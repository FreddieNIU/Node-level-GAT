If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on a cheap retirement and places to retire on $1,000 a month, go to the 5 Cheapest and Safest Countries to Retire in.Retiring CheapIn a significant development, the US Dollar achieved a one-on-one equivalence with the Euro for the first time since 2002. This milestone was primarily driven by a rise in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, making investments held in dollars particularly attractive. Simultaneously, speculations about the state of the European economy, coupled with war in Ukraine, its exposure to European nations, and the energy crisis have all been successful in raising concerns amongst investors.According to Bank of America Corporation (NYC:BAC) experts, sticky price pressures are making it harder for central banks to commit to their target inflation rates. In turn, it’s going to impact how much money is worth in different countries, strengthening the dollar even further. In lieu of this, Bank of America Corporation (NYC:BAC) recently screened S&amp;P companies to assess their correlation with the strength of the dollar. Results state that the rising US dollar is forecasted to cut the earnings of S&amp;P 500 companies by a combined $100 billion this year. However, it isn’t all bad news, least of all for retirees.For those looking to stretch their retirement savings further, relocating abroad seems like the best option. This is because the strong dollar is helping retirees stretch their dollar incomes further outside the United States. Slovakia, Dominican Republic, and Thailand are some of the cheapest countries for retirement retirees have been considering. Statistics agree, with Social Security Administration noting that the number of Americans drawing their benefits from overseas have significantly risen over the years. The last three years have witnessed this number growing from 413,000 to 760,000. Some popular overseas retirement destinations Americans are drawing their security checks from include Australia, France, Portugal, the UK, Japan, and Canada.Story continuesEurope is particularly attractive to American expats, with Netherlands, Portugal, Switzerland, and Spain emerging as the best countries to live in Europe. While the continent may be beautiful and diverse, it can be expensive for retirees to comfortably live on their social security checks. For this reason, many American expats go for cheaper options. Some of the cheapest places to retire in Europe include Albania. Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and North Macedonia.Places to Retire for $1,000 a monthFor retirees who want to stretch their retirement savings even further, they can consider many other options. Our article on the cheapest places to retire on social security can help explore some of these places, such as Granada in Spain, Zagreb in Croatia, and Alicante in Spain. Yet many other places can help retirees live comfortably under $1,000 too.Some of the places to retire for $1,000 a month include Ipoh, Malaysia; and Tanjung Bungah in Malaysia. Yet other places exist where individuals can retire for $800 a month, such as Koh Samui in Thailand, Murska Sobota in Slovenia, Chiang Mai in Thailand, and Timisoara in Romania.Due to the risks of social security depletion by 2033, rising inflation, and other financial concerns, retirees are already assessing the options that can prepare them for their golden years. If you are 50 and have no retirement savings, some best practices to employ include acting now, starting to save in retirement accounts, and considering bonds over stocks. Catch-up contributions are another way individuals 50 and above can save for their retirement years.Moreover, companies such as Bank of America Corporation (NYC:BAC) and The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) can help potential retirees save up for their golden years.

Some 1,000 workers with U.S. 401(k) plans participated in the survey, which was conducted between April 19 and May 2, 2023.Nearly eight in 10, or 78%, of survey respondents said those conditions are affecting their spending and saving habits, and 36% of them plan to delay retirement as a result.“Despite these challenges, retirement saving continues to be a priority for workers, who have maintained their 401(k) savings rates and largely stayed on top of their 401(k) investments over the past year,” said Brian Bender, head of Schwab Workplace Financial Services.Covering some retirement incomeMarci Stewart, director of Communication Consulting and Participation Education at Schwab, said it is not surprising that such a high priority is being placed on these investments as workers count on them to cover 40% of their retirement income. This is double what they expect from Social Security, the next-closest source, Stewart added.Compared to last year, more workers are also saving for retirement in a savings accounts (68% vs 61%), investing in an IRA (47% vs 33%) and investing through a brokerage account (38% vs 29%) as they look to augment their primary retirement fund with other methods of saving and investing, the study shows.To have a comfortable retirement, workers now believe they’ll need an average of $1.8 million in savings, compared to $1.7 million last year, the survey shows. Only 37% of workers think it is likely that they will achieve the target, compared with 47% in the prior year.Meanwhile, when it comes to retirement savings, there is also a large gender gap, as Kiplinger recently reported. The average 401(k) account balance for men is $89,000, while only $59,000 for women, according to the report.The Problem With 401(k) Catch-Up Contributions for 2024Should You Roll Over Your Retirement Plan When You Retire?How Does Your Magic Number for Retirement Compare to Others’?]"

Investors, however, were not happy with company shedding one million active users from the quarter before. Mizuho Americas Senior Financial Technology Analyst Dan Dolev tells Yahoo Finance Live, however, that the decline ""was very well telegraphed."" Dolev says he is ""excited"" by the company, citing its revenue numbers and its IRA business as just a couple of reasons why. ""I'm actually seeing results being very, very strong and, to me, that's more important than a data point on users,"" Dolev says of Robinhood's second quarter results.Dolev says ""the sky's the limit"" for Robinhood's retirement business. As Dolev explains, a lot of Robinhood users are young and may not have great retirement savings options. ""Over time, as they grow together with Robinhood, and they do more and more, this could be the next Charles Schwab or the next TD Ameritrade. I think that's the opportunity.""Click here to see Akiko Fujita and Seana Smith's full interview with Dan Dolev.Video Transcript- On the one hand, you've got a company that is sort of seeing the trading activity coming down. They've been trying to diversify with new product offerings. At the end of the day, it is about their active users and we saw that number down a million.When you look at the new product lines, is that enough to bring some of these users back? How do they make this platform sticky?DAN DOLEV: Yeah, I'm super excited about Robinhood. I mean, I understand why the stock is down, and hopefully you can hear me well. There's people screaming for the last two seconds here in the background. But the-- I'm really excited about Robinhood. I think the whole decline in users was very well telegraphed. Right? If you think about it, they give you like monthly trading updates and you saw those. So I don't think this is new news.The bottom line for me, and the reason I'm excited is, hey, you look at IRA, they've done like-- they got $1 billion already of IRA. Two, they beat revenues, three, they're actually growing-- they've. Become GAAP profitable. Like, I don't think there's any other company in the class of 2021 IPOs that is actually GAAP profitable. And three, the revenues are doing really well and the [? RPU ?] is basically back to-- I mean, it's not back to 2021 level, but it's the highest it's ever been.Story continuesSo I'm looking at outside that headline, I'm actually seeing results being very, very strong. And to me, that's more important than just a data point on users that really is void of any context without something else.- Let's talk about the retirement offering you just mentioned. That is one of the big product offerings that points to the maturity of the company, or the company looking to mature beyond what has been traditionally been seen as day trade, the retail traders. We've known Robinhood traditionally as sort of the place for meme stocks, but where is that opportunity on the retirement front? You know, how much upside do you see when you consider the customers are going after?DAN DOLEV: I mean, look, the sky is the limit. If you think about those like 10, 11, 12 million miles and growing, I actually think over time, they're continuing to grow, they will continue to grow, and they're going internationally. Those people today are young. They don't have like a real retirement solution.I think over time, as they grow together with Robinhood, and they do more and more, this could be like the next, Charles Schwab, or the next TD Ameritrade. I think that's the opportunity. I can't quantify it in a number. We really haven't done sort of that bottom up work but think about it. Everyone has a 401(k). They're going somewhere when they get jobs at some point when they grow-- when they grow up. They stay with Robinhood, and they do it with Robinhood. I mean this could be the next Charles Schwab. That's why I don't understand why people are worried about one data point. The stock should be up today, not down.]"

In contrast to other proposals that consider a ""ferrous scrap usage sliding scale,"" The Steel Climate Standard is ambitious, auditable, inclusive, and transparent.Greg Murphy, Executive Vice President of Business Services and General Counsel at Nucor Corporation and Chair of the GSCC, emphasized, ""Creating a dual standard would allow high-carbon emissions steel to be prioritized over lower-carbon steel. This would serve to discourage innovation and allow high-carbon steelmakers to postpone making changes in their production process.""The Steel Climate Standard, built on three key objectives, aims to:Provide a single, technology-agnostic framework for steel product certification and company science-based emissions target-setting that applies equally to all steel producers globally.Enable steel customers to make informed choices by knowing the carbon emissions associated with the steel products they purchase.Align with the Paris Climate Agreement's emissions reduction goals by 2050.""I'm proud that this standard was designed through a collaboration of steel companies and associations from around the world. It will guide all steel manufacturers worldwide toward decarbonization. It can also guide governments, steel customers and other stakeholders to encourage policies and practices that support this pivotal path to net zero,"" said Leon Topalian, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer of Nucor.Story continuesAs a leading participant in GSCC, Nucor is one of the cleanest steelmakers in the world. The company adopts circular steelmaking through electric arc furnaces (EAF) and recycling scrap metal. Nucor's innovative approach results in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) intensity less than half of the global average and only one-third of the average extractive blast furnace steel producer. Last year, the company achieved its lowest Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG intensity in its history.To review the standard please visit https://globalsteelclimatecouncil.org.About NucorNucor and its affiliates are manufacturers of steel and steel products, with operating facilities in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the biotech industry, head directly to 5 Best Biotech ETFs To Buy. According to Precedence Research, the worldwide biotechnology market was valued at approximately $1,224.31 billion in 2022. It is projected to reach a value of around $3,210.71 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.8% from 2023 to 2030. The biotechnology industry in countries like China, Japan, and India is witnessing growth propelled by positive government policies. These initiatives target the improvement of medical regulation, standardization of clinical studies, enhancement of reimbursement policies, and acceleration of product approval processes, all of which are expected to create profitable growth prospects for the biotechnology sectorDon't Miss: 12 Best Agriculture ETFs To BuyTo name a few hindrances plaguing the biotech industry, EY in a report observed that the 2022 revenue of public biotech companies declined by 1% compared to 2021 due to decreased demand for COVID-19 vaccines and antiviral treatments. 2023 is anticipated to see five patent expirations for well-established biologic products, resulting in a significant loss of revenue. Furthermore, over 20 products, accounting for nearly $200 billion in annual sales, are expected to lose patent protection by 2030. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) experienced a decline in approvals for new molecular entities and biologics license applications in 2022, which was attributed to staffing shortages. However, approvals returned to pre-pandemic levels in Q1 of 2023. Lastly, in 2022, all forms of biotech financing, including venture capital investment, debt financing, IPOs, and follow-on offerings, decreased substantially. According to Ashwin Singhania, Principal at EY-Parthenon: “Innovation is the engine that drives the biotech industry. While the approaching patent cliff is an unavoidable challenge, the pipeline continues to be very robust and the pace of innovation continues to accelerate. If executives can prioritize streamlining processes and the ongoing investment in organic innovation and inorganic growth, they will set themselves up for future success.”Story continuesAlso Read: 12 Best Energy ETFs: Top Oil, Gas and Renewable Energy FundsOn a positive note, RBC Capital Markets predicts that large-cap biotech companies with revenue resilience, less binary risk, and optimistic earnings guidance will maintain momentum in early 2023. While some larger companies have set themselves up for future growth and diversification, 2023 may be a flat earnings year for many large caps due to patent expirations and COVID-19 revenue declines. On the other hand, smaller-cap biotechs, though recovering from mid-year lows, have underperformed compared to larger and mid-cap biotechs and pharma. However, some high-quality, catalyst-driven smaller-cap companies are forecasted to perform well in 2023, driven by increasing regulatory permissiveness and potential M&amp;A activity. M&amp;A activity is also expected to rise as large biopharma companies sit on strong balance sheets, face patent cliffs, and experience better policy clarity. This potential uptick in M&amp;A could act as a catalyst for biotech stocks, driving growth and diversification among larger-cap companies facing challenges.Some of the best biotech stocks to invest in include Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV).

The company recently announced that its next generation Cologuard test demonstrated improved sensitivity and specificity for colorectal cancer compared with the first-generation Cologuard test. Once approved and commercialized, the second-generation Cologuard test should result in lower false positives, which should benefit Exact by boosting its gross margins.

Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors were dominated by  Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”9.

Thermo Fisher provides analytical instruments, laboratory equipment, software, services, consumables, and reagents for life sciences research, manufacturing, analysis, discovery, and diagnostics. Shares fell along with other life sciences tools stocks because of multiple headwinds, including a slowdown in capital spending among pharmaceutical customers, slowed growth in China, lack of funding and spending among pre-commercial biotechnology companies, and inventory destocking among bioprocessing customers. We view these headwinds as temporary and believe management can achieve its long-term goal of solid mid- to high single-digit organic revenue growth driven by long-term end-market dynamics in the life sciences industry, including favorable demographics, scientific advances, new technology, and increased regulations.”7.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the healthcare industry and go directly to the 5 European Countries with Best Healthcare for Expats.Who are Expats?According to the World Bank's 2023 World Development Report, about 184 million people, 2.3% of the world population, live outside their countries of origin, including 37 million refugees. ‘Expats’ and ‘immigrants’ are often used interchangeably but have distinct meanings and connotations. The Cambridge Dictionary defines an expat as ""someone who does not live in their own country."" According to a BBC interview with Malte Zeeck, founder and co-CEO of InterNations, the motivation behind the decision of moving abroad is what distinguishes an expat from other people moving abroad like immigrants. Since expats have more of a choice they can decide to move to countries that can serve them best, whether it's in terms of employment opportunities, education, or healthcare among other factors.Expats usually do not reside in the destination country long term; for them moving is a choice rather than a necessity. Their main motivation is to add ease, comfort, and value to their lives. When the skills of the person relocating match the skills required at the destination country, it facilitates both the labor supply and demand. According to Expat Insider Report 2023, the top expat-origin nationalities include American, British, Indian, German, and Italian.People move to a new country for better career opportunities and an improved lifestyle. Good health is fundamental to living a peaceful and happy life. Thus, a good healthcare system becomes a primary consideration when deciding which country to move to, especially when retiring overseas. Healthcare Industry at a GlanceThe pandemic has affected almost all industries; however, the healthcare industry experienced unabated growth throughout the pandemic. McKinsey &amp; Company has estimated healthcare industry EBITDA to have a 6% growth rate between 2021 and 2025. This growth rate would add $31 billion in profits to the healthcare industry by 2025. In the USA alone, according to estimates, healthcare profits will increase from $654 billion in 2021 to $790 billion in 2026 at a compound annual growth rate of 4%. Healthcare is experiencing persistent growth across different parts of the industry. The possible challenges to these rates are growing inflation and macroeconomic headwinds.Story continuesThe pandemic has impacted some of the existing trends in the healthcare industry. Care delivery was primarily confined to hospitals and traditional healthcare sub-sectors. However, non-acute sites and post-acute sites are gaining popularity post-pandemic. This shift has considerably impacted hospitals' share of overall provider revenue, which is estimated to decline from 47% in 2019 to 44% in 2025. The main contributing factors causing the shift towards non-acute settings include the advancement of value-based healthcare, related risk payments, and digitization.Some of the largest healthcare companies in the world are UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR). UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) operates through four segments: UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight, and Optum Rx. On July 14, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported a revenue of $92.9 billion and beat Wall Street estimates by $1.94 billion. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported earnings per share of $6.14 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.16. Here are some comments from the company's Q2 2023 earnings call: ""UnitedHealthcare's growth was strong and diversified as well. Today, we're serving nearly 1.6 million more people in our commercial and public sector program offerings than last year. This durable growth, driven by our colleagues' relentless focus on quality and execution, enabled us to achieve second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.14 and to strengthen our full-year outlook to between $24.70 to $25 per share. We know there is great interest in understanding the recent care activity I just mentioned. So I'll give you an overview of how we're seeing care plans progress and how we're responding. I do want to underscore the most critical point first: making high-quality care more affordable and accessible is at the core of our mission. Having more people obtain the care they need is a positive trend for individuals and our health system and society. As we discussed several weeks ago, during the second quarter, we observed increased care patents, notably in outpatient surgeries for seniors and especially with certain orthopedic procedures, which may have been postponed. ""Tech and HealthcareThe healthcare industry is one of the most innovative industries in the world. It largely invests in R&amp;D, pharmaceuticals, and technological advancements. When the pandemic hit, it further came to the forefront. The managing partner at Harris Financial Group, Jamie Cox, in a CNBC interview on July 21, noted the intersection of tech and healthcare. He commented: ""It's all about healthcare, Dom. I mean, you know, tech and healthcare, the intersection of those two sectors cannot be ignored. There's so much innovation, so much R&amp;D that happened during the pandemic and we're just starting to see some of the pieces of it come to the marketplace. One particular area, medical devices - I mean you have people voluntarily wearing continuous glucose monitors. So companies like Insulet or Dexcom, these are companies that are absolutely knocking it out of the park. People are paying really close attention to healthcare and that is brought about by technology.""The recent accelerated digitization in healthcare has popularized virtual care, especially mental health. According to a report by Deloitte, 89% of mental health consultations are being conducted online, and global spending on mental health applications increased 32% from 2019 to 2020 and is estimated to grow by 20% annually. The use of Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) is also getting popularized. This system enables care coordination and improves diagnoses. Through proper communication, duplicate testing can also be avoided. The information using HIEs is effectively distributed across geographical regions and care settings like hospitals. Increased care and service delivery automation would help the healthcare industry's overall growth. The global healthcare sector is expected to experience a 12.1 million skilled healthcare professionals shortage by 2035—the interplay between tech and healthcare is even more significant. Advancements in tech enable the healthcare industry to meet this demand. AI4HealthCro, an innovative not-for-profit public-private consortium of AI experts for healthcare, integrates AI into healthcare technologies. This venture would free up 1,944 man-hours annually, save approximately 403,000 lives and reduce healthcare costs by EUR 212.4 billion.Moving to a new country can be a daunting experience because of the anxieties accompanied by uncertainties. However, you can make the right decision with proper planning and research.

Picture credit: Oak Ridge National Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy.Originally published on U.S. Bank company blogThe amount of animal waste produced in the U.S. every year is more than 1,000 times the weight of the Empire State Building, and the greenhouse gases from that waste can significantly impact the planet. But what if there was a way to treat the wastewater to help reduce carbon emissions? That's what Bianca Bailey, Ph.D., the founder and CEO of Agriwater, aims to accomplish.Agriwater, which Bailey started in 2021 while finishing her doctorate in agricultural engineering at the University of Illinois, is developing electrolysis-based technology to treat wastewater, which often is stored in hazardous lagoons that can pollute nearby natural water sources and create strong fumes throughout nearby towns and farming communities.""It becomes a social justice issue when it relates to people who live around these areas who can't have clean air,"" said Bailey, who also points out that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also can fine farmers who don't manage animal waste properly.Instead, her innovative technology removes contaminants from wastewater, decreasing the likelihood of pollution in rural areas, reducing greenhouse gases and even creating clean water for reuse and recycling.The promise of such technology has led Bailey to participate in various business accelerator programs. In 2022, Agriwater secured a spot in the Innovations Crossroads Program sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy's Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Program (LEEP). This two-year program will allow Agriwater to work toward commercializing its technology in collaboration with lab space and mentorship from Oak Ridge Laboratory in Tennessee.""We've proven out the technology on a small scale, and now we're looking to scale the technology from inside the lab to on-site at a farm,"" Bailey said.Bailey is the winner of the 2023 U.S. Bank Foundation Cleantech Inclusion Award, which supports female and minority entrepreneurs who are building innovative companies that benefit the environment, create jobs and drive economic development. The U.S. Bank Foundation works with Evergreen Climate Innovations to present the award, which includes a $25,000 grant and a year of mentorship. The funding will help Agriwater facilitate its first industrial-size pilot with farms.""Entrepreneurs like Bailey, who tackle big challenges with such drive and passion, are working to build a more sustainable future for all of us,"" said Reba Dominski, chief social responsibility officer at U.S. Bank and president of the U.S. Bank Foundation. ""We are proud to support Agriwater as it continues to refine its technology and expand the scale of its business."" ""We're excited to continue our work with U.S. Bank Foundation to support early-stage startups working on solutions for environmental and social impact,"" said Erik Birkerts, chief executive officer at Evergreen Climate Innovations. ""We look forward to working with Agriwater and supporting their vision of creating a closed-loop water system for livestock farmers that yields an array of environmental, social and economic benefits.""Agriwater is Bailey's first commercial venture, but her interest in water treatment began years ago as an undergraduate studying chemical engineering at Howard University. As part of her work leading the campus Engineers Without Borders chapter, she facilitated a student-led water-filtration project in a small village in Kenya. This work, along with her involvement in the nonprofit Girls Inc. as a student and mentor, led to recognition from the White House Champions of Change program in 2011 for helping to recruit and retain girls and women in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). Her goal is to create a more sustainable environment for the children of the future as they will be, in her words, ""stewards of the Earth.""Now, as an engineer and business owner, Bailey welcomes the guidance she'll receive through the Cleantech Inclusion Award program and encourages others building businesses in similar fields to broaden their knowledge beyond science and technology.""Being a smart entrepreneur when it comes to technology is also knowing that you can't just focus on the technology, but you also need to focus on the intellectual property and business implementation of the technology,"" said Bailey. ""You can have great technology, but if the business model and everything else doesn't work out, then it's simply just a good idea.""This is the fourth year of the U.S. Bank Foundation Cleantech Inclusion Award. Information on how to apply for the 2024 award will be available later this year.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/us-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.com SOURCE: U.S. BankStory continuesACCESSWIRE | Article LogoView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/772082/engineer-wins-us-bank-foundation-cleantech-award-for-clean-water-technology]"

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today, Mr. Martin Jarosick, with CF Investor Relations. Sir, please proceed.Martin A. JarosickGood morning, and thanks for joining the CF Industries earnings conference call. With me today are Tony Will, CEO; Chris Bohn, CFO; and Bert Frost, Executive Vice President of Sales, Market Development and Supply Chain. CF Industries reported its results for the first half and second quarter of 2023 yesterday afternoon. On this call, we'll review the results, discuss our outlook, and then host a question-and-answer session.Statements made on this call and in the presentation on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements. More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. Also, you'll find the reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in the press release and presentation posted on our website.Now let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.Story continuesW. Anthony WillThanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday afternoon, we posted results for the first half of 2023, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of over $1.7 billion. Our trailing 12-month net cash from operations was $3.2 billion and free cash flow was $2.1 billion. These results reflect outstanding execution by the CF Industries team against the backdrop of robust demand. Our plans ran extremely well and we leveraged our unique system flexibility to maximize results, given the high volume of just-in-time purchasing that took place.We sold more product than we produced and ended the first half with low inventories. As you will hear from Bert in a moment, we believe we are really well positioned for the remainder of 2023 and into 2024. While our safety performance remained good by most measures and comparisons, it is not where we expect it to be. Our 12-month rolling recordable injury rate at the end of June was 0.54 incidents per 200,000 labor hours. Ashraf and his team are focused on this, not to manage the number, but to ensure that all of our people go home in the same condition as when they came to work every day. Looking forward, changes in the energy markets have steepened the global nitrogen cost curve and extended the margin advantage available to our North American manufacturing network. As you can see on Slide 7, we enjoy a $300 to $400 per ton margin advantage versus European and high-cost Asian production. Given the structural advantage as well as our industry best operating rates and unique network flexibilities, we expect to drive strong cash generation in the years ahead. This will enable us to make disciplined investments in growth opportunities, while also returning substantial capital to shareholders.In that vein, we remain focused on our clean energy growth platform, which has been well served by the collaborations and partnerships we have developed. We expect to make a final investment decision on a newbuild clean ammonia plant later this year in conjunction with our partners in that project. This approach significantly reduces risk to CF and ensures that the new production volume is consumed in new sources of emerging demand rather than creating an overhang in the market.We also continue to return significant capital to shareholders. Over the last 12 months, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which was more than 60% of our free cash flow. Looking ahead, as we continue to execute on our current $3 billion share repurchase authorization, we are committed to taking advantage of dips in our share price opportunistically, amplifying the rewards to our long-term shareholders.With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss global nitrogen market conditions in more detail. Bert?Bert A. FrostThanks, Tony. CF Industries experienced a very positive spring application season, that we believe points to a strong global demand dynamic in the second half of the year. Our challenge in the spring was managing through peak application season, with customers deferring purchases until the last possible moment. Despite delayed purchases, demand in North America during the spring was substantial, with planted corn and wheat acres up significantly compared to 2022. Even with this high demand, net imports were lower than the prior year. As a result, we believe that inventory in the North American supply chain is extremely low compared to historical norms and will need to be replenished. At the same time, India and Brazil will need to compete for urea tons in the coming months as they prepare for their upcoming planting season.As you can see on Slide 6, we project that Brazil still needs to secure 5 million to 6 million more tons of urea and India, another 4 million to 5 million tons of urea, by the end of the year. Farm economics continue to be robust and supportive of strong demand. Consensus estimates project that global grain stocks will improve slightly in 2023, but drought in the United States and ongoing impacts from the war in Ukraine are keeping grain prices attractive for farmers.The global nitrogen market has responded to these dynamics with rapidly rising urea spot prices through July with other products following. We saw a strong demand for urea. And in July, we built an order book of domestic and export sales that takes us into the fourth quarter. We also quickly achieved our goals for our initial UAN fill offer in North America and have been able to raise prices for subsequent layers. Against this backdrop of strong demand, the global supply response is somewhat muted. We do expect China to participate in the upcoming India urea tenders, with strong prices for nitrogen in China indicate that domestic demand is competing for the volume available for shipment. Russian tons continue to reach the global market, but willing buyers are limited to a few areas of the world, such as Brazil and the United States. Additionally, European ammonia production volumes remain well below normal due to natural gas prices that make the region uncompetitive globally.As we look at our own operations, our network continues to benefit from low-cost natural gas. Forward curves suggest natural gas values in North America will be $2 to $4 per MMBtu lower than last year in the second half, keeping our production costs firmly in the first quartile globally.With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.Christopher D. BohnThanks, Bert. For the first half of 2023, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of approximately $1.1 billion, or $5.55 per diluted share. EBITDA was $1.8 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was over $1.7 billion. At the end of June, cash on the balance sheet was $3.2 billion. Since that time, we paid CHS semi-annual distribution of $204 million from our CF Nitrogen partnership. Additionally, $1.25 billion of cash is earmarked for our acquisition of the Waggaman ammonia facility, for which the regulatory process continues. We expect to close the transaction before year-end. As a result, our pro forma available cash at the end of June was approximately $1.75 billion.Looking ahead, we expect the rest of 2023 and into 2024 to be favorable based on the global nitrogen industry dynamics that Bert just described. The second half typically starts with lower production due to maintenance activity as well as seasonally low prices that should rise as we move towards spring. We expect company-wide gross ammonia production to be between 9 million and 9.5 million tons. As you know, we recently proposed to permanently close the ammonia plant at our Billingham complex in the U.K., due primarily to the structural disadvantage that European ammonia production faces from high energy and carbon costs. We have been importing ammonia since the fall of 2022 to produce UAN fertilizer and nitric acid at the site, which we expect to continue to have a positive impact on gross margin compared to producing ammonia at Billingham.Our capital expenditure requirements for the remainder of the year remain modest, with capital expenditures expected to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million. This includes our blue and green projects at the Donaldsonville complex, which continue to progress. We continue to advance the front-end engineering design study for the proposed joint venture low-carbon ammonia facility with Mitsui. We expect to make a final investment decision later this year. Alongside our clean energy initiatives, we remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders, given our free cash flow generation outlook.In the second quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares, at an average price of approximately $64 per share, compared to an average share price in the quarter of almost $70 and to a share price that has recently been trading above $80 per share. We expect to continue to favor opportunistic purchases layered in at attractive levels. With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&amp;A.W. Anthony WillThanks, Chris. Before we move on to your questions, I want to thank everyone at CF Industries for all that they did during the first half of 2023. And our teamwork continues to deliver outstanding results. We remain very excited about the future for CF Industries. We have a large structural cost advantage that provides substantial margin opportunities, coupled with industry-leading operating expertise and unmatched network flexibility. This should continue to drive significant free cash flow. We will deploy that cash to both grow our business and return capital to shareholders. We have significant decarbonization projects in flight with industry leaders, such as ExxonMobil. The Waggaman ammonia complex will fit seamlessly into our network and enhance our ability to serve customers, and we are positioned at the forefront of low-carbon ammonia into new clean energy applications, supported by collaborations with global leaders such as JERA, Mitsui and LOTTE. As a result, we believe CF Industries is well positioned to create substantial value for our long-term shareholders. With that, operator, we will now open the call to your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho.Christopher S. ParkinsonSo I think when most people step back, Tony, I think, on normalized EBITDA, we could have a debate on this all day, but it could be low, mid-2s, somewhere in there in terms of billions of EBITDA. But you do have, I'd say, at least three, perhaps four moving variables, which are pertinent for the next 2 to 3 years in terms of what you'd add to that. I'd say Waggaman plus, obviously, carbon optionality, you have the additional 45 queues for various projects you're working on.And then on top of that, you have a nice energy transition theme, which perhaps is a little bit later outside that time frame. But it does seem like these three buckets, which could materially add to the perception of normalized EBITDA. And I was just hoping perhaps if you could add color on those three buckets and perhaps add anything else you think is important and how the investment community should be thinking about those?W. Anthony WillYes, Chris, thanks for the question. I'd say those three are certainly important and near term. I might add one or two others. But as Chris mentioned -- Bohn mentioned in his prepared comments, we expect to be able to close the Waggaman transaction here later this year, and that should certainly be additive to our otherwise normalized EBITDA numbers, as you said, whatever people project that to be. In addition to that, we're going to be starting up the CO2 sequestration project at Donaldsonville, the beginning part or early in 2025, and be able to take advantage of the 45Q tax credit that goes along with that. That is a substantial amount of money, given that the 45Q is $85 a ton -- a metric ton, and we're going to be sequestering 2 million metric tons a year.So the margin associated with just that one project is substantial and moves the needle relative to our performance on an annual basis. And then that's going to run for 12 years.In addition to the D'ville project, as you mentioned, we've got some ongoing opportunities at some of our other facilities, and we hope to be able to announce a couple of those in the coming quarters. So we're excited about the opportunities that we have on the decarbonization and the 45Q side. You did mention clean ammonia into clean energy applications. We think that that's going to start taking off in reasonable volumes in '25 and '26 and then going from there. Fortunately, we will have the D'ville project up and running by then and be able to begin meeting that requirement from there. And as mentioned, we'll evaluate the new build project, but that's a little longer wavelength, I think, than the time frame that you're talking about. But the two other things that I'd add, really, Chris, is the first one is there is broad-based efforts right now that's driving industrial companies to onshore into the U.S. manufacturing operations. And we've had advanced conversations with a number of them around ratable offtake of some of our products, both on an ammonia as well as on an upgraded basis.And that should provide attractive returns for new capital that we'd be able to deploy against those kind of opportunities, and that would be additive to our business as well as just taking more ammonia and moving it into higher-margin pieces of business on a ratable basis.And the last thing I'd add, I'd just go back to our $3 billion authorization and the amount of free cash flow that we're generating, we expect to dramatically reduce the number of shares outstanding over this time frame. So whatever you thought previously in terms of a mid-cycle kind of number that's going to increase, based on the other initiatives that we talked about, on a per share basis, that's going to be amplified as we move forward as well because of the amount of share reduction we expect to be able to accomplish.Christopher S. ParkinsonThat's very helpful. And just as a quick follow-up, there's just been a lot of, let's say, variable change in terms of regional operating rates between anywhere from -- Europe seems to be plateauing a little bit after increasing earlier this year. India has been rumored to be up, but kind of has been disappointing a little bit versus the otherwise expectations. In North Africa, down. Southeast Asia, down, now potentially up.Just in terms of just how you're thinking about your own order books, in terms of just risk management not wanting to miss a potential for the rallying essentially what we've seen over the last 6 to 8 weeks, can you just -- do you disagree with any of those? And just could you help us think about how that thought process is playing into how you're managing your book, not only to the fall application season, but also into 2024, just given all the change over the last 12 to 24 months?W. Anthony WillI'm going to give just a real brief high-level comment, and then I'm going to turn it over to Bert to kind of go into a little more detail. And the high-level comment, Chris, is we saw kind of an unusual experience over the last 2 years. 2022, based on energy differentials and where shutdowns were taking place, and of course, war in Ukraine, created a scarcity of nitrogen products in particular, and then that led to high cost or high prices globally, which reduced demand and consumption. This year, we saw a moderating of pricing, which, I would say, reinvigorated some of the application rates and demand, particularly in parts of the world that are more subsistence-based. But we saw a move toward just-in-time purchasing, which really stresses the network. And I think Bert did a great job of managing kind of that stress, but it adds a lot of complexity in terms of movements.And so there's always a balance between trying to build an appropriate book and making sure we're able to run the plants safely and efficiently and keep them online and be able to ship against that book, but not wanting to miss opportunities when you see some strengthening in the market. And again, I think Bert does a great job on doing that. But it's always a little bit of a tightrope act.Bert A. FrostYes. Thanks, Tony. In terms of -- you touched on -- let's talk about supply for a minute. And you touched on some of those areas where supply is constrained. It probably wasn't considered to be a few months ago. India production has been growing in terms of capacity growth on these new and revamped operating units. And so we would project that their internal production is probably close to 29 million tons, and that then the demand for imports on an annualized basis will be between, let's say, 6 million and 8 million tons rather than the 10 million tons we saw a few years ago.And they're behind. And so this dynamic that we saw in the United States of customers waiting and waiting and depleting their inventories has -- that situation has been multiplied globally, where many destination markets did the exact same thing, and now they all need to step in and acquire those tons, that being South America, Asia, as well as North America and Europe.So now you have this dynamic that has taken place where we've had a falling market, let's say, really since February. And in June -- the end of June and early July, we started to see this recovery, and it's been more pronounced than I think the industry had anticipated. And that's also predicated on the lack of supply, like you mentioned, with lack of gas in Nigeria and Egypt, and as well as Trinidad, Europe, the European Union gas prices, Pakistan, Brazil, many places that have produced tons in the past are not producing today.And so when we look at our order book, Tony is right, we have to go into the forward market with an order book that's shippable. We have to rely on our rail partners, truck partners and moving product by vessel and barge and pipe to keep our system balanced.And so I'm pleased with our order book for what we have for Q3. And as I said in my prepared remarks, some of those products extended to Q4, and we've been able to move product pricing up along the way. So I think you'll see we're going to perform well as we always do.OperatorThe next question is from Andrew Wong with RBC.Andrew D. WongSo CF made the decision to permanently closed Billingham for economic purposes, which I think makes a lot of sense. We've seen maybe one or two of these announcements in Europe, but maybe not as much as some might expect, given the economics for nitrogen today in Europe and potentially looking forward. So what do you think is keeping some of these plants operating? And do you expect more permanent shutdowns in Europe going forward?W. Anthony WillYes, Andrew. I think we have an interesting situation of Billingham, and that we're able to import ammonia and then still upgrade it to nitric acid and ammonium nitrate. And there is a pretty substantial upgrade margin that's available between at least over the last couple of years, the deepwater price of ammonia and what the upgraded products are selling for as fertilizer and intermediate chemicals.And so for us, the option was pretty apparent. As Chris mentioned, it is margin enhancing for us not to incur kind of the relatively high and volatile gas costs as well as the relatively high carbon costs associated with operating in that region, but still be able to get the upgrade margin by bringing in ammonia.I think some plants in Europe don't have access to be able to bring ammonia into their facilities and/or they may be making urea-based products that require the CO2 in order to be able to upgrade them as opposed to the nitrate-based products. So I think for some producers -- if you look at the gas cost versus the margin available for ultimately, upgraded product, you can probably still see some level of operation during times of the year. And I think that's probably why you see this variability in operating rates for those that are able to import ammonia. And I think there are several plants out there that have done that. They've turned off ammonia production in the near term. We've just made a decision based on the age of the equipment, the amount of CapEx required to keep it running in the ongoing carbon cost that it made sense for us to be focused purely as -- in the import ammonia and upgrade facility there.Andrew D. WongThat's great. And maybe just kind of following up on that. There's a few plants that are in the planning stages for the U.S. Gulf on blue ammonia and there has been some concern that there might be too much ammonia that gets brought online over that 3- to 5-year time frame. But there are some plans to import ammonia coming from different places into Europe, and one of your peers have mentioned something like that as well. So do you look at that be a way to balance some of these new ammonia projects that we're seeing coming online potentially over the next few years?W. Anthony WillYes. I mean I think just like happened in 2012, that there's very likely a slew of announcements about projects. And I think back in 2012, there was something like 26 projects that were announced, of which only four got built. And I think you probably saw some of that exuberance last year and into this year as well, where you're seeing a lot of announcements. And then when people really put pen and paper and need to go out and begin construction, there's a little more cautiousness that goes into it. It's easy to announce something. It's a lot harder to build it. And I think one of the interesting things about our potential new build project is that we're partnering with ultimately, folks that are going to be end users of the project from a volume standpoint and putting it into new clean energy applications. And so it's production that's not going to create the kind of overhang situation that you were just talking about. Now that's very important for us. The other piece of that is we're still collecting data on the cost side of the equation, and it's got to make economic sense for us and earn a fair rate of return for us to move forward with it. But I think that between some of the shutdowns you're seeing in high-cost places in the world, and some new demand centers that are springing up, particularly for clean energy applications, I'm pretty optimistic that we'll end up with a balanced to tight ammonia market going forward to the balance of this decade.OperatorThe next question is from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets.Joel JacksonIt seems you did a very good realized gas cost this quarter -- in Q2, excuse me. There were concerns that some of the inventory overhang higher-cost gas when your winter hedges may have pushed the realized cost close to around $4. Can you talk about what happened positively to not have such a high gas realization?Christopher D. BohnYes, Joel, thanks. This is Chris. There's really two items that occurred that allowed us to have lower gas than what we were projecting when we talked about some of that overhang from production in Q1 being sold into Q2. The first being, as Tony and Bert mentioned, we sold more product than we produced. So we went into inventory deeper than what we had anticipated doing during the particular quarter. So we bled through that overhang more quickly.And then additionally, instead of doing first of month purchases, Bert's team that was purchasing natural gas did more of the daily buying, and the daily numbers were quite a bit lower than what the first of month would have been. So I think those higher prices that we saw in, call it, March and April, have bled through. And as you look at the strip right now, it's relatively flat kind of in the $2.50 to $2.75 range. And that's what we'll expect going forward. But you're right, we were expecting slightly higher natural gas costs, but sort of those two points mitigated that a bit.OperatorThe next question is from Josh Spector with UBS.Joshua David SpectorI wanted to ask on just project returns broadly. So -- I mean as you're investing more in clean ammonia and various other applications, how do you think about the rate of returns on those projects that are required versus your historical investments?I'm just thinking if you're looking at these differently, particularly if they have offtake in stability to use a lower return versus some of the historical maybe FERC market focus, which could have more cyclicality, but also periods of much higher earnings, if that requires a different return level. So is there any way to think about how you and the Board are kind of working through those decisions would be helpful?W. Anthony WillYes. I mean I'm certainly happy to give my perspective on this, and I encourage Chris to also jump in to the extent I step out of bounds on it. But we typically target, at a minimum, a low teens kind of return, and that's been fairly consistent with how we've thought about things in the past. That tends to be well above our cost of capital, but it also takes into consideration some things like -- particularly if you're talking about construction-based projects, potential contingency on overruns and a few other things. I think the benefit of years like last year is that it meant that any of the projects we had done historically ended up looking like they were absolutely fantastic from the standpoint of capital deployed versus returns that we've been looking at.And I do think that as we talk about bringing partners in that are both adding equity into the equation in a proportionate way, but then also taking guaranteed offtake of it and moving it into nontraditional applications that derisks the project substantially. I don't think it fundamentally changes the return profile that we expect for the capital that we put into the project.Christopher D. BohnNo, I would agree with what Tony said there. That as we look at these projects, we do look at them all as risk-adjusted returns. And given what Tony said, with a ratable offtake, that has -- allows us to have better working capital from receivables to inventory to all of that.Obviously, that enhances the return profile and puts it in line even if it is slightly lower to begin with, commensurate with what our other projects are sort of in the mid-teens.OperatorThe next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.Stephen V. ByrneYes. Do you expect ammonia pricing to remain well below the unit nitrogen pricing for urea, just because of less industrial demand? And if so, do you think that, that combined with what could be a relatively early harvest, might lead to a very strong ammonia application season this fall? And if so, are you planning accordingly to -- have a strong fall through your network of storage tanks in the (inaudible)?W. Anthony WillSo Steve, almost every point in time, barring maybe a blip here or there, ammonia tends to trade at a pretty substantial discount on a margin per unit of nitrogen basis to the upgraded products. And that's just because it requires more capital to build the upgrades than it does the ammonia. And really direct application ammonia is almost limited exclusively to North America. So because of that, you generally see a pretty big margin enhancement by upgrading ammonia into other forms. And that -- I don't think that's going to substantially change. But you're certainly right and that there has been a reduction in industrial demand for ammonia over the last year. And just given sort of energy costs in other parts of the world and what looks like is -- whether you call it a soft landing or a slow recovery or wherever we are in terms of the global economic condition, I think ammonia is going to continue to be a very attractive product from a price per unit of nitrogen.And based on where we think grain prices are going to trade if you've got conducive weather, we'd expect to see a pretty strong ammonia season. But there is a limit to how much ammonia goes down, and a lot of that is driven by what's the storage capacity of end-market tanks. And in the fall, it's pretty hard to dump them and then refill them and dump them again. You typically want to get one dump in the fall. So there is a limit to availability of ammonia for fall application.Bert A. FrostYes. Just following up on Tony's comments that I do believe, based on the pricing structure of ammonia. And based on the opportunity -- the revenue opportunity by planting corn for harvest in 2024, we're going to see a positive uptake in the ammonia demand. Now Tony's point of you basically have a month to move that product through the system, and that's weather dependent. So if we had an early snow or too much rain, then you would just carry that inventory and that demand into spring. But the fall pricing has basically been set, and then we see it going up from those levels that were initially offered, but I think demand will be robust given all the considerations and if we have good weather.Stephen V. ByrneAnd just wanted to follow up on the blue projects down in Louisiana. Is there anything that you can do to pull forward that brownfield project in Donaldsonville ahead of what you're guiding to early 2025?Anything that you could do to create shipments and start to fulfill some of this demand before there. I don't know what the rate limiting factor is, is it your engineering? Or is it your plastics, injection, well partner? Or whatever it is, is there any chance you could pull that forward and start fulfilling these -- the interests from the low case and the JERA rather than 2027.W. Anthony WillWell, certainly, we'll have blue ammonia or low-carbon ammonia available by 2025. And as that demand starts developing, we -- one of the value propositions that we offer companies like that is we'll be able to service their needs as it's developing in advance of a potential new plant start-up. And so we've got supply for them. In terms of when we're able to begin sequestering the CO2, we should have the compression and dehydration equipment on-site and commissioned and ready to go probably by the end of '24. but part of the challenge has been getting Class 6 permitting for the injection wells and getting all of that done and pipeline connections built and so forth. I think ExxonMobil has done a fantastic job of managing kind of that piece of the equation, and it's very helpful that Louisiana has been granted primacy from the EPA over their ability to permit those kind of wells. So all of those things are big steps forward.But as you know, anything around this particular area takes time and requires permitting. And I think we're all trying to push forward as fast as we can because we see the economic value of getting it completed and beginning to inject, but we're targeting right now kind of first quarter, maybe beginning the second quarter at 25% is likely when we'll begin doing that.OperatorThe next question is from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.Adam L. SamuelsonMaybe first, a little bit more on clean ammonia, but maybe on the sales side. And as you work towards FID, help us think about where the key kind of pain points are still on kind of setting the contractual terms for those kinds for that kind of product?Would you be looking to FID that with a take-or-pay kind of agreement in hand with a major off-taker -- how are you -- how are those getting structured? Or what are the parameters by which you're still negotiating? Just framing those discussions would be helpful.W. Anthony WillYes. So look, let me talk a little bit about the new project, and I'll throw it over to Bert to talk about some of the interest that we're seeing from European users and others in terms of just decarbonized products. In terms of the new build projects, what we're -- the kind of operating model we're going into is the equity participation is going to be proportionate to your offtake from that project. And so that's -- call that effectively a take or pay, if you will, on that piece of it.And then it looks like demand, if everything that we're hearing from our potential partners around the expected growth in demand and the volume that they're looking at is going to well exceed what their equity participation is, we would be looking to try to enter into a back-to-back kind of take or pay for the rest of it. So our approach is going to be very much one of trying to derisk this project and have it done back-to-back and not have it be a speculative kind of investment, but one that you can pretty much bank on the return profile.Bert A. FrostAnd we're seeing -- it's interesting how this area is developing and how we're looking at it holistically and to our point of derisking and how we manage the business. So we are in conversations with a lot of different end users and applications, but as various companies and industries look at their scope emissions and their needs to improve their profiles, low carbon products, as a feedstock or as a fertilizer, adds value.And so we're in conversations and we have requests on the table today for when these products are available, that we would supply them not only to the United States, but to our European customers as well. So we're excited about the future and how we're building this capability, both with people, process, equipment, plants and customers for -- to be ready to go.Adam L. SamuelsonAll right. That's helpful. And if I could squeeze a second one on just on share repurchase. And obviously, you did resume that this quarter with the Waggaman transaction announced. Should we be thinking about that more ratably? Opportunistically? How should we be considering share repo over the balance of the year given kind of the other uses of capital and potential uses of capital you've got on the table.Christopher D. BohnAdam, this is Chris. As Tony and Bert, and I mentioned, in our prepared remarks, we are expecting to continue to generate a lot of free cash flow here. And with that $3 billion authorization open, we're starting to move into that now. I think as we've talked about on other quarters, we're going to definitely favor opportunistic repurchases more so than the ratable. It's not to say that, that's going to be 100% that way, but if you look at this past quarter, or even year-to-date, where we purchased over $200 million or 3 million shares, in the mid-60s compared to where we're trading right now, we felt that, that was a very efficient use of capital going forward. So I think for the long-term shareholder us being more opportunistic is going to provide much greater value as we look at our share repurchases. But if you look at historically, we've had share repurchase programs in over time, and we've closed them out -- over the last 12 months, we've purchased over 11 million shares for about $1 billion, as Tony mentioned earlier in his remarks. So I think it's something we're committed to doing. We're just going to do it a little more opportunistically than we have in the past.OperatorThe next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.Vincent Stephen AndrewsBert, would you mind expanding on your comments earlier, just about the order book? And I guess I'm just curious, it sounds like summer fill was very well subscribed in the industry this year. So how much of the 3Q book do you think we should think about around those summer fill values versus sort of where the market has headed?And then how much liquidity is there in the fourth quarter in terms of being able to fill up the fourth quarter book where values are today?Bert A. FrostYes. When you look at the field programs and just the running of the business, you're always looking forward the months because you need to logistically be in place as well as what customer needs. And so the interesting thing I think about -- let's focus on the UAN fill program, the price that we launched at was actually higher than the spot price ending the quarter. But you're right, we filled a book out for Q3. And the same thing with -- as my prepared remarks on urea, we were booking some export values that are below the current values today. And so that's kind of the Q3 position, and we'll execute against that and now look to Q4 and Q1 of next year and how we're going to put product in the market as well. It is a dynamic commodity business. And so you're looking at the components of gas, logistics and then the end price and what markets you put that to.And that's always the calculation that we look in the dynamic nature of our business. It's the matrix of options and how we execute against that and how you should judge us. And so we'll see when we report results for Q3.OperatorThe next question is from Ben Theurer with Barclays.Benjamin M. TheurerCongrats on the results. Two quick ones. So one, on the regulatory approval process for Waggaman. Is there anything you can share an update? Is this coming along as you expected? Is there any potential delays or maybe an acceleration of the process? That would be my first question.W. Anthony WillIt's a pretty kind of routine regulatory process, dealing with the FTC these days. And I wouldn't say there's anything that's out of the ordinary compared to how these things run. As Chris mentioned, we do expect to be closed by the end of the year.Benjamin M. TheurerOkay. Perfect. And then my second question is really to understand maybe the economic background of the decision to close down the ammonia production over in the U.K. Could you maybe somehow quantitatively elaborate what you expect the benefits are going to be? Because obviously, you're going to be able to allocate more U.S.-produced ammonia, but then there's a shipping component to it versus the cost of producing it over (inaudible). Have you done any sort of sensitivity analysis or just economic value-added analysis, so we understand better what benefits for the whole CF group ultimately is going to be from this decision?W. Anthony WillYes. We always have the option of moving ammonia from Donaldsonville over to Billingham. But oftentimes, we can just source ammonia, whether it's from Algeria or other places, and have it delivered on a lower cost basis. And we've got better opportunities to sell ammonia coming out of Donaldsonville at higher rates than moving it into Billingham.So the analysis really is both historically and as we look forward, given the volatile and high cost nature of gas in Europe and also given the high cost of carbon in Europe, and the age of the equipment and the ongoing cost for maintenance and turnaround of that asset, what do we look at being able to buy ammonia into the facility versus the fully loaded cost of running the ammonia plant, and it's just cheaper for us to be able to buy the ammonia in -- and so it's just a pure margin pickup by taking costs out of the system.OperatorThe next question is from Edlain Rodriguez with Credit Suisse.Edlain S. RodriguezI mean, Tony, like you've had a very uneven and a relatively challenging first half with prices going down just in time demand. As you look into the rest of the year and into next year, like what concerns you the most in terms of volume, energy costs, et cetera? And what excites you?W. Anthony WillWell, I'm going to recharacterize your question just for a moment, if I may, which is, except for the fact that we're comparing year-on-year against an all-time historic performance in 2022, delivering $1.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA in the first half of this year is fantastic by historical standards, really by any stretch of imagination.So Bert has had to navigate an interesting market from the standpoint of delayed purchasing patterns and volatile pricing and so forth. But I think he's done it extraordinarily well. As we look forward, we actually think inventory and supply side is pretty tight out there. And as we've mentioned, we think both India and Brazil as well as the North America channel that is really running low inventory are all going to be important centers for demand for nitrogen moving forward.The forward curve on gas is very attractive for North America. So we're optimistic about the second half of this year and into next year. We do think that grain prices will continue to have attractive farmer profitability as we move into 2024. So we're expecting high acreage next year and strong demand on a global basis.And we're just -- we're really optimistic about that. I don't really have any big concerns or bogeyman man out there that I'm worried about. Our focus is we want to get safety back to the place that we've been operating at the last couple of years, keep the plants online and just execute the way we normally do.OperatorThe next question is from Aron Ceccarelli with Berenberg.Aron CeccarelliI have two. The first one is on blue and green ammonia. How do you see the potential for blue and green ammonia as an alternative fuel for marine, which is completed now with methanol? And one of your competitors in Europe yesterday was very bullish about it. The second question is on the Slide #6 of your presentation. May you help me understand a little bit better what's the embedded assumption for the lower and the upper end of the targets, please?W. Anthony WillYes. So we're somewhat optimistic here about the potential for ammonia to be a clean energy source in marine applications. We do think that it's going to take a little bit longer time because there's some obvious EHS concerns on board, some retrofitting and then development of new propulsion systems, they're being driven off of ammonia. But there's a couple of really great developments, including some engines that are in test right now.And so our belief is this will happen. I don't think this is going to be a large center of demand in the next 5 years. But as you get out 10 years and beyond, I think that is going to become a real demand source for clean ammonia. I don't know, Bert, the other sort of thoughts on -- or Chris on...Christopher D. BohnYes, I would just say there's going to be -- as Tony mentioned, I think our thoughts are this is really into 2030, where you start to see some of that demand build on ammonia from a marine. And a good portion of the reason for that is not only because of the development that Tony talked about with the engines, but it's also just the attrition of the fleet that's out there of the 60,000 vessels in order for those to be replaced with ammonia is just going to take time when you see anywhere from a 1% to 3% per year attrition rate on those vessels.So we're being a little more conservative than others on the marine demand build, as Tony mentioned. We do expect it to come, but it's probably more closer to a 2030 post time frame.Bert A. FrostAnd regarding your second question on Page 6 of our analysis and asking what are our assumptions, these assumptions are based on: one, our active integration and understanding of the markets and conversations with those destination consuming areas, being India, Brazil, and they're just that dynamic of most of these markets have waited to purchase and don't have the inventory in place, but they have the pricing structure for the feed grains that support significant consumption of urea. And so India, just by limiting their rice exports, that's a significant move on the international market. Why are they doing that? One, to keep pricing in control, they're going to need the nutrients to produce that rice in an acceptable monsoon season, and Brazil in the same category with being a substantial producer going forward. You got the cotton planting season that is in Q4 and then second crop corn for first quarter of 2024, is going to require substantial products to be imported. And then when you look at the -- as we talked about earlier, the gas limitations and some of the supply points, it just puts together a very positive market for the tail end of the year and into 2024.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today. I would like to turn the call back over to Martin Jarosick for any closing remarks.Martin A. JarosickThanks, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing you at the upcoming conferences.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Cintas, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.25 = US$1.8b ÷ (US$8.5b - US$1.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to May 2023).So, Cintas has an ROCE of 25%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.5% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Cintas roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Cintas compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Cintas.What Can We Tell From Cintas' ROCE Trend?Cintas has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 54% over the last five years. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Cintas' ROCEAs discussed above, Cintas appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. Since the stock has returned a staggering 151% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Cintas can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.One more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Cintas and understanding this should be part of your investment process.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

18,a9bac443-672c-4196-a8f6-8b7104466f49,WMT,2023-08-04,Crypto's big two weeks: Here's what happened and what it could mean,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cryptos-big-two-weeks-heres-what-happened-and-what-it-could-mean-145720445.html,1691074640,STORY,"['COIN', 'AMZN', 'META', 'WMT']","[Crypto is having a very big two weeks.After being litigated and lobbied with more than a dozen enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the crypto industry saw the most concrete rules proposed yet from Congress for a framework to regulate cryptocurrencies.The movement in Washington comes as the industry digests two contradictory opinions over the last two weeks from different federal judges in New York about whether digital currencies can be considered securities when sold to the general public. Crypto prices and stocks have been mixed, as a result.“Expect to see more disagreement between courts, and less clarity, until Congress acts,” Stephen Palley, a Washington, D.C.-based legal partner with Brown Rudnick who co-chairs the firm’s digital commerce group, said Monday over Twitter.One possible turning point for how the industry is regulated came last week when the Republican-led House Financial Services Committee passed legislation out of committee that aims to create clarity around gaps between the rules of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC.A long outstanding issue for the crypto community has been what criteria would cause a crypto token to be classified as a commodity or as a security.The bill provides the CFTC with jurisdiction over digital commodities and clarifies the SEC's jurisdiction over digital assets offered as part of an investment contract. It also tries to direct what firms need to do to register with the SEC and requires the SEC to write new rules that are customized to govern crypto.There would be a ""decentralization"" test to help decipher whether the token is a commodity, but that wouldn't exclude it from necessarily becoming a security depending on how it's used.Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and a top deputy, Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.), were able to get six Democrats on board with the bill to get it out of committee.Story continues""There is no commingling,"" said McHenry, referring to allegations made about FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange that collapsed last year. ""The worst practices of FTX are banned in this bill.""""It is better at worst case than what we have currently, which is no consumer protection in the hopes the courts will understand the complexities of securities and commodities law and the technology. We have to wrestle with it. It is Congress’s obligation to wrestle with it.""The bill made it out of committee despite objections from Democratic committee leader Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who feels the bill fails to offer adequate funding and maintains consumers and investors will have fewer protections than currently granted under existing securities laws.""Moving forward on legislation is certainly a positive development, but we have to be pragmatic,"" said Sandra Ro, chief executive of Global Blockchain Business Council, a trade association focusing on blockchain technology.""The political climate and the congressional calendar currently present obstacles to seeing legislation become law. While any movement is positive, time is of the essence.""'Crypto wants to diminish the role of the SEC'So far, the SEC hasn't written specific rules about how the crypto industry should be policed. Rather, the agency has only stated that current securities laws apply to crypto.SEC Chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly asked crypto firms to register with the SEC and leveled more than a dozen enforcement actions against crypto firms for violating securities laws.Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler. (Evelyn Hockstein/Pool via AP) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The introduction of the Republican-sponsored legislation raises the question of whether the SEC will be forced to change its approach to regulating crypto companies using rules on the books, or whether new rules need to be implemented by lawmakers to regulate these assets.""I think it fundamentally rejects much if not all of what the SEC chair has been saying about the state of the market and the so-called clarity of the rules,"" said Paul Grewal, the chief legal officer of Coinbase (COIN), the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US.The SEC is suing Coinbase for selling certain digital currencies that the SEC considers to be unregistered securities.Coinbase is the largest US crypto exchange. (Richard Drew/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg, for his part, doesn't see a path forward for this bill through the end of 2024.""Democrats object to giving the CFTC authority over so much of the crypto universe as it has no experience with retail investor protections,"" Seiberg told Yahoo Finance. ""By contrast, crypto wants to diminish the role of the SEC and boost the power of the CFTC.""Court confusionBut the courts have not yet been clear on how digital currencies should be treated.Analisa Torres, a US judge in the Southern District of New York, said on July 13 the XRP digital token issued by Ripple Labs was a security only when it was sold to institutional investors, and not when it was purchased by the general public. The SEC had sued Ripple for selling unregistered securities.Then July 31, US judge Jed Rakoff disagreed with that specific view in his case, in which the SEC has alleged stablecoin issuer Terraform Labs sold unregistered securities.He determined that how a crypto token is sold — whether through an exchange or directly to institutional investors — does not determine whether any reasonable investor would expect the promise of profits. Rakoff ruled the SEC's case against Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon can proceed.US judge Jed Rakoff in the Southern District of New York. (Yana Paskova/For The Washington Post via Getty Images) (The Washington Post via Getty Images)The verdict was a blow to crypto exchanges like Coinbase that do sell digital currencies to the general public.Coinbase's Grewal, however, sees Rakoff's ruling as another sign new rules are needed for crypto.""I think it actually underscores that we need a single standard that applies across the country and that single standard can really only come in the form of legislation from Congress,"" Grewal said.""A couple of district judges reaching different conclusions about certain elements of cryptocurrency regulation in the same courthouse actually only adds fuel to the fire that we think is lighting Congress to move forward.""StablecoinsThere is also movement in Washington that affects another part of the crypto world: stablecoins.On July 27, the House Financial Services also passed stablecoin legislation in a vote of 34-16 with about seven Democrats signing on in a show of bipartisan support.But not all Democrats are on board. Waters objected to it, contending it undermines creating strong reserve requirements by allowing any stablecoin regulator — federal or state — to unilaterally expand the list of eligible reserve assets.Waters also said the bill grants no actual enforcement authority to the Federal Reserve for issuers with state licenses, a key sticking point for Democrats.Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. (Amanda Andrade-Rhoades/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)""We are getting to a point where [Congress has] to make a go or no-go decision on whether or not they're going cut this deal,"" said John Rizzo, a former Treasury public affairs official, who worked on the President's Working Group's stablecoin recommendations, and is now senior vice president at the Clyde Group.""The differences now don't seem all that different from the differences that we confronted in the summer of 2022.""Both parties are still at loggerheads now over unhosted wallets and the degree of state versus federal oversight — issues that were also unresolved last year.Waters also asserted the stablecoin bill removes the ban on companies from issuing stablecoins, allowing companies like Amazon (AMZN), Walmart (WMT), or Facebook (META) to create their own stablecoins or be affiliated with a stablecoin issuer.""Does no one remember the numerous hearings we had when Mark Zuckerberg tried to do this just four years ago?""

This compares to year-ago revenues of $613.57 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Kontoor shares have added about 1.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 17.6%.What's Next for Kontoor?While Kontoor has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Kontoor: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

The company's bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play.In Stabroek Block, located off the coast of Guyana, Exxon Mobil has made many major discoveries that significantly improve its production outlook. The advantaged growth projects of Guyana have lower greenhouse gas intensity than most of the oil and gas-producing resources across the globe. Exxon Mobil also has a strong presence in the Permian Basin, the most prolific resource in the United States.However, the firm reported weak second-quarter earnings owing to lower crude price realizations.

After all, studies have shown that most successful stocks have seen an acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price.Earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in a company's earnings per share (EPS). In other words, if the rate of a company's quarter-over-quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time, it can be called earnings acceleration.In the case of earnings growth, you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price. But earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven't yet caught the attention of investors and, once secured, will invariably lead to a rally in the share price. This is because earnings acceleration considers both the direction and magnitude of growth rates.An increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period. Meanwhile, a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown, while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down.The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,735 stocks to only three.

This compares to earnings of $1.37 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of $1.62 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 1.23%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Microchip Tech , which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry, posted revenues of $2.29 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.96 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Microchip Tech shares have added about 28.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 17.6%.What's Next for Microchip Tech?While Microchip Tech has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Microchip Tech: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.61 on $2.24 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.27 on $8.84 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed is currently in the top 45% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Magnachip (MX), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023. The results are expected to be released on August 7.This chip products maker is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.23 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -200%.

For the first quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, GAAP net income was adversely impacted by amortization of acquired intangible assets associated with our previous acquisitions.Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was a record at $905.3 million, or $1.64 per diluted share, up from non-GAAP net income of $767.2 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, in the prior year's first fiscal quarter. For the first quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, severance, and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition), professional services associated with certain legal matters, and losses on the settlement of debt. For the first quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, our non-GAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the applicable fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.Microchip announced today that its Board of Directors declared a record quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 41.0 cents per share, up 36.2% from the year ago quarter. The quarterly dividend is payable on September 5, 2023 to stockholders of record on August 22, 2023.""Our June quarter results were in-line with the midpoint of our guidance as revenue grew 2.5% sequentially and 16.6% year over year, amid a weakening macro backdrop and increased business uncertainty,"" said Ganesh Moorthy, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""We delivered record revenue of $2.29 billion during our first fiscal quarter, marking the 11th consecutive quarter of revenue growth. Our team's disciplined execution, in combination with resilient end markets and a diverse customer base, helped to drive record non-GAAP gross and operating margins of 68.4% and 48.1%, respectively.""Mr. Moorthy added, ""We continue to navigate a challenging market environment and are trending toward supply chain normalization as we continue to improve lead times for many of our products. In the June quarter, we further assisted customers in de-risking their inventory positions by pushing out non-reschedulable backlog to future quarters. China was our weakest region again, as macro softness drove weaker sell-through activity and inventory build at Chinese distributors. Even as our broad base of customers experience demand uncertainty, we expect our operating metrics to demonstrate resiliency through this business cycle.""Eric Bjornholt, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, said, ""We continued to pay down our debt with another $413.0 million of payments during the June quarter, reflecting a cumulative debt pay down of over $6.8 billion over the past 20 quarters, as we have enhanced our operating performance while actively managing the working capital requirements for the business. We ended the June 2023 quarter with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 1.29x compared to 2.05x at the end of the June 2022 quarter. Our operating model has been, and remains, a strong cash generator and continues to demonstrate consistently high non-GAAP operating margins as we execute our Microchip 3.0 strategy.""Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair, said, ""Microchip's board of directors approved a record dividend of 41 cents per share, which represents a 36.2% year-over-year increase. Given our cash flow generation during the June quarter, we are targeting to return $562.6 million to our shareholders in the September quarter through dividends and share repurchases. Our board remains committed to increasing cash returns to shareholders with the goal of returning 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders by the March 2025 quarter.""Mr. Moorthy concluded, ""Considering the macro environment we face of slowing economic activity and increasing business uncertainty, combined with the active steps we are taking to help customers with inventory positions to push out some of their backlog, we expect net sales in the September quarter to be up 1% to down 3% sequentially. At the mid-point of our guidance for the September quarter, net sales would be 9.3% higher than the year-ago quarter. Notwithstanding any near-term macro weakness, we are confident that semiconductors remain the engine of innovation for the applications and markets we serve. Our focus on Total System Solutions and key market megatrends is fueling strong design-win momentum that we expect will drive above-market long-term growth.""Microchip's Highlights for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2023:Published annual Sustainability Report, highlighting key sustainability goals, the strategies used to implement them, and progress made to further sustainable business practices.Announced the promotion of Rich Simoncic to executive vice president.

Therefore, our estimate of GAAP operating expenses excludes certain amounts that may be recognized as Special Charges and Other, net in the quarter ending September 30, 2023.(3) The forecast for GAAP tax expense excludes any unexpected tax events that may occur during the quarter, as these amounts cannot be forecasted.(4) Represents the expected cash tax rate for fiscal 2024, excluding any transition tax payments associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Capital expenditures for the quarter ending September 30, 2023 are expected to be between $90 million and $100 million. Capital expenditures for all of fiscal 2024 are expected to be between $300 million and $400 million. We continue to add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing capabilities to support the expected growth of our business.Under the GAAP revenue recognition standard, which we adopted on April 1, 2018, we are required to recognize revenue when control of the product changes from us to a customer or distributor. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on creating demand for our products in the end markets we serve and not on moving inventory into our distribution network. We also manage our manufacturing and supply chain operations, including our distributor relationships, towards the goal of having our products available at the time and location the end customer desires.Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Our non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, severance, and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition), professional services associated with certain legal matters, and losses on the settlement of debt. For the first quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, our non-GAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units, and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. Our other non-GAAP adjustments are either non-cash expenses, unusual or infrequent items, or other expenses related to transactions. Management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.We are using non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars, including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP other expense, net, and non-GAAP income tax rate, which exclude the items noted above, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of our business and for compensation purposes. We also use our non-GAAP results when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. Our determination of these non-GAAP measures mightnot be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using these non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.Generally, gross profit fluctuates over time, driven primarily by the mix of products sold and licensing revenue; variances in manufacturing yields; fixed cost absorption; wafer fab loading levels; costs of wafers from foundries; inventory reserves; pricing pressures in our non-proprietary product lines; and competitive and economic conditions. Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to net sales and profit levels.Diluted Common Shares Outstanding can vary for, among other things, the trading price of our common stock, the exercise of options or vesting of restricted stock units, the potential for incremental dilutive shares from our convertible debentures (additional information regarding our share count is available in the investor relations section of our website under the heading ""Supplemental Financial Information""), and repurchases or issuances of shares of our common stock. The diluted common shares outstanding presented in the guidance table above assumes an average Microchip stock price in the September 2023 quarter between $85 and $95 per share (however, we make no prediction as to what our actual share price will be for such period or any other period and we cannot estimate what our stock option exercise activity will be during the quarter).MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(in millions, except per share amounts;

Welcome to the MetLife Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will now turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations.John Arthur HallThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I'd point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of Metlife.com in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management.Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which address the quarter. The slides are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to them in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to the slides features disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, which you should similarly review. As usual, after prepared remarks, we will host a Q&amp;A session, which will end promptly just prior to the top of the hour. (Operator Instructions) With that, over to Michel.Story continuesMichel Abbas KhalafThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As market conditions continue to fluctuate, what has been a constant is the underlying performance of MetLife's diversified set of market-leading businesses. What has also been constant is the relentless execution of our strategy, which includes delivering in the second quarter on our commitment to accelerate the runoff of our legacy business through a financially attractive deal that also reduces enterprise risk.Our strong risk management capabilities are the bedrock of MetLife. This foundation enables us to successfully navigate shifting currents. We are confident in the prudence of our investment portfolio. We are secure in the effectiveness of our asset liability matching. We are certain of the safety and soundness of our capital and liquidity, and we are convinced of our balance sheet strength.Shifting to second quarter results. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings of $1.5 billion or $1.94 per share, which compares to $1.7 billion or $2.13 per share a year ago. We continue to be pleased with the underlying momentum of our core businesses, which was evident in the quarter. Our sales were strong across the board with impressive results in Group Retirement and Income Solutions, Asia and Latin America. Our underwriting results were well within targeted levels, our direct expense ratio totaled 12.2%, illustrating our capacity to generate further operating leverage. Our recurring investment income continues to climb with new money rates pushing past 6% and our adjusted return on equity of 14.6%, excluding AOCI other than FCTA met our target range of 13% to 15%. For the quarter, Variable investment income of $221 million came in below our outlook expectation. In the aggregate, private equity returns were about 1.5% inclusive of a positive 40 basis point return on our venture capital portfolio. We generated a minus 1.9% return on real estate equity funds, an asset class that remains under some cyclical pressure. Nonetheless, we believe we've reached the trough relative to VII's contribution to our quarterly adjusted earnings. In total, net income for the second quarter was $370 million, which reflects certain required accounting adjustments following the announcement of our pending reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic. We did not incur material credit losses in our real estate portfolio or elsewhere during the second quarter. Shifting to MetLife's business performance in the quarter. I will start with our U.S. Group Benefits results. Adjusted earnings totaled $372 million with underwriting results in line with our expectations after reflecting certain unfavorable items. In total, year-to-date sales are up 13%, while year-to-date adjusted PFOs are up 5%, reflecting the impact of par firmly within our 4% to 6% outlook range, which we expect to achieve for the full year 2023. Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to sustain our growth trajectory in this attractive capital-light business for many reasons. The strength of our relationships with our largest national accounts, where our average customer has been with us for more than 20 years is well known. The power behind this strength is apparent when you consider that 75% of new sales are made to existing customers through product additions and enrollment growth. Our efforts to accelerate growth in regional business is evident in our market share gains. A key element of this success is driven by our expansive product portfolio, the broadest across the benefits universe. As a proof point, more than half of our new regional business customers purchased multiple products. And again, this can also be seen in our success with voluntary products, which we've been able to grow at a mid- to high teens rate for many years now. For Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings totaled $417 million, up 11% from the prior year, driven by higher recurring investment margins and higher asset balances. Sales in the quarter were very strong across a range of products, including pension risk transfer with more than $2 billion booked, structured settlements, longevity reinsurance and post-retirement benefits. We see good runways for growth in all these areas. In Asia, adjusted earnings of $431 million were below a year ago on lower variable investment income. Our ability to bring new products quickly to market was on full display in the quarter. Sales on a constant currency basis were up 34% in the region, led by Japan, where sales jumped 42% year-over-year, led by the introduction of a foreign currency life insurance product. Turning to Latin America, which put up another strong quarter, adjusted earnings totaled $219 million. Further, Latin America posted gains in both sales and adjusted PFOs of 13% and 14%, respectively, on a constant currency basis. Taking a wider lens on the momentum in our business, we managed through the pandemic expecting to emerge from the turmoil stronger than we entered. With the fullness of time, we can now see that is true. Some numbers can help. In full year 2019, our group benefits business generated premiums, fees and other revenues of roughly $19 billion. We are on track to generate Group Benefits PFOs of roughly $24 billion in 2023, representing $5 billion of growth at a CAGR of more than 5%. In 2019, our Retirement and Income Solutions business generated average quarterly adjusted earnings of $310 million, with variable investment income matching outlook expectations. So far in 2023 RIS has averaged about $410 million of adjusted earnings per quarter without the benefit of normal VII.Similarly, our Latin America business averaged roughly $150 million of adjusted earnings per quarter in 2019, which has grown to an average of more than $200 million per quarter in 2023. To me, the message is clear, the fundamentals associated with our market-leading businesses continue to gather steam. Moving to capital and cash. MetLife remained active with capital management during the second quarter. Following the increase to our common stock dividend, we paid roughly $400 million of common stock dividends to shareholders and we repurchased $672 million of our common stock. The pace of repurchases in the second quarter slowed due to the impending announcement of our reinsurance deal. In addition to our activity in the second quarter, we repurchased roughly another $300 million of our common stock during the month of July. Year-to-date through July, we have repurchased about $1.8 billion of our common shares, which leaves approximately $3.5 billion remaining on our expanded repurchase authorization. As we have done consistently over time, we carefully assess every use of capital with the goal of achieving the right balance between investing in responsible growth for the future and returning capital to generate sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. At the end of the quarter, we held $4.2 billion of cash at our holding companies, which is above the top end of the $3 billion to $4 billion liquidity buffer we maintain. In the beginning of July, we issued senior debt on attractive terms, which will be included in our cash balance in the third quarter. Beyond this, the dynamics of our reinsurance transaction will further add to cash as we move through the remainder of this year. During the quarter, we announced that Steve Goulart will retire at the end of August. Today will be his last earnings call with us. So feel free to pepper him with questions, you will not get another chance. I would like to take this moment to thank Steve for his 17 years of distinguished service to MetLife. In that time span, he led our corporate development and mergers and acquisitions team and served as Treasurer before taking on his roles as MetLife's Chief Investment Officer, and the President of MetLife Investment Management. From a standing start in 2012, Steve established MetLife Investment Management and fostered its growth to its present status as $167 billion institutional fixed income and real estate manager. I believe the talent at MetLife truly sets us apart and serves as a clear differentiator for our company. Steve's retirement provides the opportunity to broaden the roles and responsibilities of some of our top leaders. In addition to her role as Chief Risk Officer, Marlene Debel will lead MetLife's insurance investments with Chief Investment Officer, Chuck Scully, reporting directly to Marlene. John McCallion, MetLife's Chief Financial Officer, will take on additional responsibility as the Head of MetLife Investment Management. And Ramy Tadros, Regional President U.S. business will add Head of MetLife Holdings to his portfolio. These moves draw up on MetLife's deep bench and illustrate our ability to deploy top talent to the areas of greatest impact for our customers and shareholders. In closing, MetLife's all-weather strategy positions us to perform across a range of economic cycles. By focusing on what we can control, how we execute, how we invest and how we deploy capital, we will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance in greater detail.John Dennis McCallionI will start with the 2Q 23 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance and an update on our liquidity and capital positions. In addition, I'll provide an update on our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Net investment losses were primarily the result of securities that were associated with the pending reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic that we announced at the end of May. For GAAP purposes, gross unrealized losses as of June 30 on securities expected to be transferred to Global Atlantic at closing, are required to be realized through net income this quarter. In addition, we had net derivative losses due to the favorable equity markets, strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the yen and higher interest rates. That said, derivative losses were mostly offset this quarter by market risk benefit or MRB remeasurement gains due to higher equity markets and interest rates. Overall, the portfolio remains well positioned. Credit losses continued to be modest and the hedging program performed as expected.On Page 4, you can see the second quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment excluding a favorable notable item of $77 million in 2Q of '22, primarily related to a reinsurance settlement, which was accounted for in MetLife Holdings. There were no notable items in the current quarter. Adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion, down 10% and down 11% on a constant currency basis. The primary driver was lower variable investment income. Underwriting margins were also less favorable than the prior year, but within our targeted ranges. Higher recurring interest margins and solid volume growth were partial offsets. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.94, down 5% year-over-year on a reported and constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses, starting with the U.S. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $372 million, down 8% versus the prior year period. Results were below run rate expectations for the quarter due to certain unfavorable expense, reinsurance and reserve-related items, which reduced Group Benefits adjusted earnings by approximately $40 million and were specific to this quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio was 85.3%, essentially in line with the prior year quarter and at the bottom end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. Regarding non-medical health, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 73.3% in the quarter above the midpoint of its annual target range of 70% to 75%. We had a disability reserve refinement of approximately $15 million after tax, which increased the ratio up by 0.8 percentage points and was included in the items totaling $40 million that I just referenced. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 4% year-over-year taking participating contracts into account, which dampened growth by roughly 1%. The underlying PFOs were up approximately 5% year-over-year, primarily due to solid growth across most products including continued strong momentum in voluntary and was within our 2023 target growth range of 4% to 6%. In addition, group benefit sales were up 13% year-to-date, driven by strong growth across most products and markets. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were $417 million, up 11% year-over-year. The primary drivers were higher recurring interest margins and solid volume growth. This was partially offset by lower variable investment income year-over-year. RIS investment spreads were 132 basis points. Spreads, excluding VII, were 142 basis points, up 29 basis points versus Q2 of '22 and primarily due to higher interest rates as well as income from in-the-money interest rate caps. RIS liability exposures were up 5% year-over-year driven by general account liabilities, which grew 7% due to strong net flows. RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers were up 73% primarily driven by strong sales of structured settlement products and growth in U.K. longevity reinsurance. With regards to PRT, we completed 2 transactions worth approximately $2 billion in the quarter, and continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were $431 million, down 11% and 9% on a constant currency basis primarily due to lower variable investment income. Adjusted earnings ran approximately $25 million above expectation due to certain reserve refinements and tax-related true-ups. Asia's key growth metrics were strong as general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis grew 5% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 34% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth across the region. In Japan, sales were up 42% year-over-year, driven by continued strong momentum in FX annuities through our face-to-face channels as well as life sales due to a relaunch of a single premium FX Life product on April 1. We continue to see Japanese consumer interest for our FX products given the attractive higher U.S. interest rates. Latin America adjusted earnings were $219 million, down 13% and 21% on a constant currency basis due to less favorable underwriting margins versus 2Q of '22. The prior year quarter had a roughly $40 million benefit to adjusted earnings from a release of a COVID-related IBNR reserve. In addition, investment margins were down year-over-year, partially offset by solid volume growth. Latin America's top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 23% and 14% on a constant currency basis and sales were up 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. EMEA adjusted earnings were $70 million, up 6% and up 15% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by higher recurring interest margins. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 4% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 13% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $211 million, down 31%. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $228 million, essentially flat versus an adjusted loss of $227 million in the prior year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 22% and at the low end of our 2023 guidance of 22% to 24%. On Page 5, this chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the prior 5 quarters, including $221 million in Q2 of '23. Private equity portfolio of $14.6 billion had a plus 1.5% return in the quarter. Real estate equity funds of $2.2 billion had a minus 1.9% return. While both PE and real estate equity funds are reported on a 1-quarter lag, as of now, we anticipate that VII in the third quarter will generally be in line with the second quarter results. On Page 6, we provide VII post-tax by segment for the prior 5 quarters. As you have noted previously, each of the businesses hold its own discrete investment portfolios, which have been built to match its liabilities. As reflected in the chart, Asia, RIS and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest portion of VII assets given their long-dated liability profile. For 2Q of '23, Asia's VII portfolio generated the highest returns at 2.2%, outperforming MetLife Holdings at 1.5% and RIS at 0.9%. Now turning to Page 7. The chart on the left of the page shows the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the past 3 years in Q2 of '22 versus Q2 of '23. While VII has had the lower-than-trend returns over the last few quarters, recurring income, which accounts for approximately 96% of net investment income was up $700 million year-over-year reflecting higher interest rates and growth in asset balances. Shifting your attention to the chart on the right of the page, which shows our new money yield versus roll-off yield over the past 3 years, new money yields continue to outpace roll-off yields in the recent quarters. In this quarter, our global new money yield reached its highest level in more than a decade of 6.06%, 157 basis points higher than the roll-off yield. We expect this favorable trend to continue, assuming interest rates remain near current levels. Turning to Page 8. I'll provide a few updates on our commercial mortgage loans, which you can find further details in our quarterly financial supplement. As of June 30, our commercial mortgage loan or CML portfolio, carrying value of approximately $53 billion is well diversified by geography and property type. The CML portfolio is concentrated in high-quality properties and in larger primary markets. These loans are typically to the larger and stronger institutional sponsors who are better positioned to effectively manage assets through periods of stress. Given the focus on the office sector, our real estate team updated all U.S. office valuation through June 30, assuming a 25% peak-to-trough valuation decline. We believe it was prudent to focus our efforts here in the quarter given the heightened attention this has received. As expected, LTVs increased slightly as a result with our CML portfolio now in an average LTV of 62%, up from 58% in the first quarter of '23 and an average debt service coverage ratio of 2.3x, down slightly from 2.4x in 1Q '23. The modest increase in LTVs coupled with the resiliency and robustness of the debt service coverage ratio is another indicator of the disciplined approach we take to investing in this asset class. The quality of our CML portfolio remains strong with only 2% of the loans having LTVs more than 80% and DSCRs less than 1x. With regards to CML loan maturities, we now have successfully resolved 69% of the portfolio scheduled to mature in 2023, and our expectation is for minimal losses on the portfolio. Now let's switch gears to discuss expenses on Page 9. This chart shows the comparison of our direct expense ratio for full year 2022 as well as Q1 of '23 and Q2 of '23, which had a ratio of 12.2%. As we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. Our Q2 direct expense ratio benefited from solid top line growth and ongoing expense discipline. We remain committed to achieving a full year direct expense ratio of 12.6% or below in 2023, demonstrating our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 10. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at June 30, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion and consistent with March 31. The cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend and share repurchases of roughly $700 million in the second quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. The buybacks in 2Q of '23 were lower than our recent trend as we were in a blackout period for most of May in advance of our pending reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic. That said, we have repurchased shares totaling approximately $300 million in July. For our U.S. company's preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2023 statutory operating earnings were approximately $2 billion while net income was approximately $1.3 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1.3 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable underwriting, partially offset by higher expenses. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $17.4 billion as of June 30, 2023, down 2% from March 31, 2023, primarily due to the temporary impact of roughly $300 million associated with the investments expected to be transferred to Global Atlantic. We expect these impacts to reverse at close, which remains on target by year-end. In addition, as previously disclosed, we expect the transaction to add approximately 60 combined RBC points. Finally, we expect the Japan solvency margin ratio to be approximately 700% as of June 30, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. Let me conclude with a few points. First, while VII remains below historical returns, we believe we reached a trough. In addition, core spreads remain robust and continue to benefit from a higher-yielding environment. Second, the underlying strength of our business fundamentals continues to be displayed with strong top line growth, coupled with disciplined underwriting and expense management. Lastly, MetLife remains in a position of strength given our balance sheet, investment portfolio, free cash flow generation and the diversification of our market-leading businesses and we are committed to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth and building sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperatorWe first go to the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW.Ryan Joel KruegerMy first question was following the recent risk transfer deal. Do you see further opportunities for additional risk transfer in MetLife Holdings over time?John Dennis McCallionRyan, it's John. I think we would probably follow the same commentary we've given before. We are continuing to look for ways to optimize. We look internally for ways to optimize, and we continue to have external communications around different opportunities. I think at the end of the day, similar to what we did with this transaction, it needs to fit the right profile for us. It needs to be value creative. It needs to be risk reducing, and -- but at the end of the day, we don't have to. We're very comfortable managing these blocks of businesses ourselves. We have the expertise. And I think there are different ways to find ways to optimize that book. So -- but nonetheless, it's a healthy process for us continuing to have these conversations.Ryan Joel KruegerThen I had to ask one for Steve on his last call. Could you provide some additional details on the office loans that have been resolved year-to-date, the mix of pay downs versus extensions? And any more color on what the terms of the extensions are.Steven Jeffrey GoulartRyan, I would hate to go through my last earnings call without a question, but on your question, let me talk about sort of the total portfolio. Again, John mentioned 69% of the loans scheduled to mature this year have already been resolved. Of that, 31% of them were actually paid off, so very positive. And 57% of them were resolved through the borrower extension of contractual loan extensions. And we've talked about that a little bit in the past. But again, those are not financially distressed loans and the average LTV on those loans is 51%. And again, they have contractual extensions that allow the borrower to choose to extend. And that's what has happened with those. And again, when they do, they have to meet financial performance tests related to debt yield related to LTV, sometimes both. We also get fees paid on those extensions and so it's not a surprise just given where interest rates are, that this is what the borrowers would choose to do. The office portfolio is very similar in those statistics that I just gave. So we're very comfortable looking out the rest of the year, we would expect similar resolutions and are very pleased with how it's moving forward.OperatorOur next question is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.Elyse Beth GreenspanMy first question, John, I think you pointed out that there was around $40 million of one-off items within group. So just thinking about going forward, should we just normalize for that and think about that as the run rate earnings power of the segment? Or is there any other seasonality that we should take in mind in the back half of the year?Ramy TadrosElyse, it's Ramy. So the short answer to your question is, yes. So these were unfavorable items that we don't expect to reoccur. Just to give you a flavor of what the items were. So the first one was an expense item, which is related to a catch-up on state tax assessment. The second one is an adjustment on the life reinsurance policy. And the third one is a reserve refinement in our disability line, which, as John indicated, impacted our nonmedical health ratio by just about 1 point. So we don't expect these to be recurring as I mentioned. And so you could essentially normalize for those on a go-forward basis.Elyse Beth GreenspanAnd then my second question, you guys saw a buyback pick up in July. So is that July level kind of a good run rate from here as we think about the Holdings transaction closing. And then I also believe your subsidiary dividends are typically greater in the back half of the year.Michel Abbas KhalafElyse, Michel here. So I would say that there was a bit of catch-up in July, given the fact that we were in blackout for part of the second quarter due to the reinsurance transaction. So if you look at probably the sort of run rate up to July year-to-date, I think that gives you a good sense of sort of pacing. Obviously, we're looking to close the transaction in the second half of the year and when we do, we'll assess the environment at that time. I think we've built a good track record here in terms of after major divestitures in terms of how we we're deliberate and expeditious in returning excess capital and expect the same year.OperatorNext, we go to Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.Erik James BassCan you provide some more color on your non-medical health underwriting results this quarter, I guess, in particular, the experience in dental and disability and how you're thinking about those going forward?Ramy TadrosSure, Erik. It's Ramy here. So I'll start with disability. So our results this quarter were favorable year-over-year. We're seeing favorable incidents and very strong recovery levels and very pleased with the performance of that line this quarter. And as I just noted before, we have seen about a 1-point impact on the ratio given some of those reserve refinements, which we referred to earlier. .On disability, we're continuing to benefit from tailwinds here in terms of favorable macro environment, interest rates and tight labor markets. But aside from the macro factors, we're also benefiting from our strong underwriting, our return to health capabilities, the deployment of data and technology and how we run this business. And we also continue to invest in our leave and absence capabilities, which give us pricing power and continue to resonate well in the marketplace. From a dental perspective, we have seen a slight elevation in our trend this quarter, driven by an increase in our claims costs. As part of the normal course of managing this product, we adjust our pricing to make sure we meet our target margins. So as a reminder, we repriced the majority of our dental book, call it about 80% annually, and we're always monitoring the trends and adjusting our pricing accordingly. So this is part of the course in terms of managing dental book. And maybe if you want to kind of step back and look at the non-medical health benefit ratio for the full year, which is inclusive of dental and disability, we expect to be at the midpoint of our guidance range for the full year here?Erik James BassAnd then maybe if I could pivot to Asia. Japan sales continue to be very strong. So hope you could talk a little bit more about what's driving this, the current competitive dynamics in the market and what impact the change in BOJ policy could have on the business?Lyndon OliverErik. It's Lyndon here. So look, we're very pleased with the overall sales performance we've seen in Asia in the second quarter. You've seen Asia sales overall have grown 34% and Japan, in particular, is up 42% and the rest of Asia up 17%. Now if we look a little deeper in Japan, foreign currency products continue to drive our sales growth over there. The market for single premium foreign currency products has been strong, given the higher rate environment and we continue to sustain our market position in the Annuity segment. Michel pointed out in his opening remarks, our ability to bring new products to market quickly has really helped us in terms of launching our single premium foreign currency product. We've also optimized our capital structure for these products by leveraging our internal reinsurance in Bermuda. So the combination of both the product differentiation, the speed to market as well as the strength of our distribution in the face-to-face as well as bancassurance has really been a strong factor in growing sales. If we look at the rest of Asia, we've recovered really well this year. We've seen broad-based improvement in China, India and Korea. And overall, all the initiatives we've taken on the customer side, the distribution side as well as on the product -- the new product launches have really helped in these markets. And if we look ahead to the outlook, our management actions have really continued to drive the sales momentum. But when we look at the year-over-year comparison for the second half, we're going to be challenged given we had a strong second half of the year last year. However, we're on track to be at the high end of the full year guidance of mid- to high single digits.OperatorNext, we move to a question from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.Jamminder Singh BhullarSo first, just a question on spreads in the retirement business assuming that interest rates sort of follow the forward yield curve, it would be reasonable that your yield would pick up, but should we assume that spreads would improve as well? Or are you at a point where now any incremental increases in yields in the retirement business would need to be passed through to customers through higher crediting rates.John Dennis McCallionJimmy, it's John. Look, as we think about yield, as you said, it's -- we had a really strong quarter. And certainly in RIS, we're 132 all in and if you exclude VII, we're at a healthy 142. And probably if you kind of normalize for VI, that puts us at the high end of the range. It's very much in line with what we gave in our outlook. We thought the first half of the year, even though the forward curves have moved around and things like that we would have kind of a higher level in Q1 and Q2. I think as you look forward, we would think spreads kind of hover around this point. I'm not so sure it would kind of -- now why it does that is not necessarily exactly, I'd say, perfectly aligned with the pass-through comment you made. I think there's other -- a variety of other factors. I think it's just as the curve begins to shift how the impact of the caps versus the long end start to manifest itself in spreads. But I think right now, we would view the kind of the third quarter outlook would be somewhere in this vicinity or maybe the average of Q1 and Q2.Jamminder Singh BhullarAnd my comment was around just competition as well because there's a limit, obviously, to how much they can reasonably improve. And then maybe to shift things...John Dennis McCallionYes, go ahead. No understood.Jamminder Singh BhullarYes, what I meant was like if rates keep going up, you're already at a pretty good point in terms of spreads. So I'm assuming it's unreasonable to assume that they keep improving a lot more from here..John Dennis McCallionYes, that's fair. I think the key for us is, I'd say, to your point, new business pricing is -- that's where I think your point lies. I think we still are on an overall basis, have some -- we're short, so I think as there's roll-off reinvest, that's where my point was.Jamminder Singh BhullarOkay. And then in Japan, you've been selling a lot of ForEx products. Some of your peers have as well. And I think with changes in the economic solvency margin, that product becomes more sort of capital unfriendly or not as healthy as it is right now. So I'm wondering if you are planning on making any changes to your products or you could actually manage around that through offshore reinsurance and then relatedly, I don't know if there's a limit to how much the FSA would let companies use in terms of or use offshore reinsurance to shift business out of Japan.Lyndon OliverLook, it's Lyndon here. So let me make a couple of comments around this. So the ESR implementation is a couple of years away. And we continue to make very good progress looking at all these products under the new regime. But we're still early in the work, and the regulations are still evolving. The second point here is we currently price our products on the MetLife's economic solvency and on a local statutory basis. So to some extent, we're already using an economic lens as we analyze product profitability, but as I said, it's a little early. The regulations continue to go -- to evolve. We're in the middle of field testing. So I think as our implementation plan progresses, we will start to make adjustments as needed. This would include reinsurance or product modifications or anything like that. But it would -- it still be too early given it's a couple of years away.OperatorAnd our next question is from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI.Thomas George GallagherFirst one is just on a trend peers have seen, which has been elevated long-term care claims. It looked to me like holdings, underwriting and underlying earnings were actually pretty favorable. So I wanted to see if you also experienced elevated long-term care claims within that? And if so, how much?John Dennis McCallionTom, it's John. We did see some unfavorability kind of towards the end of Q1 and into Q2 and maybe the first couple of months of Q2, higher claims as well as some lower terminations on just on a relative trend perspective. Towards the end of Q1 -- or Q2, I should say, and then into July, we've seen those trends revert back. So right now, we probably would account for that as an aberration, a short-term aberration, but we'll obviously still monitor.I think just an overall point around results for holding while that's the case, we had favorable mortality in this segment. So that was a positive. But specifically the long-term care that's the case. I think on the flip side, the team has been doing a really, really good job continuing to get rate increases. We've already met our kind of our typical run rate of rate increases this year at 4.5% of premium, year-to-date. That's kind of our -- that's what we typically assume each year. So we're off to a great start there.Thomas George GallagherAnd then my follow-up is, so last quarter, I think you all had mentioned $200 million of potential foreclosures on CRE or CMLs with $15 million of related losses as I guess, that was a stress test. What would the update be now? It sounds like it's probably going to be less than that. But curious what you think now and then also, have you seen any meaningful credit migration into 2Q on your CMBS portfolio?Steven Jeffrey GoulartTom, it's Steve Goulart. Thanks for the question. And I think you were headed in the right direction, basically. Obviously, we continue to do stress testing, but really nothing to note on that. We're very comfortable with the portfolio, very comfortable with the results of the stress testing. Certainly, nothing is different if anything may be marginally better than last time. .You talked about foreclosures also. We did use a number. Frankly, it's going to come in materially less than that. We think we're going to have very small charge-offs in the portfolio as well. The portfolio is very well positioned. So I think we're very comfortable with it, and it will continue to perform through this. On -- I'm sorry, the last part of the question was related to CMBS migration? Or just can you repeat the last question?Thomas George GallagherSure, Steve. CMBS, did you see credit migration on that portfolio downgrades? And or did you have losses on that portfolio that you took this quarter?Steven Jeffrey GoulartNo, no. We haven't had any material losses in that portfolio.John Dennis McCallionI'd just add 2 things, Tom. So I think to Steve's point around just losses, I think is referenced to just materially less was relative to the stress that we had put out, right? I mean I think the comments I made in the first quarter around what our expectations for kind of the maturities and kind of the potential loss there. I'd say no change is one. And then two, just maybe broadly speaking around just credit losses were very modest this quarter as we said. And actually, I don't know if we even had any real estate and CECL went down because there was a revaluation of a hotel that actually went up. So there's a lot of factors there. But I think all in all, the portfolio is performing well.OperatorYour next question is from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies.Suneet Laxman L. KamathStart out, best of luck to Steve. Just on the 69% of CML maturities that were, I guess, resolved here, I don't know if you mentioned this, but what percentage of those were office, if you can disclose that.Steven Jeffrey GoulartYes. Let's see -- the resolution was basically in line with the overall portfolio and of the office loans, roughly the same percentage were resolved trying to get the actual percentage of office, and I'll get that in 1 second for you.Suneet Laxman L. KamathOkay. I can pivot to my second question and then maybe circle back. I guess for Ramy, we've seen good disability results sort of across the board, I guess, for a couple of quarters now. Just curious, based on your experience, when do you think that some of these results might start to feather into pricing, and we could start to see greater competition. I would imagine at some point, it would need to work its way through. Just wondering any thoughts on the timing of that.Ramy TadrosSure. I mean I think if you're thinking about this over kind of the short to medium term, I would say there are like 4 factors driving disability margins. You've got very disciplined underwriting. You've got strong claim management. You've got customer service that drives persistency and the ability to get appropriate rates at renewal and this one is particularly important if you're in the business of providing bundled solutions, including absence and leave capabilities, which we are a market leader in and then, of course, you got the macro factors in terms of the employment levels as well as the competitive environment. .And I would say for us, the first 3 drivers of this underwriting claims and capabilities are a core competitive advantage and will continue to be so as we continue to invest in this business. If you think about the macro environment, we're seeing some of those tailwinds right now, but we continue to be disciplined in our pricing because there's a fair bit of uncertainty in the environment going forward, and we're certainly continuing to bake that into our pricing as we look into '24.Suneet Laxman L. KamathSo a pretty rational environment in terms of pricing, not just you guys, but just in terms of what you're seeing from a competitive perspective?Ramy TadrosYes, I would say it's competitive. It's rational, and there's also multiple levers to differentiate beyond price, and we're certainly pulling on every single one of those levers given our scale and capabilities in this business.Steven Jeffrey GoulartSuneet, this is Steve, I just wanted to follow up. We did -- sorry, I didn't have that answer at the tip of my fingers. But basically, it's just over $5 billion of total resolutions and of that, nearly half were office.OperatorOur next question is from Mike Ward with Citi.Michael Augustus WardMaybe just on VII or overall, pretty solid result, I think, considering the macro and real estate dynamic. Just wondering if you can expand on your confidence in that trough, the trough dynamic, thinking about the real estate, equity or I guess, overall noncash sort of gains, just hope you can expand on that confidence.John Dennis McCallionMike, it's John. Yes, I think as both Michel and I mentioned in our opening remarks, our view is, yes, we've met. We've come to a trough I think different assets are in kind of different positions. But all in all, in the trough, we've seen some headwinds in real estate funds that I mentioned, minus 1.9%, but we saw some positive offsets in the PE portfolio. We think that dynamic continues into the next quarter, which is why I mentioned we would generally be in line with now. Obviously, it's early. We don't have a ton of, I'll say, objective insight. We have some qualitative commentary and views. We've seen a positive equity markets, although it might be driven by a small number of stocks, depending on how you look at the second quarter. So that typically directionally translates into some level of, I'll say, the positive in-line return, but the betas are typically lower. So that's kind of where we are. We kind of view this trough as more of a U-shaped recovery in this asset class versus kind of a sharp V. And we just don't want to get ahead of ourselves. So right now, we kind of view that the best view would be kind of in line with Q2.Michael Augustus WardThanks, John. And then maybe for just group benefits overall in the U.S. Just curious from your guys' perspective about the climate or the sentiment for U.S. employers, labor market has been pretty resilient. Some headlines around head count reductions. Just curious what you guys are hearing in that regard and also on wages or and how that flows into demand for overall benefits?Ramy TadrosI would say from a top line perspective, we're still seeing significant strength across the portfolio. So we're very pleased with our PFO growth. And that's a combination of new customers. It's a combination of good persistency, rate actions for a portion of our portfolio. We've got some tailwinds in terms of wage growth. So we're still seeing very strong momentum there.As Michel alluded to, we're still seeing double-digit growth in our voluntary portfolio and with a lot of white space, both in terms of customers who don't offer voluntary as well as increasing opportunities to increase penetration within the work side as well. And then I would also just point to the below 5000 space, which we define as our regional market, national is about 5,000. That is emerging as a particularly bright spot for us. Our PFO growth there is high single digits. We do a fair bit of internal research where we cut the data by market segment. And when you look at the data below 5,000, we're a top 3 player in that segment, and we're continuing to take share in a fragmented market. So all in all, we're still seeing really positive tailwinds both from the macro environment as well as how we're positioned in this business that's driving PFO growth that's well within the 4% to 6% range that we have.OperatorNext, we go to a question from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.Taylor Alexander ScottFirst one is a little bit of a housekeeping question. I was just interested in the corporate expense load. It looks a little bit elevated. I know some of that -- I know some of that is just part of VII, but even other expenses a bit elevated. So I just wanted to get a feel for there is anything nuanced going on there, any investment in the business or something we need to be aware of and just confidence around the, I guess, the $650 million to $750 million annualized number headed in the back half and into next year?John Dennis McCallionAlex, it's John. As you point out, a couple of things. One, we obviously VII being below the kind of historical returns puts pressure on C&amp;O as well. So that's probably one driver maybe the elevated loss that you're referencing. We did have higher expenses in C&amp;O. Obviously, our direct expense ratio came in while overall expenses would -- were very good along with strong top line growth. So our ratio of 12.2% was well below the 12.6%. We're still obviously targeting below the 12.6% for full year, and it can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, but a good quarter nonetheless. In terms of the expenses, if you kind of compare to last year, I'd say probably 2 main things to highlight. One, interest on debt. It was one item year-over-year that's a relatively big piece of that. And then the second one is we did have some higher onetime costs in C&amp;O this quarter due to some corporate initiatives, I'll call it, that was part of just kind of our general efficiency mindset. We don't ever exclude those things. Those are all part of our direct expense ratio, but there are investments that we've made to kind of improve our run rate go forward. So hopefully, that helps with the C&amp;O.Taylor Alexander ScottYes. That is helpful. Second one I had for you is just on the Fitch downgrade of U.S. debt. I think having 2 out of 3 below AAA now probably moves the composite rating and so maybe that would affect risk weights. And it seems like it should be reasonably limited, but I just wanted to get your thoughts on if we should expect any material impact to RBC from that and if it affects anything else in your business.John Dennis McCallionAlex, it's John. Obviously, very recent news. I'm not so sure I saw a ton of reaction yesterday on it and nor do we really think that it has a broad-based impact on how we run our business or we wouldn't expect capital impacts, but I guess, you never know. But right now, we wouldn't expect any impact one way or the other. In terms of our how we run our investment portfolio and our outlooks there, doesn't change anything.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, for final remarks, I'd like to turn the call back to MetLife's Global Head of Investor Relations, John Hall.John Arthur HallWell, thank you, everybody, for joining us. And you know where to find us with any follow-up questions. Thanks very much, and have a good day.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

The top line beat the consensus mark by 8.8%.The better-than-expected second-quarter results were supported by higher investment returns, volume growth across some segments and improved contributions from the U.S. and EMEA businesses.

Extreme heat is contributing to this unwelcome price spike.The problem is that refineries, like humans, can’t handle persistently sweltering temperatures.When temperatures soar to 100 or even 110 degrees Fahrenheit, these complex facilities can’t churn out all the gasoline consumers want or need. And that loss of supply is occurring just as demand is at or near a peak this summer driving season.“Refineries break down in extreme heat. It’s like running an engine at very hot temperatures for a long time,” said Tom Kloza, president of the Oil Price Information Service.As refineries have suffered outages, pump prices have soared. The national average for regular gasoline has climbed by 30 cents over just the past month alone to $3.83 a gallon, according to AAA.Ironically, all of this shows that not even oil and gas companies — an industry that scientists blame in part for global warming — are immune from the consequences of the climate crisis. And consumers are suffering the consequences as gas prices rise, a development that threatens to undo some of the progress made on the inflation front across the economy.Saudi Arabia and Russia restrain supplyOf course, extreme heat is not the sole factor behind the gas price jump. Oil prices continue to be the main driver of retail pump prices.And since mid-June, US oil prices have climbed by 22%, reflecting easing recession fears and promises by Saudi Arabia and Russia to restrain supply.Saudi Arabia on Thursday announced plans to extend a 1-million-barrel-per-day voluntary supply cut for another month and threatened to do even more this fall. Russia also announced plans to slash oil exports by 300,000 barrels per day in September.Still, high heat is clearly piling pressure on gas prices.In the Middle East, extreme temperatures are forcing some nations to burn oil to keep the lights on and meet demand for air conditioning.Story continuesIn Texas, Louisiana and elsewhere along the Gulf Coast, some refineries have been forced to slow activity due to unscheduled maintenance.Why high heat mattersIn order to churn out gasoline, jet fuel and diesel, refineries heat crude oil, sometimes to 900 or 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, to break the molecules down, according to Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates.After heating the oil, it must be cooled to get the finished product. Normally, that is a standard process, but everything changes in triple-digit temperatures that persist.“As it gets hotter outside, the cooling back down gets more and more difficult,” said Lipow.High heat can also snarl maintenance efforts at refineries.From a pure profit standpoint, refineries have every incentive to go all out right now. Profit margins are high, making it lucrative to maximize the production of gasoline, jet fuel and diesel.“Refineries are doing very, very well — if they can keep their operations going. The profit potential and the motivation is there to run as hard as you can,” said Kloza.Diesel prices surgeHowever, Kloza said most refiners that would like to run at 100% capacity are only able to run at 85% when it’s 100 degrees outside.This is a particular issue because refinery capacity has dropped in recent years, leaving little room for error.“There really is no slack in the system,” said Lipow.This situation has also helped drive up jet fuel and diesel prices. Diesel is a crucial fuel for the economy, powering trucks, boats and trains. Higher transportation costs will eventually get passed along to consumers.Retail diesel prices have surged by 31 cents a gallon over the past month, according to AAA. The futures market is signaling more gains to come for diesel.“Everyone gets really excited about high gas prices. But those fuels have an even more insidious impact on inflation,” Kloza said.The good news is there are signs the impact of high heat on gas prices may be easing.Even as retail prices continue to climb, wholesale prices for gasoline have flattened out.“I think we’re hitting a plateau,” said Kloza.Drivers should catch a break in the coming weeks as fuel demand typically drops in September when summer ends.Kloza said gas prices could just be pennies away from their peak of the summer.The one catch? If there’s a major hurricane, perhaps one strengthened by the unusually warm ocean temperatures, that threatens the Gulf Coast and its hub of refineries.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com]"

Please go ahead.Steve BakkeThank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's Second Quarter Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Finance.During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. We'll be observing a 2-question limit during the Q&amp;A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.Story continuesSumit RoyThank you, Steve. Welcome, everyone. We successfully executed on our strategy in the second quarter and continue to see momentum across the business. I would like to sincerely thank our one team whose focus and commitment continue to propel our business forward, serving all our clients and stakeholders. We believe the strength of our platform and quality of our real estate portfolio were evident in the quarter's results.Despite a challenging interest rate environment, AFFO per share grew 3.1% from last year to $1 per share. Combined with our dividend, we are pleased to have delivered a total operational return of over 8% on a trailing 12-month basis. Delivering stable and consistent growth is foundational to our mission at Realty Income. Underlying this growth, our team continues to source and invest in high-quality properties at accretive spreads to our cost of capital while partnering with our clients who are leaders in nondiscretionary low price point and service-oriented industries. Partnering with industry leaders across over 13,000 properties in a diversified real estate portfolio offers us durability of cash flows that results in the predictable nature of our revenues, earnings and dividend payments.Our investment activities remain robust as we continue to demonstrate that size and scale are unique advantages in the sale leaseback and portfolio transaction markets. In the second quarter, we closed on approximately $3.1 billion of high-quality real estate investments, which brings our year-to-date investment activity to over $4.7 billion. Cap rates in our acquisitions appear to have stabilized after a meaningful adjustment period to a higher interest rate environment. Though in select situations, we continue to find unique opportunities to source and close on larger transactions where our relationships, platform and access to capital allows us to take advantage of more favorable terms. Our second quarter initial cash lease yield of 6.9% represents a 120 basis point increase compared to the second quarter of 2022 and resulted in a realized investment spread of approximately 133 basis points when calculating our WACC on a leverage-neutral basis using the cost of equity and debt raised in the quarter. In addition to closing our $1.5 billion U.S. convenience store acquisition from the EG Group, we remained active internationally during the second quarter, closing on $416 million of investments at an initial cash lease yield of 7.1%.This international activity includes the addition of a new geographic vertical in Ireland where we acquired 2 properties for $54 million at healthy cash yields. Given the transaction velocity, we have achieved in the first half of the year, we are increasing our outlook for investments to over $7 billion for 2023. Year-to-date, we have acquired 15% of source investment volume compared to an average of 7% over the last 5 years. In today's more constrained environment for capital, we have found the size and scale of our platform have become increasingly meaningful differentiators as we seek accretive growth opportunities.Shifting to operations, our portfolio continues to perform, and we ended the quarter with occupancy of 99%, the third consecutive quarter at that level. This matches our highest occupancy at the end of a reporting period in over 20 years. Additionally, our rent recapture rates increased from last quarter to 103.4% across 201 new and renewed leases, bringing the year-to-date recapture rate to 102.7% across 377 new or renewed leases executed in the period.As further testament to the stability of our portfolio and the leading clients with whom we partner, our client watch list declined from last quarter and now represent less than 4% of our annualized rental revenue. This is the lowest level in the last 5 years. Finally, our same-store rental revenue increased 2.0% in the quarter, a tangible result of our purposeful decision to seek investment opportunities with higher internal growth characteristics as well as the benefit of uncapped CPI-based rent escalators, present in nearly 30% of the leases in our growing international portfolio. Our efforts to increasingly pursue leases with meaningful contractual rent escalators has helped contribute to a portfolio with contractual rent growth at approximately 1.5% per annum as of the second quarter, or 2% annual growth on a levered basis. Before turning it over to Christie, I would like to recognize the tremendous value she has brought to Realty Income, first as a Board member, and then as Chief Financial Officer. Her leadership and counsel through a very active period for our company has left a lasting positive mark as well. I would also like to congratulate Jonathan on his upcoming promotion to CFO. Christie?Christie B. KellyThank you, Sumit. It's an honor to serve our colleagues, Board and stakeholders during this exciting time at Realty Income. As we previously announced at the end of this year, I will be retiring as CFO and passing our CFO baton to Jonathan Pong, who is our current Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Finance. Jonathan has been with the company for the last 9 years and brings significant experience to the role, having overseen our capital markets, investor relations, FP&amp;A and derivatives functions during his time here.Over the last 2.5 years, since joining the management team, we have worked closely together as part of a planned succession and Jonathan is well positioned to carry the torch moving forward. With that, I would like to hand the call over to Jonathan to go over the financial results from our quarter.Jonathan PongThank you, Christie. I would be remiss without acknowledging your many contributions to the company and its stakeholders during your tenure. I'm grateful for your guidance, support and leadership all of which has laid the foundation for excellence as our business continues to evolve. Over my 9-year tenure at Realty Income, we have experienced significant growth in new industry verticals, geographies and property types. However, we've continued to view a reliable growing dividend and a well-capitalized balance sheet as critical components of our business.To that end, we finished the second quarter with healthy leverage as measured by net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA of 5.3x and our fixed charge coverage ratio remains solid at 4.6x. We are once again active issuers of equity capital via the ATM, raising approximately $2.2 billion in the aggregate in the second quarter, $651 million of unsettled forward equity remains outstanding as of today.As our platform has advanced and grown over time, our investment spread business has been supported by access to a wide range of products in the capital markets. Last month, we added another capital source to our inventory, raising EUR 1.1 billion through our debut public offering of euro-denominated unsecured bonds. This dual tranche offering resulted in a weighted average tenure of 9 years. And a weighted average annual yield to maturity of 5.08%.Establishing a presence in the euro unsecured bond market allowed us to diversify our fixed income investor base, and generate a natural hedge for yield denominated earnings and access of source of debt capital that was priced approximately 60 basis points inside of indicative U.S. dollar bond pricing at the time of execution. Proceeds from the offering effectively repaid short-term bonds on a multicurrency revolver and commercial paper programs, which had a combined balance of $990 million at quarter end. Combined with $254 million of cash on hand at quarter end and the $650 million of forward equity previously mentioned, we believe we are well capitalized with significant liquidity heading into the third quarter.Finally, from an earnings outlook perspective, the midpoint of our 2023 AFO per share guidance is unchanged, though we have narrowed the guidance range of $3.96 to $4.01, representing approximately 1.8% growth at the midpoint. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Sumit.Sumit RoyThank you, Jonathan. As our second quarter results illustrate, our company is well positioned to provide consistent results in a variety of economic environments and to grow through a variety of different acquisition channels. The optionality we have to toggle between different sources of capital is also a competitive advantage as it broadens our reach of investors and oftentimes provides a lower cost of capital alternative to the public U.S. dollar market.Looking at the S&amp;P 500 constituents within our addressable market, we count approximately 300 firms with $1.6 trillion of owned real estate. To quantify the near-term opportunity, which is available to us as sale-leaseback capital providers, this group has approximately $1.2 trillion of debt representing 34% of the group's outstanding debt capital maturing between 2024 and 2027. Meanwhile, corporate bond deals have risen anywhere between 240 and 400 basis points from the 2021 average to today. This compares to a 140 basis point increase in initial cash lease yield for Realty Income's investments over the same timeframe, making our capital solutions even more competitively priced on a relative basis than in the past.Because of this cost of capital convergence, and because of the many benefits sale-leaseback financing provides, including the elimination of maturity risk, we believe there is a more compelling case to be made than ever for corporates to look to sale leaseback financing to replace maturing debt. As the attractiveness of sale-leaseback financing accelerates for corporates with looming debt maturities and elevated debt costs, we believe our growth opportunities will continue to expand on a sustainable basis. At this time, we can open it up for questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions). And our first question will come from Nathan Crossett of BNP Paribas.Nathan Daniel CrossettMaybe just a question on guidance. Maybe you could just unpack -- you guys increased acquisition and volume guidance at the midpoint on AFFO remaining the same. Maybe you can just kind of go over the puts and takes there. And then also, what are you guys assuming for kind of cap rates in your guidance? I think we're down 10 basis points in the quarter. What's kind of the outlook of the pipeline right now?Sumit RoySo Nate, I'll take your second question first, and then I'll hand it off to Jonathan to talk about puts and takes with regards to the earnings guidance. With regards to the cap rate, we are assuming the cap rate to be within the ZIP code that we've announced in the second quarter and in the first quarter. That's where we believe where the cap rates have settled down. Opportunistically, there are situations that we could enter into where we could drive those cap rates higher. But for modeling purposes, I would request that you keep it within these ZIP codes that we've announced in the first and second quarter. Jonathan?Jonathan PongNate, on the guidance question, I would, first of all, say the midpoint of our guide is the same as the one at the start of the year. And so when you think about how we put guidance together, there's a lot of puts and takes that we look at, at the beginning of the year, reasons at every quarter. We know that on a probability-weighted basis, not all of the takes are going to happen or puts that going to happen, and so when you think about acquisition guidance increasing 2 quarters now, that was a scenario that we had expected at the start of the year, but there was always going to be puts and takes that could offset that a bit. I think the biggest one for us has been short-term interest rates.When you look at what was implied back in January and February on the SOFR forward curve, you compare that to what it is implying today about a 40 basis point increase. And so that alone is $0.01 per share for our business in the back half of the year. So I would say that, and there's also some other things that we always look at that, maybe we're taking a slightly more conservative view on over the second half of the year appropriately, but we feel very good about being more or less accurate from what we came out at the start of the year.Nathan Daniel CrossettOkay. That's helpful. Maybe just one on the debt rates are much lower in Europe. You did that recent bond deal. Can you just like talk about how much you could kind of theoretically raise over there to kind of take advantage of the better cost of capital? Are there any like hindrances like in terms of size?Jonathan PongYes, Nate. We're not going to go crazy and have significantly more liabilities denominated in one currency relative to the assets we have denominated in that same currency, especially when it's four denominated. And so for us, when we're going out and issuing in various currencies, we're thinking about the income statement, FX risk that we might have, and we're using the natural interest expense in that currency to serve as a hedge. If we don't have that, there's not a lot of reason for us to go out and do that type of issuance. We also know that we have a very active acquisition pipeline across all currencies. We know that we're going to need the capital at some point. really denominated in dollars, sterling or euro.So that's how we think about it. It was a 60 basis point pickup relative to comparable U.S. dollar, but for us, it's really about diversification. And so you can expect us to utilize everything in our toolkit going forward. But I think we are all set on the euro side, at least for the near term.OperatorThe next question comes from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank.Greg Michael McGinnissSo as always, I am interested in any larger portfolio deals. And we appreciate your opening remarks regarding the size of the potentially addressable S&amp;P 500 market. But have you noticed any material uptick in sale leaseback interest from those companies at this point? Or is that still developing potential?Sumit RoyI guess we have to post one of these large transactions per quarter. And I think we've done that. If you look at what we've done in the fourth quarter of last year, that's when we closed on the gaming asset, which was $1.7 billion. You look at the large portfolio deal we did in the first quarter, it was a CIM transaction. That was circa $900 million. And in the second quarter, we've announced the $1.5 billion and closed the $1.5 billion EG Group transaction.And look, the reason why we are sharing all of this data is to help support what we are seeing develop in our pipeline and the conversations that we are having currently. Now how much of that gets translated to close transactions, time will tell. But clearly, we are very optimistic. And that is one of the main drivers of why we have increased our guidance by another $1 billion in terms of acquisitions. So we just feel like I wish our cost of capital was slightly better. But in terms of actual transactions, we feel like the pipeline is robust and it's largely a function of what is happening in the debt capital market.Greg Michael McGinnissOkay. What are your thoughts on increasing maybe the level of tenant debt investments to push earnings growth higher and offset some of that cost of capital? It's not exactly where you want it.Sumit RoyWell, we think of ourselves as an investment company, Greg. So where we invest on the capital stack is always available for debate within the 4 walls of Realty Income. And wherever we feel like we can quantify the risk and underwrite the benefits of doing a sale leaseback versus doing a direct loan to one of our clients. We are going to go down the path of whichever yields the best risk-adjusted return. So yes, we haven't done one of those, but it is certainly up for discussion, and it's one that we have been discussing with my colleagues here at Realty Income.OperatorThe next question comes from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets.Bradley Barrett HeffernSumit, can you give your updated thoughts on how you feel about the theater business broadly right now? Obviously, AMC recently reported its best week, but then you have the strikes, which will theoretically start affecting things at some point and the release schedule is it back to normal. So are you feeling worse at this point or better given the recent strength?Sumit RoyYes. So Brad, I've always stated this about the theater business that it is largely a function of content. And as long as the content continues to develop and it goes back to levels that it was pre-pandemic, which was circa 70, 75 big tent type releases. We're going to get back to levels pretty close to the revenue levels that we had in 2019. And anytime you have situations like the one that you've just described, where you have a strike, it does obviously put a little bit of a breaker in terms of the ability of studios to continue to release those big tent movies.The good news in today's environment versus the last time there was a strike, which lasted if I remember correctly from -- for about 4 months. The good news today is, we've got a lot more studios beyond the big 4 that are releasing big budget movies and I'd put Amazon and Netflix in the mix there. But yes, all else being equal, a strike is not a good thing. We see this having a near-term impact, I don't think so because a lot of these movies have already been completed, and it's just a question of staging the release. But longer term, it could have a disruption on how many of these movies get released. And so we are watching this closely. I believe there's a meeting on Friday, where the studios are getting together with the riders and the actors and all of that. And my hope is that there's a resolution soon. And -- but yes, it is a situation that we are monitoring closely. But my expectation, if it is anything like what it was last time, this should resolve itself in the next couple of months.Bradley Barrett HeffernOkay. I appreciate that. And then can you give your expectations for the Cineworld sites that were rejected and maybe talk through some of the opportunities with those, whether it's just typical releasing or if there's a development opportunity for any of them?Sumit RoyYes. So Brad, I'm not going to give -- go into the details of the Cineworld situation just because we haven't quite penned the contract yet. What I will say is that any of the potential economic outcomes have been completely reflected in our updated earnings guidance. So that's how I'm going to leave it with the Cineworld situation. And I'll just add something to stuff that I've already talked about in the past, there will be a few assets that we expect to get back. And we have already started to look at what are the alternatives at those particular sites.And the gamut runs from a complete redevelopment of the site to an alternative use, i.e., industrial to situations where we have a retailer coming in and talking about potentially just taking the asset as is even though they're not movie theater operators to potentially re-entitling the asset for an alternative use and selling it, i.e., creating more value for ourselves. And the last bucket, we'll be just selling the asset as is. So all of those various permutations are being considered on a handful of assets that we expect will get rejected through this process, but I'm not going to go into any more detail than that.OperatorThe next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho.Haendel Emmanuel St. JusteSumit, I'd like to go back to a conversation we've had in the past on high-grade. You continue to source deals here with a lower share of high-grade than historically. And I know in the past, you've talked about that your experience in acquiring higher-yielding assets and you're focused on generating the best risk-adjusted returns. But this quarter, particularly, we had a big drop, but it continues the trend of having below average high grade. So I guess, is this a dynamic that we should just expect to continue going forward? Is this a new norm? How should we think about the share of high grade going forward?Sumit RoySure. Thank you for that question, Haendel. So just to continue to reiterate the point, we are not targeting investment grade. What we are targeting are opportunities that yield the best risk-adjusted return. If it so happens that it is an investment-grade client then so be it. But ultimately, it's the economic profile of that investment that's going to dictate as to whether or not we are going to invest.Today, truth be told, we are looking at some of these investment grade opportunities and cannot pencil the risk-adjusted returns. We are finding far more value in areas where we're looking at sub investment-grade tenants who are willing to give us a return profile that is commensurate with the inherent risk in that particular opportunity. And that's what's driving the approximately 26% year-to-date investment-grade closings that we've done and is closer to 18%, I think, for the second quarter. But that's how we think about the world.And the other thing I'd just point out is just to make it equivalent because I have seen some of these cap rates being reported and there's a bit of a mixed match. When we're talking about a 6.9% cash lease yield. If you layer in the straight line, we're talking about an additional 100 basis points. And I've seen certain reports that are sort of conflating these 2 numbers. So just to make it apples-to-apples, our straight line yields are closer to 7.9% on $3.1 billion worth of acquisitions. That's where we are seeing the value. with, I would argue, much better growth profile. And clearly, that's represented in the 100 basis points of increase when compared to cash yields.So that's how you should think about us, Haendel. And if it just so happens that this dynamic were to shift and suddenly investment grade was to go back to our 40%, 45% that we have in our portfolio then that will be it. But it's not something that we target, and you shouldn't expect us to be targeting that number going forward.Haendel Emmanuel St. JusteThat's really helpful. I appreciate the color there. And one more. I guess I wanted to get your updated thoughts on investing in gaming assets today. I know in the past, you've talked about having an interest. I'm curious if you're seeing anything out there today, that would interest you? What type of returns or incremental spreads you require there? And specifically, your potential or your level of interest in a potential Bellagio trade.Sumit RoySure. So again, I'm not going to talk about specifics, but I'll repeat what I've said in the past about our desire to grow our gaming vertical. We are obviously looking at many opportunities. And thankfully, it's a fairly robust environment today for gaming. And yes, in terms of how we're going to view these opportunities, it's along the lines of how I answered the previous question. So that's what you should expect from us for this particular vertical.OperatorThe next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein of Bank of America.Joshua DennerleinI just I saw your cap rates on looks like domestic acquisitions -- about [6.8.] And then for developments, it was like a [6.9.] 10 basis point spread seems kind of small. So just -- is that a function of kind of when deals were struck or just the risk profile the tenants or just something that you're seeing broadly in the market?Sumit RoyYes. Very good question, Joshua. As you know, when you enter into transactions that have a long duration associated with it, which is what development by its very definition, is going to have. It does become a function of when were those transactions entered into and what's the duration of that build-out period. And so what you might have noticed is, if you're tracking our development yields over the last few quarters, you've noticed a marked increase in those cash yields on developments. It's largely a function of when did we strike those.So things that you're starting to see filter through in the second quarter, which has a similar yield to what you saw on the domestic side, it's largely a function of us having entered into those transactions over the last 2 to 3 quarters when we were anticipating a much higher interest rate environment and therefore, being able to work with our clients to get that yield reflected in the development cycle. And you should continue to see that. Trends slightly higher looking into the next few quarters as some of the older generation development opportunities start to sort of get fully developed and become cash paying opportunities. So I think just keep a close eye on that and that's the trend you should see manifest itself over the next few quarters.Joshua DennerleinOkay. All right. That makes sense. And then I think Jonathan might have answered this, but I just wanted to clarify, the top end of guidance, it looks like you took down $0.02. Was it just the interest rate environment that's pushing down -- put downward pressure on that top range or anything else in there? Just curious, given acquisition guidance a bit so.Jonathan PongJosh, to address that, Sumit brought it up earlier, the impact of what we felt was the greatest uncertainty out there, the Cineworld resolution that impact is now that are known to us. And going into the quarter, it was something where there was a range of possibilities that we built into the high end and the low end. And so with a greater sense of confidence now where that's trending, we felt that it was appropriate to take the high end down by $0.02 in addition to bringing the low end up by 2.OperatorThe next question comes from Michael Goldsmith of UBS.Michael GoldsmithJonathan, you've been with Realty Income for a while, and I think you're developing a reputation for a creative solution from a financing perspective. But as you move into the CFO seat, is there anything different that you would think about doing in their new position or different approaches to what Realty is doing overall?Jonathan PongMichael, I appreciate the question. I would say, look, what's made Realty Income so successful over the years, regardless of what we've done, what verticals we've established. It's commitment to a fortress balance sheet. And that's the one thing that is going to be sacrosanct to us for as long as we're in existence in these seats. And so we're not going to sacrifice things like the A3 minus credit rating that we worked very hard to get. We're not going to sacrifice the trust of the fixed income community that now spans across 3 of the currencies. And so you're going to see us continue to focus on low leverage, plenty of liquidity and we're going to be very predictable from that standpoint.I think going forward, given the added complexity of the business, the volume, the transaction volume that we see, the different countries that we're in, and we'll continue to be in, I think it's really more of a focus on more of the internal operations though. The external side of things, I think we're pretty well established. We're going to continue to be creative. But I think it's about building and continuing this momentum on the internal platform that we've created, which we think is a differentiator in the net lease industry and frankly, in the real estate industry.Michael GoldsmithAnd Sumit, you mentioned your size and scale as a competitive advantage, at least twice, if not 3x on the call. Do you feel like your competitive advantage is growing? Are you seeing fewer bidders on some of the larger deals out there? Is that gap and the strength of the size and scale, is that improving and widening versus peers?Sumit RoyThanks for the question, Michael. I might have actually said it 4 times. I'm not sure. I just believe in it so much. And it's really not something that we believe. It's what we are hearing. When we are engaging in these conversations with clients who are big clients who have big questions that they're trying to answer. It's the fact that who gets invited to the table. And when we see that we are the only REIT in the net lease space at the table competing against private sources of capital, that in itself gives us continued confidence that we are playing a game that is very different from some of our smaller peers.And we want to be that. We want to be the real estate partners of choice for the S&amp;P 500 names. We want to be the first name that is considered when we -- when folks think about -- they have the ability to write big checks. They have the ability to stand by what it is they say. Their reputation speaks for itself and their ability to close is -- are none. And when we hear those comments from clients who work with us and more recently with some of our new clients who have been added to our registry, it gives us continued confidence to say that our scale and size is being appreciated within this space.OperatorThe next question comes from Eric Wolfe of Citi.Eric WolfeJust wanted to follow up on Greg's question. When you look at your S&amp;P peers, just curious what percentage would you say are receptive to the sale-leaseback conversation? And how has that changed versus a couple of years ago? Just trying to understand how your addressable market has changed. And for those that perhaps aren't as receptive, what's the typical pushback?Sumit RoyI can't give you percentages, Eric. But what I can point to is just look at some of the larger transactions we've done and who have we done it with. And they're all first time sale leaseback candidates, right? Think about [Wynd.] They were -- they've never done a sale leaseback before, and they chose to do it with us. Think about EG Group, they've never done a sale leaseback before. Their best chance of doing a sale leaseback was when they actually ended up being the winners in the Cumberland Farms portfolio. This was 3, 4 years ago. And they chose not to do it at that time.And so part of the reason why I believe that sale leaseback as a product is maturing, is certainly driven by the capital markets environment that we find ourselves in and suddenly finding that sale leaseback as an alternative to raise capital is quite beneficial vis-a-vis as we were traditionally being compared to the debt capital markets, especially for names that are lower investment grade or sub-investment-grade candidates. And so I believe that, that will continue. And there will be other transactions that we hope to get over the finish line that we can speak to. That will again be first-time candidates. And yes, we feel like that, that will continue to grow.Eric WolfeThat's helpful. And then you look at the 10-year or whatever interest rate you want to look at and it's up pretty meaningfully over the last couple of weeks. When you see moves like this and how quickly will you adjust your pricing on future acquisitions or potentially even [retrade] some deals, just trying to understand how sort of real-time capital market volatility changes return all those?Sumit RoyYes. So Eric, I'm going to have Jonathan talk a little bit about things that we try to do to anticipate what I'll call unanticipated movements in 10 years, okay? We've talked about a hedging strategy that we have in place. But I just want to make one point very clear. Our cost of capital gets mark-to-market pretty much by the second. That's not how cap rates move. There is absolutely a lag time, how sticky these movements, these upward movements and the cost of capital. People have a different opinion about how sticky that is and that drives their view around what cap rates should be. And it does take time for people to adjust to a higher cost of capital environment. And if there's a lot of volatility that makes that adjustment period that much more difficult.So yes, we've seen movements on the 10-year from [386 to 417, 418] today within a matter of days, you're not going to see a 30 basis point movement in cap rates to reflect this movement in 10 years, unless we see that this 4.7, I mean, 4.17, 4.2 become a more sustainable rate. But then what do we do balance sheet perspective to sort of anticipate those situations? I'll have Jonathan speak to that.Jonathan PongThanks, Sumit. We've been very active on the hedging front, both for FX, which I alluded to earlier, but also on the interest rate front. If you look at the 10-Q from the first quarter, you'll see that we actually purchase swaptions, which really go out until January of next year that protects us against rising rates on the tender. The reason why we chose a billion, the reason why we went out to January is because we do have some debt maturities coming up of around $1 billion, $1.1 billion in the first quarter of next year. We put those hedges in place in late March, early April and as far as you might imagine, it's pretty healthily in the money right now. So from that standpoint, we've taken out the primary balance sheet risk or refi risk that we have coming up over the 6 to 9 months, but we're always going to look for opportunities where we see a risk, we want to be proactive. We can't time the market, but what we can do is mitigate the exposure that we have on potential risk.And so -- that's something that we've done now twice, and the first time we did it was the middle of pandemic, and we were able to monetize that (inaudible) swap at a $72 million gain. We're not always going to be so fortunate, but that's how we're thinking about managing risk.OperatorThe next question comes from Wes Golladay of Baird.Wesley Keith GolladayCan you talk about what's going on in the U.K., it looks like volume was low. I'm just curious if this is a function of just low deal volume? Or is it just pricing just lagging still over there?Sumit RoyYes. Neil needs to work a little bit harder, I think. It really is a timing issue as we had some great momentum towards the end of last year driven by pressures that funds were experiencing on the redemption side and it created some amazing opportunities for us. That momentum continued into the first quarter. Second quarter was still very healthy. We did about $420 million which is a big number, but it's just -- it got dominated by what we did on the U.S. side, largely driven by the $1.5 billion.If you take that $1.5 billion away, and you look at what we've done, we were at $1.6 billion, of which the European -- the international business represented, I would say, trying to do a quick math right around 30%. So -- and that's generally been where the international business has contributed. But look, I'm very excited about that business, and there's more to come.Wesley Keith GolladayOkay. It sounds good. And yes, good job, Neil. That's actually good volume was adjusted. I guess next question is more bigger picture. I'm kind of curious what your opinion would be, what is the bigger risk to net lease? Would it be inflation and potentially having this price escalators or to be tenant credit at this point of the cycle?Sumit RoyI would think it's tenant credit. You'll have to look at all of the various different net lease businesses and take a view on where do you see the credit risk largely driven by these inflationary pressures, the persistence of those inflationary pressures which then obviously is resulting in this higher interest rate environment. I think that's going to sort of filter through and it will impact net lease businesses, net lease companies differently depending on the makeup of where their exposure lies.For me, one of the advantages that we have is, do we -- can we perfectly match inflation with -- of the inherent growth rates that we have, we can't. So there's always going to be a bit of a mismatch. But have we, and now I'm talking about Realty Income done a much better job of growing the inherent growth profile of our leases, the answer is a categorical yes. Today, when I think it was part of my prepared remarks, our overall portfolio, if you were to do nothing, we'll grow by 1.5% and on a levered basis closer to 2%. Some of it is actually benefited from non-capped CPIs that we've been able to get on 1/3 of the assets that have CPI growth rates built into them in the international markets. And those have contributed greatly to increasing our inherent growth rate.So it's never going to be perfectly matched, but the risk of not having a perfectly matched growth rate inherent in your leases is somewhat muted versus credit risks that could translate into much bigger impact on your overall business.OperatorThe next question comes from Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley.Ronald KamdemJust two quick ones. Staying on the tenant credit risk. So I see occupancy 99, median EBITDA, it looks like it ticked up 2.8% versus 2.7% last quarter. And I know that's reported with a lag, but still pretty interesting. And I think in your opening comments, you mentioned that basically the watchlist was the lowest sort of ever. So things are certainly feeling pretty good. But as you sort of look forward, when you hear stuff like student loans starting again for property insurance in Florida. Just sort of curious, how does your team sort of stress test that or think about that, what the potential impact did have on the tenant side?Sumit RoyYes. Good question, Ronald. And just to clarify, it was in the last 5 years that I said that our credit watchlist is in the 3s. It's the lowest been in the last 5 years. Those are very good questions. What is it when student loans get instituted back again and discretionary income falls? What are the first things to go? It's going to be discretionary spend, right? And if you look at the portfolio that we've created that largely consists of nondiscretionary low price point service-oriented businesses, these are things that will be the last to go. Could they be impacted? Of course, they can.But when you have discretionary income that is getting compressed, those are not going to be the types of businesses that will get impacted first. And that's how we've constituted our portfolio of assets is being very much focused on what are the industries that are going to be a lot more resilient under economic conditions like the one that we are facing today. So it is not by luck that we find ourselves with a credit watch list that is circa 3.7%. It is by design. And that's how we run our business, Ronald.Ronald KamdemGreat. And then my second one was just -- so going back to guidance a little bit and taking a step back thinking about this year, just can you -- what are the sort of big two or three sort of comp issues that the guidance was facing this year. I think you hit on one, which is the interest cost sort of headwind, right, for this year? But presumably, that's not going to be an issue for '24 because the comp just is not as tough. But was there anything else sort of onetime or unique to this year, it could be property tax, it could be whatever that we should be mindful of -- for '23 that maybe does not sort of happen again in '24?Jonathan PongRon, it's Jonathan. I'll say -- I'll expand on what I said earlier regarding short-term rates. We talked about the impact to the back half of this year. But when you really zoom out and you look at year-over-year versus all of 2022 versus 2023, it's even a greater impact. It's closer to $0.07 or $0.08, which based off the midpoint of our guide is about 2%. And so you take that out on a normalized basis, the volume that we're doing, everything that we're doing from a portfolio and asset management standpoint, we're trending closer to a 5% number year-over-year if you were at 3.1% this quarter.The first quarter did have a little bit of a tougher comp, if you recall the first quarter of 2022. We did have a significant reserve reversal in the theater industry. So that's why the first quarter was a little bit flat. Second quarter outside of rates is getting back more towards a normalized level. So back half of the year, I think you'll continue to see some difficult comps on the SOFR front. And given that we do have even an 8%, 10% exposure to variable rates, just given the magnitude of the move, that's going to be the biggest difference.OperatorThe next question comes from Linda Tsai of Jefferies.Linda TsaiJust going back to your comment regarding the stickiness of cap rates, the investment spread of 133 basis points. How does that vary between international and domestic investments? And where would you see investment spreads in those two categories trending?Sumit RoyYes. If you actually follow the headline cap rates that we are registering, I think the international business was 20 basis points higher. So that should answer your question, Linda. But again, this is going to be very much a product-by-product opportunity-by-opportunity discussion in terms of what is the actual spread that we are going to realize, and is there an advantage between the domestic markets and the international markets. I think the advantages are very different. Here in the U.S. market, there's clearly more competition, there are more players. In the international markets, we don't experience that.The U.S. market, however, is a much more mature sale-leaseback market. And so there are more opportunities that one can participate in. Whereas I would say the international market is still in the nascent stages of sale leaseback as a viable product. It is maturing, but it is behind the curve.And for us, what we want to try to do is position ourselves in both these markets and work from our points of strength that allows us to then win transactions. Our average has been 150 basis points of spread from the time we've been tracking spreads. And first quarter, it was 200 basis points based on realized capital that we raised to actually help finance our business. This quarter, based on, again, the same method, it's 133 basis points. So if you average out year-to-date, it's still north of what our 150 basis points historical average has been. But it's very difficult, Linda to tell you, going forward, you're going to have one geography that is going to dominate the spread versus another. It's very much opportunity-driven.Linda TsaiGot it. And then I think you said 30% of your international leases have uncapped CPI. What is the nature of those tenants that are open to that versus the other 70% of leases that don't have uncapped?Sumit RoyYes, Linda, let me be a bit more precise, of the international leases that have CPI as the driver of internal growth, 1/3 or 30% of them are uncapped. So not all of our leases in the international markets have CPI drivers of internal growth. So I just want to make that clarification. And again, it is very much a function of the market. A market that is used to seeing CPI growth as the metric for -- in their leases, they're far more receptive to continuing to see that. Now there has been some pushback given just the sheer magnitude of inflation that's being experienced in some of these markets, and we are trying to be commercial about that.But it's very difficult, suddenly to go to a client here who happens to be an investment-grade client and say, ""Sorry, we want CPI growth"", you're not going to get that. So yes, we see -- we tend to see more uncapped CPI growth in the international markets than we do here. And yes, but that too is evolving.OperatorThe next question comes from Harsh Hemnani of Green Street.Harsh HemnaniSumit, you mentioned that in the past, sourcing, what you close is roughly 7% of what you've sourced. And this quarter, it was closer to 15%. Do you worry at all if the net lease transaction market sort of continues to remain in liquid and at Realty Income, you're closing $5 billion to $7 billion annually, that you might not have the luxury to be as selective as you were in the past and maybe you have to execute on your second or third best idea. How are you thinking about that looking over the next 12 months?Sumit RoyWell, the good news, Harsh, is that we haven't gone to executing on our second or third best ideas yet. We're very fortunate. Let me shed some light on this 15% closing rather than what we've traditionally done, which is the 7% to 10%. What is skewing this is clearly the $1.5 billion transaction that we closed on in the second quarter, but it's not reflected in the denominator in the sourcing volume of $15 billion. We had sourced that asset, I would say, probably in the fourth quarter of last year. So that's where the mismatch occurs. In some ways the sourcing volume is much more real time, what did we see? And there is generally a lag between when we engage in a conversation, i.e., when it is sourced versus when does that particular transaction get over the finish line or closes. And I think that lag sometimes does create this mismatch.So if we were to sort of take away the $1.5 billion and then look at the $1.6 billion that we ended up closing in a year that -- in a quarter where we source $15 billion, $16 billion, that's still 10%. So I think that's probably the way to think about this mismatch that we saw in the second quarter.Harsh HemnaniOkay. That's helpful. And then the $1.6 trillion that you provided that there's $1.6 trillion of commercial real estate on S&amp;P 500 company balance sheet. How much of that is real estate that you would actually want to have in your portfolio. So I imagine you're not actively acquiring office assets. Could you share how much of that is maybe retail gaming, et cetera, that you might go after?Sumit RoyYes, that's a great question, Harsh, and we did that when we talk about $4 trillion here in the U.S. and $8 trillion in Europe. And just to be also super clear about this particular statistics that we shared in the prepared remarks. It does not include other real estate companies. It does not include certain sectors like finance companies, banks, energy companies, et cetera, et cetera. These are operating businesses that have assets.And an easy way to think about it is, let's assume that half of it is office. Let's assume that another 20% of it is something that we wouldn't want. Even if it is 20% or 30% of this $1.6 trillion, that is a massive number. And the point is that these are companies that are going to have to refinance their debt, this $1.2 trillion of debt over the next 3 years. It's maturing over the next 3 years. And sale leaseback should be a conversation that is appealing to them, especially given the cost of doing a sale leaseback today in this environment versus the cost of refinancing that a lot of these companies are going to experience. That's really the point.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sumit Roy for any closing remarks.Sumit RoyThank you all for joining us today. We're looking forward to seeing many of you at the various conferences this fall. Have a good rest of your summer. Bye-bye.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.]"

50,9aa58921-bc5f-3700-a0b1-e612b94927b2,CRM,2023-08-04,30 Drunkest Cities in America in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/30-drunkest-cities-america-2023-130844516.html,1691068124,STORY,"['ABI', 'BUD', 'CRM']","[In this article, we are going to discuss the 30 drunkest cities in America in 2023. You can skip our detailed analysis of the economic cost of excessive drinking, the effects of Covid-19 on drinking habits, the pharmaceutical treatment for heavy drinking, and the workplace drinking culture, and go directly to 10 Drunkest Cities in America in 2023. Alcohol is the most widely used drug in America, but in some areas drinking is more prevalent and an essential part of the local culture. Canadian health officials issued revised government recommendations for alcohol consumption recently, changing the low risk level from two drinks per day to two drinks per week. Health officials further said that no amount is safe and strongly suggested that citizens cut out alcohol altogether.There is a substantial amount of evidence that suggests that any alcohol consumption, however moderate, can have negative health consequences. Even low levels of drinking can increase the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, and even certain types of cancer. Understanding that there is no such thing as risk-free drinking, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – while not going so far as its Canadian counterpart – defines moderate drinking as 2 drinks or less per day for men and no more than one drink per day for women. Still, despite the well-publicized health risks, more than two-thirds of adult drinkers regularly exceed those levels.The Economic Cost of Excessive Drinking: Excessive drinking cost the United States almost $250 billion in 2010 (Latest figures available by the CDC). Two of every $5 were paid by the government, and 75% of the cost was due to binge drinking – defined as consuming five or more drinks in a 2-hour period for men or four or more drinks for women. The median cost per state was $3.5 billion. Several evidence-based strategies can help reduce excessive drinking, including increasing alcohol excise taxes, limiting alcohol outlet density, and commercial host liability. Story continuesThe Effects of Covid-19: As the Covid-19 virus tightened its grip on the country in 2020, the hospitality industry took one of the biggest economic hits, but that didn’t mean it became harder to get a drink. With almost every state relaxing its alcohol laws in 2020 in an effort to keep local economies afloat, it was even easier to kick back with a drink after a bad day. All but three states gave liquor stores a lockdown exemption, with many classifying the business – along with grocery stores and pharmacies – as an essential service. In the first few weeks of the lockdown, alcohol sales for off-premise locations jumped 54% and online alcohol sales had increased by 262% compared to sales data from the same week in 2019. From March to September 2020, there were $41.9 billion in liquor store sales, representing an increase of 20% from the same period the previous year. Pharmaceutical Treatment: Naltrexone is an FDA-approved drug used to treat alcohol use disorder and opioid dependence. One of the companies manufacturing naltrexone is Mallinckrodt plc (NYSE:MNK), which sells it under the brand name Depade. Although Mallinckrodt plc (NYSE:MNK)’s growing portfolio of specialty pharmaceuticals helped treat a variety of health conditions, the company got caught in an opioid controversy and agreed to pay $1.6 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits last year, over its role in the opioid crisis. The stock price of Mallinckrodt plc (NYSE:MNK) has plunged by over 80% this year. Workplace Drinking Culture: According to the Institute for Work &amp; Health, employees at companies that most discouraged social drinking were 45% less likely to be heavy drinkers than those in workplaces with the most liberal attitudes to drinking, after taking into account other factors that influence drinking levels. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a company that famously banned alcohol from in-office events back in 2016. Soberforce is an employee-led resource group within Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) that was started with the goal to provide a community and connection for sober employees, support people with addiction issues and destigmatize addiction. Soberforce holds regular virtual meetings and leads conversation threads on Slack, which is made available to all of 75,000 global employees of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). If you want to check out which countries drink the most alcohol, please read Top 20 Alcohol Drinking Countries in the World. With that said, here are the 30 Drunkest American Cities in 2023. 30 Drunkest Cities in America in 2023Copyright: dmitrymoi / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodology:To collect data for this article, we have referred to the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps, the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, looking for Cities With the Highest Rates of Excessive Drinking. The excessive drinking rate measures the percentage of a city’s adult population that reports binge or heavy drinking in the past 30 days. To keep our list more relevant, we have only kept it limited to larger cities with populations of 200,000 or more. When two cities had the same excessive drinking rate, we ranked them by the percentage of driving deaths with alcohol involved. If you’re also interested in reading which states drink the most amounts of beer, please refer to 25 U.S. States With the Highest Beer Consumption per Capita.  30.

These energy incentive initiatives reward participants who can be flexible when they use energy and help reduce the state's emissions footprint.""Energy incentive programs are a win-win for participants, putting money back in their pockets and positioning them to make a difference, banding together with others in the state to relieve stress on the grid and help prevent rotating outages,"" said Jason Glickman, PG&amp;E, Executive Vice President, Engineering, Planning and Strategy. ""There is also a real environmental benefit, as these programs help to shift substantial energy use to times when more clean generation is powering the state's electric grid.""SmartAC Smart Thermostat ProgramSmartAC Smart Thermostat is a voluntary program implemented by Uplight that rewards customers for being flexible with their air conditioning (AC) load during the most high-demand hours. By allowing adjustments to their thermostat schedule so their AC uses less energy during high-demand hours in coordination with thousands of other customers, participants can earn money and help prevent power interruptions while maintaining comfortable temperatures in their homes.Story continuesCustomers can enroll in Smart Thermostat under the SmartAC program. On extreme heat days between June 1-Oct. 31 when PG&amp;E anticipates there will be a high demand for energy, the Smart Thermostat program will automatically shift a portion of participants' energy use out of the hours when most people are using their AC to keep homes comfortable without contributing to stress on the grid. Enrolled customers may opt out of any event simply by changing the setpoint on their thermostat.Participants who enroll with an existing smart thermostat receive $75 when they sign up, or enrollees can receive $120 off a new smart thermostat. All participants are eligible to receive $25 at the end of the SmartAC season.The program is open through the end of this year to PG&amp;E electric service customers with at least one Wi-Fi enabled smart thermostat that is always connected to a central AC and a Wi-Fi network. There is a limit of one enrollment reward per household, and participants may not be enrolled in another energy incentive program implemented by PG&amp;E or a third-party vendor.""We are excited to be approaching 100,000 participants in the SmartAC Smart Thermostat program—we expect to reach that milestone in the coming weeks. Energy incentive programs like SmartAC Smart Thermostat and Power Saver Rewards are important, because they put the power in the hands of our customers. Making small changes to when they use energy can make a big impact for our hometowns and our planet,"" said Glickman.Power Saver Rewards ProgramPower Saver Rewards is a free program offered by PG&amp;E that rewards participants for temporarily reducing energy use when the demand for electricity is high.By conserving energy during Power Saver Rewards events coinciding with a CAISO Flex Alert and/or an Energy Emergency Alert Watch between May 1-Oct. 31, customers earn $2 for each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of energy saved. Last year, PG&amp;E customers received over $55 million in bill credits. Over the 10 event days in 2022, the average customer bill credit for program participants was $35.Currently, more than 1.6 million customers are enrolled in the program, initiated by the California Public Utilities Commission. Customers who reduce energy use between 4-9 p.m. on event days receive an automatic credit on their energy statement after the program season ends. Notifications to customers to reduce energy use as part of the program are sent out the day before an event. There is no penalty for not reducing energy.PG&amp;E electric customers with a SmartMeter not enrolled in a conflicting peak hour program are eligible to participate. Most customers enrolled in a Community Choice Aggregator can also join. Customers can disenroll from the program at any time through the program website.Additional Resources to Help Manage Summer Energy BillsIn addition to financial and bill assistance resources, PG&amp;E offers a variety of programs to help customers manage their summer energy costs:Personalized Rate Comparison supports customers by providing the best rate plan options for their household, which can help save money on energy bills.Budget Billing averages customers' monthly energy costs to help monthly payment amounts remain more consistent, even if energy use changes significantly from season to season.Bill Forecast Alerts are notifications sent by email, text or phone notifying customers if their monthly bill is expected to exceed a specific amount set by the customer, based on how they are using energy.Home Energy Checkup is a free service that helps customers assess their energy use and gives customized savings tips.HomeIntel is a free energy saving program that includes a Smart Audit and a personal energy coach.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.14 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Motorola shares have added about 11.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 17.6%.What's Next for Motorola?While Motorola has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Motorola: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future.

Details regarding these non-GAAP adjustments and the use of non-GAAP measures are included later in this news release.Story continuesOTHER SELECTED FINANCIAL RESULTSRevenue - Sales were $2.4 billion, up 12% from the year-ago quarter driven by growth in North America and International. Revenue from acquisitions was $20 million and currency headwinds were $23 million in the quarter. The Products and Systems Integration segment grew 12%, driven by growth in Land Mobile Radio Communications (""LMR"") and Video Security and Access Control (""Video""). The Software and Services segment grew 13%, driven by growth in LMR, Command Center and Video.Operating margin - GAAP operating margin was 21.6% of sales, up from 16.7% in the year-ago quarter and Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.7% of sales, up 350 basis points from 23.2% in the year-ago quarter. The increase in both GAAP and Non-GAAP operating margin was driven by higher sales, inclusive of higher pricing, lower direct material costs, and improved operating leverage.Taxes - The GAAP effective tax rate was 23.4%, down from 23.7% in the year-ago quarter. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.9%, up from 22.3% in the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by a higher UK tax rate in the current year.Cash flow - Operating cash flow was $93 million, compared to $10 million in the year-ago quarter and free cash flow was $40 million compared to a usage of $49 million in the year-ago quarter. Both the operating cash flow and free cash flow for the quarter increased primarily due to higher earnings, net of non-cash charges and improved working capital, partially offset by higher cash taxes.Capital allocation - During the quarter, the company repurchased $224 million of shares, paid $148 million in cash dividends, and incurred $53 million of capital expenditures.Backlog - The company ended the quarter with record Q2 backlog of $14.3 billion, up 6% or $856 million from the year-ago quarter. Products and Systems Integration segment backlog was up $496 million, or 11%, driven primarily by strong LMR demand. Software and Services segment backlog was up $360 million or 4%, driven by an increase in multi-year software and services contracts in North America, partially offset by revenue recognition for the Airwave contract and a reduction related to the exit from the ESN contract.NOTABLE WINS AND ACHIEVEMENTSSoftware and Services$34M video order for the Virginia State Police, which included our largest ever in-car video order$15M LMR service agreement with City of Baltimore, MD$13M LMR managed services agreement renewal in Latin America$12M command center order for a U.S. federal customer$8M LMR service agreement with a U.S. federal customerProducts and Systems Integration$145M P25 system upgrade for Kern County, CA$41M P25 system and device order for a U.S. federal customer$31M P25 system expansion for Ventura County, CA$19M P25 device order for a U.S. federal customer$6M fixed video order for a U.S. healthcare customerBUSINESS OUTLOOKThird quarter 2023 - The company expects revenue growth of approximately 6%, compared to the third quarter of 2022. The company expects non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.99 to $3.04 per share. This assumes approximately 172 million fully diluted shares and a non-GAAP effective tax rate between 23% and 24%.Full-year 2023 - The company now expects revenue in the range of $9.875 billion to $9.900 billion, up from its prior guidance of $9.725 billion to $9.775 billion, and non-GAAP EPS of between $11.40 and $11.48 per share, up from its prior guidance of between $11.21 and $11.29 per share. This outlook assumes approximately $25 million in foreign exchange headwinds, approximately 172 million fully diluted shares and a non-GAAP effective tax rate between 23% and 24%.The company has not quantitatively reconciled its guidance for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics to their most comparable GAAP measures because the company does not provide specific guidance for the various reconciling items as certain items that impact these measures have not occurred, are out of the company’s control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial metric is not available without unreasonable effort. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the company’s results.RECENT EVENTSCMA UPDATEIn October 2021, the United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (the ""CMA"") announced that it had opened a market investigation into the Mobile Radio Network Services market. This investigation included Airwave, the company's private mobile radio communications network that it acquired in 2016. Airwave provides mission-critical voice and data communications to emergency services and other agencies in Great Britain.On April 5, 2023, the CMA issued its final decision which stated it will impose a prospective price control on Airwave. The company strongly disagrees with the CMA’s final decision and it filed an appeal with the Competition Appeal Tribunal (""CAT"") on June 5, 2023. On July 31, 2023, the CMA adopted a remedies order which implements the price control set out in its final decision; however, the remedies order has been suspended until the CAT’s judgment on the company’s appeal. The CAT appeal hearing took place on August 2 and 3, 2023. Depending on the outcome, further appeals may occur throughout 2023 and 2024.Based on the adoption of the remedies order, beginning August 1, 2023, revenue under the Airwave contract will be recognized in accordance with the prospective price control until a successful appeal. Further, as a result of the issuance of a final decision from the CMA during the quarter ended July 1, 2023, the company has tested its Airwave asset group for impairment, noting the assets are expected to be recoverable.MACROECONOMIC EVENTSSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has navigated disruptions in its supply chain, in particular challenges in procuring certain semiconductor components along with diminished transportation capacity and higher freight costs. During 2023 the company experienced gradual improvement in the market conditions influenced by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the inflationary cost environment, particularly with respect to availability of materials in the semiconductor market. Where appropriate, the company has taken pricing actions around its product and service offerings to mitigate its exposure to inflationary pressures and benefited from these adjustments during the first half of 2023, and expects to continue to benefit from such adjustments in the second half of 2023. The company continues to remain focused on improving its supplier network, engineering alternative designs and working to reduce supply shortages and effectively manage costs. In addition, the company continues to actively manage its inventory in an effort to enable continuity of supply and services to its customers, which includes making changes that diversify the footprint of its supply chain operations. The company expects to maintain elevated levels of inventory until supply conditions stabilize.CONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST Motorola Solutions will host its quarterly conference call beginning at 4 p.m. U.S. Central Time (5 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time) on Thursday, August 3. The conference call will be webcast live at www.motorolasolutions.com/investors/. An archive of the webcast will be available for a limited period of time thereafter.CONSOLIDATED GAAP RESULTS (presented in millions, except per share data)A comparison of results from operations is as follows:Q2 2023Q2 2022Net sales$2,403$2,140Gross margin$1,189$990Operating earnings$518$358Amounts attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. common stockholdersNet earnings$371$228Diluted EPS$2.15$1.33Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding172.6170.9USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATIONIn addition to the results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (""GAAP"") included in this news release, Motorola Solutions also has included non-GAAP measurements of results, including free cash flow, non-GAAP operating earnings, non-GAAP EPS, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP tax rate and organic revenue. The company has provided these non-GAAP measurements to help investors better understand its core operating performance, enhance comparisons of core operating performance from period-to-period and allow better comparisons of its operating performance to that of its competitors. Among other things, management uses these operating results, excluding the identified items, to evaluate the performance of its businesses and to evaluate results relative to certain incentive compensation targets. Management uses operating results excluding these items because it believes these measurements enable it to make better period-to-period evaluations of the financial performance of its core business operations. The non-GAAP measurements are intended only as a supplement to the comparable GAAP measurements and the company compensates for the limitations inherent in the use of non-GAAP measurements by using GAAP measures in conjunction with the non-GAAP measurements. As a result, investors should consider these non-GAAP measurements in addition to, and not in substitution for or as superior to, GAAP measurements.Reconciliations: Details and reconciliations of such non-GAAP measurements to the corresponding GAAP measurements can be found at the end of this news release.Free cash flow: Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. The company believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as the basis for comparing its performance and coverage ratios with other companies in the company's industries, although the company's measure of free cash flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. This measure is also used as a component of incentive compensation.Organic revenue: Organic revenue reflects net sales calculated under GAAP excluding net sales from acquired business owned for less than four full quarters. The company believes organic revenue provides useful information for evaluating the periodic growth of the business on a consistent basis and provides for a meaningful period-to-period comparison and analysis of trends in the business.Non-GAAP operating earnings, non-GAAP EPS and non-GAAP operating margin each excludes highlighted items, including share-based compensation expenses and intangible assets amortization expense, as follows:Highlighted items: The company has excluded the effects of highlighted items including, but not limited to, acquisition-related transaction fees, tangible and intangible asset impairments, reorganization of business charges, certain non-cash pension adjustments, legal settlements and other contingencies, gains and losses on investments and businesses, Hytera-related legal expenses, gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt and the income tax effects of significant tax matters, from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements because the company believes that these historical items do not reflect expected future operating earnings or expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's current operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance. For the purposes of management's internal analysis over operating performance, the company uses financial statements that exclude highlighted items, as these charges do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's current operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance.Hytera-Related Legal Expenses: On March 14, 2017, the company filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the ""Court"") against Hytera Communications Corporation Limited of Shenzhen, China; Hytera America, Inc.; and Hytera Communications America (West), Inc. (collectively, ""Hytera""), alleging trade secret theft and copyright infringement and seeking, among other things, injunctive relief, compensatory damages and punitive damages. On February 14, 2020, the company announced that a jury decided in the company's favor in its trade secret theft and copyright infringement case. In connection with this verdict, the jury awarded the company $345.8 million in compensatory damages and $418.8 million in punitive damages, for a total of $764.6 million. In a series of post-trial rulings in 2021, the Court subsequently reduced the judgment to $543.7 million, but also ordered Hytera to pay the company $51.1 million in pre-judgment interest and $2.6 million in costs, as well as $34.2 million in attorneys fees. The company continues to seek collection of the judgment through the ongoing legal process.On December 17, 2020, the Court held that Hytera must pay the company a forward-looking reasonable royalty on products that use the company’s stolen trade secrets, and on December 15, 2021, set royalty rates for Hytera's sale of relevant products from July 1, 2019 forward. On July 5, 2022, the Court ordered that Hytera pay into a third-party escrow on July 31, 2022, the royalties owed to the company based on the sale of relevant products from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2022. Hytera failed to make the required royalty payment on July 31, 2022. On August 1, 2022, Hytera filed a motion to modify or stay the Court’s previous July 5, 2022 royalty order. On August 3, 2022, the company filed a motion seeking to hold Hytera in civil contempt for violating the royalty order by not making the required royalty payment on July 31, 2022. Hytera made quarterly royalty payments on October 31, 2022, January 31, 2023, April 25, 2023 and July 25, 2023 into a third-party escrow. The amounts paid into escrow were de minimis and will not be recognized until all contingencies are resolved and amounts are released from escrow. On July 11, 2023, the Court denied Hytera's modification and stay motions and stated that it will consider the company's contempt motion on August 8, 2023, if Hytera has not yet made the deposit previously due on July 31, 2022, into the escrow account. The Court subsequently set the company's contempt motion for hearing on August 17, 2023.On August 2, 2022, Hytera appealed the Court’s judgment with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (the ""Court of Appeals"").The company filed its cross-appeal on August 5, 2022. The parties have now submitted all briefs and responses on Hytera's appeal and the company's cross-appeal. The Court of Appeals has not set an oral argument date yet.Separate from the company's litigation with Hytera, on May 27, 2020, Hytera America, Inc. and Hytera Communications America (West), Inc. each filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California (the ""Bankruptcy Court""). On February 11, 2022, the Court entered an order to confirm the liquidation plan for the two Hytera entities and the distributions were made on February 25, 2022 to the creditors, including $13 million to the company. On December 22, 2022, an additional distribution of $2 million was made to the Company as well as an assignment of various delinquent accounts receivable of the bankrupt Hytera entities. The gain was recorded to Other charges (income).Management typically considers legal expenses associated with defending the company's intellectual property as ""normal and recurring"" and accordingly, Hytera-related legal expenses were included in both the company's GAAP and non-GAAP operating income for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019. The company anticipates further expenses associated with Hytera-related litigation; however, as of 2020, the company believes that these expenses are no longer a part of the ""normal and recurring"" legal expenses incurred to operate its business. In addition, as any contingent or actual gains associated with the Hytera litigation are recognized, they will be similarly excluded from the company's non-GAAP operating income, consistent with the company's treatment of the $13 million of proceeds realized in Q1 2022. The company believes after the jury award, the presentation of excluding both Hytera-related legal expenses and gains related to awards better aligns with how management evaluates the company's ongoing underlying business performance.Share-based compensation expenses: The company has excluded share-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements. Although share-based compensation is a key incentive offered to the company’s employees and the company believes such compensation contributed to the revenue earned during the periods presented and also believes it will contribute to the generation of future period revenues, the company continues to evaluate its performance excluding share-based compensation expenses primarily because it represents a significant non-cash expense. Share-based compensation expenses will recur in future periods.Intangible assets amortization expense: The company has excluded intangible assets amortization expense from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net earnings measurements primarily because it represents a non-cash expense and because the company evaluates its performance excluding intangible assets amortization expense. Amortization of intangible assets is consistent in amount and frequency but is significantly affected by the timing and size of the company’s acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to the company’s revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to the company’s future period revenues as well. Intangible assets amortization expense will recur in future periods.FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTSThis news release contains ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of applicable federal securities law.

While the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the top line missed the same despite the strength of the business model, revenue diversification and the ability to respond proactively to the evolving market scenario. Shares declined sharply post-earnings release owing to a relatively grim outlook due to limited market visibility and high channel inventory levels.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, net income in the June quarter declined to $1,803 million or $1.60 per share from $3,730 million or $3.29 per share in the prior-year quarter. The decrease in GAAP earnings was primarily attributable to top-line contraction.Quarterly non-GAAP net income came in at $2,105 million or $1.87 per share compared with $3,356 million or $2.96 per share in the year-ago quarter due to lower-than-expected revenues owing to soft demand trends. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents.QUALCOMM Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseQUALCOMM Incorporated price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | QUALCOMM Incorporated QuoteRevenuesOn a GAAP basis, total revenues in the fiscal third quarter were $8,451 million compared with $10,936 million in the prior-year quarter. The quarterly revenues missed the consensus mark of $8,513 million. Despite solid automotive revenues, the top line decreased on soft demand patterns and elevated inventory levels owing to market uncertainty and macroeconomic woes. High inflationary pressures and soft economic recovery in China further compounded the problems. However, Qualcomm witnessed strong momentum in IoT across consumer, edge networking and industrial sectors, along with strength in Snapdragon portfolio within the automotive sector. Non-GAAP revenues in the reported quarter were $8,442 million compared with $10,928 million in the year-earlier quarter.Story continuesSegment ResultsQuarterly revenues from Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) declined 24% year over year to $7,174 million, as strength in the automotive platform was more than offset by lower demand in handsets and channel inventory drawdown within the IoT business. The segment’s revenues fell short of our revenue estimates of $7,263.2 million. Despite solid potential in the EDGE networking business that helps transform connectivity in cars, business enterprises, homes, smart factories, next-generation PCs, wearables and tablets, the company witnessed lower demand owing to an uncertain landscape.Automotive revenues rose 13% to $434 million, while handset and IoT revenues were down 25% and 24%, respectively, to $5,255 million and $1,480 million. This was the 11th consecutive quarter in which Qualcomm recorded double-digit growth in automotive revenues. EBT margin for the QCT segment decreased to 24% from 32%.Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL) revenues totaled $1,230 million, down 19% year over year due to lower licensing revenues. The segment’s revenues exceeded our estimates of $1,210.6 million. EBT margin declined to 66% from 71%.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityQualcomm generated $2,657 million of net cash from operating activities in the fiscal third quarter compared with $2,895 million a year ago, bringing the respective tallies for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 to $7,209 million and $7,650 million. At quarter-end, the company had $6,087 million in cash and cash equivalents and $14,530 million of long-term debt. The company repurchased 4 million shares for $400 million during the quarter.Q4 GuidanceFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, Qualcomm expects GAAP revenues of $8.1-$8.9 billion due to rapid deterioration in demand and high channel inventory. Management expects the uncertain macroeconomic outlook, high inflation and a slower recovery in China to adversely impact demand as customers remain cautious with their purchasing decisions, further leading to inflated inventory levels. Non-GAAP earnings are projected to be $1.80-$2.00 per share, while GAAP earnings are likely to be $1.37-$1.57 per share. Revenues from QTL are expected to be between $1.15 billion and $1.35 billion.

The profit upside came despite a continued slowdown in sales of Amazon Web Services as the company lost market share to Microsoft and Google.Amazon stock popped on Thursday and continued to surge by as much as 10% in early trading on Friday.The e-commerce giant reported a relatively small — but vital — beat for revenue in its cloud business, Amazon Web Services, or AWS, with sales coming in at $22.14 billion compared to the $21.71 billion that Wall Street was anticipating.Additionally, Amazon's third quarter revenue outlook was a striking beat, coming in between $138 billion and $143 billion, ahead of the $138.3 billion expected.Currently, cloud results are top of mind for tech investors, as the sector is in the midst of a slowdown with an uncertain future. For now, investors appear to be pleased in the profit line. Whether that is sustained is unclear.The earnings rundownNet Sales: $134.38 billion actual versus $131.63 billion estimated (guidance: $127 billion to $133 billion)Diluted EPS: $0.65 versus $0.35 estimatedAmazon Web Services (AWS) Net Sales: $22.14 billion versus $21.71 billion estimatedOperating Margin: 5.7% versus 3.46% estimatedOperating Income: $7.68 billion versus $4.72 billion estimatedQ3 Net Sales Outlook: $138 billion-$143 billion versus $138.3 billion estimatedCloud has been a key battleground among tech giants. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), both cloud rivals for Amazon, reported earnings last week, with relatively mixed cloud results.AWS sales rose 12% year over year excluding volatile foreign currencies. Sales for AWS gained 16% in the first quarter.For its part, Microsoft Azure clocked a decline in its revenue growth for the second quarter, which has been the case each quarter since at least Q3 of last year. Meanwhile, Google Cloud turned profitable for the first time in Q1 and saw income of $395 million in the second quarter — a stark contrast to the same quarter last year, when Google Cloud reported a $590 million loss.Story continuesWhat else caught our attention: Forward guidance and operating incomeAmazon's operating income beat comes after months of serious cost-cutting efforts led by CEO Andy Jassy. That efficiency push has visibly materialized in the company's 27,000 layoffs to date.Additionally, Amazon's Q3 outlook beat is noteworthy for its link to Prime Day. Amazon held its often-seismic Prime Day event in July and, in Q3, those sales will be reflected in full.Amazon has already disclosed that the first day of the July event was the largest-ever single day of sales, as consumers spent more than $2.5 billion on north of 375 million products, according to the company.What analysts are saying post-earnings""Delivering strong results across the board. 2Q Net Sales came in 2% above [consensus] while [operating] Income was 60% ahead, driven by Net Sales and [operating] Income beats across North America, International and AWS.""The mid-point of 3Q guidance for Net Sales was 1.5% above consensus, while [operating] Income was 26% above at the midpoint. The midpoint of 3Q Operating Income guidance implies a moderation in Operating Margin (to 5.0% vs. 5.7% in 2Q), although AMZN generally takes a pragmatic approach to its profit outlook."" -Brent Thill, Jefferies""We reiterate our Outperform and raise our [price target] to $190 (35% upside) in the wake of a Solid Beat &amp; Bracket Q2 print. We are keeping AMZN on our Tactical Outperform list, and AMZN remains our #2 pick among Large Cap ‘Nets.""We believe this quarter provides an unlock on the stock as the Q2 print addresses two of the key questions facing the company: 1) Retail margin recovery – a big step-up in N.A. Retail margin (to 3.9%) with confidence from mgmt. on recovering to and then exceeding preCovid levels (5%+); 2) AWS Revenue re-acceleration – while Q2 was a modest [deceleration], management all but said the “A” word (i.e. acceleration), as AWS is moving past the optimization cycle and customers start to shift towards new workload deployments. We also saw preliminary signals of N.A. Retail sales stabilization – while growth rate was flat on tougher comps, mgmt. noted macro indicators improving across N.A. and Int’l. We remain enthusiastic buyers of AMZN."" -Mark Mahaney, Evercore ISIAllie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

(NASDAQ:PAYX) Stock Goes Ex-Dividend In Just Four Days",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paychex-inc-nasdaq-payx-stock-100058065.html,1691143258,STORY,['PAYX'],"[Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. In other words, investors can purchase Paychex's shares before the 9th of August in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 24th of August.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.89 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$3.56 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Paychex has a trailing yield of 2.9% on the current stock price of $124.67. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether Paychex can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. Check out our latest analysis for Paychex Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. It paid out 75% of its earnings as dividends last year, which is not unreasonable, but limits reinvestment in the business and leaves the dividend vulnerable to a business downturn. We'd be worried about the risk of a drop in earnings. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Over the last year, it paid out more than three-quarters (75%) of its free cash flow generated, which is fairly high and may be starting to limit reinvestment in the business.It's positive to see that Paychex's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Paychex, with earnings per share up 9.3% on average over the last five years. Decent historical earnings per share growth suggests Paychex has been effectively growing value for shareholders. However, it's now paying out more than half its earnings as dividends. If management lifts the payout ratio further, we'd take this as a tacit signal that the company's growth prospects are slowing.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Paychex has delivered an average of 10% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Paychex? Earnings per share growth has been unremarkable, and while the company is paying out a majority of its earnings and cash flow in the form of dividends, the dividend payments don't appear excessive. In summary, it's hard to get excited about Paychex from a dividend perspective.Curious what other investors think of Paychex? See what analysts are forecasting, with this visualisation of its historical and future estimated earnings and cash flow.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

Never be left in the dust again.Apple sales disappoint despite earnings beatApple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) were down 1.7% in premarket trading Friday after the iPhone maker reported its third consecutive quarterly sales drop, even though fiscal third-quarter results topped estimates.iPhone revenue, which makes up nearly half of total revenue, fell to $39.67 billion from $40.67B a year earlier, missing estimates of $39.91B. And revenue overall totaled $81.B - better than the $81.73 consensus, but down from $83B a year earlier.Strength in Apple's services business helped offset the soft iPhone sales: Revenue from Apple News, Apple TV+, and iCloud, among other service units, grew to $21.21B from $19.60B a year earlier, ahead of estimates of $20.76B.As for its bottom line, earnings per share came to $1.26, also topping estimates for $1.19.Regarding the iPhone softness, in the earnings call, CFO Luca Maestri said the company expects iPhone and services performance to ""accelerate from the June quarter"" year over year. He also predicted more double-digit declines in Mac and iPad sales, ""particularly on the Mac,"" due to difficult comparisons vs. the prior year.In fiscal Q3, iPad revenue fell by 20% to $5.79B year-on-year in Q3. missing Wall Street estimates of $6.41B.After the report, Morgan Stanley trimmed Apple's price target to $215 from the prior $220 while maintaining its Overweight rating on the stock. Barclays, for its part, raised the tech giant's price target to $167 from the prior $149, keeping its Equalweight rating.AMD slips on concerns around AI exuberanceAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) on Tuesday came in a penny better than consensus on EPS and edged out revenue estimates, while also delivering above-par Q3 guidance.Story continuesBut shares fell 7% in the next session amid a broader tech selloff amid analyst concerns. Bernstein said it fears estimates ""remain too high"" amid optimism around AI ""and the stock... looks a little stretched to us,"" according to Reuters.Oppenheimer was also cautious, writing:""Difficult to confidently model given lack of design-wins and/or timeline. [Gross margin] expected to improve 130 [basis points] to 51% in 3Q (mix). We remain sidelined as AMD’s AI strategy proves out.""CEO Lisa Su, meanwhile, said the company's artificial intelligence (AI) engagements climbed by more than seven times ""as multiple customers initiated or expanded programs supporting future deployments of Instinct accelerators at scale.""The company earned $0.58 per share in the second quarter on $5.4B in revenue vs. Wall Street expectations for $0.57 and $5.32B, respectively, per analysts polled by InvestingPro.Data Center sales declined 11% year over year to $1.3B, mainly attributed to lower sales of AMD's 3rd Gen EPYC processor, while Client revenue plummeted 54% to $998 million amid a slump in processor shipments due to a weaker PC market and a significant inventory correction across the PC supply chain.Citi, for its part, upgraded AMD to Buy from Neutral after these results, bumping its price target by $16 to $136 per share.""We thought AMD’s AI products (MI300) would be margin dilutive and investors would eventually care about the expensive valuation on AMD, and we were wrong on both counts,"" the analysts said.Shares partially recovered on Thursday, rising 3.5% to $113.15.Starbucks comes in ahead, but concedes challenging backdropStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) beat earnings estimates even as global comparable sales missed amid signs of slackening demand for the coffeehouse giant's drinks and food in North America.Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.00, topping InvestingPro consensus estimates of $0.95, thanks to a sharp recovery in sales in China. That also represented a 23.4% rise from the prior year. Tapering commodity costs also offset the impact of spending on wages and worker benefits, boosting profit margin for the quarter ended July 2 up to 17.4%.Comparable store sales in North America grew by 7%, missing expectations. On a global basis, comparable sales at Starbucks grew by 10%, below analysts' projections for an 11.1% jump.Speaking to investors following the earnings, executives at Starbucks flagged that they expect to see continued revenue pressure in the fourth quarter due in part to a normalization in pricing trends after several months of price increases.KeyBanc believes the company should be well-positioned thanks to its ""scale, best-in-class digital platform, innovation competencies, and forward-thinking business mentality,"" but that ""the operating environment remains challenged.""Stifel said it is ""encouraged by the continued momentum in the U.S. business and the faster-than-expected pace of recovery in China during F2Q,"" but it maintained its Hold rating on the stock and lowered its price target by $7 to $110. The analyst added, ""We would prefer a better entry point given the risks of softening consumer spending later this year and near-term setbacks in the pace of the China recovery.""Shares ticked higher by 0.9% Wednesday.Pfizer beats, but sales slideFinally, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) on Tuesday slipped 1.3% after the pharma giant reported better-than-expected Q2 results, but also said revenue plummeted amid a major decline in COVID-related sales.The company also cut its full-year revenue guidance warning of “near-term revenue challenges"": It now expects sales of between $67B-$70B, with the high end trimmed by $1B vs. the prior range. Analysts are looking for $61B.For Q3, Pfizer booked a profit per share of $0.67 on revenue of $12.7B, beating the analyst consensus for $0.57 on revenue of $12.08B, per analysts polled by InvestingPro.The company sees full-year EPS at $3.35, better than the Street's $3.01 expectation.CEO Dr. Albert Bourla said the company looks forward to ""continuing our progress in the second half of 2023.""After these numbers, several firms - including JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo - maintained their neutral ratings on the stock, with price targets ranging between $38 and $40. Truist and BMO Capital still call Pfizer a buy.Yasin Ebrahim, Scott Kanowsky, Senad Karaahmetovic, Liz Moyer, and Davit Kirakosyan contributed to this report.Related Articles4 big earnings hits: Apple's iPhone letdown; AMD frettingExclusive-TikTok in talks to gain Indonesian payments licenceExclusive-China, Saudi in talks for ETF cross-listings to bolster financial ties-sources]"

Lastly, pharmacy CVS has topped earnings estimates while undergoing layoffs as part of an ongoing cost-cutting strategy. ""The balance sheet is burdened with debt,"" Tengler notes, advising to invest in traditional health care and consumer staple sectors.Video Transcript- Being in the thick of earnings season, investors are constantly looking for investing opportunities but also warnings on stocks to avoid. Laffer Tengler investments CEO and CIO Nancy Tengler back with her picks. And Nancy, let's begin with those stocks that you like, kind of something you mentioned earlier. Starbucks. You kind of describe this as more of a legacy company that really is getting consumers to sort of stick with the brand, particularly through their digital strategy and loyalty. What do you like about that?NANCY TENGLER: Well, I think, and most importantly, Akiko, is I really like the new CEO. And that matters. Investors should be investing like private equity investors do. They should be buying the management team. And he has demonstrated pretty clearly that he understands the global market in a way that I don't think previous CEOs necessarily have. And he has hired a new head of supply chain who is really going in and looking at every aspect of the business, which allowed them to improve margins during the quarter.Story continuesI just finished the second edition of my book, the Women's Guide to Successful Investing. And I wrote about Starbucks in that book. I bought it in April of 2007 at 30. It promptly went to 5 and just left to its own devices since then. It's up tens of thousands of percent in total return simply because this is a great company with a great brand that figures it out over time. They stumble, and that's an opportunity to add to holdings. And so we did that last year. And we will continue to add to holdings because I think they're going to be able to deliver on their pretty aggressive earnings and revenue growth numbers.- Oh, Nancy, I will be reading your book, especially when you give that context for that call. I mean, that was a big move since then. To your point, left to its own devices, even including the pandemic when so many stocks sold off and then popped back, and Starbucks has held up. I did listen to their earnings call this week. And you've made this point about some skepticism, there was.Particularly when you think of US sales, they talked a lot about China. But the penetration isn't there yet in China, especially to offset any kind of softening in terms of sales growth here in the US. You still like it in the face of skepticism?NANCY TENGLER: I do, Diane, because I think-- well, first, Wall Street analysts are not very good at turning points. Most people aren't. That's why we use a discipline that forces us to pay attention at turning points. But I think also, this is a management team that will figure it out. And the digital engagement-- I mean, what Laxman said on the call was not just that he wanted to embrace the digital portion, but he wants to scale. And that is how you get productivity and improvements in a name like this.And they have a lot of room for improvement. McDonald's noted I think it was 4 to 5 times the downloads of their digital app last quarter than Starbucks did. So even with the improvements in Starbucks' digital app, there is plenty of room. For growth and we think he's the one that is going to get that accomplished. And so we're getting paid a 2% dividend, 12% growth in that dividend. So we can kind of afford to just hang out and wait for the management team to get it right. They will. They have in the past. And they will do it again.- Another pick you like, Nancy, is Broadcom. You've mentioned this before, and this is one where you're standing by your man. Now to be fair, it has performed well since you last called for this as a pick. Does it still have more room, especially when you see some struggles that its competitors have?NANCY TENGLER: Oh, the chip names have been really sort of confounding this quarter. Some really good reports and some not so good reports, like we saw from Qualcomm today. But yes, and here's why. I think a couple of things. One is this is a name that is-- well, first of all, they've beaten 12 out of the last 12 quarters. And they've not just beat on revenues and earnings, but they've raised guidance every single quarter for the last quarter.It's a management team that understands their business infinitely. We weren't counting on the AI tailwind, but we got it. And we think it will continue to contribute materially to earnings growth in the future. You have the VMware transaction will close. That's good news for the stock, which is really actually about 50% software after that transaction and 50% chips.And then in addition, you are getting paid 2.1% dividend yield with 23.5% I think five-year annualized growth in the dividend over the last five years. I'll take that all day long. The stock is trading close to $1,000 a share. I think you're probably going to get a split, which doesn't add any economic value but adds to sentiment. And so I think when technology sells off, and I expect that will happen between now and the end of the year, this is a name you want to go in and scoop up.- And Nancy, let's talk about some of the names that you say investors should steer clear from. UPS one of those. How much of this has to do with rising costs? On the one hand, UPS averted the worst case scenario with a strike. But when you look at the tentative agreement, that only points to higher costs ahead.NANCY TENGLER: And that's the reason, Akiko. I mean, I think there's just better places to be. You want to own industrials when the manufacturing PMIs are bottoming. They are. But you want to own the short cycle names. So even though I think Carol Tome is an excellent CEO, I think you are getting paid to wait. So if you own the stock, you're collecting a pretty nice dividend. I think the stock will outperform in the future.But in the near term, I just think there are better places to be. So if you don't own it, don't buy it here. I think it's tempting. But I wouldn't. We're exiting the name. And we're putting the proceeds into short cycle industrial names. And that's where I think you want to be focused in the next nine months to a year.- And Nancy, another one that you don't like, and you've mentioned this before actually, CVS. And once again, you've nailed this one. I mean, year to date the stock is down 20%. It did beat on its latest earnings. However, there's some caution there. Take us through the case for steering clear of this one.NANCY TENGLER: Well, Diane, thank you. I think it's, again, there are better places to be in health care and certainly in consumer staples/discretionary or retail, however you want to characterize the name. I would use this bounce to exit. And the reason for that is the balance sheet is burdened with debt. They were just paying it down, starting to grow the dividend, and then they made a number of acquisitions.I don't really get the model. I mean, I understand it, but I'm not convinced that it's going to be a high growth name in the future. So it's one of those names that could sit in the portfolio and contribute from a dividend growth perspective. But again, we're finding much more attractive places to be in the market. And I just don't think-- I think this is dead money. You are collecting dividend. I don't think it's going to grow very much because the company has a lot of debt to pay back.And there was a lot of concession around the fact that their earnings growth is going to is going to be slow. So I wouldn't invest the capital here. I'd look for better opportunities in health care, consumer staples, and consumer discretionary.- Nancy Tengler with Laffer Tengler Investments. Good takeaways there. Really appreciate the time today.NANCY TENGLER: Thanks so much.]"

""What we all know is that about half of the U.S. debt is going to come due in the next one to three year,"" Tengler says on Fitch's U.S. credit downgrade. She also comments on the ways soft-landing recession calls are shifting the focus on earnings and markets.Video Transcript- All right. We are in the thick of earnings season. 170 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting results this week according to FactSet and the headliners after the close. Amazon and Apple, we're watching those closely. Joining us now is Laffer Tengler Investment CEO and CIO, Nancy Tengler. Nancy, thanks so much for joining us. So let's kind of dive right into the key focus for today amid this earnings season.I mean, you've had about 80% of companies beating expectations. You have these two kind of bellwether companies, if you will, especially Apple. I mean, they've made up, as Jared Blikre just pointed out, a significant portion of the rally that we've seen. What does Apple and/or Amazon need to deliver, and pardon the pun, to not upset the apple cart, if you will?NANCY TENGLER: Oh, boy. Thanks, Diane. That was an excellent pun. So I think that a couple of things. I think they have to provide strong guidance as we move forward. And there has to be at least a maintenance of or expansion of margins. What we've seen this last quarter is I find it just amazing that almost every quarter, 80% of the companies surprise to the upside. But this quarter is particularly important because expectations were so low.So what we've seen, and I think this comes from the fact that managements have been waiting for the Godot recession now for almost a year, and they've had time to prepare. So they've laid off staff. They've cut costs. They've improved supply chains. We saw that with Starbucks in the most recent report. And so what we really want to hear from these companies is that they are going to continue to deliver on margin, and they are providing positive guidance as we look forward.Story continues- Yeah. And Nancy, on that front, we've been following a lot of these consumer facing companies. Apple, certainly one of those. Amazon, another one. And the commentary seems to be that, yes, the consumer is still very resilient. But they are starting to get a little more cautious. And I imagine we're likely to see that reflected in Apple numbers as well. But what's your read on what we've heard from the companies as well, and to what extent that is indicative of what we're seeing in the broader macro environment?NANCY TENGLER: So Akiko, we were advocating, and we were following our own advice by adding to technology and consumer discretionary last fall. It seemed to us that we were closer to the end than to the beginning of the rate hiking cycle. No big surprise there. And that inflation had peaked in June and was coming down. And so we added risk back into our portfolio.Those are also the names we've been trimming in recent months because they've run so far, so fast. But if you step away and just look at Starbucks as a bellwether for the consumer, what you'll see is that they saw increased engagement on the digital side of their business. So 75 million users, 4 million new from a digital 90-day kind of average user.So 20 million peak. It's a peak number in China. And they raised guidance on revenues and earnings. Revenues from 10% to 12%, earnings from 15 to 20. So I think what we're seeing is that the consumer is still spending in areas where they find value or they find satisfaction.You saw today in the ISM services numbers that prices paid came in at 56, which is well above expansionary levels. So I think you have to go company by company. You have to own the high quality companies with the proven management teams that can deliver continue to deliver earnings growth in a slowing economic environment, and that's what we've been focused on in our portfolios.- Nancy, let's talk about those margins that you mentioned. Do you see enough improvement in terms of inflation at the wholesale level for companies to improve their margins?NANCY TENGLER: Yeah. Exactly, Diane. I mean, what you saw in this inflation cycle was that PPI peaked in March. CPI peaked last June. And now we're in an environment where PPI is down to like 0.1%. It has been leading inflation down. And companies have been taking advantage of that by maintaining margins.So they've been able to pull back a little bit on pricing. Though some companies, we're still seeing pretty aggressive price increases. But in general, what you're seeing is that managements have been able to manage that. And I also thought today's productivity numbers were pretty encouraging. They're notoriously volatile. So I don't want to read too much into this.But productivity came in much stronger than expected. Unit labor costs at about a positive 1.6% for the last quarter. We can live with that. I think the Fed can live with that. So we'll be continuing to watch throughout the season. But we're seeing a common theme among the higher quality names that we own.- Nancy, let's talk about the broader market action. We've seen the S&amp;P 500 edging lower for a second day, this coming after the big sell off we saw yesterday on the back of the US credit being downgraded by Fitch. You say we're still in a bull market, but where do you see the opportunity to invest right now?NANCY TENGLER: Well, I think, Akiko, that you want to own companies that can deliver earnings growth when you're in a slowing economic environment. And I don't know if we're going to get a hard, soft, no landing. But I do know the trend. And that is that growth is slowing. The government, and this is I think-- Fitch's downgrade matters only because it drew attention to the fact that the government is sucking capital out of the private sector in, I don't know, an unprecedented manner that in my career of 40 years. So we will see slowing growth despite the spending that has been coming out of Washington.And that's when you want to own the companies that can deliver growth. So think the technology companies, the large cap names, the established names. The ones that are going to benefit from the AI tailwind, the cloud tailwind, the digital tailwind. And then our other theme is old economy companies that are embracing the digital revolution. So this would be a name like Starbucks. But there are plenty others in our portfolios, a number of industrials that are really turning into technology companies, if you will, or even a Pepsi who says we are a technology company that happens to sell snacks and beverages.And so those are the names that we want to own with strong management teams that will deliver through this period. If you get a dividend and a rising dividend, that's even better. But this is not the time where you want to go uber defensive and own the highest yielding names in the S&amp;P. You want to own dividend growers that are able to also support their earnings growth.- So Nancy, I want to put a pin in that because I definitely want to come back to that conversation about particular stocks that you like. But I just want to get your perspective, especially while we have now. We talk to a lot of economists fresh off the heels of that downgrade. A lot of people were surprised by it not. So much by I guess it happening but the why, why now? What was your take, or what is your take on that downgrade?NANCY TENGLER: I mean, I think it's late, to be honest. I think they're trying to get in front of the presidential election. So they're not implementing a downgrade during a presidential election year. But I think what we all know is that about half of the US treasure-- the debt is going to come due in the next one to three years.That half is at an average coupon of about 1.6%. So you didn't really have to be super good at math to understand that. Debt servicing is going to go up dramatically. We think it's somewhere between $250 and $400 billion this year. And that is just simply not sustainable. And so I think that's Fitch's message, which is the spending needs to come in. I don't know that it will. But it's drawing attention to it. I think that's good. But other than that, I don't think it's very meaningful.- All right. Go ahead, Akiko.- Yeah. Nancy, we've been talking about where the economy is headed. It feels like we've been having this potential recession conversation for more than a year. Expectations for that have started to recede while inflation easing is given some sign of optimism for investors. But there is a question of a soft landing. Where do you see that going right now?NANCY TENGLER: So I just wrote a piece called The Perfect But Not Necessarily Soft Landing because I'm up in Tahoe, And I landed a perfect face plant on a granite slab recently. And so it just was mindful of the economy. If you land it just right, I was able to protect the rest of my face by using my nose as an airbag according to the doctor.But I think that you have to as an investor understand the trend line and what the market's not anticipating. I do think that we might have an uptick in inflation between now and the end of the year, and the market's definitely not pricing that in. I would use that as an opportunity to step in and buy the higher quality names that will go on sale with everything else during that correction period. But that that's just a speculation. I don't know that that's going to happen.I think, however, that what we're seeing is companies are raising earnings estimates. So the hard landing scenario in my view is out. The soft landing or no landing are more likely. And again, all I need to know as an investor is that growth is slowing. And that allows me to allocate my portfolio accordingly.- And Nancy, speaking of that soft landing scenario, let me just give some context to where I want to go with this. So Bank of America dropped their call for a recession this year. Do you agree with that assessment? And is a soft landing in your eyes no recession?- Pretty much, Diane. Answering the latter part of your question, I think a soft landing is kind of a no recession at least one that won't be widely felt. I think that, I don't want to sound cynical, but I think following the strategists is never a winning strategy for investors who are trying to buy low and sell high. So many of these same strategists were extremely negative last year when you actually should have been holding onto and adding to your equity holdings.And so I think now, it's just a little bit too late. Too little, too late. They may be right, but the market's already reflecting that. The market already discounted at least an extension to the recession last fall and into the first half of this year. So now, we're looking forward and saying earnings estimates are on the rise in the first half of this year. They're going to be much stronger next year. And that's really what the market's focused on rather than do we or don't we actually have a soft landing or no recession at all.]"

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you. Please go ahead.Todd M. LeombrunoThank you so much, Donna. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Parker Hannifin's Fiscal Year '23 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Release Webcast. As Donna said, this is Todd Leombruno, Chief Financial Officer, speaking. And with me today for the webcast is Jenny Parmentier, our Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Banks, our Vice Chairman and President.I think everyone knows we've released our results and all of these slide materials this morning. Our comments today will address forward projections and non-GAAP financial measures. On Slide 2 of this presentation, you will find specific details to the disclosures that we are making in respect to both non-GAAP financial measures and forward projections. And just as a reminder, actual results could vary from what we speak about today in this presentation based on all of the items listed here in these disclosures. Our press release, this presentation and all reconciliations are available under the Investors section at parker.com, and those will remain available for 1 year.Today, we're going to start with Jenny addressing some of the highlights of our strong fourth quarter and really what was a transformational fiscal year for Parker. She is also going to reiterate some reasons that show why Parker is so well positioned for the future. I'm going to follow up with just some color on how the quarter wrapped up and provide some details around our initial FY '24 guidance that we released this morning. Jenny will wrap up the call with some key messages, and then we're going to open up the lines for Q&amp;A for Jenny, Lee or myself.So now I'll ask you all to move to Slide 3. And Jenny, I'll hand it over to you.Story continuesJennifer A. ParmentierThank you, Todd. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Q4 was a quarter of outstanding performance across all of Parker.Starting with safety. We remain in the top quartile with a 20% reduction in recordable incidents. Safety has been and will remain our top priority. We had record sales of $5.1 billion in the quarter, a 22% increase over prior year, with organic growth of 6%. This is our second quarter above $5 billion in sales.We achieved record adjusted segment operating margin of 24%, a 110 basis point increase over prior year. And as we discussed last quarter, our backlog coverage remains resilient at 55% and has increased 1% sequentially. The Win Strategy and portfolio changes have delivered a strong finish to a great year.Next slide, please. A great and transformational year. On the right side of the page, you can see highlights from fiscal year '23. Again, it all starts with our team. Top-quartile safety and engagement delivers these results. We now have approximately 30% of the portfolio in aerospace and defense, and we couldn't be happier with the progress of the Meggitt integration. The team is exceeding our expectations. And a record $3 billion operating cash flow, 22% higher than prior year, allowing us to make great progress in paying down debt. Todd will give you a few more details on this in his upcoming slides.Next slide, please. Many of you have seen this slide before. As you know, over the past 8 years, we have strategically reshaped the portfolio to double the size of aerospace, filtration and engineered materials. I'd like to draw your attention to the middle of the page for the FY '23 update.The data line represents where we originally forecasted our longer-cycle and secular trends revenue to be at the end of the year. The aero and new solid line represent that we have realized a bigger shift to longer-cycle revenue. The combination of the portfolio changes and secular trends is already and will continue to create a profound shift in our revenue mix. We have high confidence that by FY '27, we will have approximately 85% of the company in long-cycle end markets and industrial aftermarkets. This mix shift is further reason while we will grow differently in the future.Next slide, please. Diving a little deeper into our future sales growth drivers. The 5 buckets on this slide will allow us to achieve our FY '27 target of 4% to 6% organic growth over the cycle. The Win Strategy is our business system. It delivers growth and financial performance. Every tool in this system expands margins.CapEx reinvestment is addressing the last decade of underinvestment as well as investments to strengthen and develop the supply chain. This will result in increased equipment spend and higher levels of automation. And under innovation, our new product blueprinting tools and Simple by Design principles have increased our product vitality index, that is, the percent of sales from new products. This enables faster growth and support of the secular trends.The acquisitions we have made are great companies with higher growth rates, aftermarket and accretive margins. We continue to benefit from the growth related to secular trends. We expect multiple years of solid growth in aerospace driven by both commercial and defense. And we are enjoying an increased bill of material on all electric passenger vehicles and continue to partner with our mobile customers on electrifying their equipment and helping them to achieve their carbon-neutral goals. And today, 2/3 of our portfolio enables these clean technologies. Again, all of this is giving us high confidence to grow differently than we have in the past and achieve our 4% to 6% organic growth over the cycle.Next slide, please. As a reminder, living up to our purpose, top-quartile performance and being great generators and deployers of cash, is what drives Parker. This slide provides an update on living up to our purpose: enabling engineering breakthroughs that lead to a better tomorrow. We are committed and on track to be carbon-neutral by 2040 and achieved a 20% carbon reduction in fiscal year '23. And we are proud to be in the first quartile of the Carbon Disclosure Project on climate change.Post pandemic, our teams were anxious to get back into the communities where we work and volunteered over 10,000 hours in fiscal year '23 to help serve others. And again, our clean technologies are critical in helping our customers achieve their carbon-neutral goals.Next slide, please. The combination of our growth drivers and living up to our purpose points to a very promising future for Parker. We are committed to our FY '27 targets of growing EPS from $21.55 to $30 and achieving 25% adjusted segment operating margin. Growth from secular trends, continued transformation of the portfolio with Meggitt, and continuing to accelerate our performance with Win Strategy 3.0 will drive top-quartile performance and organic growth of 4% to 6% over the cycle.We have entered fiscal year 2024 on a solid foundation. The guidance that we are sharing with you today reflects continued progress to these FY '27 goals. Todd will go through the quarter in the guide, and then I will be back with more comments on our guide assumptions and why we are still very bullish about the future and the 4% to 6% organic growth over the cycle. Over to you, Todd.Todd M. LeombrunoThank you, Jenny. If everyone's following, I'm going to start on Slide 10. And I'm really proud to say once again, every Q4 number highlighted in this gold box is a record for the company. It was really just an unbelievably strong finish to the fiscal year.I'm going to try to move quickly because Jenny already spoke to the 22% sales growth and the 24% segment operating margin. But in respect to sales, organic growth was 6%. When you take a look at the Meggitt acquisitions and the divestitures that we did in FY '23, the net addition for the quarter was 16%. And the good news here is on currency, the headwinds have moderated. It's now was just a slight a headwind of 0.4% in the quarter.One thing I do want to note is adjusted EBITDA margins, 24.4%. That's an increase of 130 basis points versus prior year. And if you continue down the page, both net income and adjusted earnings per share did increase by 18% versus the prior year. Our adjusted net income was $791 million or a 15.5% return on sales, and adjusted EPS was $6.08 in the quarter. That is an increase of $0.92 or 18% versus prior year.Internally, we always stress how important it is to finish strong. And really, these results are just really a testament to the resilience of our global team. So thank you to everyone for a great Q4 and a great fiscal year '23.If you move to Slide 11, this is just a bridge on how we generated that $6.08. This is a $0.92 walk. And I'm proud to say, again, you could see the biggest bar on this page is increased segment operating income. If you look at that, we increased segment operating dollars by $264 million. That's nearly 28% increase year-over-year. That added $1.63 of EPS to our total for the quarter.There were a few headwinds below the segment that are really no surprise. Obviously, that interest is 100% related to Meggitt. That's consistent with what we've seen in past quarters. And income tax was favorable this year in the quarter. Even though we did finish favorable, it was a headwind of $0.19 compared to what we did last quarter. And if you think about that, last quarter, we did have a few onetime items that were related with the acquisition that were favorable and some higher discretes last year. Those were obviously nonrepeating issues this year. So the story on the walk is just really strong operating execution, and it's really across the board.If you move to Slide 12, just some details on the segment performance. Every segment delivered positive organic growth this quarter, but they also delivered positive margin expansion, you can see across the board here. Incrementals were very strong, and all of these margins are records.And I'm also proud to say, even with the challenging comparisons, orders did increase from last quarter to a plus-3% versus prior year. And our backlog did increase 1% sequentially and did reach a record, $11 billion. So this is really the result of robust aerospace activity but also the changes to the portfolio that we spoke to throughout the year.Just jumping into the North American businesses. Sales were very strong, $2.3 billion. That was 5% organic. That's really right in line with our guide. Adjusted operating margins did increase 60 basis points to 23.5%, really just driven by excellent execution across those North American businesses. Incrementals also did improve sequentially, and that helped drive our margin expansion.One thing to note, orders did turn negative to 8%, but that really still is against tough comps. We still have strong backlog coverage that we believe will continue to support growth. And customer sentiment overall remains positive in North America. So all in all, a great quarter and a great finish by our North American team members.If you look at the international businesses, sales were $1.5 billion; organic growth, nearly 4%. Organic growth did remain positive in all of our international regions, really led by Asia Pacific, 8.5%, almost 8.6%. Latin America was 2.5% positive. And even EMEA, which we've seen some softness in, did post a 1% positive organic growth.Even with all that said, margins did increase 90 basis points, finished at 23.3% versus prior year, and really still continued to reflect consistent performance, productivity improvement, good cost controls and that increase in distribution mix that we've talked about periodically.Orders in the international business did improve from last quarter. They are still negative 1%, but it is a nice improvement from last quarter. And again, from our international team members, great consistent performance, and I'm glad to see these results.If you move to aerospace, this is really the story of the quarter, really a standout, just fantastic results all around. Sales are $1.3 billion, 16% organic. Total sales are a 90% increase versus prior year. That's really obviously benefiting from the Meggitt acquisition. But if you look at the business, commercial OEM and MRO continue to be very strong. Both of those businesses are growing at plus 20% versus prior in the quarter. The military OEM business did return to growth this quarter with high single-digit organic performance. That was really nice to see. And operating margins, a new record high, really increasing an impressive 160 basis points to 25.8%. Those strong margins reflect that growth in the commercial aftermarket businesses and really notably, a nice favorable mix of spares versus repairs.So you can also see the addition of Meggitt has also increased our aftermarket exposure. That was one of the compelling aspects of that acquisition. We're glad to see that materialize in the results. The aerospace team is really doing a phenomenal job, obviously, dealing with growth. The integration is ahead of schedule and on track, and these results are really fantastic to see. It's really truth that Parker and Meggitt are really better together.If you look at aerospace order rates, plus 28%, continues to be robust and then obviously, it's helping our backlog. Great performance across the segments.If I jump to Slide 13, I just want to highlight our cash flow performance. We finished the year with extremely strong cash flow. It was a record in FY '23. We increased cash flow from operations 22%. We reached a record $3 billion of cash flow from operations. That's 15.6% of sales. Free cash flow, also very strong, $2.6 billion or 13.6% of sales. Our CapEx came in right where we were forecasting, 2%. And just as a note, because this was the closing of Meggitt, we did have some transaction-related expenses that were a drag to cash flow. That was about 1% of sales. So those obviously aren't going to repeat next year. And we have set ourselves up extremely well to be great generators of cash.If you look at conversion, free cash flow conversion for the year, 125%. And I just really want to thank our teams for the great work on working capital. We strive to be great generators, great deployers of cash, and reaching this $3 billion milestone is really the result of significant effort from our team across the globe.If you go to Slide 14, you can see what we did with all that cash. We reduced debt by $850 million in the quarter. Since we closed Meggitt just this fiscal year in September, we have reduced our debt by $1.4 billion. Since announcing Meggitt way back in August of 2021, we have already paid down approximately 35% of the total consideration of nearly $10 billion. So very impressive work across the board by our team.If you look at leverage, gross debt to adjusted EBITDA finished the year at 2.8%, and net debt to adjusted EBITDA finished the year at 2.7 -- excuse me, 2.7x. We've spoken about our great track record of how we are so dedicated to quickly deleveraging after the deals. And since closing the transaction in September, we have already reduced leverage by 1 full turn. So we're proud of that.Looking forward to next year, we expect to generate significant cash flow. We think we can reduce debt by an additional $2 billion in FY '24. And we are targeting leverage of 2x in early FY '25.Okay. So moving to guidance and putting FY '23 to bed. You could see what we are looking at here is Slide 15. And I'll start with the top line. Reported sales growth for the year is forecasted to be in the range of 3% to 6%, or 4.5% at the midpoint. That equates to approximately $19.9 billion of total sales. If you look at the split, the first half is 49% and the second half is 51%.Speaking specifically to organic growth, for the full year, we expect it to be 1.5% at the midpoint. In respect to aerospace, we're expecting high single-digit growth in aerospace, a little over 8%. North America organic, we expect that to still be positive at plus 1%. And international, we are forecasting slightly negative at 2.5%. Those are all full year numbers.The backlog that I just spoke of earlier does support our growth, so we feel confident in these numbers. And if you look at the breakdown, the guidance does assume acquisition sales, roughly $500 million from Meggitt, offset by $400 million of the divestitures that we did complete in FY '23. So the net impact is $460 million or about 2.5% of our total sales.I mentioned currency earlier based on spot rates as of June 30. We do expect currency to be a slight tailwind of 0.5% or roughly $100 million. So that is based on currency rates as of June 30. We still see margin expansion this year. 30 basis points is what we're forecasting for FY '24. That is all based on continuing to accelerate our performance across all of our businesses using The Win Strategy and, of course, delivering on Meggitt synergies that we have communicated.If you look at adjusted segment operating margin, our guidance is 23.2% at the midpoint, and there is a range of 20 basis points on either side of that midpoint. If you look at operating income dollars -- segment operating income dollars, the split is 47% first half, 53% second half. And for the full year, we are forecasting incremental margins of 30%.A few other items in respect to guidance. Corporate G&amp;A is $240 million. That's a full year number. Interest expense is $525 million. That is a $40 million reduction from where we finished in FY '23, really just based on our strong debt pay down. And other expense is $25 million. Full tax rate, we're guiding at 23.5%. That is without any discrete items. That is really a continuing rate from operations, 23.5%. And finally, we expect full year as reported EPS of $18.55, or on an adjusted basis, $22.40. The range -- those are both midpoint numbers. The range on either side of those is $0.50, plus or minus. And the split, 46% first half, 54% second half. And just specifically for Q1 of FY '24, we are forecasting adjusted EPS to be $5.10 at the midpoint.Looking at cash flow. Full year free cash flow is expected to be between $2.6 billion and $3 billion. So we'll be mid-teens free cash flow and our conversion will be over 100%. Also included in the appendix is some segment guidance details and some other specifics that you might find helpful.If I move to Slide 16, this is just a bridge, and really highlights as follow, again, very similar to what's happened throughout this fiscal year. That organic growth, the acquisition sales, margin expansion and the $75 million of incremental Meggitt synergies for the year translate to an increase in segment operating income of $1.47. We will have less interest expense next year based on that debt reduction that we've done, but -- and that will add $0.23 to EPS. Our forecasted tax rate of 23.5% is a headwind of $0.26. But remember, we had a lot of favorable items in FY '23. We're not forecasting those to continue.We also had lower interest income. If you remember, we prefunded those -- the Meggitt transaction in June of last year. So we had interest income in the first quarter of last year. That was about $35 million. Just to note, that is reported in the other expense/income line on the business segment statement. That was a one-off benefit that obviously will not repeat in FY '23. That's a $0.21 headwind.The rest is just a forecasted $0.20 unfavorable to EPS, and there's just some -- really some nonrepeating items in there. And obviously, share count is also a $0.10 headwind that we hope to make up. So that's the walk from FY '23 to FY '24. EPS at the midpoint is forecasted to be $22.40.So with that, Jenny, I'll hand it back to you and ask everyone to move to Slide 17.Jennifer A. ParmentierThank you, Todd. Just a few key messages to close this out. So FY '23 was a tremendous year with record performance. We have top-quartile safety and engagement, and that continues to drive results in our business. We truly have a great team. We have a proven track record, and we're going to continue to accelerate our performance with The Win Strategy 3.0.The transformation of the portfolio is clearly delivering on longer cycle and more resilient portfolio, and this will allow us to achieve our FY '27 targets and continue to be great generators and deployers of cash.So before we go into Q&amp;A, I'd like to give you a few of our assumptions and comments on the guide. So obviously, aerospace is a real growth differentiator for Parker in fiscal year '24. We are projecting total aerospace growth at 17% with the acquisition sales for Meggitt and organic growth of 8%. We see strong mid-teens growth in commercial and mid-single-digit in military. Good story all the way around.We have now had 2 years in a row of double-digit growth for industrial. But having said that, as Todd mentioned, industrial orders have been negative for the past 2 quarters. However, in North America, backlog coverage is still above 30%, which is roughly double what it has been in the past, and it will support the growth we have in the first half.We do expect some destocking to continue, but overall sentiment from our customers is positive about steady demand and future growth. Obviously, there's more macroeconomic uncertainty for the second half, and we'll update you on that in future calls.While we did see an improvement in international orders from Q3 to Q4, this does include a benefit coming from some of those multi-period, longer-cycle orders and an easier comp from last year's China COVID shutdown. Again, the backlog coverage remains above 30%. But as Todd said, we are forecasting negative growth for the first half and full year.Since the last time we talked, we've seen some signs of Europe slowing. Customers are returning to those seasonal shutdowns where they do maintenance in their facilities, and we're starting to see some softness in some of the end and geographic markets as well as some weakening macroeconomic indicators. And although China had stronger growth in Q4 than Q3, recovery is slower than anticipated, and then we will face a tough comp in Q1 against prior year China COVID rebound.So in summary, this is our thinking right now: strong aerospace growth, strong backlog on the industrial side, some near-term uncertainties and tough comps, but the future growth drivers that I went through on the earlier slide remain intact, and activity is at a high level. We are still very bullish about the future and our 4% to 6% organic growth target over the cycle.So now I'll hand it back to Donna for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Today's first question is coming from Julian Mitchell of Barclays.Julian C.H. MitchellMaybe just wanted to start off with the industrial businesses. Maybe give us a bit more color on the assumptions for international. It sounds like you've got a down first half organic sales and also down second half organic sales in the guide. So are you sort of assuming heavy negative orders pressure there for the coming 6 months or so? Just wanted to check that. And broadly on destocking, any regions or markets to call out in particular where that's most severe?Jennifer A. ParmentierSo first of all, to your question on international, like I was talking about earlier, obviously, the backlog is still strong. It's above 30%. But those customer shutdowns that I mentioned, that takes weeks out of the schedule that we hadn't seen previously. So a return to that is one of the reasons.And then obviously, since the last time we talked, we've seen a slowing in Europe. We've seen the demand not be as strong in certain regions. And then the China recovery is -- we haven't seen the rebound from the stimulus that had been previously anticipated. So that is all weighing in there as well.Julian C.H. MitchellI see. And maybe just following up on the sort of the destocking comments you've made. Any more color on markets or geographies most affected?Jennifer A. ParmentierSo we did see destocking happen in Q4, and we just expect that to continue through the first half. I'll let Lee comment a little bit on the specifics of some regions and markets.Lee C. BanksYes. Julian, it's Lee. I think destocking, mostly at the distribution level, there's -- it's been going on for a couple of quarters. They were holding more inventory than usual. But I would tell you the sentiment is still strong. So we've seen destocking across our European distributors and in North America.Maybe too, just a little more color on Europe. As Jenny was talking about, the biggest softness really is around the DACH region. So that would be Germany, Austria, Switzerland. I think it's a couple of things. It's -- the China export market is a big deal for them. And China has not rebounded like we all expected it would.And then I think when you pivot to Asia, with China, the property woes continue to weigh heavily on the business community there. So all the stimulus we read about really hasn't trickled down to any significant economic activity. I'm still expecting that to change going forward, but those are the plus signs as we move forward.Todd M. LeombrunoJulian, this is Todd. I would just add, we don't have this really first half, second half weighted. We are forecasting international in total to be about 2.5% for the full year. And if I look across the year, there's no real weighting there. It's about an even split.OperatorNext question is coming from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.Joseph Alfred RitchieNice end to your year.Todd M. LeombrunoThanks, Joe.Jennifer A. ParmentierThanks, Joe.Joseph Alfred RitchieMaybe just wanted to maybe talk a little bit more about North America. Obviously, you've got this little order deceleration, the destocking commentary. Just maybe talk a little bit more about what your expectation is for orders going forward or any comments you can make about how this fiscal first quarter is trending. That would be helpful.Jennifer A. ParmentierYes. Thank you, Joe. So obviously, we've already talked a bit about what we expect to see: a continuing destocking and just kind of a softening in orders despite a very positive sentiment from the customer.So in the first half in North America, we're projecting 2% growth, and overall for the year, 1%. So we think that there's some macroeconomic uncertainty in the second half. But in the first half, we fully believe that this strong backlog is going to support what we have in the guide. So the backlog, again, above 30% and a little bit down, about 2% down from last quarter, but very strong. And in talking with our customers, we continue to constantly pressure test this and analyze it. And we're not really seeing any major pushouts or cancellations, so we feel good about the guide we have out there.Joseph Alfred RitchieOkay. Great. And then maybe just focusing to aero. I guess it's funny, like you're expecting 8% growth. Good growth, but why is 8% the right number? It feels like it could be better than that and then particularly with military inflecting. And then also, would love to get any color around where the integration is going better than expected with Meggitt.Jennifer A. ParmentierSure, sure. So the first half for aero is 12%. So obviously, we're going to see some nice growth here in the first half. And in the second half, we have 5%. And the comps get pretty tough in the second half. So we feel good about that 8% organic number right now.So obviously, we're seeing really nice growth in commercial OEM. We see those narrow-body rates increasing. Wide-bodies are starting to recover, but really, it's a story about narrow-body rate increases. And then MRO, as Todd mentioned earlier, the Meggitt acquisition has really increased our aftermarket exposure. And it's been really strong with the air traffic recovery, especially with those narrow-bodies.And we're pleased to see military OEM return. Obviously, the military budget increase is going to drive mid- and long-term growth. F-35 is nearing peak delivery. So all good news there. And then same thing with military MRO. I mean there's a focus on retrofits and upgrades as the fleet ages. So really good outlook for all of aerospace going forward.So you questioned about Meggitt integration. I mentioned in the slides, we couldn't be happier with the progress of that integration. We're forecasting another $75 million in synergies in FY '24. Team did a great job in FY '23 of pulling some actions ahead and allowing us to increase those synergies by $15 million. So really just a positive outlook for aerospace.Todd M. LeombrunoJoe, this is Todd. Just one thing I would add. If you remember a year ago, when we did the Meggitt post-close call, we said that we felt Meggitt could add $0.80 of EPS on a full year basis. We are ahead of that schedule. So that should give you some comfort too, that it is adding EPS to the bottom line as well.OperatorThe next question is coming from Andrew Obin of Bank of America.Andrew Burris ObinJust a question on price and cost. Companies are starting to talk about disinflation, maybe some deflation. What's the view on the company's pricing power into next year and also ability to actually extract price concessions from supply chain?Lee C. BanksSo we've -- you've covered us a long time. I mean the one thing I think we've got a good handle on inside the company is kind of price/cost and the ability to push cost in the price. Every one of our facilities is embedded in our Win Strategy. We look at costs constantly, and we look at price.I would say pricing has become much more normal now. We're not in that rapid inflationary period. But our goal is always to keep things margin-neutral, and we're working that. And we're working the cost side on the supply chain side, too. So I'm comfortable that kind of the price/cost scenario we have is baked into our margin forecast.Andrew Burris ObinExcellent. And then the other question, you sort of talked about seeing Europe slow down, specifically Germany and the DACH region. If you read the newspapers, Economist, Politico, a lot of articles about sort of structural slowdown in Germany, right, because exports to China, cheap energy from Russia. Could you use this slowdown as an opportunity to sort of reconfigure your manufacturing footprint and supply chains in Central -- I would call it Central Europe, or just Western Europe in general? What are your thoughts? And is it too early to say?Lee C. BanksWell, I -- so first off, we've been reconfiguring our supply chains and our manufacturing footprint in Europe for the last 8 or 10 years. I mean you remember when Tom and I took our roles, we had a big initiative.Andrew Burris ObinI absolutely do, absolutely do, yes.Lee C. BanksSo -- and I would just tell you that, that is always ongoing. So we never stopped with that. And we take every opportunity we can to just continue to be better, and we're doing that today.Jennifer A. ParmentierYes. We don't wait for an event, Andrew. It's something we're always working on.Todd M. LeombrunoAndrew, this is Todd as well. I think Lee brings up a good point. We've been working that initiative for a long time. And if you look at the margins that I just ran through for Q4 and really what we're guiding for FY '24, you'll see that those international margins are similar to every other piece of our business. So that has been a great success.Lee C. BanksGreat European team with great leadership, doing great things, they really are.Andrew Burris ObinNo, I appreciate you're certainly doing something right.OperatorThe next question is coming from Nathan Jones of Stifel.Nathan Hardie JonesQuestion on the margin guidance in aerospace. Jenny, you just mentioned $75 million of additional synergies for Meggitt in 2024, which I think is about 150 basis points. And the margin guidance is up about 60 basis points. So maybe just some commentary on the core, I guess, margin decline in 2024. Is that really just a function of increasing commercial OEM as part of the mix or is something else in there?Jennifer A. ParmentierYou just answered the question, right? We expect those narrow-body rates to go up, and it's definitely a matter of mix.Nathan Hardie JonesOkay. Fair enough. That's helpful. And then I guess just on the M&amp;A outlook now. I mean you guys have obviously done a sensational job paying down debt post Meggitt back to towards 2x by the end of the fiscal year, early in '25. What are kind of your criteria for getting more materially back into the M&amp;A market and the shape of the pipeline? I know you guys continue to cultivate that even when you're out of the market. Just commentary on plans there?Jennifer A. ParmentierYes. So we're committed first to pay down our debt. That is our #1 priority and our focus. We're always working the pipeline. We have long-standing relationships with people we talk to now as we have in the past. So that's not something that we ever let go stale or dry. It's a continuous pipeline.So for now, we're focused on paying down debt, and we expect to get in the range of about 2x by fiscal year 2025. And I'm sure we'll talk about it in the future.OperatorThe next question is coming from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.Jeffrey Todd SpragueJust wanted to follow up on, Lee, your comments on price/cost margin-neutral. I believe you got yourself to price/cost margin-accretive through this period. Kind of correct me if I'm wrong on that. But should we kind of expect that trend back to neutral to occur here in '24? Or can you actually maintain some kind of positive spread?Lee C. BanksWell, I think, Jeff, again, you've followed us, we've always maintained some kind of positive spread. We're always looking at the portfolio. We're sunsetting products. We've got different strategic pricing initiatives. But I would tell you, we deal with a lot of core tough customers, and pricing is very competitive. It's really what we do with the balance of the portfolio that helps us out. And as we've talked about in the past, one of the great strengths of this company is the distribution base we have, which gives us a great opportunity to kind of price into that market.Jeffrey Todd SpragueUnderstood. And then, Jenny, just back to aero. Can you be a little bit more explicit about what your aero commercial aftermarket assumption is inside the guide? And is the growth similar at legacy Parker aero and Meggitt on those metrics?Jennifer A. ParmentierI guess, I would say, first of all, that it is very similar. But obviously, the Meggitt acquisition, as we've mentioned, has meaningfully increased our aftermarket exposure. So it's mid-teens is what we're projecting right now. And again, that air traffic recovery, especially with the narrow-bodies with this high domestic traffic, is that really what's going to help that into the fiscal year.OperatorThe next question is coming from David Raso of Evercore ISI.David Michael RasoOn the margins industrially that you had them up despite in aggregate, your industrial organic sales are down, just want to make sure I understand. The destocking that you're referring to, I think that probably is distribution, which would be a challenging mix if that's your destock, are you also referencing, though, maybe a more balanced destock? It's at OEs as well? I'm just trying to get a sense of the ability to have margins up when you're destocking distributions, a heavy lift. So I'm just curious if you could color on that.And maybe the -- what's in the backlog? It sounds like the backlog will help carry the first part of the fiscal year. Although margins particularly positive, what will be coming out of the backlog? Just trying to get a sense of the margin progression and how to have margins up if organic is down industrially for top line.Jennifer A. ParmentierYes. So David, primarily when we talk about destocking, we are talking about distribution. But we're just seeing a kind of a moderation of growth across all of our customers. So don't worry about margin degradation. We're not going to allow that. We have all the right things in place to make sure that we hit our margin targets.So really, it's about -- we're just continuing to see the benefit of this transformed portfolio, right? We're continuing to see the power of the acquisitions that we've done over the last several years.Todd M. LeombrunoDavid, this is Todd. I would just add to that. Jenny is absolutely right. We do believe that we can expand margins both in the North American businesses and the international businesses. It really is a testament to the power of The Win Strategy.But if I'm looking at the numbers here, it really is a smooth glide path, very similar to what we've done historically with our normal seasonality. So it's not weighted in any -- one way or the other. I gave a little color on the splits of operating income, but the margin expansion is a nice glide throughout the year.David Michael RasoAnd maybe I missed it, just a clarification. The first quarter in North America particularly has a hard comp. Are we saying margins could be up every quarter in North America? Or is it just for the full year and the first quarter is down and then it's up from there?Todd M. LeombrunoNo, we see margin expansion in every quarter this fiscal year.OperatorThe next question is coming from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley.Joshua Charles PokrzywinskiJenny, you've referenced the backlog here a few times. I think for most folks, they don't really think about backlog when they think about the industrial pieces of Parker. Clearly, that's changing, but maybe some more kind of breakdown of how long does that backlog extend out? Is there a particular set of end markets or channel mix? Like I would assume more OEM, maybe more project activity. Just any kind of color you can give us on the nature of that backlog and really the duration over which it ships. Is it kind of 1 to 2 quarters, 3, 4 or something like that?Jennifer A. ParmentierSo the backlog, as I've said, is at 55% right now, and it went up 1% sequentially. So that -- we talk about that backlog being so strong and especially, obviously, aerospace is in there. But industrial's being above 30% is roughly double what it was in the past. So we were sitting around 15% to 17% coverage in the past, and now we have 30%. So that's really coming from the acquisitions we've done, the higher aftermarket, the longer cycle. So we're seeing a more resilient and longer, I call it the demand horizon, a longer horizon on that backlog. So we feel very strongly about it.Now we'd know from the past that backlog isn't bulletproof, but we are constantly pressure testing it, analyzing it, talking to our customers, which is really a great benefit of us being so decentralized because our divisions can have real-time conversations to make sure that, that backlog is strong.So I wouldn't be able to break out all the details that you were just asking about between the channel and the OEMs, but I would tell you that over 30% coverage in industrial is a good place to be right now. And that's why we feel good about it covering the growth we have in the first half.Joshua Charles PokrzywinskiGot it. That's helpful. And then -- oh, yes, please go ahead.Todd M. LeombrunoThis is Todd. I was just going to add to that, the other thing to keep in mind is when we talk about the company having 30% aerospace exposure, 5% of that exposure does come from our industrial businesses. So that is also a plus there as well.Joshua Charles PokrzywinskiUnderstood. That's helpful. And then just pivoting to something I've heard a lot of your peers talk about, particularly this quarter, on U.S. mega projects or, I guess, North American mega projects and near-shoring. Obviously, you folks play in all stages of that, I guess, new products that are being developed here as well as the construction of maybe some of these facilities themselves. Open-ended question, but is that something that in Parker's, I guess, more kind of component- and subsystem-type business that you're actually seeing yet? Or is it just a little too early and maybe we see that more kind of later in '24?Jennifer A. ParmentierWe are seeing some of it through our customers and our distributor partners. And you're right, there's just been a massive amount of announced CapEx. I mean some industry sources are citing over $500 billion.Some key examples of that where we will get into the game is the semi fabs and the electric vehicle battery plants that are now breaking ground. So we win -- Parker wins when the job site is prepped, when the factory is built and when the machines go into the factory. So it's early days, but Parker is winning and will continue to win in the future.OperatorThe next question is coming from Joe O'Dea of Wells Fargo.Joseph John O'DeaTodd, I wanted to circle back. You talked about Meggitt trending ahead of that $0.80 that you had given about a year ago. Just any sort of color on what you think the all-in Meggitt contribution is this year?Todd M. LeombrunoYes. I would say it's slightly above that $0.80 that we really forecasted for the first full 12 months. So we've only owned them 9.5 months, but it's been a fantastic 9.5 months. We've talked about the synergies being ahead of schedule, but the other thing is they are benefiting from the secular trend in aerospace. So their growth has exceeded expectations every quarter since the close. So we feel really good about that. I'm really happy we got the deal done.Joseph John O'DeaAll right. Got it. And then, Jenny, I wanted to circle back the macro CapEx investment sort of drivers that you talked about, kind of the 3 main buckets with underinvestment supply chain megaprojects. Can you just talk about sort of within those buckets, sort of if you can rank order what you're seeing as sort of like the biggest growth drivers for you, but also just what you're seeing in terms of kind of the evolution of them, maybe where things are accelerating, where things have played out a little bit more?Jennifer A. ParmentierWell, I don't know that I can rank them right now, but I would tell you that I see activity in, obviously, all 3 of them. If you start off just thinking about the CapEx investment because of the reinvestment over the last 10 years, we're seeing some -- just some upgrading of factories, a lot of work being done to really develop the supply chain and increase capacity. So that ties into the investment in a lot of machinery and a lot to help really that supply chain development.A lot of folks that got burned during the pandemic are going to dual sources. So that drives a lot of investment. And as I mentioned just a few minutes ago, the mega projects, we're starting to see some of that. We're hearing about involvement in that from some of our distribution partners. And it's still early days, but there's a lot out there for us to go win.OperatorThe next question is coming from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse.Jamie Lyn CookCongrats on a nice quarter. I guess most of my questions have been asked, but I guess just to -- you wouldn't know this from looking at your results. But in 2023 or 2022, is there any way you can handicap the inefficiencies running to your earnings, whether it was related to supply chain, employees not being back, et cetera? And I'm just wondering, for Lee, if any of this is an opportunity for 2024 potential tailwind that's not implied in your guide.And then my second question, Lee, I don't think you said this yet. I know you walked through some end-market color. But last quarter, you told us like the percent of the portfolio that was growing versus not growing. I think last quarter, 90% of the portfolio was still in growth mode. Can you give us an update just on your portfolio percent, flat versus growing versus negative?Lee C. BanksSo Jamie, it's Lee. I guess I'll start on a couple of things. One, in terms of -- we're always striving for productivity and continuous improvement. So certainly, things coming out of COVID were chaotic. Some of that chaos is settling down. So those are opportunities for us, but productivity is increasing. You see it in our numbers and kind of the inefficiencies that were going on are getting better. It's not perfect. There still are supply chain issues out there, but it's a far cry from what it was before.I would say when we look at our markets from the backlog that we have, all our markets are still growing at different levels. I mean it's kind of interesting, nobody talks about oil and gas anymore, but that's been incredibly strong, land-based oil and gas here and even offshore here and in Europe. Everything in aerospace is great, and forestry and automotive is still great. North America, anything around electric vehicles is doing really well, and we share a lot of content in those areas. And then construction equipment is still steady throughout all that, and as is ag.I think some of the areas that have softened, and you've seen it with public announcements, is the whole area of HVAC is down. I think that's short term. That will come back. And semicon is soft. And life sciences, really just tough comps coming out COVID, things were really going there. The sentiment is it's just tough comps. So it's getting better as we kind of cycle through the comps.Todd M. LeombrunoJamie, this is Todd. I would just add to that. On your 90% question, if you look at our total orders, last quarter, they were plus 2. They did move to plus 3. So there really hasn't been a material change in that percentage of end markets that continue to grow.OperatorThe next question is coming from Jeffrey Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets.Jeffrey David HammondJust a couple of quick questions. Supply chain in aero has kind of been a problem point. Just wondering what you're seeing there and how that kind of informs kind of the growth rate and how much it's maybe holding the growth back.Jennifer A. ParmentierYes. So it's interesting. I've been talking to a lot of people about supply chain as always. And the aerospace supply chain is really experiencing what the industrial side of the business did 18 to 24 months ago. So just -- it's a little bit tough. There's constraints responding to the high rate increases and demand. But I would tell you that outside of chips and electronics, we're starting to see some lead times moderating. But overall, I would say it's still a constraint for aerospace. So again, we work closely with our suppliers. We're investing in developing suppliers, especially in aerospace, because obviously, with it being 1/3 of our portfolio, it's very important to us that we can deliver these orders.Jeffrey David HammondOkay. Great. And then I think as was the case with LORD, Exotic, the deleveraging process is pretty swift here and seems maybe a little bit ahead. Just level set us on when we start to shift away from debt pay down.Todd M. LeombrunoJeff, this is Todd. Obviously, Jenny mentioned it earlier. We are fully committed to debt pay down. So if you look at what I mentioned earlier, we expect to pay down another $2 billion of debt in this fiscal year of FY '24. We don't expect to get to 2.0x until early FY '25. So we talked about the portfolio. We never stop looking at it both from an addition and a subtraction standpoint. But our main focus really is still -- for FY '23 is to continue that debt pay down trajectory.Okay. This concludes our FY '23 Q4 webcast. As always, we fully appreciate everyone's interest in Parker. Jeff Miller, our VP of Investor Relations; and Yan Huo, our Director of Investor Relations, are available if anyone needs any further clarifications or has any questions on any of the materials we covered this morning. I want to really thank everyone for joining. We appreciate your support. Thanks.]"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the corn sector in the US, go directly to the 5 States That Produce the Most Corn.The United States produces and consumes the most corn. It is the lifeblood of the US Agricultural sector, with over 95% share in the feed grain industry. So, this article will list 15 states that produce the most corn annually according to the latest figures. Corn is the edible grain of the grass family. About 1000 years ago, natives in the North American region started the domestication of corn. It has now become one of the most grown and distributed crops in the world, with the United States taking the lead in its production. China, Brazil, Argentina, and Ukraine are also major producers of corn after the United States. Corn is often regarded as ‘yellow gold’ because of its versatility and high yields. It is used as industry raw materials, biofuel, and human food. Companies such as Archer Daniels Midland Co (NYSE:ADM),  which supply corn syrup are huge in the United States.  The primary use of corn in the US, however, is to make ethanol. America's leadership position in corn production is credited to the ‘Hybrid Vigour’ method, discovered by Edward East and George Shull. This method combines inbreeding and cross-pollination to achieve consistent corn stocks with high yields. Today, at least 41 Sates produce and grow corn commercially. Why is corn important for the United States?  Corn plays a vital role in maintaining the US balance of payment because it is an essential component of its trade. In addition, it is also important for many companies headquartered in the United States. Many publicly traded food processing companies throughout the United States are major stakeholders in the corn industry. Kellog Co (NYSE:K), one of the leading marketers and manufacturers of cereals and snacks, has offices and retail locations all over the United States. Story continuesThe highest chunk of revenue Kellog Co (NYSE:K) generates, comes from cereals that use corn as their main ingredient. Kellogg Co (NYSE:K) reported an annual revenue of $15.315 billion in 2022. Corn is the main ingredient in high fructose syrup. So, fructose corn syrup suppliers like Archer Daniels Midland Co (NYSE: ADM) are also stakeholders in the corn industry. Archer Daniels Midland Co (NYSE:ADM) reported revenue of $101.6 billion in 2022. Corn also helps meet the energy requirements of the United States. It is used to produce corn ethanol, which accounts for 26% of America’s gasoline consumption. This also explains why the United States is the largest ethanol producer. Challenges for Corn Production in the United StatesThanks to its high yields, the US is the leading producer of corn. However, this position of a market leader is under threat from Brazil and the challenges it currently faces in corn production. While the United States produced more corn during the marketing period of 2022-2023 compared to the last, the growth rate has not been impressive. It produced less than expected corn because of dry weather conditions and limited rainfall. Some farmers also had to deal with nutrient-depleted soil which further decreased production.Climate change and environmental factors are not the only challenges the US corn producers face. Logistical issues because of the pandemic also caused delays in the availability of seed, which led to decreased production.The crop production summary of 2022 by the US Department of Agriculture shows that corn production in the United States is concentrated in the northern and midwestern states. Our analysis of the data shows that the top 4 corn-producing states account for more than half of United States corn production. Here are some of the key findings from the report: Iowa is the leader in terms of total harvested area and yield. It is also the leader in terms of overall corn production, accounting for 18.06% of total volume. Utah had the lowest yield per acre and produced the lowest volume of corn. It accounted for only 0.02% of the corn produced in the United States in 2022.Arkansas comes last in the list of the top 15 states that produce the most corn. It contributed 0.88% of the total corn produced in the United States. Our methodology We used the latest report from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which is regarded as the authority on agricultural statistics of the United States. We looked at the 2022 figures and calculated the percentage of corn stock each state contributes to the national cumulative to curate our list. For our analysis, we also looked at the yield and the total area harvested for corn stock. Without further ado, let's look at the states that produce the most corn. 15 - ArkansasArea harvested in 2022 - 6845,000 acres Production in 2022 - 120,235,000 bushels  Yield per acre in 2022 - 184 bushelsContribution in 2022 - 0.88%As the second largest producer of Poultry in the United States, corn produced in Arkansas is mostly used domestically as poultry feed. Arkansas also exports some corn through the Mississippi River. Its corn acreage has increased and taken over cotton production substantially in the last decade. 14 - TexasArea harvested in 2022 -11,080,000 acresProduction in 2022 - 152,950,000 bushelsYield per acre in 2022 - 128 bushelsContribution in 2022 - 1.11%The northern high plains of Texas contribute to most of its corn acreage. It is worth noting that corn plantations in Texas can begin as early as January and as late as June. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, corn quality in Texas is declining.13 - KentuckyArea harvested in 2022 -5,809,000 acresProduction in 2022 - 210,600,000 bushelsYield per acre in 2022 - 192 bushelsContribution in 2022 - 1.53%While every county in Kentucky grows corn, its western parts have the highest acreage. Corn is the leading crop in Kentucky, along with soya beans. It uses corn mainly for live feed and as a cash crop. A considerable portion of corn in Kentucky is used for fuel as well. 12 - MichiganArea harvested in 2022 - 6,210,000 acresProduction in 2022 - 336,000,000 bushelsYield per acre in 2022 - 174 bushelsContribution in 2022 - 2.45%Most of the corn grown in Michigan is exported out of state. A substantial portion is also used for the production of ethanol. The corn plantation season in Michigan takes place during May, with 45% of acreage planted by May 15th. This is an interesting contrast to Texas, where corn planting season lasts for six months. 11 - North DakotaArea harvested in 2022 - 21,144,000 acresProduction in 2022 - 349,770,000 bushelsYield per acre in 2022 - 105 bushelsContribution in 2022 - 2.55%North Dakota’s corn is mainly produced for animal feed and ethanol production. It is the second most grown crop after soya beans. Most of the corn here is planted during May. North Dakota corn crops are always at risk of fall and frost damage, so early planting is recommended. 10 - MissouriArea harvested in 2022 - 13,417,000 acresProduction in 2022 - 502,320,000 bushelsYield per acre in 2022 - 159 bushelsContribution in 2022 - 3.66%Missouri is one of the top corn producing states. It is often grown with a two-year rotation with soya beans. The corn plantation season in Missouri starts in the last week of April and lasts till the first week of August. The majority of Missouri corn is utilized as livestock feed, while a significant portion is used for ethanol production. 9 - KansasArea harvested in 2022 - 21,906 acresProduction in 2022 - 510,600,000 bushelsYield per acre in 2022 - 139 bushelsContribution in 2022 - 3.72%Kansas's agriculture sector is highly dependent on corn, as it contributes the most in terms of production and economic contribution.

Returns could continue to be strong, thanks to a long-term growth catalyst: the rising global population.In fact, the United Nations states that the world will need to produce 60% more food to feed an estimated 9.3 billion people by 2050.Investors can capitalize on this global trend by selecting top dividend-paying agriculture stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsArcher-Daniels-Midland (ADM)Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) logo on sign at office campusSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comArcher-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) is the largest publicly traded farmland product company in the U.S. The company generates annual revenue of approximately $85 billion.As the largest public farmland product company in the country, Archer-Daniels-Midland benefits from economies of size and scale. The company has approximately 450 crop procurement locations, 320 food- and feed-processing facilities, and more than 60 innovation centers. The company also has a significant presence in international markets due to its global distribution system.Archer-Daniels-Midland’s business model has proven to be very recession-proof as food demand often remains consistent during economic downturns. The company saw earnings per share (EPS) grow almost 29% from 2007 to 2009. More recently, Archer-Daniels-Midland weathered the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic extremely well as bottom-line results improved 29% from 2019 to 2020.Archer-Daniels-Midland has raised its dividend for 50 years, qualifying the company as a Dividend Aristocrat and a Dividend King. It is likely that Archer-Daniels-Midland’s dividend growth streak continues as the expected payout ratio for 2022 is just 31%. Shares of the company yield 2.2%, slightly above the average yield of 1.5% for the S&amp;P 500.Bunge Limited (BG)A Photo of a blue sign in an industrial campus showing the Bunge (BG) logo.Source: JHVEPhoto/ShutterStock.comBunge Limited (NYSE:BG) is one of the largest agribusiness and food companies globally, with integrated operations that stretch from farmer to consumer. The company buys, sells, stores, transports and processes oilseeds and grains to make protein meals for animal feed and edible oil products for commercial customers. Bunge also produces sugar and ethanol from sugarcane, mills wheat and corn, and sells fertilizers.Story continuesBunge stock has performed well in the past 12 months with an 18% return. The company’s strong balance sheet and liquidity position provides it with a competitive advantage even in adverse market conditions. Even though the global supply chain bottlenecks persist, BG has profited from the rise in crop prices since a growing global population has raised the need for more food-grade oils and well-fed livestock.On May 3, the company announced Q1 2023 results, reporting Q1 GAAP EPS of $3.26, which beat the markets’ estimates by 2 cents. Bunge reported revenues of $15.33 billion, down 3.5% year-over-year. Although results were down from the notably good performance last year, the agribusiness sector nonetheless performed strongly. Results for refined and specialty oils were better in every region, suggesting good demand trends and efficient supply chain management. In addition, BG announced specific initiatives to increase business capabilities, expand footprint and promote growth. Lastly, the management maintained its guidance for full-year 2023 adjusted earnings per share of at least $11.Bunge Limited has grown its EPS by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.9% over the past nine years. Indeed, the company has experienced significant growth in EPS in the last two years. Bunge now has an increasing opportunity to expand its revenue. For instance, as the world advances toward sustainability, the growth in renewable diesel, produced from crop oils, is currently a modest portion of Bunge’s business but may become big in the future.BG has a low dividend payout ratio of approximately 30% for the current year. The stock has a 2.5% dividend yield.Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG)Scotts Miracle-Gro logo displayed on a web browser and magnified by a magnifying glassSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comScotts Miracle-Gro (NYSE:SMG) is one of the world’s leading marketers of branded consumer lawn and garden as well as hydroponic and indoor growing products. The company offers fertilizers, grass seed products, spreaders, outdoor cleaners and any lawn-related weed-, pest- and disease-control products. Scotts Miracle-Gro generates around $3.9 billion in annual revenue.The company recorded first-quarter sales of $1.53 billion, a 9% decline compared to Q2 2022. This was primarily driven by a 54% sales decline in the Hawthorne division and a 2% sales decline in the U.S. Consumer division. The decline in Hawthorne’s sales reflected the continued challenges in the hydroponic industry. The company is currently being pressured by higher commodity prices that have led to a significant margin decline despite multiple pricing actions. Consequently, adjusted income-per-share came in at $3.78 compared to adjusted income-per-share of $5.03 in the same period of last year.To get the business back on the right track and return profitability in both segments to an appropriate level, the company has launched Project Springboard 2.0. The project is now expected to deliver over $200 million of annualized savings in fiscal 2023 ahead of schedule, with a line of sight to additional savings through fiscal 2024. For fiscal 2023, management expects mid-single-digit percentage growth in adjusted operating income versus fiscal 2022.Having well-known and trusted brands gives Scotts Miracle-Gro a leg up on the competition. Home improvement stores, both national and local, favor the company’s products as they can help drive store traffic. Brand recognition and prime shelf space affords the company the ability to charge premium prices compared to its competitors without negatively impacting its market share. Scotts Miracle-Gro is the rare company that can increase its product pricing while also improving its standing in its industry.Scotts Miracle-Gro has a growing hydroponics business as well. Currently just a 25% contributor to sales, this area should become more important as the need for indoor and year-round food production increases along with food demand.Scotts Miracle-Gro has raised its dividend for the past 12 years. We believe that the company will continue to provide future dividend growth as well. Shares of the company yield 4%, more than twice the average yield of the S&amp;P 500 Index.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

HST lost 4.13% in the after-hours trading in response to lower-than-anticipated second-quarter 2023 results.Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share of 53 cents lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents. The figure fell 8.6% from the prior-year quarter.Results reflect lower-than-anticipated revenues. Although growth in city center markets aided the rise in comparable hotel revenue per available room (RevPAR), moderating rates at the company’s resorts hurt it. It also narrowed its 2023 outlook.Host Hotels generated total revenues of $1.39 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42 billion. Also, the top line declined nearly 1% on a year-over-year basis.Per James F. Risoleo, president and CEO of the company, “Our results were driven by improvements in the group business segment and continued rate strength across the portfolio, despite some moderation at our resort properties. Overall, transient demand was affected by headwinds in San Francisco and Seattle and elevated international outbound travel without a corresponding increase in international inbound travel, which led to RevPAR results below our second quarter guidance range.”Behind the HeadlinesHost Hotels’ comparable hotel RevPAR was $255.12 in the reported quarter, climbing 2.7% from the year-ago quarter’s $219.23. The same improved 6.2% from the second-quarter 2019 tally. The rise was backed by growth in city center markets, offset by moderating rates at its resorts. Our estimate for comparable hotel RevPAR for the quarter was pegged at $229.92.Comparable hotel EBITDA came in at $449 million, falling 8.4% from $490 million reported a year ago. The figure, however, surpassed the second-quarter 2019 tally of $412 million.The average room rate of $303.29 in the second quarter increased from $296.18 reported in the year-ago quarter. The figure also compared favorably with $258.56 reported in second-quarter 2019.The comparable average occupancy percentage in the quarter was 74.2%, up 20 basis points from the prior-year quarter. However, the figure was lower than the comparable average occupancy of 81.9% in second-quarter 2019. We estimated comparable average occupancy to be 71.8% for the second quarter.The room nights for its transient business fell 0.8% year over year. While the same for group business remained unchanged, contract businesses witnessed 12.6% growth from the prior-year period. Host Hotels’ transient, group and contract businesses accounted for roughly 65%, 32% and 3% of its 2022 room sales, respectively.Story continuesBalance-Sheet PositionHost Hotels exited second-quarter 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $802 million, down from $563 million as of Mar 31, 2023.HST’s liquidity totaled $2.5 billion, including FF&amp;E escrow reserves of $213 million as of Jun 30, 2023. It had $1.5 billion available under the revolver portion of the credit facility as of the same date.Capital ExpenditureAs of Jun 30, 2023, Host Hotels’ capital expenditure aggregated $323 million. Of this, $97 million was the total return on investment project spend, $133 million was renewal and replacement expenditure, and $93 million was renewal and replacement insurable reconstruction.2023 Outlook NarrowedHost Hotels narrowed its outlook for 2023 based on its performance in the first half of the year and the macroeconomic backdrop for the second half of the year.It now projects full-year AFFO to lie in the range of $1.82-$1.89, down from the prior-guided range of $1.84-$1.95. This suggests a negative 4 cents change at the midpoint. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is presently pegged at $1.90.The company lowered its comparable hotel RevPAR projection for the current year to $210-$214 from $211-$216 guided earlier. The adjusted EBITDAre is now estimated between $1.535 billion and $1.585 billion, down from $1.545 billion and $1.625 billion.For 2023, management revised its expectations for total capital expenditure in the range of $625-$725 million from $600-725 million stated earlier.Host Hotels currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The two groups have been in federal mediation since September 2022 and SWAPA negotiators had become “increasingly frustrated with Southwest’s lack of commitment to negotiating in earnest and the pace of productivity during this negotiation cycle,” according to a June SWAPA statement.As a basis for the request for release from mediation, SWAPA stated it believed “further mediation will likely not result in any additional agreements between the parties,” but NMB disagreed and ruled the negotiations must continue on Wednesday.“I’m disappointed but not surprised,"" Captain Casey Murray, president of SWAPA, said in response to the decision, according to Bloomberg News. ""We are further away today than the day we filed for release, which is truly the definition of an impasse.”Pilot fatigue is the center of SWAPA’s concerns. In an open letter to Southwest Airlines in April 2022, SWAPA said: “Our primary job as Pilots is identifying and capturing errors in order to break the error chain, but our ability to do so is compromised when we are fatigued.”Other focus areas include compensation and quality of life provisions.Pilot strikes are historically rare, Kiplinger previously reported. The last one occurred in 2010 at Spirit Airlines. Agencies like the National Mediation Board take pains to prevent work stoppages from disrupting the flow of interstate commerce via the airline and railway industries, with Congress also sometimes stepping in.Story continuesJust last week, American Airlines agreed to a tentative contract deal with its pilots, matching terms set by Delta Air Lines and United Airlines pilots, according to the Associated Press. The American Airlines pilots will vote on the agreement this month.Related ContentSouthwest Airlines Bracing for Pilots Strike: Kiplinger Economic ForecastsBiden Proposes New Rule to Help When Flights Get Canceled or DelayedTravel Trends: Skip Skiplagging, Try Airline Clothes Rental: Kiplinger Economic Forecasts]"

(NYSE:PPG) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sure-check-ppg-industries-inc-100255597.html,1691143375,STORY,['PPG'],"[PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. This means that investors who purchase PPG Industries' shares on or after the 9th of August will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 12th of September.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.65 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$2.48 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, PPG Industries has a trailing yield of approximately 1.9% on its current stock price of $140.28. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether PPG Industries's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. View our latest analysis for PPG Industries If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see PPG Industries paying out a modest 44% of its earnings. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 48% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies that aren't growing their earnings can still be valuable, but it is even more important to assess the sustainability of the dividend if it looks like the company will struggle to grow. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's not encouraging to see that PPG Industries's earnings are effectively flat over the past five years. It's better than seeing them drop, certainly, but over the long term, all of the best dividend stocks are able to meaningfully grow their earnings per share. Recent growth has not been impressive. However, companies that see their growth slow can often choose to pay out a greater percentage of earnings to shareholders, which could see the dividend continue to rise.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. PPG Industries has delivered 8.2% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years.Final TakeawayIs PPG Industries worth buying for its dividend? The company has barely grown earnings per share over this time, but at least it's paying out a decently low percentage of its earnings and cashflow as dividends. This could suggest management is reinvesting in future growth opportunities. Generally we like to see both low payout ratios and strong earnings per share growth, but PPG Industries is halfway there. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.So while PPG Industries looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock.

This trend is mirrored in the company's overall insider transactions, with 4 insider sells and 0 insider buys over the same period.Senior VP &amp; CFO Vincent Morales Sells 3,700 Shares of PPG Industries IncThe relationship between insider transactions and stock price is often complex. Insider selling can sometimes be a bearish signal, indicating that insiders may believe the stock is overvalued. However, it's also important to note that insiders may sell shares for personal reasons unrelated to the company's performance or outlook.On the day of Morales's recent sale, PPG Industries Inc's shares were trading at $143.33, giving the company a market cap of $33.39 billion. The price-earnings ratio stood at 25.45, higher than both the industry median of 20.07 and the company's historical median. This could suggest that the stock is currently overvalued.However, according to the GuruFocus Value, which is an intrinsic value estimate based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates, PPG Industries Inc is fairly valued. The stock's price-to-GF-Value ratio is 0.93, with a GF Value of $154.47.Story continuesSenior VP &amp; CFO Vincent Morales Sells 3,700 Shares of PPG Industries IncIn conclusion, while the recent insider selling by Vincent Morales may raise some eyebrows, it's important to consider the broader context. The stock's valuation metrics suggest that it is fairly valued, and the company's strong market position and global operations make it a key player in the paints and coatings industry. As always, investors should conduct their own research and consider multiple factors before making investment decisions.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Impressive efforts on stage, which included a reminder that all of their music was being sung and not powered by AI. Bearish for AI stocks? Unclear.I also was reminded that this is one expensive stock market that is priced for perfection. And if that perfection isn't achieved, investors will pay dearly. And they paid this week, to an extent.We continue to see global markets roiled a bit from Fitch's credit rating downgrade on US debt. Pricey tech stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA) are feeling a big brunt of the risk-off move.morning brief imageAll of this got me thinking maybe it's time for investors to find a few interesting turnaround situations to bet on. You know, well-known companies that have visible catalysts in place that investors have forgotten about amidst the summer hype for top-performing businesses.And companies whose stocks aren't as inflated as the broader market, so there is already a ton of bad news priced in.Take for instance chip giant Intel (INTC).The company has had a brutal 12 months as CEO Pat Gelsinger slashes costs, builds new chip-making plants, and tries to catch up to AMD and Nvidia on design. A post-pandemic downturn in PCs hasn't helped Intel's fundamentals either.But Intel looks to be turning the corner operationally, at least in the eyes of the energetic Gelsinger.""The worst is behind us,"" Gelsinger told Yahoo Finance Live.Story continuesThe symbol for Intel appears on a screen at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York on Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2019. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)Gelsinger thinks the PC market will gradually recover this year, and the company has secured $1 billion-plus in commitments for AI-related chips. The company also remains on track to attain $8 billion in cost cuts by 2025.This is a markedly different tone relative to when we talked a few months ago.Is Intel hitting its stride? Who knows. But the situation appears way better than two quarters ago — and it may not be priced into the stock price of this iconic American company.Another big business that may be beginning to see daylight after a tough stretch is toymaker Hasbro (HAS).Hasbro unloaded its anchor-like entertainment business eOne to Lionsgate for $500 million this week. The sale removes a non-core asset from Hasbro's books, freeing up resources to invest in core toys.This comes as Hasbro has seen stabilization in toy demand despite the juggernaut demand driver for rival Mattel (MAT) in the Barbie movie.Speaking of resources, Hasbro is on pace to remove $250 million to $300 million in costs by year-end 2025.Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks sounded pretty confident in our chat this week that his company's worst days were behind it too. Now onto some debt pay-down ($400 million) and marketing behind the red-hot-selling, Furby doll.I would even add a small-cap name like grill-maker Traeger (COOK) into this turnaround play callout. The company has gotten its inventory levels into far better shape after a rough year. Demand for grills is stabilizing, and the CEO has been refocused on driving stronger operations.""I truly believe we have turned around,"" Traeger CEO Jeremy Andrus told us.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

(Jordan Strauss / Invision / Associated Press)This Barbie is an environmentalist. And a prankster.""Splash"" and ""Wall Street"" star Daryl Hannah helped carry out a Barbie-themed ""hoax"" that duped several media outlets into believing she was the face behind Mattel's new environmentally conscious ""EcoWarrior Barbie"" on Tuesday.The viral campaign launched as Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" feature dominated the summer box office. And, apparently, that was the point, according to to the activist group behind the prank.Read more: Greta Gerwig did not expect a right-wing takedown of 'Barbie': 'There's a lot of passion'In a video titled ""Plastic Free With Daryl Hannah"" that liberally utilized Mattel branding, Hannah convinced some viewers that the famed toymaker also pledged to go plastic-free by 2030, starting with Ruth Handler's iconic fashion doll. Hannah announced her partnership with the company and even delineated ways Mattel would produce future dolls with ""totally compostable materials"" such as resin, mushroom and algae. She also asserted that Mattel would support a federal ban on plastics in kids' toys and on single-use plastics.""Barbie and I are about the same age, except she will never die, really,"" the 62-year-old star claimed. ""During my lifetime, Barbie and over 1 billion of her friends have been abandoned in our landfills and waterways where they will live on forever.""Read more: What a doll! Margot Robbie's best Barbie-inspired looksBut a spokesperson for Mattel confirmed to the New York Times and New York Post that it was not behind the campaign, describing it as ""a hoax"" that ""has nothing to do with Mattel or any of its products."" Representatives for the El Segundo-based company did not immediately respond Wednesday to The Times' request for comment.An infamous satirist from the Yes Men — Mike Bonanno (whose real name is Igor Vamos) — partnered with Hannah for the lark, along with activist group the Barbie Liberation Organization. They produced the video in which Hannah also pitched MyCelia dolls inspired by environmental activists such as herself, Greta Thunberg, Julia Butterfly Hill, Nemonte Nequimo and Phoebe Plummer.Story continuesRead more: How hilarious 'Barbie' earworm 'I'm Just Ken' brings toxic masculinity to its kneesHannah has been familiar with the Yes Men since first meeting them at a global climate conference in Amsterdam in 2010. She was drawn to their irreverent, ""incredibly effect"" approach, she said in an email to The Times.""They say what needs to be said. They wanted to do something around the attention swirling around Barbie because they had participated in the Barbie Liberation Organization action in 1993 and they came to me to talk to me about the documentary brainstorming ideas,"" she explained. ""While we were brainstorming ideas, I remembered I had this barnacle covered Barbie I found in one of the most protected parts of the Pacific Ocean and the idea [sprang] from there.""Hannah says she found the ""barnacle covered Barbie"" while snorkeling off the coast of Fiji a decade ago, the only real claim she made in the video.According to the New York Times, the Barbie Liberation Organization, the activist group that began targeting the dolls in 1993, launched the campaign to capitalize on the hype surrounding the “Barbie” film and call attention to the use of plastic in toys.""What we're fighting against is half a century of misinformation from the plastics industry and from fossil fuel companies and interests that are trying to convince people that recycling is a viable solution to the plastic waste problem,"" Bonanno told the newspaper.Read more: Commentary: Barbie is ultra-feminine, and that is her power The elaborate prank also involved convincing faux Mattel websites, one of which was titled ""New Mattel Decomposable Barbie Line Celebrates the End of Plastic and Mourns the Dead."" It included a fake statement dated July 21 from Mattel's executive vice president and chief brand officer, and a bogus media contact e-mail address.""We've always wanted people to see themselves in Barbie,"" the statement said. ""But we never intended for her to enter our bloodstreams as microplastic, literally becoming a part of us forever. It sounds nice, but it's actually not very good for you.""News organizations such as People, the Washington Times and Dow Jones Newswires ran articles about the campaign that have since been removed or amended. The Washington Times, for example, issued an editor's note addressing the flub.Read more: I did the 'Barbenheimer' doubleheader. Here's what I learnedHannah was ""absolutely ecstatic"" over the public response to the campaign, noting that people were ""giddy, beyond thrilled"" at the prospect of Mattel going plastic-free.""That seems to be what everyone wants,"" she told The Times. ""Because it’s clear to everyone we have a waste crisis and that petrochemical plastics should not be for daily use. Certainly not toys that live on forever,"" she added. ""They get inside our soil, our water and even ... inside our bodies. So the toy industry, especially the large wildly successful ones like Mattel, have this wonderful opportunity to make a REAL change and have a huge impact if they’d aim for plastic free, biodegradable and compostable products. We don’t want more empty symbolic announcements.""Mattel, which co-produced the ""Barbie"" movie through Mattel Films, has previously announced sustainability efforts regarding its plastic use, although not as extreme as those that Hannah described in the video.In 2021, the company introduced its Barbie Loves the Ocean doll, its first fashion doll in the line made from recycled ocean-bound plastics and other recycled materials.“This Barbie launch is another addition to Mattel’s growing portfolio of purpose-driven brands that inspire environmental consciousness with our consumer as a key focus,” Richard Dickson, president and chief operating officer of Mattel, said in a statement at the time. “At Mattel, we empower the next generation to explore the wonder of childhood and reach their full potential. We take this responsibility seriously and are continuing to do our part to ensure kids can inherit a world that’s full of potential, too.”The program, the statement said, is one of several supporting the company's corporate goal to ""to use 100% recycled, recyclable or bio-based plastic materials in all products and packaging by 2030.""Read more: 'Barbenheimer' box office effect continues, 'Haunted Mansion' creeps into third placeThose pledges weren't enough for the BLO. Members from the activist group lambasted Mattel on Tuesday in news-conference videos that Hannah reposted on social media.""This is a message for Mattel, and every other company: Stop making plastic crap. You are ruining our future. Stop pink-washing your environmental crimes,"" two seemingly young girls say in the clip.""I love animals. I love the planet. Don't take them from us. I think adults should just stop messing with our future,"" one of them adds before they repeat in unison that ""the Barbie Liberation Organization has spoken.""A third member spoke out on behalf of women ""fighting fascism"" on the front lines around the world.

(NASDAQ:MAT)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportune-moment-examine-mattel-150753091.html,1691075273.0,STORY,['MAT'],"[Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAT), is not the largest company out there, but it received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Mattel’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Mattel What's The Opportunity In Mattel?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 16% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Mattel today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $25.22, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Mattel’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will Mattel generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Mattel's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in MAT’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on MAT, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

124,1dc1db97-1479-30eb-a443-0ff5fd847642,MAT,2023-08-04,What Does the New Barbie Movie Mean for Toy Maker Mattel’s Business?,FX Empire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-barbie-movie-mean-toy-144639662.html,1691073999.0,STORY,['MAT'],"[According to Rotten Tomatoes, Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig, grossed an estimated $93 million in its second weekend. The picture currently has the sixth-best second weekend of all time and had already earned $351.4 million after just 10 days.A collaborative effort between Warner Bros and Mattel, the creator of Barbie, the movie has helped Mattel’s stock price rise by almost a third from its low point in March, as the corporation attempts to cash in on its popularity. The toy company is already preparing a sequel and expanding its Hollywood franchises to include other brands like Hot Wheels and Barney.Daily Mattel Chart – Source: Online trading platform ActivTraderAlthough there are some who feel that the excitement generated by the movie will only result in a temporary increase in sales that will begin to decline in the final few months of the year, Mattel believes that this marks the beginning of a promising new chapter for the company.Mattel, a company established in 1959, has previously seen the production of animated versions such as Barbie In The Nutcracker, Barbie As Rapunzel, and Barbie Of Swan Lake. However, the most recent live-action production of Barbie is the most prominent rendition to hit cinemas and is hoped to be a huge boost to the company, as some other recent films have proven to be for the companies that created their title characters.Nintendo Reports Massive Growth Following Super Mario Bros. MovieOne such company, Nintendo, released its earnings report this week and has had a blockbuster movie to thank for its vastly healthier-looking balance sheet.Since its premiere in April, Universal Studios “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” based on Nintendo’s most popular characters, has earned over $1 billion worldwide. It’s been hugely beneficial to a variety of Nintendo’s commercial divisions, and it produced a halo effect that attracted customers to the products offered by the Japanese gaming giant.The company also launched “The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom” in May, and it quickly became the best-selling game in the series’ history thanks to the hype generated by the movie.Story continuesAccording to the company’s statement released on the 3rd of August, the first quarter of the fiscal year saw a 50.0% rise in net sales, to 461.3 billion yen, an 82.4% increase in operating profit to 185.4 billion yen, and a 52.2% increase in ordinary profit to 253.7 billion yen.Sales of mobile and IP-related products increased overall by 190.1% year over year to 31.8 billion yen, helped by a rise in royalties and sales of visual assets from the movie.If the Barbie Movie does as expected and reaches near the $1 billion dollar mark for sales, it’s probably fair to assume a similar story may unfold for Mattel’s next quarter earnings, even despite recently falling sales.Mattel’s Most Recent Quarterly Earnings Were a Miss, but the Future Looks BrightYnon Kreiz, Chairman and CEO of Mattel suggested in their most recent earnings report on July 26th, that the Barbie movie serves as a demonstration of the cultural impact of the company’s intellectual property, their capacity to draw in and work with top creative talent, and the skills of the company’s franchise management. He also pointed to the future potential of Mattel Films and the considerable advancements made in their plan to maximize the value of their intellectual property.Despite the positive demand for the film, Mattel’s previous quarter results weren’t exceptional. As with other toy companies, Mattel has seen a drop in sales since the pandemic drove parents and shops to stock up on toys for children who were forced to stay inside. As a result of high inflation and interest rates, toy stores are still trying to sell off their surplus of stock despite the current drop in consumer spending by reducing prices.During the second quarter, there was a decrease of 12% in Net Sales, or 13% in constant currency, compared to the previous year’s second quarter. The recorded operating income amounted to $63 million, reflecting a decline of $62 million. Similarly, the adjusted operating income was at $75 million, indicating a reduction of $47 million.The company’s EPS was $0.08, down from $0.18 in the prior-year period, while EPS was $0.10, up from $0.18 in the prior-year period after adjusting for non-recurring items.Mattel executives discussed the film’s influence on sales and the company’s ability to partner with other brands during its earnings call, describing the phenomenon as a “halo effect” for Barbie that would have long-lasting repercussions.After a successful month of July sales, CEO Kreiz suggested that the brand’s line of movie-themed toys and goods had sold out “very fast” and that more would be coming soon. Mattel announced the release of a soundtrack and the formation of over 165 consumer product collaborations in conjunction with the film, with thousands of displays being placed in shops across the world…DisclaimerCFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. 85% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to American International Group's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for American International Group How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for American International Group is:11% = US$5.2b ÷ US$46b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.11 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.American International Group's Earnings Growth And 11% ROETo begin with, American International Group seems to have a respectable ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 11% the company's ROE looks quite decent. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the impressive net income growth of 52% seen over the past five years by American International Group. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that American International Group's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 12% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for AIG? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is American International Group Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?American International Group has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 9.7%, meaning that it has the remaining 90% left over to reinvest into its business. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Besides, American International Group has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 23% over the next three years. Despite the higher expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with American International Group's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Now What?,Commercial Observer,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/soundstages-were-already-reeling-summer-201021720.html,1691093421,STORY,['NFLX'],"[Writers picketing outside Paramount Studios in Los Angeles. Photo: FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty ImagesHollywood has lights and cameras, but no action. Writers aren’t writing and actors aren’t acting, by and large, so cameras aren’t recording and soundstages across the country are silent.The summer of strikes hit Hollywood and other entertainment hubs after union-affiliated writers and actors walked off their sets in protest against studio executives over contract disputes. It’s the first double strike the entertainment industry has seen in over 60 years, and much is at stake. According to Zion Market Research, the demand for global movies and entertainment in terms of revenue was valued at $94.5 billion in 2022, and it is expected to surpass $169 billion by 2030.The last significant strike to hit the industry was in 2007. It only included writers, and tech companies such as Apple and Amazon didn’t have skin in the game like they do now via their expensive streaming arms. Even still, that strike lasted 100 days and was estimated to have cost Hollywood’s economy $2.1 billion.The current strike could cost a lot more, depending on how long it lasts. This time it could mean at least a $4 billion loss globally, according to the Milken Institute, and that’s just the immediate impact. New contracts are expected to cost studios an additional $450 million and $600 million per year, as actors and writers seek higher wages and residual revenue sharing with streamers, as well as protections from artificial intelligence.“It’s a challenging time,” said Sam Nicassio, president of Los Angeles Center Studios. “You come out of COVID and start to build it back up, and then the production industry comes to a halt. It’s challenging to run a business for sure.”The halt in production comes amid a storm of other headwinds for those in the intense streaming wars. Challenges include declining profits, rising interest rates and inflation, regional bank failures, large amounts of dragging debt, and plummeting commercial real estate values. “Production in the U.S. has halted at a time when the sector is under pressure to mitigate the secular decline in linear TV and shows it can operate streaming platforms at a profit to mitigate linear decay,” Moody’s Analytics reported. “In a prolonged strike in which new theatrical Hollywood tentpole product is spread more thinly or runs dry, these companies could face earnings, cash flow and liquidity pressures.”Story continuesIn the short term, the strikes obviously mean there are empty soundstages this summer. And that could give the studios trying to cut costs a chance to terminate deals and productions that now seem too expensive. But it remains to be seen what those empty soundstages mean for the long term. Even after new contract agreements are reached, questions will remain about if and how the shutdown will impact future negotiations on soundstage rents, loans and even development.“This is creating a lot of stress in the market-place,” Gregory Barsamian, a senior vice president at CBRE (CBRE) based in L.A., said. “I know some of these guys are already going to their landlords and asking for some sort of rent relief arrangement.”Investment in and development of studio and soundstage space skyrocketed after the start of the pandemic as streaming subscriptions boomed during COVID-19 lockdowns. But, after record-setting growth, the labor strikes may just be highlighting and even exacerbating a strained and saturated market, illuminating that investment has peaked — and maybe is stretched too far.“Even if the [Writers Guild of America] and [Screen Actors Guild] strikes resolve themselves later this year, the entire entertainment/media landscape is very murky at best,” a market analyst familiar with the industry’s real estate activity told Commercial Observer. “Pretty much everyone with the exception of Sony jumped into the streaming wars, and now everyone has realized there was always going to be only one winner: Netflix (NFLX).”Analyst firms are responding as well. Moody’s Analytics, which published a report this summer titled “Golden Age of TV Spending Causes Dark Age for Studio Profits,” downgraded soundstage owner and Netflix landlord Hudson Pacific Properties’ preferred stock rating and its senior unsecured debt rating amid the strikes because it does not expect the REIT can cover expenses, leasing costs and debt maturities. (Hudson Pacific declined to comment for this article. Another prolific L.A.-based studio landlord, Hackman Capital Partners, also declined to comment)But, while some ratings suffer from the strikes, three brokerages last month raised their ratings on Netflix’s stock, Reuters reported. There’s also growing uncertainty over the spike influx in studio development projects that entered the pipeline the past three years — which would add several dozen more soundstages just in L.A. alone — and whether those projects will will come to fruition now. The days when Blackstone or other institutional investors entered Hollywood and dropped $1 billion on studio development could be over.“I don’t know if you’re going to see the number of studio developments that have been announced actually get developed,” Nicassio said. “I’ve heard some are going forward, some are on pause, and some aren’t going to happen at all. And that may be normal in development cycles, but I think this has scared some people off, that maybe the studio business isn’t evergreen.”Matt Moran, director at Project Management Advisors, which represents owners and real estate managers, including studio developers, said his firm has seen a slowdown in construction projects.“Clients or owners are taking it as far as they can before they start building any kind of new real estate,” Moran said. “There’s been talk of developers slowing down on the development of studios, because, A, we’re coming to a saturation point; but, B, as the streaming services buy each other out, they [add more] content and have less of a rush to produce.”The entertainment industry and studio real estate were already on shaky footing before the strikes. Last fall, Savills reported that “a reckoning” hit the entertainment industry as it faced rising costs and slower subscription rates that spooked investors. “For the first time in a decade, Hollywood has now entered a period of relative austerity due to slowing growth and recent industry consolidation,” Savills’ 2022 report read. “Developers have proposed millions of square feet of studio and soundstage projects just as content spending could be plateauing. … If all proposed studio and soundstage projects are realized, the L.A. market could see a supply glut over the next four to five years.”Citing data from the period leading up to when the actors joined the writers on the picket lines, nonprofit FilmLA reported that on-location productions in the L.A. region declined in the second quarter by 29 percent compared to a year ago, for the sixth straight quarterly production drop.“Greater Los Angeles is the North American epicenter of scripted television production. Before long, this sector’s shutdown will be felt in every corner of the regional economy,” FilmLA President Paul Audley said. (During the strikes, all FilmLA employees’ hours are reduced by 20 percent, and all staff have now been designated as “hourly” employees.)Many also believe the Hollywood labor strikes will lead to more consolidation, internally and externally, and force reductions in size for the entertainment industry.“Studios were already looking to densify and consolidate all of their space types, including office,” Moran said. Sources told Commercial Observer that Showtime terminated its headquarters office lease at The Lot in West Hollywood, showing that parent company Paramount is looking at efficiencies. Also, Warner Bros. is subleasing space and consolidating some units, such as CNN and Cartoon Network. Additionally, CoStar reported that independent production company Vista Studios is set for auction after filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which means putting more space on the market.Moreover, the strikes could ironically push consumers further into streaming services, which have large catalogs of content to turn to when other outlets run dry. Some streaming services’ banks of unreleased programs can help them survive in the near term while other networks will have nothing new to offer. Bigger companies like Netflix, Disney, Warner Bros. and Amazon also have produced content in foreign markets that aren’t covered by Hollywood unions, and also have larger reserves of content that will help buy them time and weather the strike.On the other end of the production spectrum, movie theaters face their own judgment day, and soon they could have significantly fewer titles to debut because of the strikes. And theaters were already retracting: In 2022, there were only 71 movies that opened to wide release compared to 112 in 2019.All the behind-the-scenes ancillary services are struggling mightily as well. These are the industries that rely on show business: hair, makeup, wardrobe, agents, accountants, prop warehouses and set designers — and commercial real estate firms.“It’s not only affecting the people you see in the news, but independent operators like us and everybody else that services the production industry,” Nicassio said. “I’ve got tenants that are not production but are production-related here asking for rent relief like it was COVID again. It’s affecting publicists, the agents, it’s everything that feeds off the system.”If the strikes carry on much longer, Barsamian said he could see some smaller shops in the support industry shutting down.The total fallout might not hit consumers or exert a larger effect until this fall when there’s no new television programming, and then in 2024 when fewer and fewer new movies show up in theaters. The industry will wait to see who survives until then.“It will get settled. The production business that we rely on more than the office here will come back,” Nicassio said. “Healthy landlords like us will fare much better.“Having done this for 20 years and watching the cycles — and this is the most brutal cycle I’ve seen — I firmly believe when production comes back, it will come back as strong as it was. There’s still demand.”Greg Cornfield can be reached at gcornfield@commercialobserver.com. Trending Commercial Observer StoriesJPMorgan Pays $745 a Foot for Activision Blizzard HQ In Santa MonicaNYU Buys Kips Bay Residential Tower for $210MWho Owns the Most Apartments in Los Angeles?New Yorker Hotel’s $106M Note Sells to Yellowstone Real Estate Investments Sunday Summary: Could China’s Real Estate Problems Become Ours?Read the original story Soundstages Were Already Reeling Before This Summer of Strikes.

LightShed Partners Partner Rich Greenfield says the company is ""generating far more cash flow than investors expected when this transaction closed last year,"" however, ""the advertising environment is just not picking up."" Greenfield notes, however, this is a problem for all legacy media companies, not just WBD.Another concern for Greenfield is the ongoing Hollywood writers' and actors' strikes,""I'm just worried the strike is going to last until October, November,"" he says.

The company also reported a $3 million loss in its streaming segment after seeing a $50 million profit in the first quarter. Rich Greenfield, LightShed Partners partner is joining us now. Rich, it's good to see you here. So what-- give us sort of your big-picture take first of all on these numbers?RICH GREENFIELD: Look, they are delivering on what they said in terms of free cash flow. There's no doubt David Zaslav and team are getting the cash out of this business. They've dramatically restructured, radically reduced cost. They are generating far more cash flow than investors expected when this transaction closed last year. I think the challenge and what you're seeing in terms of the weighing on the stock today is the fact that the advertising environment is just not picking up.You know, you had a lot of media companies, legacy media companies early in the year talking about sort of a second half recovery, and that you'd see a ramp in advertising or improvement. And it's improving, but off of a much lower base and you're still looking at pretty sizable declines in advertising. Whether we're talking NBC Universal, whether we're talking Warner Brothers Discovery, all of these companies are seeing the TV ad market just be terrible, recession or not.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Well, and it doesn't help if you're losing subscribers, right? I mean, like how is Max? Is Max competitive, like--RICH GREENFIELD: Yeah. I wouldn't read too much into that.JULIE HYMAN: OK.RICH GREENFIELD: No, but I wouldn't read too much into that. Part of that is, you know, remember, there's Discovery Plus subscribers in that number, and they folded Discovery Plus into Max. So when HBO Max became Max, it now includes Discovery Plus, and there were subscribers who took both services. So I think some attrition is not unexpected, there's still in terms of the size of Max relative to its peer group, Max is doing just fine.So I don't-- the stock is not down because Max lost a little subscribers. I think if anything, the Max rebrand has gone pretty well. I think the service works better. I mean, if you've tried downloading a show on Max versus the old HBO, the new interface is far better. I think this is more about they guided to the bottom end of their-- you know, they had a range of 11 and 11 and 1/2 billion of EBITDA. They got it to the bottom end of that range.They took down sort of their advertising guidance for the rest of the calendar year. I think that's sort of what's weighing on WBD, as well as the sector at large because the headwinds facing Warner Brothers are no different than the headwinds facing Disney, I mean, you saw Iger on CNBC the other day. This whole sector is facing very significant headwinds.- You know, Rich, it got a little bit of a mention in the release from Warner Brothers today, of course, the strike that we're seeing in Hollywood right now impacts may be mixed in the second quarter for a lot of these companies. How are you thinking about that longer term for the space?RICH GREENFIELD: Look, I'm just worried the strike is going to last until October, November. I mean, I don't sense any real progress. Yes, talks are going to theoretically restart tomorrow with the writers. But I think you've got a long road ahead. And from everyone I talk to in Hollywood, I think people are sort of prepared that we may not be fully back in action until sometime in November, even towards Thanksgiving. And that's going to be very disruptive to the business of Hollywood in Q4.And look, it also just drives consumers to watch more catalog, to watch more overseas content, to watch more YouTube. Like this is not the right-- you know, there's probably never a good time for a strike to be honest, but I think given the alternatives the consumer has today versus what they might have had 10 and 20 years ago, this is far more devastating to this industry than I think both sides realize.JULIE HYMAN: And I wonder how you think these different companies are navigating it. I guess what I want to ask about is leadership of the big media companies and studios, whether it's Iger, whether it's Zaslav, whether it's Bakish, like have these-- you know, and whether it's the strike or the slowing ad market. How are these guys doing? Are they doing a good job navigating this?RICH GREENFIELD: Look, all of these companies were too late to embrace streaming, right? There's no doubt they waited too long to go to streaming. They saw what Netflix was doing. And they jumped on the bandwagon. You know, Disney was the one who really started it with Disney Plus, but then everyone else jumped on it. Now, they're all realizing that their core business, which is cable network, broadcast and cable networks, they're all realizing those businesses are in secular revenue decline.Advertising is going down. Affiliates, which is the fees paid by cable and satellite operators to cable networks. Those fees are now going down. So the whole top line of this industry is in secular decline, and sports rights and costs keep going up. And I think that's what's spooking investors. It's why Iger is talking about spinning off linear TV, needing partners for ESPN. Like, this is the sort of the sickness that's sort of plaguing this entire legacy media industry.And so you say who's leading? I think all of these executives have been caught a little flat footed. I think, you know, Zaslav has probably been one of the most upfront of the challenges and recognizing, hey, we got to cut this aggressively. And you see that in the free cash flow. I mean, there's no doubt they are deleveraging faster than investors expected because he realized there is no growth story left in the linear business.- Yeah. And Rich I wanted to ask a little bit about the sports rights picture, you know, maybe a little bit smaller for Warner than some of their other peers. But just where that fits in because as an outsider, you know, I see the salary cap going up for all the leagues, I see the rights projections going way higher, and yet you see the stocks and what's going on the dynamic you're talking about doesn't really add up to me.RICH GREENFIELD: Look, you're seeing it in local, right? The local sports side is imploding. If you look at Diamond sports which went bankrupt, it was owned by Sinclair Broadcasting. There's no doubt that local sports has imploded, and you're seeing all of the after effects of that right now. The question is going to be, is the local sports problem going to play out in national over the next few years? And look, it's possible it doesn't because you have digital players like Apple and Amazon and even Google that have come in.You know, Google Sunday Ticket, Amazon's bought Thursday Tonight Football, you're seeing Apple do MLS and probably do Pac-12 now. But look, all signs point to if the way you pay for sports is advertising and affiliate fees, meaning the cable and satellite fees, if those are the way you pay for sports rights and those fees are going down, it is hard, very hard to comprehend how sports rights keep going up. And that's going to be the challenge. And why the leagues so desperately need the digital players to step in because I don't think these legacy media companies are going to be able to keep paying more for rights as their revenues go down.JULIE HYMAN: So Rich, circling back around to Warner Brothers specifically. Zaslav on the call was asked about sports. He was asked about other things like the international push and licensing content. There's-- whatever of these media companies you're talking about, there's a lot of different facets, right? What does he need to be prioritizing for Warner Brothers right now?RICH GREENFIELD: Look, I think the question is, how much sports does he really need? Can he get out of-- you know, he pays a billion to a year for the NBA. Is there a way to create a smaller package where he, you know, reduces cost or at least holds costs? I mean, I think that's what investors are trying to understand. You heard a couple of the questions about sports.Like, I think everyone's trying to understand, you know, it's great that they're cutting costs right now, how much control of the cost structure do they have looking out over the next few years as the sports rights come up for bid, and can they resist-- you know, I think they're really going to look to Zaslav and hold him to it, can he resist overspending on sports rights given what's happening on the top line?JULIE HYMAN: It's a good question. We'll see. A little suspense here. Rich Greenfield, thank you so much. Always great to catch up with you, LightShed Partners partner.RICH GREENFIELD: Thanks for having me.JULIE HYMAN: Thank you.]"

(NYSE:TJX) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sure-check-tjx-companies-inc-100844600.html,1691143724,STORY,['TJX'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) is about to go ex-dividend in just 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Therefore, if you purchase TJX Companies' shares on or after the 9th of August, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 31st of August.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.33 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.33 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, TJX Companies has a trailing yield of approximately 1.5% on its current stock price of $86.02. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. View our latest analysis for TJX Companies Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see TJX Companies paying out a modest 37% of its earnings. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 35% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's positive to see that TJX Companies's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. For this reason, we're glad to see TJX Companies's earnings per share have risen 10% per annum over the last five years. The company has managed to grow earnings at a rapid rate, while reinvesting most of the profits within the business. Fast-growing businesses that are reinvesting heavily are enticing from a dividend perspective, especially since they can often increase the payout ratio later.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, TJX Companies has lifted its dividend by approximately 19% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.To Sum It UpIs TJX Companies worth buying for its dividend? TJX Companies has grown its earnings per share while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. Unfortunately it's cut the dividend at least once in the past 10 years, but the conservative payout ratio makes the current dividend look sustainable. There's a lot to like about TJX Companies, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.In light of that, while TJX Companies has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with TJX Companies and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

Amgen said it is discussing with regulators whether the data could be used to seek approval of the drug for patients with relapsed or refractory disease.Story continuesFor the full year, Amgen modestly raised its outlook for adjusted earnings per share to a range of $17.80 to $18.80 from its prior forecast of $17.40 to $18.60. The company also increased its outlook for 2023 revenue to $26.6 billion to $27.4 billion from $26 billion to $27.2 billion.Amgen said the forecast does not include any impact from the planned Horizon acquisition.In a lawsuit, the FTC said it believed Amgen could leverage its big selling drugs to pressure insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers to favor Horizon's two key products - thyroid eye disease treatment Tepezza and gout drug Krystexxa - over potential competitors.""We look forward to making our case in court in September,"" the CFO said.Amgen shares were up about half a percentage point at $232 after hours.(Reporting by Deena Beasley Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

It also starts with an A. That would be Amgen, though. We're switching to health care now. Its earnings its quarterly report card beating estimates on revenue and earnings per share. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani has been speaking with the company's top c-suite. And she has the details.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right. Amgen with a strong quarter again. Some interesting things to pull out, but just let's look at the top line numbers first. Of course, like you said, beating estimates, especially on revenue and adjusted earnings per share, coming in a little bit over at 8% up on that earnings per share, like you can see on your screen, as well as on the revenue side, beating out close to 7 billion. So that's where things are right now for the top line.Now, two major drugs that are in focus here for the company. One is Amjevita, that's the Humira-- or AbbVie's Humira biosimilar. They did report an increase in sales of about 29% but still a little bit slower than expected. So they missed on that one. And then LUMAKRAS, another drug that they have, did say that sales were flat essentially for that one. But they are expecting sort of more to come down the pike with more indications, currently working on other uses for the drug. So that's sort of where things look for them.Meanwhile, I did also ask CFO Peter Griffith about one of the topics that I think has been really interesting for pharma this season especially. And that's China, you know, just the strength of the Asia-Pacific market. And he did say that it came in for about 46% of revenue. And they did note that [INAUDIBLE] sales were quite strong this quarter. So that's an interesting sort of story that I've been seeing throughout the season.Story continuesMeanwhile, I also discussed the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act and Medicare drug pricing, which is really on the horizon for a lot of companies. And he had a really interesting comment about that. Peter Griffin told me, quote, well, ""We're well-positioned to manage through a declining price environment. We're valuing our portfolio, given the impact of this legislation, and we'll make appropriate resource allocation decisions but nothing abrupt.""So that's really interesting because it kind of falls in line with this, you know, talking point that the industry has had that it is going to impact innovation and how companies, even ones and especially ones as large as Amgen, will be operating. So should be interesting to see how that impacts in the second half of the year.DIANE KING HALL: Interesting, indeed. Anjalee Khemlani, thank you so much.]"

Amgen said it is discussing with regulators whether the data could be used to seek approval of the drug for patients with relapsed or refractory disease.Story continuesFor the full year, Amgen modestly raised its outlook for adjusted earnings per share to a range of $17.80 to $18.80 from its prior forecast of $17.40 to $18.60. The company also increased its outlook for 2023 revenue to $26.6 billion to $27.4 billion from $26 billion to $27.2 billion.Amgen said the forecast does not include any impact from the planned Horizon acquisition.In a lawsuit, the FTC said it believed Amgen could leverage its big selling drugs to pressure insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers to favor Horizon's two key products - thyroid eye disease treatment Tepezza and gout drug Krystexxa - over potential competitors.""We look forward to making our case in court in September,"" the CFO said.Amgen shares were up about half a percentage point at $232 after hours.(Reporting by Deena BeasleyEditing by Bill Berkrot)]"

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 82% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about General Dynamics. Check out our latest analysis for General Dynamics ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About General Dynamics?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in General Dynamics. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see General Dynamics' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. General Dynamics is not owned by hedge funds. LongView Asset Management, LLC is currently the company's largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.1% of common stock, and General Dynamics Corporation 401(K) Plan Master Trust holds about 6.1% of the company stock.Story continuesWe also observed that the top 10 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of General DynamicsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of General Dynamics Corporation in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$393m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 11% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand General Dynamics better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with General Dynamics .Ultimately the future is most important.

Today's Research Daily features a real-time update on the ongoing Q2 earnings season and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), General Dynamics Corporation (GD) and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all of this morning's results, we now have Q2 results from 394 S&amp;P 500 members or 78.8% of the index's membership. Total Q2 earnings for these 394 index members are down -11.8% from the same period last year on flat revenues (actually down -0.01%) from the year-earlier level, with 79.7% beating EPS estimates and 66% beating revenue estimates. Excluding the Energy sector drag where Q2 earnings and revenues are down -50.5% and -28% from the year-earlier levels, respectively, the earnings and revenue growth pace for the rest of the S&amp;P 500 index would be -5% and +4.8%, respectively. As we have noted all along since the start of this reporting cycle, the Q2 EPS beats percentage is tracking notably above what we had seen from this group in recent quarters as well as historically. This is significant since Q2 estimates had fallen less than was the case ahead of other recent quarters. We are seeing a similar  revisions trend at play for the current period (2023 Q3), with estimates holding up essentially unchanged since the start of the quarter. This is particulalry so on an ex-Energy basis. In fact, the aggregate ex-Energy earnings total for the rest of the S&amp;P 500 index is a hair up since June 27th, with Tech, Autos, Construction, Utilities and Transportation enjoying positive estimate revisions.

154,0b0936e2-a3fc-37f2-879f-d3b4b323f569,NEE,2023-08-04,20 Countries With Highest Cost Of Electricity,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-countries-highest-cost-electricity-140347672.html,1691071427,STORY,"['DUK', 'NEE']","[This article will cover countries where electricity prices are soaring and impacting the average utility bills. If you don't want to read about how electricity costs have changed in this recent inflation wave across the globe, go directly to 8 Countries With the Highest Cost Of Electricity. According to the World Energy Outlook 2022, electricity accounts for 20% of the world's total energy consumption. Countries with the highest cost of electricity usually face these intensive prices because of increasing demand and dependency on imported energy. For instance, Italy, Austria, and Belgium have the most expensive electricity in the world as these nations' consumption of electricity is import-driven. Other factors that make electricity a costly commodity are infrastructure challenges and state-imposed taxes on end-user electricity provision. Also, the cost of fossil fuels, which still constitute a substantial portion of electricity generation, is subject to fluctuating global markets. Volatility in these markets can drive up the cost of electricity. The commute and living costs are driving people to the edge; learn more about it by reading 30 Countries with the Highest Gas Prices.Electricity Market Outlook The global electricity market intertwines energy production, distribution, and consumption. The sector has undergone significant changes in recent years due to shifts in technology and consumer demand. According to Precedence Research, the electricity market is valued at over $1.94 trillion in 2023 and is expected to reach $3.9 trillion by 2032 at a CAGR of 8.4% between 2023 and 2032.As of 2023, global electricity demand stands at approximately 27,000 TWh per annum, an increase of around 2% from the previous year. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), electricity demand will pick up pace in 2024 and grow by 3.3% worldwide. Such high demand stems from population growth and economic development. According to estimates, the industrial sector consumes around 41.9% of the total electricity demand, followed by residential (26.92%) and commercial (21.5%) sectors.Story continuesIf we talk about per capita electricity consumption, it has steadily increased over the past decade, reaching around 3,500 kWh in 2023. As of the last count, approximately 87% of the global population has electricity access, although significant disparities exist between developed and developing regions. For instance, per capita energy use reaches 53000 kWh per year in Iceland and 23000 in Norway, while the average consumption stands at 211 kWh in the least developed countries. Notably, the electricity sector is seeing an ongoing shift towards renewable energy as the urgency of mitigating climate change is pushing nations to make concerted efforts to transition away from fossil fuels. As per Vantage Market Research, the renewable energy market, including wind, solar, and hydroelectric power, was valued at $988.26 billion in 2022 and is forecasted to reach $1.9 trillion by 2030 at a solid CAGR of around 8.6%.The Energy Information Association (EIA) projects that the world's energy requirements will see a 50% increase by 2050, out of which, electricity use makes up a substantial part. EIA says that the residential end-use sector will see the highest growth in delivered electricity consumption. These forecasts call for advanced electricity supply chains that make nations self-sufficient in electricity generation and distribution. In this aspect, the largest renewable energy companies, like NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE), are taking the lead. NexEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) is one of the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy, whose wind energy capacity has nearly tripled in the last decade. The company's generation capacity was 55,000 megawatts of generating capacity in 2020, with over 90% of its electricity derived from clean or renewable sources. NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) is also actively expanding its solar and wind capacity and is a key innovator in battery storage technology. Likewise, Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), one of the largest electric power holding companies in the US, is significantly invested in transitioning its energy portfolio towards cleaner sources. As of 2023, Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and plans to at least double its solar, wind, and other renewable energy resources portfolio by 2025. Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) provides electric power to approximately 8.2 million retail customers in six states in the Southeast and Midwest regions of the United States. Duke Energy also supplies natural gas to about 1.6 million customers across five states.Dominion Energy Inc. (NYSE:D) is another noteworthy name trying to make energy resource-intensive and has an installed capacity of 27,100 megawatts. As of current, Dominion Energy Inc. (NYSE:D) is providing clean energy to nearly 7 million people and is one of the nation's largest producers and transporters of energy. Out of the total electricity supplied by Dominion Energy Inc. (NYSE:D), 3100 megawatts come from clean energy, owing to its advanced solar initiatives. As the global electricity needs are going up, these companies' clean energy initiatives and innovative storage technology present a positive future outlook.We have already covered the Biggest Power Generation Companies in the world; read to know about big stakeholders in the energy grid. Let's now find which countries have the highest electricity costs.20 Countries With Highest Cost Of Electricity20 Countries With Highest Cost Of ElectricityOur Methodology To find electricity prices by country in 2023, we referred to the cost chart displayed on GlobalPetrolPrices. The countries with the highest cost of electricity have been ranked in ascending order of their electricity prices as of July, 2023. Based on our findings, these are the countries with the most expensive electricity in 2023:  20. JamaicaAverage Electricity Cost Kilowatt Per Hour: $0.327As of 2023, the average residential electricity rate is $0.327 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in Jamaica. The price is affected by the country's reliance on imported fossil fuels for power generation. Although initiatives to shift towards renewable energy sources have been initiated, the transition is slow, maintaining Jamaica's position among the countries with the highest cost of electricity.19. Luxembourg Average Electricity Cost Kilowatt Per Hour: $0.335Despite being one of the richest countries, Luxembourg experiences high electricity costs, currently at $0.335 per kWh. Luxembourg's high electricity prices are largely influenced by the country's lack of natural resources, which results in energy imports. The cost is further amplified by high taxes and levies imposed on energy.18. Switzerland Average Electricity Cost Kilowatt Per Hour: $0.343Switzerland's high electricity prices come from the cost of maintaining its energy mix and transmission infrastructure. The average electricity cost for Swiss households is about $0.343 per kWh. Also, the country relies heavily on hydropower and nuclear energy, but costs remain intense due to a commitment to energy transition and the decommissioning of nuclear power plants.17. Cyprus Average Electricity Cost Kilowatt Per Hour: $0.368High electricity costs in Cyprus stem from the island nation's geographic isolation and lack of interconnections with neighboring countries. While we see some ongoing efforts towards renewables, the energy sector still relies on imported fossil fuels, boosting electricity costs. 16. Finland Average Electricity Cost Kilowatt Per Hour: $0.371According to the International Energy Agency, Finland has a low reliance on fossil fuels. The country's current dependence on fossil fuels is 36%, well below the IEA average of 70%. However, since Finland has no domestic fossil fuel production and imports crude oil, natural gas, and coal, the country's end-user electricity costs are high.15. Bermuda Average Electricity Cost Kilowatt Per Hour: $0.427Bermuda also heavily depends on imported fuel for power generation, which translates to expensive electricity. Not having significant local energy resources, combined with the geographical isolation and expensive infrastructure upkeep, contribute to this situation. The Bermuda Electric Light Company Limited (BELCO), the sole electricity supplier on the island, operates diesel-powered generating plants. In 2023, these plants still account for over 90% of the island's electricity supply.14. Sweden Average Electricity Cost Kilowatt Per Hour: $0.438Sweden records an extensive use of renewable energy sources, but the country's electricity costs are still high. It's because regular infrastructure maintenance and continuous investments are required for green technologies. Also, the country's high taxes and regulatory costs make basic utilities like electricity costly. Sweden's commitment to phasing out nuclear power adds to the future cost uncertainty as it is currently responsible for the nation's 40% electricity. 13. Latvia Average Electricity Cost Kilowatt Per Hour: $0.477Latvia faces high electricity prices because of imports, primarily coming from Estonia and Lithuania. High transmission costs and the expenses associated with upgrading aging power infrastructure also elevate electricity prices in Latvia. As Latvia's grid becomes more integrated with the rest of Europe, these costs are expected to remain high in the near future. 12. Czech Republic Average Electricity Cost Kilowatt Per Hour: $0.455The Czech Republic's considerable amount of electricity is generated from coal. Therefore, the costs associated with emissions and environmental regulations have resulted in soaring energy prices. The country's ongoing transition towards renewable energy sources also contributes to the rise in electricity costs due to investment in new technologies and infrastructure. 11. Estonia Average Electricity Cost Kilowatt Per Hour: $0.475Estonia's electricity costs are amplified by its use of imported energy resources. The Baltic country relies on power sources like shale oil and renewable energy, but due to the challenges of extraction and implementation, costs remain high. Moreover, its connection to the European electricity grid and the necessity to abide by European Union carbon pricing can also elevate these costs.10. Cayman Islands Average Electricity Cost Kilowatt Per Hour: $0.481As a group of islands, Cayman Islands' challenges differ from other countries that boost electricity costs. The Islands lack local fossil fuel resources and depend on imported oil for power generation. Likewise, the geographical dispersion of the islands makes extensive power grid infrastructures resource-intensive. On top of this, the tropical climate results in high energy demands for air conditioning.9. United Kingdom Average Electricity Cost Kilowatt Per Hour: $0.495The transition towards low-carbon and renewable energy sources in the UK is beneficial for environmental sustainability. But at the same time, it has necessitated significant infrastructural changes, thereby inflating costs. The UK's extensive regulations and taxes related to carbon emissions also show in the people's electricity bills. Click to continue reading 8 Countries With Highest Cost Of Electricity.Suggested ArticlesTop 20 Countries with Highest Electricity Consumption20 Worst States to Retire in for Taxes and Cost of Living20 Countries That Produce the Most Electric Power Disclosure: None. 20 Countries With Highest Cost Of Electricity is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

MAS, Option Care Health OPCH, Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure SOI and PulteGroup PHM.Time to Add These 5 Relative Price Strength StocksWall Street experienced a strong rebound in the first seven months of 2023, recovering from the disappointments of the previous year. The S&amp;P 500 Index surged nearly 20% during this period. This positive performance can be attributed to the steady decline in inflation rates, a strong labor market and the Federal Reserve's decision to reduce the magnitude of interest rate hikes. The bullish sentiment has even led to U.S. consumer sentiment jumping to the highest level in almost two years.In particular, the inflation rate is dwindling steadily since June 2022. Consequently, the Fed is approaching the end of its ongoing interest rate hike cycle. The central bank is now more confident about the soft landing of the economy. This could mean a brightening outlook for the stock market.Investors who want to take advantage of the bullish equity setup should focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.Relative Price Strength StrategyInvestors generally gauge a stock's potential returns by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples. At the same time, it's essential to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers, or an appropriate benchmark. If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors, it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative. However, those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance of providing considerable returns. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Story continuesFinally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies.

You can skip our comprehensive analysis of the global meat consumption stats and proceed directly to the 5 Most Consumed Meats in the World.Meat consumption holds considerable importance in diets across the globe and plays a crucial role in shaping diverse cultures and societies. The global consumption of meat has seen significant growth over the years, but it is also accompanied by various trends, regional variations, and cultural influences that shape the way meat is consumed in different parts of the world. As noted by the Statista, the meat market is projected to achieve a revenue of $1,378.00 billion in 2023, with an anticipated Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 6.35% from 2023-2028. Notably, China leads the global comparison by generating the most significant revenue, amounting to $260.40 billion in 2023. Additionally, the volume of the meat market is predicted to rise to 182.10 billion kg by 2028, showing a growth rate of 3.3% in 2024. On an individual basis, the average volume per person in the meat market is projected to be 20.43 kg in 2023.Global Meat ConsumptionMeat consumption on a global scale has been steadily increasing for several decades. The growing population, rising incomes in developing countries, and changes in dietary preferences have contributed to this trend. As a result, the demand for meat has surged, leading to the expansion of the meat industry worldwide. To gain a comprehensive insight into meat consumption patterns, the article Top 20 Countries with the Highest Meat Consumption offers an in-depth and detailed analysis.The Statesman’s report observed that global meat consumption reached 346.14 million tons annually in 2018. By the year 2030, it is anticipated that this figure will rise to 453 million tons, indicating a 24% increase. Although the projections for future world meat demand remain uncertain, estimates range from 375 to 570 million tons by 2050. This potential growth represents an increase of 70 to 160% compared to the levels in 2000.Story continuesThe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has recently published its biannual report on the worldwide food markets. According to the report, it is projected that the global expenditure on food will reach $1.98 trillion in 2023, demonstrating a 1.5% growth compared to the previous year. The anticipated global meat production for the year 2023 is expected to experience a slight rise to 363.9 million tons carcass weight equivalent, showing a marginal increase from the 362.6 million tons recorded in the previous year.The global meat industry is influenced by industry leaders like Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN), Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL), JBS S.A., Cargill, Smithfield Foods, and The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR). Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) offers diverse meat products, while Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) is famous for SPAM and other goods. JBS S.A., is a Brazilian giant in beef, poultry, and pork, and Cargill operates in commodities and meat processing and Smithfield Foods is a major pork player acquired by WH Group. These companies adapt to changing consumer preferences and environmental concerns alongside the rise of plant-based alternatives. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), a significant retailer, also plays a vital role in shaping the industry's supply and demand dynamics.Taking this context into account, let's proceed to examine the most consumed meats in the world rankings.15 Most Consumed Meats in the WorldMethodologyWe undertook a thorough investigation of terrestrial and marine animals to rank the most consumed meats worldwide. For certain types of meat, due to limited consumption data, our analysis involved taking their production levels measured in tons as proxy. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of our findings, we employed data from reputable sources, including Science Direct, IGI Global, and Helgi Library. Additionally, we utilized Vivid Maps exclusively to obtain precise information on consumption levels. The organized list is presented in ascending order, with the meat type boasting the highest consumption level occupying the top position. The consumption levels which we have found directly are for the year 2021. Note: We estimated Venison meat consumption levels by analyzing the annual number of slaughters, given the limitations of both restricted consumption and production data.Below presented is our list of the 15 Most Consumed Meats in the World:15. VenisonConsumption 2020 (estimated): 30,800 tonsAs per the findings in the Nature Journal, an annual count of 440,000 deer is harvested for meat consumption. Based on this number, we estimate a production of 61,600,000 pounds of meat. Converting to tons gives approximately 30,800 tons of meat from this population. The worldwide venison market was valued at $1.7448 billion in the year 2021, with projections indicating that it will reach $2.3035 billion by 2028, showcasing a CAGR of 4% over the forecasted period.14.

TSN is likely to register top-line growth when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on Aug 7.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $13,776 million, suggesting 2.1% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line has declined by 8.1% to 34 cents per share over the past 30 days. The projection indicates a decrease of 82.5% from the figure reported in the year-ago period quarter. The meat product company has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 36.1%, on average.Factors to ConsiderTyson Foods has been benefiting from its focus on three main pillars. These include driving growth across the core protein platform. The company expects global demand for protein to continue rising and remains well-placed to cater to it.Tyson Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTyson Foods, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Tyson Foods, Inc. QuoteNext, TSN aims to fuel growth through its robust brands, which include more than 30 prepared food and snacking brands. Thirdly, Tyson Foods is focused on prudent international expansion. It expects most of the protein consumption growth to take place outside the United States. The company is focused on making the most of this opportunity by scaling its existing business, strengthening its customer base and exploring new markets.The United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) projects fiscal 2023 domestic protein production (beef, pork, chicken and turkey) to increase slightly from the fiscal 2022 level. For the fiscal, the company expects better results from its foreign operations in the International/Other segment. These aspects, together with Tyson Foods’ measures to boost efficiency, bode well for the quarter under review.However, softness in the Beef segment is a concern. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, sales in the Beef segment declined 8.3% to $4,617 million. Volumes dropped 2.9% due to reduced head processed, and the average price fell 5.4% owing to lower domestic demand and weaker export markets. For the Beef segment, the USDA projects domestic production to fall 4% year over year in fiscal 2023. Also, management expects Beef segment margins between a 1% loss and a 1% gain due to the deterioration of the current market scenario. These factors raise concerns for the third quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter sales for the Beef segment currently stands at $4,175 million compared with $4,366 million reported in the year-ago period.Increased input costs also remain a downside. Incidentally, Tyson Foods witnessed elevated input costs per pound in most segments in the last reported quarter, mainly due to the inflated costs of raw materials and labor.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Tyson Foods this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.Tyson Foods has an Earnings ESP of -41.18% and a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

Riley Securities, Inc., Research DivisionSimon William Flannery; MD; Morgan Stanley, Research DivisionPresentationOperatorGood morning, and welcome to the Globalstar Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. I will now turn the call over to Jay Monroe.James MonroeThanks, everybody, for joining today's Globalstar's Second Quarter 2023 Investor Call. In keeping with recent practice, I will make very brief opening remarks, and then we'll move straight to Q&amp;A.But first, please note that today's call contains forward-looking statements intended to fall within the safe harbor provided under the securities laws. Factors that could cause the results to differ materially are described in the forward-looking statements and Risk Factors section of Globalstar's SEC filings including its annual report on Form 10-K and for the financial year ending 2022 as well as this morning's earnings release.As outlined in the release, Globalstar continued to see robust growth and a significant improvement in profitability, resulting in a 50% increase in revenue over the prior year's quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was up 86% over the same period. And for the first half of 2023, our revenue was up more than 60% to $113 million and EBITDA was almost $60 million, an increase of over 140%. Our liquidity ended the quarter with $65 million, more than double our cash balance at year-end. Service revenue, unrelated to our wholesale business increased, reflecting organic growth in our commercial IoT business.We expect this to continue, propelled by the launch of new 2-way device platform and services later this year. Average revenue per subscriber is expected to increase meaningfully after that introduction. As a result of these factors, we are increasing the low end of our 2023 revenue guidance from $185 million to $200 million and reiterating a forecasted adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 55%, not including spectrum revenue.A brief update on our Band 53 efforts. We are working on many fronts and engaged in engineering efforts with a wide range of companies which are working on Band 53 deployments. Our opportunity set is truly unique given, among other things, the installed base of devices capable of using Band 53 continues to grow. We expect it to be in hundreds of millions of devices by this time next year.And we are also making great progress with the strategic collaboration agreement we signed with Qualcomm earlier this year. This agreement increases the range of infrastructure available for Band 53 deployments and further drives device adoption. With Qualcomm and their system integrator partners, we are simplifying private wireless deployments, so Band 53 can be rolled out ubiquitously around the world.Industrial and security of critical infrastructure, our macro trends driving private wireless today and they're driving it on a global basis. We are a great resource with the right ecosystem to deliver for this growing demand, specifically regarding the opportunities that we discussed during the first quarter call. We are in the midst of final engineering validation and are looking forward to sharing more detail about these shortly. We hope you understand that timing is not within our control. The engineering is driven by the technical demands of the individual projects, not by our public company reporting calendar.Finally, I want to reiterate my sentiment from last quarter. I do not believe the current market price of our stock reflects the company's value. When participating in multiple investment conferences this past quarter, we heard questions about whether our transformation and growth is sustainable. My simple answer is yes. Globalstar has invested over $1 billion during the past decade, rebuilding our satellite and ground network, innovating to bring Band 53 to market, delivering revolutionary satellite services which went operational in November and putting other resources in place to prepare for this moment. I am absolutely confident that we will continue to execute and deliver increasing revenue, EBITDA and shareholder value.Now we'll open the call up to Q&amp;A. We have today available to answer questions, Dave, Rebecca, Kyle and Tim. It would be helpful if you would direct your questions to whomever you prefer. As a reminder, we are still not able to answer questions related to our wholesale partners' activities or future plans in the direct to handset market. And we thank you in advance for focusing your questions on other parts of our business. And of course, our financial results. Operator, we can begin Q&amp;A.Story continuesQuestion and Answer SessionOperatorOur first question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.Simon William FlanneryThis may be for you, Jay, but I just wanted to get an update on the construction of the new satellite constellation. Any sense on where you are on the milestones and the ultimate launch timing and how we think about payments and cash flows through the balance of the year. And then maybe just if you could just comment on the SPOT outlook and the supply chain and how that should normalize.James MonroeSure. Simon, why don't we break that into 3 different people to answer the questions that you've asked. Tim, if you would talk first just about the status of the contract. Rebecca, then about the cash flow implications to us and the funding sources. And Dave, hopefully, you can tackle the question on SPOT.Timothy Evan TaylorSure. Thanks, Simon. So MDA has been working tirelessly as the prime on the contract and developer of the payload, while Rocket Lab has been delivering per the schedule. And it's clear that the benefits of their years long acquisition and integration of leading critical subsystem developers is proving successful in this program. We're just about to enter a critical design review, will take place through the large part of August. And we're still on pace to complete satellite acceptance as scheduled originally in the contract and to launch the satellite in 2 years during 2025.Rebecca S. ClarySimon, it's Rebecca. So on the payment load side of things. So we've incurred $166 million roughly under the $327 million contract with MDA of the $166 million, we've paid about $108 million. The balance will be paid when due. So we're on track there, as Tim just mentioned and under the 2023 funding agreement with our partner, of 50% of milestones will be paid by them, funded through that agreement and the remaining 50% will be paid through our own operating cash flow. So as those milestones are completed and payments are due, we will pay them in line with that agreement.Simon William FlannerySo the critical design review of that -- once that's done, then you will be due in other payments, or you'll be due to make another payment.Rebecca S. ClaryThat's right.David B. KaganSimon, this is Dave. Yes. As of mid-April, all of the supply chain issues are now behind us. We are in full production. And in fact, we're building safety stock. Our goal is to build 6 months of safety stock for each of the main products. We're well on the path of doing that. Demand is still robust. It's a little bit of a process to refill up the retail chain, which that is also underway and our big box retailers, the REI, Bass Pro, Cabela's, West Marine. They're all ordering healthy and we see continued success on the SPOT business. We're pretty satisfied where we are at this point.Simon William FlannerySo we should see a reacceleration in Q3, Q4?David B. KaganYes. And we're already starting to see that pick up. We see the orders in advance, of course. And so they are all there. And we're also seeing, given the summer period an increase in saves that we're making with our SPOT products as well. So everything has been normalized, and we feel good about where we are.Simon William FlanneryGreat. And maybe just one clarification. I think you said the low end of the guidance you're raising. And I think you said because you were confident on the trajectory of service revenues, driven largely by your excitement about commercial IT. Is that what you're trying to say?James MonroeThat's correct. Absolutely, Simon. And Dave, maybe you can tackle the 2-way as well for the answer of SPOT question.David B. KaganAbsolutely, yes. So on the 2-way side, we are making great progress. This is not just a product launch. This is also an entire infrastructure platform launch. Half of the infrastructure is already at every gateway that we needed to be. And that has proven to be very successful. We're seeing a significant uptick in unique messages processed as much as 30%.The second half of the infrastructure is being worked on as we speak, and we're getting a lot of good tests, hitting all the milestones that we need to come into beta by the end of the year with the product. We also just received what's known as the X1 build, which is the first initial Board. And those boards are able to be brought up on the network. And so again, we're hitting the milestones there as well. So we do believe we'll be in beta with key customers by the end of the year with the product and the entire ecosystem.OperatorOur next question comes from George Sutton with Craig-Hallum.George Frederick SuttonI'll address this question to Jay. Your IoT activation growth was effectively double what we had modeled. And I'm curious if you can give us a sense of the breadth of where that growth is coming from? Was that a specifically large implementation or are you seeing a broader demand curve change?James MonroeGeorge, I think the best one to answer that is Dave, CEO. He's involved in those discussions all the way down to the sales funnel. So Dave, can you answer George's question, please?David B. KaganSure, absolutely. Yes. It's not any one in particular significant customer demand is across the broad breadth of all of our customers. And obviously, some of it is in all the different verticals that we're seeing in transportation, oil and gas, all those markets seem to be rebounding with other folks dealing with the end of their supply chain issues as well because a lot of our customers build our modules into their products. And so I think it's broad, which we're glad about. And we just see a very robust and strong pipeline as we continue to go through the year.George Frederick SuttonGot you. And I think that helps address Jay's point on sustainability of the growth. So One other question, I'm not sure who to address it to, but on the country updates for Band 53, can you just give us a sense of how many opportunities we are focused on right now and any sort of time frame or expectations?James MonroeSure, you're asking about new countries or developments within the countries we already have licenses in.George Frederick SuttonNew countries to expand our presence.James MonroeYes. Okay. Very good. That is continuing. We're in discussions with a number of regulators right now. And on a global basis, they put things out for notices, and those notices have started to come in a couple of different countries in Europe, and we expect more of those in the near term. We also have a couple of other countries that are very far along in the process. We never identify which one until it comes through. I apologize for that kind of in advance. But we have other countries that are deep into their process, and we hope that we'll be able to announce something in the coming months or at least one, but there are a few others. And of course, the ones that happened in Europe, we believe, will happen more frequently now after we receive Spain and went through the broad EU technical process. it's now to be implemented in each country, but you have to do that country by country. Is that a complete answer for you?OperatorAnd our next question comes from Mike Crawford at B. Riley Securities.Michael Roy CrawfordI'm not sure if this is going to be for Kyle or you, Jay, but on your last call, it seems that you went into more detail on specific engineering NRE and licensing opportunities for Band 53 including one deal that was signed and expected to generate $30 million of NRE over like maybe an 18-month period. I'm wondering if that time frame has changed. And this said, there was another replicable deal related to private LTE for critical infrastructure that was near being signed than others in the works. But could you just maybe fill in the blanks on those issues?James MonroeSure, I can. And Kyle chime in as well. But Mike, the ones that we talked about last quarter are the ones I was referring to a moment ago when I said that they are in the final throes of the technical work that needs to be done. We had hoped, of course, that it would have been done in 90 days, but it looks like it's just going to take a little bit longer. That applies to both the project that you referred to that had the $30 million of NRE associated with it and the other critical infrastructure project that we talked about. Both are I mean, we look at them every single day, as you might imagine and work them every single day. But it is one of these deals where the technical work is just taking a little bit longer than we wanted and hope to have an announcement on one or both of those that we won't have to wait another 90 days to announce.Kyle PickensYes. I think that's most of it. The other thing to think about, Mike, I mean, these are very, very long-term deals. And so it's very important that we get them exactly right going into them because once we deploy these. They're in place for 15 to 30 years.James MonroeMike, one other thing that I'll add to Kyle's point, that we're talking about these 2 because they're close and the engineering has proceeded well, and we feel like we can push those through quickly. But we do have as I mentioned in my short prepared remarks, a lot of additional discussions that are ongoing, either through the Qualcomm service integrator channel as well as with a ton of other individual companies that are testing or starting to test the band.And in part, they're doing that because the ecosystem for both the infrastructure, which is the Qualcomm component of it as well as the chipset, which is another piece of Qualcomm, which has proliferated now into basically any device that Qualcomm sells. So it will be available, and that broadens the interest on the part of the users of these private network implementation. So we are extremely bullish on what the future looks like. We're looking at distribution centers where people are testing. We're looking at other types of infrastructure, particularly critical infrastructure, which benefits from having totally licensed spectrum and all of those opportunities are maturing. But I think it's safe to say that now that the ecosystem on the infrastructure side as well as on the handset side has evolved so rapidly that it's a whole lot easier to entertain these conversations with companies that want to have them now.Michael Roy CrawfordOkay. And then just a final question is, given that you now have wholesale partner revenue, a large component of which I believe is fixed and some variable, what would have to happen for Globalstar to only recognize $86 million of revenue in the second half of the year to hit the raised lower end of your guidance?Rebecca S. ClaryYes. Thanks for the question, Mike. So I mean, if you just take the run rate where we are right now, you get to the lower end of the guidance. So I'm not sure exactly if I followed the question. But I think that just based on the results year-to-date and midway through the year, as we sit here in early August, it makes sense. We know enough about the balance of the year to tighten that range.Michael Roy CrawfordOkay. I thought the company had $113.7 million of revenue in the first half of the year.Rebecca S. ClarySome of that is nonrecurring. As we talked about last quarter, just about $6 million or $7 million that we recognized in the first quarter. We've also talked about just kind of the variability and the lumpiness, I guess, that results from that and the revenue recognized under the contract. And that's just one example. So while that particular item might not be recurring, there might be something else that replaces it. But it's a little too soon to be precise on that, right? So if you remove that from the run rate, you get to the numbers that we're forecasting.OperatorIf there are no further questions, I will turn the call back over to Jay Monroe for closing remarks.James MonroeThanks, everyone, for joining the call today, whether you're on the phone or on the webcast. We appreciate the attention and are obviously very, very pleased with the financial results and anticipate those results continuing and growing and look forward to an opportunity to talk to any of you who would like to, from time to time. Otherwise, we'll reconvene again in 90 days. Have a great day. Thank you.OperatorThis meeting is now concluded. You may now disconnect.]"

And with that, let me turn the call over to Peter.Story continuesPeter Maxwell KernThanks, Harshit, and good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. Travel demand has remained robust, and we are pleased to see our continued execution result and solid performance for the second quarter. As gratifying as those results are, I'm even more excited with the progress on our platform transformation journey, having just launched One Key in the U.S. and continuing to be on schedule with our Vrbo migration.We are particularly pleased that we were able to meet our second quarter financial goals while electing to move some marketing spend from Q2 to Q3, where we believe it can better -- can be better spent in support of the launch of One Key and our accelerated growth in the back half of the year. Industry trends have remained broadly consistent with the first quarter, demand in North America and Europe has remained stable with stronger growth in APAC and Latin America. Travelers worldwide continue to favor shorter stays in urban locations versus longer trips in sun and ski destinations. As far as pricing, both hotel and vacation rental ADRs are holding up year-over-year, while international cross-border air fares are stable. U.S. domestic air fares have seen some declines as capacity increases. Rental car rates continue to decline as inventories normalized from compressed levels last year, resulting in more attractive prices for consumers and more transactions. Overall, the data continues to show that travel remains a top priority for consumers. As I've explained before, our B2C strategy is to build products, features and customer propositions that attract and help us retain valuable customers and to move those customers into loyalty membership and app usage to amplify their value. These travelers drive higher profits per transaction and higher repeat rates, ultimately leading to higher lifetime value. In addition, as these customers have a higher propensity to come to us through direct channels, this helps us drive future leverage in sales and marketing. As a combination of all of these factors, these travelers have a much higher return on investment and ultimately drive more profitable and faster growth as they stack up over time. As we continue to move from a purely transaction room night focused world, to one in which we focus on customers and lifetime value, we've been able to build a bigger, more valuable base of these high ROI travelers. Our focus on acquiring and retaining loyalty members and app users to drive this strategy continues to show good results. This quarter, active loyalty members continued to hit new highs and were up 15% year-over-year in our core brands and the percentage of bookings coming through our apps was up 300 basis points sequentially versus the first quarter. We know that members with the app have the best economics, which is why we have been so focused on growing this segment of customers. In our Expedia brand in the U.S., I am pleased to say that we have seen this cohort of customers increased to roughly 135% versus 2019. As we roll out our strategy across all our brands and all our markets, there remains significant opportunity to accelerate further. A couple of weeks ago, we took another major step forward with the launch of One Key in the U.S. This is the most flexible travel rewards program in the industry, with our core brands unified under one loyalty program offering our customers the ability to earn and use One Key cash, a simple common currency across our vast breadth of flights, hotels, vacation rentals, car rentals, cruises and activities. In addition to the breadth of this program, this marks the first time any major vacation rental marketplace will have loyalty which is a significant differentiator against our competition. It's early days, but as we have seen historically, our loyalty members are much more productive. And with this now best-in-class program spanning our biggest brands, we expect to drive many more customers into the program and substantially increase our base of loyal travelers. Overall, our B2C business is finally nearing the end of its major changes and piece by piece, getting the benefit of new capabilities and greater agility that comes from a unified stack. With One Key at the door, our last major tech lift is the Vrbo migration to our main platform. We have already moved 100% of our Vrbo U.S. web traffic to the platform and are on track to complete the migration during the fourth quarter. As we've explained before, we expect some modest headwinds to conversion as we transition. But ultimately, the payoff is well worth it with better conversion, increased feature velocity and ultimately better performance from Vrbo overall. Our single tech strategy is designed to give all of our brands the benefit of our entire suite of product features, including our latest advancements in AI and machine learning to personalize and enhance the customer experience. On the topic of AI, earlier this year, we launched conversational trip planning powered by Chat GPT and the Expedia iOS app. And last month, we launched it on the Expedia Android app. We have been learning from consumer interactions and are adding a number of new features to help consumers on their journey of discovery. Travelers can now start a new conversation by choosing from suggested prompts and soon they will be able to return to a conversation at any time and even respond throughout a conversation by simply choosing a suggested response, all of which is designed to bring them one step closer to booking their desired trip. Beyond the growth and progress we've seen with our brands, we continue to see tremendous momentum in our B2B business, which grew revenue 32% year-over-year in the second quarter. Our B2B business has greater exposure outside the U.S. and has benefited by continued opening of markets around the world. The engine for our B2B business is fueled by the same technology, supply and service that serve our own brands. And as we have advanced in all areas over the last several years, this has only added to the velocity of our B2B business. We believe we have the most successful and differentiated business in the travel world with a large addressable segment still available to penetrate further. And our wins in the marketplace continue to demonstrate that point. In the second quarter, we announced a new partnership with Mastercard where our tech will power Mastercard's global network of issuers so that their customers can spend their loyalty points on great travel experiences. And then another huge development for this segment, we teamed up with Walmart where we are now powering their first ever travel benefit for Walmart Plus members through our White-Label Template solution. We also continue to expand our tech delivery to our existing partners, not only through our core travel OS products, but through our expanding offering of solutions. After recently commercializing our fraud prevention capability, I'm happy to announce that our revenue performance API is now in pilot with one of the largest hotel management companies. As our tech continues to advance, driven by our industry-leading AI capabilities and the acceleration of our single platform strategy, there is much more opportunity to gain wallet share with our existing partners and to scale further with new partners. So overall, I'm very pleased with the momentum we now have and our accelerating product improvements as we move towards the second half of '23 and beyond. Over the last few years, we have taken on many difficult challenges in order to transform not only our tech but our entire strategy. As we begin to emerge from this period of massive change, it is clear that we are building the best offerings for travelers, a better marketplace for our partners and overall, a better company. It is great to see so much finally coming to fruition and our entire organization is excited about the future. And with that, let me hand it over to Julie.Julie P. WhalenThanks, Peter, and hello, everyone. Our second quarter results with record revenue and EBITDA demonstrate that our strategic initiatives are working and that we have a significant opportunity for long-term growth and profitability. And it is this ongoing strength in the business that enabled us to deliver another quarter of accelerated levels of share repurchases, resulting in approximately $1.2 billion repurchased year-to-date, our largest buyback to date. Before I jump into more of the details, I wanted to remind you that going forward, all financial comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis. It is also important to note that our second quarter 2023 growth rates as compared to 2022 were impacted by FX headwinds of approximately 40 basis points to gross bookings, 170 basis points to revenue and 530 basis points to EBITDA. We also saw an approximate 80 basis point headwind to the EBITDA margin. Now as far as our performance this quarter, let's begin with our gross booking trends. Total gross bookings of $27.3 billion, were up 5% versus last year and in line with our mid-single-digit top line guide. Growth was driven by lodging gross bookings, which were up 7% and were the highest second quarter on record.The strength continues to be driven by our hotel business, which achieved record gross bookings, primarily from strength in our B2B business, as well as in Brand Expedia, which saw 15% increase year-over-year. This was partially offset by our Vrbo business, which was impacted by the shift in consumer demand toward urban markets and shorter length of stays, as well as the impact from Vrbo's tech platform migration that we mentioned on last quarter's earnings call. However, given the size and strong growth of our hotel business, we were pleased that we were able to deliver record lodging bookings in total. Moving to the key financial metrics in the P&amp;L, starting with total revenue. Revenue of $3.4 billion, was up 6% versus last year, in line with our mid-single-digit top line guide and was the highest second quarter on record. Revenue growth was primarily driven by the continued strength across our lodging business, which grew 12%. This was partially offset by softness we have been seeing in insurance and car, 2 categories that have been impacted by some industry-wide changes post pandemic. For insurance, we are seeing lower attach rates as consumers' appetite for insurance normalizes. And for car, we are continuing to see rates decline as supply has increased. Total revenue margin increased 10 basis points to approximately 12.3% versus last year, primarily due to an increased mix shift to lodging revenue, which has higher revenue margins. Cost of sales was $403 million for the quarter, which is lower than last year by $13 million or 3% with approximately 110 basis points of leverage as a percentage of revenue versus the second quarter of 2022, driven by ongoing efficiencies across our customer support and other operations. Our customer support operations continue to benefit from the various automation initiatives we have implemented over the past couple of years, and we will continue to find more efficiencies in such areas as the cloud and license and maintenance costs when we finalize our migration to one platform and eliminate redundant systems accordingly. Direct sales and marketing expense in the second quarter was $1.6 billion, which was up 2% versus the second quarter of 2022. The primary driver of this year-over-year increase was related to an increase in commissions in our B2B business to support its strong growth of over 32%. As we've noted in the past, commissions paid to our B2B partners fall into our direct sales and marketing line and overall are more expensive as a percentage of revenue than our B2C business, but as they are generally paid on a state basis and to a contractually agreed-upon percentage, the returns are more guaranteed and immediate. This increase in B2B direct marketing costs was mostly offset by marketing efficiencies in our B2C business this quarter, and resulted in marketing leverage as a percentage of gross bookings as compared to the second quarter of 2022. These B2C marketing efficiencies resulted from the benefits we are seeing from our continued investments in loyalty and app members, as well as our decision to move some of our planned spend from the second quarter to the third quarter to tie it more closely with One Key launch and to support our accelerated growth in the back half. While marketing will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we were pleased to see this marketing leverage. Overhead expenses were $627 million, an increase of $77 million versus last year or 14%. While we remain disciplined on our overall cost structure, as we have said over the past year, we have continued to invest in talent across our product and technology teams to support our strategic initiatives and we're pleased we were able to more readily fill these positions given the surplus of top-tier tech talent in the market. We also saw higher salary expense associated with our annual compensation increases this year, which went into effect during the second quarter and was the primary driver of the overhead increase from the first quarter. As we finish our technology work in the coming quarters and look to redeploy resources and deprecate systems next year, we expect to realize cost efficiencies going forward. Despite this overhead pressure, we are pleased to see that with another quarter of strong revenue and overall expense discipline, including our decision to shift some marketing spend, we delivered record second quarter EBITDA of $747 million which was up 15% with an EBITDA margin of 22.2%, expanding approximately 190 basis points versus the second quarter of 2022. Our free cash flow remained strong at $3.8 billion year-to-date. The year-over-year decline is primarily associated with changes in working capital from the timing of payments. Last year, as the business emerged from Omicron, we saw meaningful increases in some of the working capital drivers like payables, which has since normalized this year. We remain pleased with an ongoing robust cash flow levels, and we expect them to remain strong in the year. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $8.8 billion, driven by our unrestricted cash balance of $6.3 billion and our undrawn revolving line of credit of $2.5 billion, which provides us with ample access to cash to operate the business. From a debt perspective, our debt level remains at approximately $6.3 billion. But with our expanding EBITDA, our gross leverage ratio has come down from the first quarter to 2.6x. We have started to make progress towards our target gross leverage ratio of 2x and expect to make continued progress in the coming quarters through EBITDA growth and potentially some debt repayment. As far as capital allocation, given our strong free cash flow levels and a stock price that we believe remains undervalued, we have been buying back our stock on an accelerated basis to maximize our return of capital to shareholders.As a result, we bought back approximately $1.2 billion year-to-date or nearly 12 million shares, our largest level of repurchases to date. We continue to believe that our stock price remains undervalued and does not reflect our confidence in the expected long-term performance of the business. Therefore, considering our ongoing strong liquidity and free cash flow, we expect to continue buying back our stock opportunistically throughout the remainder of 2023. Looking ahead, we are reiterating our full year outlook of double-digit top line growth with margin expansion. As it relates to the third quarter, we expect year-over-year gross bookings growth to accelerate to high-single digits. This acceleration is driven by Brand Expedia and HCOM, partially offset by Vrbo, which continues to face short-term headwinds from its migration. While we expect revenue growth to be lower than gross bookings growth driven by the prior quarter's reduced Vrbo bookings converting to stays and therefore, revenue in the third quarter, which is historically our highest revenue quarter for Vrbo, we expect revenue growth to see modest sequential acceleration. We expect EBITDA margins to stay relatively in line with last year. While we expect to see continued cost of sales leverage, as previously mentioned, we will be investing in marketing to support the One Key launch and to set us up for a strong back half. Overall, we expect fourth quarter will see a more meaningful acceleration in both top line and bottom line growth as Vrbo finishes its migration, the One Key impact starts to kick in and the growing base of app members drives more production, all of which gives us confidence to reiterate our full year outlook. In closing, we finished the front half of 2023 on a strong note with record second quarter revenue and EBITDA. We are pleased to see the continued momentum even while we continue to transform the business and navigate associated headwinds. Our accelerating product improvements give us confidence that we are on the right path and that there is a huge opportunity in front of us to drive long-term profitable growth and to maximize shareholder returns. And with that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs.Eric James SheridanTwo, if I could. In terms of forward booking trends, I understood on the commentary broadly about the summer, but the industry obviously had some tailwinds from elements of longer booking dynamics as we've come out of the pandemic. Are we seeing more normalized behavior with respect to forward booking? And is there anything to call out either in consumer behavior or geography in the forward booking trends that you want to highlight? And then in terms of thinking about the exit philosophy for Vrbo, is there a way to quantify elements of what One Key mix and easier comps might mean in terms of the reacceleration at Vrbo (inaudible)?Peter Maxwell KernSure. Thanks, Eric. I'll take a crack at both of those. I'd say, broadly yes, I mean, what we're seeing is a relative -- what I would call, a relative normalization of seasonal trends and booking trends. There's obviously some dynamics around what is opening or more newly opened and what has been open for a while as we've seen, for example, this year, this summer with lots of travelers going to Europe where maybe they didn't go last summer, Asia opening up and more travelers going there. Of course, parts of Asia, like China still don't have full airlift out of China. So there's still differences. But I think broadly, in terms of the effect of like COVID -- last year, we had COVID first quarter and then the second quarter was a huge quarter because things opened up after Omicron, that's kind of normalized out. And I think in terms of booking windows, booking trends, they're moving around a little bit. But by and large, they're normalizing to what, I would call, generally pre-pandemic patterns. So I think that's the main thing. In terms of geo, again, Asia will open up more that will -- there will be more travel there. We're seeing APAC and LatAm growing faster because of those things opening more recently. So that's certainly a trend. But again, I think that normalizes once it's been open, call it, a year or so. And then as far as Vrbo goes, very hard to quantify. I mean, obviously, the switch -- the sort of consumer switch from Vrbo or vacation rentals generally to more hotel started happening in the back half of last year and earlier this year. So that's sort of a macro trend as far -- so we'll be lapping some of that now as we get into the back half of the year. But as far as our journey goes, yes, One Key, we think, is a big opportunity for us. It's the first time that Vrbo customers will have loyalty. It's a chance to get them involved in our whole universe of products so we can bring them into the other products. Obviously, now Expedia members, Hotels.com members can use their points on Vrbo. So we think that becomes a very attractive reason to use Vrbo. So we definitely think One Key will drive a lot of cross-shopping between the products. Hard to quantify yet, but that's a core belief in what we are trying to do with One Key. And then as far as the migration goes, as we've talked about, you're changing the product, you're moving it across, the last piece will be moving the app, which is very binary, so you tend to do it at the end, that's still coming. But we're excited about what the product we'll be able to do. We're excited about having all the products on one stack, and being able to innovate across all of it together. And as we've talked about for a long time, that will eventually lead us to be able to sell much more easily Vrbo products across all brands, across our B2B products, et cetera. So we don't have a number for you, but I think -- broadly, I think we're going to lap the macro trends of shift from vacation rental to hotels later this year. And then the migration stuff will still be around for a few more months, but we're excited about being casted and the opportunities that presents.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz from Deutsche Bank.Lee HorowitzSo you talked about some of your marketing spend getting pushed from the second quarter to the third quarter in order to support the 1Q loss. Can you maybe help us better understand how this may have impacted the bookings in nights in the second quarter relative to your expectations? And then maybe relatedly, can you talk a bit about how you think lodging share paced throughout the second quarter? And what your expectations are for share as you move through the balance of the year and you drive that accelerated growth across a number of your properties?Julie P. WhalenThis is Julie. I'll take the first one. Yes, I mean, obviously, I'm sure there was some impact to the second quarter as a result of our decision to shift the marketing. At the end of the day, our top line was hitting our expectations and obviously, what we had told the Street about mid-single digits. And so we thought the right choice of action was to take that spend and to get the best return to tie it nicely with our One Key launch and also to set us up for the back half. So we made the decision to take that money and push it into the third quarter. But sure, could we have spent more and maybe gotten some incremental nights and bookings in the second quarter, sure, but we thought this was a better path to take.Peter Maxwell KernAnd then I think the share point plays into that. We feel like we've been holding share in our core markets. We've been gaining some of our outside North American markets, outside U.S. markets in a number of places. So again, as Julie said, it's all sort of plays in together, which is we're trying to, of course, drive the best return on our investments. We thought there was better return when we had the extra hook of One Key. We felt like we were holding in places, and we could have spent the money to drive some more bookings into Q2, but we felt like the return was better, literally waiting weeks, several weeks, many weeks to push it into July when we were launching with One Key. So it's a small movement in the scheme of things. Of course, it moves around margins a little bit, and it moves around. Yes, it moves some bookings from maybe Q2 into Q3 and yes, it moves some EBITDA maybe into Q2 instead of Q3. But in the scheme of things, we're trying to spend that money as efficiently as we can. We launched One Key as soon as we could basically, and it would've been nice to obviously launch it sooner, but this is when we could get it out the door. And we think that there's better returns attached to that hook in getting customers in, getting them engaged in One Key, getting those return dynamics and direct dynamics where we want them. So that's why -- in the scheme of things, not huge dollars or anything, but we moved a little money and sure that cost us a little bit of GBV and revenue in Q2 and will mean a little bit of extra spend in Q3.OperatorYour next question comes from Kevin Kopelman from TD Cowen.Kevin Campbell KopelmanAs you think about the acceleration that you're looking for in the third quarter, do you see that as being focused in U.S. and B2C given the One Key launch? Or is it going to be more broad-based?Peter Maxwell KernI think it's a number of things. So as I mentioned, Kevin, we are seeing good growth as we push back into some of our foreign markets where we saw opportunity and that's been going reasonably well. In the scheme of things, obviously, U.S. being so big for us to accelerate broadly, we also need the U.S. to accelerate. So that's a combination of a number of things, which have to -- which are -- yes, One Key starting to kick in. But Q3 is early days, right? One Key is a loyalty program designed to instant return, certainly attractive in terms of make your first purchase and get valued. But I don't think -- we're not expecting massive impact in Q3 from One Key. We're just seeing good acceleration in the market. Obviously, the Q2 comps were tough because of last year. And as Julie alluded to, some of the insurance dynamics and other things normalize out in the Q3 as we lap that in Q4. So the acceleration is really just a continuation of -- we see strong demand. We've built this base of consumers that we continue to build on that are repeating more and having behaviors we go out more, and that just keeps building, and One Key enhances it. And that's really the core of it, but it's not just in the U.S. The growth is also outside the U.S. But I will say a lot of the acceleration certainly is coming from B2C as opposed to more acceleration in B2B.Kevin Campbell KopelmanGreat. And then could you just touch on the CapEx expectations for the rest of the year and drivers there?Julie P. WhalenYes. I mean, we've seen CapEx come up even in the last quarter, and we had expected this. We are putting more into capitalized labor in order to hit our strategic initiatives this year. Obviously, there's a lot of transformation that we have still been pushing through this year, i.e., One Key's launch and the Vrbo migration and things like that. And so literally, this is just a function of higher capitalized labor to complete out these projects. And as we go forward, we don't expect it to be as much in these elevated levels as we will, and we'll start to get the return from these projects that we're putting in place.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI.Mark Stephen F. MahaneyOkay. Let's see. I want to ask 2 questions. One, the travel bond or the chat GPT experience that you have on the site, what have you seen so far in terms of -- I think there's enormous potential here. I just don't know how long that takes and whether there's just a kind of tweaking that needs to happen in order to really get it right, how do you feel like what have you seen so far in terms of engagement? Has it kind of led to increased conversion rates? And if not, maybe it's just way too early, but what's a reasonable expectation for when you could actually see that?And then the other thing is on One Key, now that you're rolling it out, can you set an expectation for when you think we'll see kind of the impact that has? I know it's just recently launched, but is that something you take one quarter or is it one full year before you really can tell how successful that's been in terms of deeper engagement and maybe attracting newer users?Peter Maxwell KernYes. Thanks, Mark. So on Chat GPT, I agree with you, it's interesting. It has a ton of promise. It is early days. We've been studying it. I won't say it's moved the numbers in any way that you could see and the customers who like to engage with it, like to engage with it, lots of customers don't need it or don't choose to. I think the future, though, lies much more in a better integration, which will come as more large language models come out, and we figure out how to embrace them with our own data. Right now, they kind of live separately, and you can do a bunch of discovery with the tool and then save things and come investigate with us. Over time, there will be ways I think where we're not sharing your personal data with ChatGPT, but we can combine their capabilities with our data and use that to serve you better. So this is going to be an evolution of experience. That's why I mentioned, we've been learning, we've been studying where customers get stuck, what they can't seem to do, some of them don't exactly know how to engage or start a conversation. So there's a lot of work not just by us, but by the industry around large language models on prompts and other ways to get customers through it more easily. And I think all of those pieces will add up to more impact, but the impact now is basically de minimis as you wouldn't see it in the numbers. As for One Key, I think that's more of a gradual build. Obviously, there's a couple of different things you're looking for. There's the appeal of having a strong, broad, best-in-class rewards program to attract customers and make them choose us over other people and then there's the back-end part of when do they come back directly once you've got them in the One Key program and hopefully, once you've got them to download the app and how do they exhibit the behaviors of coming back. So that second part takes longer because as we all know, people don't -- some people don't travel all that often, so it takes time for them to come back and book again, et cetera, even though many book a lot.And then the first piece, we should start to see as we literally just launched it, you may have seen the ads, the campaigns are out there starting to put the messaging into all our performance marketing and all our streaming -- anything that's out there digitally, et cetera, and to our out-of-home. So it will continue to build, and you'll start to see it show up in all our marketing for all our brands. And we believe that's a hook that we'll continue to make intelligent consumers choose us because we'll be of better value if that gives them more back for their travel. So that part we should begin to see sooner, and that's why we think that will start to have a bigger impact into the back end of this year. But the longer-range part of return and direct and driving those things, that will take a little longer to play out in the numbers.OperatorYour next question comes from the line from Justin Post from Bank of America.Justin PostCould you talk about the customer and the B2C customers? It seems like you're trying to improve that quality base and maybe the Street doesn't see it in the numbers yet. What gives you confidence there? Are you seeing higher repeat rates? You said you had some leverage in the quarter. Was that timing? Is there some real improvement you're seeing on the B2C side on marketing leverage? And then one question on One Key, starting to see some discounts on the site. Do you think that allows you to better compete against booking? And who's funding those?Peter Maxwell KernYes. Maybe I'll take those in reverse order, take the sort of factual ones first. So yes, one of the pieces not that relevant necessarily for the investment community, but that's important for the consumer is we've expanded our member discounts as part of this One Key launch. So where we used to have one level basically of member discounts, we now have Blue, Silver, Gold levels, and there are more discounts for higher-tiered members, and that is part of the value proposition that we give to our consumers. Those are funded by our supply partners. It's a way for them to get to better and better higher-value travelers. And that is an important added feature that we launched with and we will be expanding over time. So that is certainly -- bookings has had tiered discounting from some of their supply partners. And that is a feature we have not had before. So I think, yes, that is a -- it's good competitively. I will say that we also think we have those discounts on more valuable hotels that are worth more value to our customers who are more valuable, which goes to your first question, which is, yes, we have confidence that we are building a pool of more valuable customers in large part because we are getting them into more valuable sites. So as we get them into membership, as we get them into app and we follow how those cohorts perform, we know those cohorts perform for lots of good and thoughtful reasons, much better. So a member, of course, sees the member discounts, gets the loyalty rewards and so forth and app member does even more typically and comes back more directly, all good things. So as we build up those pools and our blend of total consumers and total transacting consumers is blended towards these pools that have higher repeat rates, higher LTV, et cetera, we're essentially building a bank of more value that's left to play out in the future. So that's why we do have confidence in what we're doing there. Obviously, we've done it particularly well, as I talked about before, in Expedia U.S. Now we're doing it in more countries. Now we're working on doing it with HCOM and then examining that to more countries. Now we'll be able to do it in Vrbo as well. So there's a lot of -- that's why we say we have a lot of runway left here, but we can see it happening where we've had intent, where we spent according to that, where we've driven the product to move more customers into membership and to sign up into the app. Every step in that journey creates more value for us.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from UBS.Lloyd Wharton WalmsleyAnything you can share in terms of just early feedback going back to One Key on maybe cross shopping? And then changes in conversion rates at Vrbo now that you have loyalty, anything interesting there? And then as part of that, anything in terms of cross currents from HCOM customers given they're getting diluted there as part of One Key? Would love some help understanding that.Peter Maxwell KernSure. I think to the first one, the short answer is it's too early. I mean, we've converted more than 70 million, I don't have today's count, but over 70 million consumers into the One Key program, these are existing members and also new members that have joined in the last few weeks. We've had lots of new members join in Vrbo. We've been able to activate some -- a customer who may be using Vrbo and may have been a customer of one of the other brands a long time ago, but now they're in a program where they'll see the benefit in the other brands. So we've done a lot of sort of the core work of getting customers aligned, getting their accounts right, getting their accounts consolidated if they had reports in different places, which was complicated.So we made huge progress. It's too early to say that we're -- there's not enough signal yet to say people are doing acting -- behaving differently and doing lots of different things. And even in Vrbo, there's a lot of crosscurrents with the migration happening at the same time as launching One Key and a lot of our Vrbo customers even though they're getting a great benefit, they're having to understand like wait a minute, there's a membership program, what is it, do I sign up to it? So there's the usual issues of launching something new in a product experience that people are accustomed to, but we've seen a lot of great response and millions of sign-ups and I wouldn't say necessarily massively incremental in terms of the velocity, but just a lot of people engaging with it and signing up. And then as far as HCOM goes, yes, we have -- there is a little bit of noise from our heaviest users about what does it mean for them. But I will say, we've taken care of them. We've made sure that the value they had did not get diluted and our view of the new program is that they get much more value through flexibility, they get value through the deeper discounts we just talked about and member discounts. So while it might not be constructed exactly the same, our heaviest users will get massive benefit and, in our opinion, more benefit than they can get anywhere else in travel.So it's not like we went from -- we love you and we give you all this and now we're going to devalue your program and not give you that, we're actually carrying over their value and we're giving them huge incremental flexibility, ways to spend their value on flights on Vrbo, all kinds of things they couldn't do before and far more member discounts and other high-end benefits for our heaviest users Gold and Platinum, et cetera. So they're going to get a ton of value and they just have to make the -- I think the industry has trained people to think they're going to lose out every time loyalty program changes. This is not one of those circumstances. I won't say there's not a single customer who won't find that -- they don't like this one as well as the last one. But this is a great program with a lot of value for the heaviest users, and I think they will all come to understand it and love it and appreciate the benefits what they got even though it might be slightly different than it was.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from B. Riley Securities.Naved Ahmad KhanJust a couple of questions. Peter, I think I heard you say you might have gained share in some of the international markets. And I'm a little intrigued what may be driving that? Any color or commentary there would be helpful. And then I have a follow-up.Peter Maxwell KernYes. I think it's really just intent on our part. As we reacted to COVID and we started rebuilding things in a number of markets in the rest of the world, we backed down spend a little bit and we got a little more conservative as we wanted to build our new mousetrap as it were. And I think now that we have greater confidence in all the things I've talked about, be it membership, the value of app downloads and so forth, we've been driving back into a number of international markets where we think there are good returns, and we've been seeing nice returns. Now these are modest changes in the scheme of things. There's nothing dramatic happening, but we're just seeing, what I call, low-hanging fruit and opportunity for us to move back into some of these markets in a smarter way. So again, not a huge story there, just that we feel good about share in the U.S., we feel good about what we're seeing early signs as we push back into these international markets. So on share, we're feeling reasonably good with more...Naved Ahmad KhanUnderstood. Yes. The follow-up I had is just around advertising, and we are hearing some commentary from other players about maybe some increased competition maybe in Europe or other markets. Just curious if you're seeing anything there or anything to say about Google's new ad format. I think they recently introduced profit listing even in the main search?Peter Maxwell KernYes. I think on the last part, you're talking about vacation rentals. Is that what you're talking about?Naved Ahmad KhanNo, still there's hotels, but I think this has introduced the new format into the main search.Peter Maxwell KernYes. I mean, I would say, look, we're working with them and working in the auctions around the world all the time. I don't think we've seen anything particularly different in terms of inflation or not in the auctions. I mean, the auctions have been inflating over the last several years. And of course, they're highly competitive, particularly amongst the biggest of us. But no, I don't think we've seen anything that's of any concern, et cetera, over what's happening in terms of pricing in those markets. And of course, we are trying every day to find better opportunities, higher long-term return opportunity to invest our advertising dollars, be it in app downloads or other kinds of environments, I would say, that encourage those behaviors as opposed to just Google option. So I think we're probably not alone in that, but that's been a core part of our strategy as we've tried to get away from simply trying to buy transactions and getting much more focused on what consumers we buy, getting them into the right state in the app and so forth. So that's an ongoing journey for us, but that's the direction that journey will keep going on forever.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni from Jefferies. Your next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer &amp; Co.Jed KellyGreat. Just 2, if I may. One, just -- the airlines have recently called out weaker domestic trends. Is there anything where there's just softening underlying demand? Or is that the pattern shifts that you kind of mentioned earlier? And then just thinking about your back half brand spend, can you just talk about the efficiencies you plan to get on being able to market all your brands under one loyalty program versus marketing it all separately? And are you going to continue to market each of your key brands separately?Peter Maxwell KernSure. So I think, yes, as far as the airlines go, I mean, we have seen -- you've no doubt heard that pricing has softened a little bit in domestic air in North America. There's a little bit more supply and yes, there's been high demand for international. So I think it's been mostly a shifting of patterns. It's not total consumable dollars. Obviously, in every industry, not everybody participates the same way. Some are more domestically focused. Others have bigger international exposure. But in terms of consumer demand, I'd say, it's broadly been steady and good, and that there hasn't been -- there are places that fall and other places they rise. But overall, the consumer has been acting healthy and strong. So I don't think there's anything to see there other than moving geographical trends and consumer trends in terms of what they're looking for. As far as brand spend and again, this isn't -- I don't want -- I wouldn't get focused on the word brand spend as we conventionally think about it. It is spend against our business, which could be brand spend, it could be performance marketing, it could be app, it could be a lot of things. When we say we wanted it to support the One Key launch, it's not in the sense of like we needed money to buy TV spots, it's in the sense of we got our money with the hook of One Key out the door would be more efficient as we drove consumption, be it through Google options or be it through digital advertising of various kinds or television. So that's what we're talking about. As far as how we're going to spend, we have a campaign out now that's very focused on One Key as a concept and the 3 of them coming together. But our intent is, at least for now, to keep marketing each brand, they will then -- they will all have a touch point to One Key and make clear that they are sibling brands and part of one big umbrella loyalty program, but they will each have their own brand identity in terms of what their consumer proposition is and how they deliver it to the consumer.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni from Jefferies.John Robert ColantuoniSorry about the drop earlier. Wanted to talk a little bit about the One Key role. Can you help us understand what's changing from a loyalty perspective across each of the individual brands and how we should think about the sort of collective impact to take rate from these loyalty changes and perhaps some sort of other potential merchandising changes related to the rollout? And can you also help sort of talk a little bit more about the puts and takes of the acceleration in bookings growth next quarter? There's -- the (inaudible) slowdown, the shift in marketing spend, and maybe some pull forward into last quarter into 1Q from 2Q. But I'm also curious if -- you started to see an inflection point in some of the smaller brands where they've gotten small enough to not have as material an impact on the overall business?Peter Maxwell KernThanks. A lot of good questions there. I would say starting with One Key. Basically, I think the simplest way to think about it is One Key is closest in what it offers to what the Expedia program was -- the Brand Expedia program was historically and that your end points, the points are worth money, you can spend the money. Some things have changed. I mentioned the member discounts. We now have Silver and Gold member discounts. There's added benefits for those Silver, Gold, Platinum members that they get. But it's most similar. So that's, I would say, the least change, in the sense that you could already use that currency across many products and you couldn't really use -- you couldn't use it in Vrbo but that was the one missing piece. So maybe the way to think about that is you've added Vrbo to the path and those consumers can now benefit when they want a rent -- vacation rental. Hotels.com, many of you are familiar, had a very rich program for the super user. If you book 10 rooms, you get a night free. And that was a very valuable benefit for super user. But the vast majority of users didn't get a benefit because they never stayed enough nights. So we're trying to make that program much more attractive to all users while still keeping it very attractive to the super user for all the points I went into a moment ago as to why they would find incremental value there. And again, you could only use that on hotel product. Now you can use it on anything, and that's a lot more flexible, a lot more vast and you can do a lot more with it. And then, of course, Vrbo had nothing. Now Vrbo will have rewards, which -- maybe it doesn't have, et cetera and you'll be able to use it for your next Vrbo stay, but you can also use it to go to a hotel or a resort or take your family on a flight or whatever. So again, it just gives all of our customers a lot more ways to use it for a lot of different occasions and for a lot of different products. And ultimately, we're trying to build a base of loyal customers that use us for all their travel needs that can go across whatever they need and spend more with us, buy more products from us, et cetera. So that's the game. We have all these brands, all these capabilities, we wanted the customers to benefit from all that. So the patterns we're looking for is cross shopping, more items per customer, higher LTVs, more direct -- more app direct, et cetera. So that's where we think One Key really helps drive. As far as the puts and takes, in the back half of bookings, your point about the smaller brands as part of it, yes, the smaller brands that we have deemphasized for some time now are getting smaller and that drag is getting lighter all the time. We mentioned some of the things going on with insurance normalizing post COVID and a few strange effects there, that's normalizing in the back half of the year. And lodging continues to grow, B2C lodging continues to grow, most through BEX, but both brands are getting stronger in the back half after the tough comp. And so you're basically getting the strong pulling more weight and getting bigger, the sort of noisy stuff making less noise. And overall, we see good velocity in the business right now, and we're seeing it continue, and we feel good about all the product improvement. I mean, this has also been a journey of improving product, improving conversion, improving signing, improving app download, like all of those things are part of that journey. So every day, they're literally getting better and stacking up on themselves. So I think that's a long journey, and there's no magic to why it's going to hit next Tuesday, but with Vrbo's migration done with One Key which had a huge amount of resource for us out the door, these things, the velocity of other innovation gets faster and faster, and that's what we're focused on.OperatorOur final question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research.Deepak MathivananJulie, can you help us with the full year guide on margin expansion? We're almost, I mean, into the peak travel season, and you said that for 3Q margins should be flat year-on-year. But anyway, you can frame us -- frame for us what the full year margins can reach to? And then kind of related to that, how should we think about the headwinds from fixed cost growth? You obviously have a little bit of duplicative costs right now with all the replatforming efforts. Is there a time line when we can expect this to somewhat sort of like start to show leverage and maybe you can deploy them for other projects.Julie P. WhalenSure. On the margin side, the EBITDA side, obviously, this quarter's leverage certainly helps on the full year. We did guide to next quarter being more in line with last year, and that is, as you mentioned, the shift from the marketing spend that we have. But for all the things that Peter just alluded to and the strength of the business in the back half, particularly in the fourth quarter, we expect to see strong margin expansion in the fourth quarter that will help us on the year. So it's our accelerating top line, which will leverage the entire P&amp;L, including marketing leverage in the fourth quarter that we think will drive that expansion. From a headwinds -- from a fixed cost perspective, certainly, we are going to be aggressive as we move out of this year and come out of the transformation phase to finding efficiencies across the P&amp;L. As we've said, we have got redundant systems for very good reasons while we're going through the migration. But it's time that we'll be starting to deprecate those systems and pulling cost out of the P&amp;L and whether that's cloud costs, licensing and maintenance, repurposing some of the product and tech staff to now go on the offense and go after optimization and innovation instead of migration, there's a lot of opportunity to really dig through the costs and pull that out as we move forward, but that's probably more of a 2024 going forward focus. But certainly, with all that optimization as well, we should be able to leverage the P&amp;L next year. So super excited about that.Peter Maxwell KernOkay. I think that was the final question. So thank you all. Have a good Thursday. I appreciate your time. Take care.OperatorThat concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a nice day.]"

Online furniture retailer Wayfair stock jumps after posting an earnings beat. Clorox sees its shares boosted on a mixed earnings print. Yahoo Finance Live anchors Akiko Fujita and Diane King Hall examine several stocks trending in the after-hours trading session following the closing bell.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Online travel company saw record revenue of $3.36 billion in Q2, but it still fell well short of Wall Street estimates. And, Diane, you know, we've been talking a lot about earnings and the big beats. On the one hand, it is about this quarter coming in with such low expectations.DIANE KING HALL: Right.AKIKO FUJITA: You look at a name like Expedia, it is about expectations being so high because of what we heard on the travel demand. In many ways, that's what's happening with the stock in terms of the big declines we've seen there.DIANE KING HALL: That's right. It certainly fell short. Go ahead, Akiko.AKIKO FUJITA: Well, I was going to say, there is such a thing as, you know, maybe expectations being too high going into it, but when you think about some of the other travel names that have been reporting, you know, analysts expecting a little more from Expedia. Certainly not beating the bar at least, with shares down more than 16%.DIANE KING HALL: Especially to your point about what the expectations were for travel, and we've seen such strength there with this-- this experiences play that we've seen. We've seen with a lot of both the airlines, the cruise lines, and just travel stocks in general. Gross bookings for Expedia did increase, but less than expected. I mean, it rose 9% to $27.3 billion. Analysts were looking for $28.3 billion.Lodgings, it did come in at a record, actually, $19.2 billion. But again, short of what expectations were, and just that question of, is there softness coming when it comes to the travel picture and what that looks like, whether we're talking about airlines or hotels?Story continuesAnother stock that we are watching is shares of Wayfair, that stock finishing the day well in the green, on the plus side, up by about 16%, so the flip of what we've seen with regard to Expedia. Its results soaring past estimates in the second quarter. Despite seeing active customers fall, the online furniture retailer continues climbing after reporting adjusted earnings per share of $0.21 a share against-- they were expecting a loss, so it was a surprise gain for Wayfair. I mean, look, you remember, this was a pandemic darling, and then it lost its luster, and now it's come back, Akiko.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, this is a company that has really been really moving aggressively to try and slash costs. They've laid off about 10% of their staff and we're starting to see a bit of a turnaround. Interesting to see how the sentiment has shifted on Wall Street. In recent days we saw Piper Sandler upgrading the stock to overweight from neutral, raising the price target to $97 from $35 a share. Wells Fargo also upgrading shares to overweight, raising their price target as well to $100. So, you know, it certainly feels like when you look at the home furnishings industry as we call it, where Wayfair competes, things are starting to stabilize and we're seeing some of those results with that stock up roughly 16% today.Well, shares of Clorox closing the day up about 9% here following an earnings beat. The company reporting net sales of $2 billion, a 12% growth since last year. Clorox also projecting better than expected guidance for fiscal 2024, as they expect to exceed its pandemic years, and that is saying a lot, Diane, when you think about how Clorox performed during the pandemic.But-- but, look, this is a company that raised its prices, that, you know, has certainly boosted profits. But, you know, I think it's interesting, because even though we're talking about that guidance being optimistic, they also kind of had a cautionary note here, saying that consumer demand is robust, but they're seeing economic activity becoming a little more challenging in the months ahead, the CFO saying specifically, we expect it's going to continue being a challenging economic environment, and we continue to expect ongoing cost inflation. So they are still seeing that reflected in their numbers.DIANE KING HALL: They are. However, I mean, it did well. I mean, people are buying the cleaning products and the trash bags. I mean they make Glad trash bags, so they've had strength there. The filters as well, water filters. Cat litter. I mean, this was-- this was-- I mean, I'm doing a deep dive into their report.AKIKO FUJITA: Everything in your cabinet.DIANE KING HALL: Wipes. I mean, I need more wipes. So, you know, Clorox certainly doing well. Wall Street rewarding it with a big thumbs up today.]"

After all, it’s easy to understand why these transactions receive so much attention, as it’s a confidence booster for investors when an insider swoops in for a buy. But who is considered an insider?An insider is defined by Section 16 of the Security Exchange Act as an officer, director, 10% stockholder, or anyone who possesses information because of their relationship with the company. Of course, many strict rules apply.As of late, three stocks – Lockheed Martin LMT, Lennar LEN, and Exxon Mobil XOM – have all seen insider activity. Let’s take a closer look at each.Exxon MobilJeffrey Ubben, a director, made a big splash very recently, acquiring 458,000 XOM shares at a total transaction value of nearly $50 million. XOM shares have found themselves back in attention following the recent rise in oil prices, up 6% since Mid-July and widely outperforming the general market.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s growth has significantly cooled from 2022’s euphoria, with earnings forecasted to decline 37% on 21% lower revenues in its current year. Still, income-focused investors stand to reap solid payouts, with XOM shares yielding 3.5% annually currently.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, the company continues to be a cash-generating machine; operating cash flow totaled $9.4 billion throughout its latest quarter, with free cash flow reaching $5 billion.Lockheed MartinJohn Donovan, a director, purchased 548 LMT shares in July, with the transaction totaling approximately $250,000. The company recently reported quarterly results, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by 4.6% and sales expectations by 5%.LMT shares appear attractive from a valuation standpoint, with the current 16.5X forward earnings multiple reflecting a 38% discount relative to the Zacks Aerospace – Defense industry and beneath 2022 highs of 18.4X.The stock carries a Style Score of ‘B’ for Value.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company also boasts a shareholder-friendly nature, with its dividend payout growing more than 8% over the past five years. Shares currently yield 2.7% annually, nearly double that of its Zacks industry average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther stating its shareholder-friendly nature, LMT purchased $500 million worth of shares and delivered $784 million in dividends throughout its latest release, with the former helping put a floor in for shares.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLennarAmy Banse, a director, recently purchased roughly $100k in Lennar shares at a price tag of $126.42 per share. The company’s earnings expectations have turned highly positive over the last several months, landing the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLennar posted results that blew away expectations in its latest release, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by nearly 30% and reporting sales 10% ahead of expectations. Impressively, the company has exceeded EPS expectations by an average of 20% across its last four quarters.As we can see below, shares have gotten a boost post-earnings following back-to-back releases.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s growth is slated to taper in its current year, with estimates suggesting a 28% decline in earnings on 3% lower revenues. Still, growth resumes in FY24, as expectations allude to a 3% recovery in the bottom line and a 2.3% bump in sales year-over-year.Bottom LineInvestors closely follow insider transactions. After all, if an insider is buying, it sends a positive message to shareholders, whereas selling could convey negative sentiment in certain circumstances.And insiders of all three companies above – Lockheed Martin LMT, Lennar LEN, and Exxon Mobil XOM – have recently made splashes.Importantly, insiders have a longer-term holding horizon than most, a critical aspect that market participants should be aware of.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MAS, Option Care Health OPCH, Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure SOI and PulteGroup PHM.Time to Add These 5 Relative Price Strength StocksWall Street experienced a strong rebound in the first seven months of 2023, recovering from the disappointments of the previous year. The S&amp;P 500 Index surged nearly 20% during this period. This positive performance can be attributed to the steady decline in inflation rates, a strong labor market and the Federal Reserve's decision to reduce the magnitude of interest rate hikes. The bullish sentiment has even led to U.S. consumer sentiment jumping to the highest level in almost two years.In particular, the inflation rate is dwindling steadily since June 2022. Consequently, the Fed is approaching the end of its ongoing interest rate hike cycle. The central bank is now more confident about the soft landing of the economy. This could mean a brightening outlook for the stock market.Investors who want to take advantage of the bullish equity setup should focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.Relative Price Strength StrategyInvestors generally gauge a stock's potential returns by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples. At the same time, it's essential to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers, or an appropriate benchmark. If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors, it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative. However, those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance of providing considerable returns. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Story continuesFinally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies.

186,5bf53dd5-504c-377b-842e-c30077eb4002,WEC,2023-08-04,WEC Energy Group (NYSE:WEC) Is Paying Out A Larger Dividend Than Last Year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wec-energy-group-nyse-wec-173002833.html,1691083802,STORY,['WEC'],"[WEC Energy Group, Inc.'s (NYSE:WEC) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to $0.78 on 1st of September. This takes the annual payment to 3.5% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. See our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group WEC Energy Group's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Before making this announcement, WEC Energy Group was paying out a fairly large proportion of earnings, and it wasn't generating positive free cash flows either. This is a pretty unsustainable practice, and could be risky if continued for the long term.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 26.8%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 61%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendWEC Energy Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.20 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $3.12. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 10% over that duration. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Although it's important to note that WEC Energy Group's earnings per share has basically not grown from where it was five years ago, which could erode the purchasing power of the dividend over time. Earnings are not growing quickly at all, and the company is paying out most of its profit as dividends. When the rate of return on reinvestment opportunities falls below a certain minimum level, companies often elect to pay a larger dividend instead. This is why many mature companies often have larger dividend yields.Story continuesIn SummaryIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think WEC Energy Group's payments are rock solid. While WEC Energy Group is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Just as an example, we've come across 2 warning signs for WEC Energy Group you should be aware of, and 1 of them makes us a bit uncomfortable.

Play These ETFs,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-bet-perfect-aaa-credit-171500242.html,1691082900,STORY,['JNJ'],"[Credit ratings are a critical factor when it comes to investing as they indicate the creditworthiness of an entity, be it a company or a country. A higher credit rating implies a lower risk of default, making it easier and cheaper for the entity to borrow money.In times of easy money and cheap debt, credit ratings might have seemed less relevant as companies could easily access funds regardless of their rating. By borrowing, companies continued to boost return on equity and impress investors.However, gone are those days. The Fed has hiked rates multiple times since March 2022 and took its benchmark overnight interest rate to the 5.25%-5.50% range in July. With higher interest rates, debt is no longer as cheap, leading credit ratings to gain importance all over again.Shares of the 10 S&amp;P 500 companies with the highest credit ratings have outperformed (up more than 23.3%) those of the 10 companies with the lowest credit ratings (up 15.4%) this year, per an article published on investors.com.Inside United States' Credit Rating Downgrade by FitchRating agency Fitch downgraded the United States to AA+ from AAA this week, expecting fiscal deterioration over the next three years and repeated last minute debt ceiling negotiations that can pressurize the government’s ability to pay its bills. U.S. stocks slumped on Wednesday following the news (read: ETF Areas in Focus on Fitch Downgrade of Credit Rating).In light of this event, investors might be interested in identifying companies and countries that still hold the desirable 'AAA' credit rating. Given this context, here are companies and countries currently holding a 'AAA' credit rating that investors may consider as relatively safer options for investment.AAA Stocks in FocusJust two companies in the S&amp;P 500, Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ and Microsoft MSFT, maintain their AAA credit ratings from S&amp;P, per an Investor's Business Daily analysis of data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence and MarketSmith.Story continuesJ&amp;J has been suffering due to legal issues and its stock has failed to gain this year but Microsoft can always be played in the form of ETFs. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) and Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF (FTEC) are some of the ETFs each of which invests around 20% to MSFT.AAA Countries in FocusThe Fitch Ratings’ downgrade of the U.S. puts the focus on the countries still holding onto the sought-after top credit grade – AAA. Economies with the highest credit rating at S&amp;P Global Ratings, Fitch and Moody’s Investors Service include Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Singapore and Australia. Canada is rated AAA by two of the ratings companies, per Bloomberg.While economists do not seem worried about the United States’ ability to pay its bills (even after the latest Fitch Downgrade and the S&amp;P’s downgrade in 2011), investors can try their luck by investing in AAA-rated economies though ETFs.These ETFs include iShares MSCI Switzerland ETF EWL, Global X MSCI Norway ETF NORW, iShares MSCI Singapore ETF EWS, iShares MSCI Germany ETF EWG, iShares MSCI Denmark ETF EDEN, iShares MSCI Netherlands ETF EWN, iShares MSCI Australia ETF EWA.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily features a real-time update on the ongoing Q2 earnings season and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), General Dynamics Corporation (GD) and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all of this morning's results, we now have Q2 results from 394 S&amp;P 500 members or 78.8% of the index's membership. Total Q2 earnings for these 394 index members are down -11.8% from the same period last year on flat revenues (actually down -0.01%) from the year-earlier level, with 79.7% beating EPS estimates and 66% beating revenue estimates. Excluding the Energy sector drag where Q2 earnings and revenues are down -50.5% and -28% from the year-earlier levels, respectively, the earnings and revenue growth pace for the rest of the S&amp;P 500 index would be -5% and +4.8%, respectively. As we have noted all along since the start of this reporting cycle, the Q2 EPS beats percentage is tracking notably above what we had seen from this group in recent quarters as well as historically. This is significant since Q2 estimates had fallen less than was the case ahead of other recent quarters. We are seeing a similar  revisions trend at play for the current period (2023 Q3), with estimates holding up essentially unchanged since the start of the quarter. This is particulalry so on an ex-Energy basis. In fact, the aggregate ex-Energy earnings total for the rest of the S&amp;P 500 index is a hair up since June 27th, with Tech, Autos, Construction, Utilities and Transportation enjoying positive estimate revisions.

The year-over-year increase in revenues was driven by sales of Sarepta’s three currently-approved RNA-based PMO therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).The reported revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $264.5 million.In the year so far, Sarepta’s shares have declined 18.8% compared with the industry’s 12.3% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarter in DetailSarepta’s commercial portfolio includes three approved PMO therapies for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”) — Exondys 51, Vyondys 53 and Amondys 45.The company’s product revenues were up 13% year over year at $239.0 million, entirely derived from the sale of the above three DMD drugs. The upside was driven by an increase in demand for DMD products. The reported product sales beat our model estimates of $235 million.The company recorded $22.3 million in collaboration revenues, primarily from its licensing agreement with Roche RHHBY. In the year-ago period, management recorded $22.0 million as collaboration revenues, which were also received from Roche.Sarepta and Roche entered into a licensing agreement in 2019 to develop Elevidys (delandistrogene moxeparvovec, or SRP-9001), a one-shot gene therapy for DMD which recently received accelerated approval from the FDA. Per the agreement, Roche has exclusive rights to launch and commercialize Elevidys in ex-U.S. markets.During the quarter, Sarepta did not generate any revenues from Elevidys.Story continuesAdjusted research and development (R&amp;D) expenses totaled $212.2 million in the second quarter, down 8% year over year. This downside is attributable to a decline in manufacturing expenses incurred during the quarter, partially offset by an increase in clinical study expenses.Adjusted selling, general &amp; administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses were $90.3 million, up 42% year over year. The upside was driven primarily by an increase in professional service expenses incurred by the company for Elevidys’ launch.2023 GuidanceSarepta reiterated its previously issued product revenue guidance for the three approved PMO drugs, which are expected to generate more than $925 million in 2023. Management did not issue a guidance on Elevidys sales stating that it will continue to evaluate the gene-therapy’s demand to provide accurate guidance.Pipeline UpdatesIn June, Sarepta announced that the FDA granted accelerated approval to Elevidys. Following this approval, Elevidys is the first and currently the only one-shot gene therapy approved for treating DMD. Alongside second-quarter results, Sarepta announced that the first patient received the commercially reimbursed Elevidys on Aug 2.Though the FDA has restricted the use of Elevidys in ambulatory DMD patients aged between four and five years, it has stated that it will grant a non-age-restricted expansion to the gene therapy provided the phase III EMBARK study achieves its objectives. The EMBARK study is the proposed confirmatory study that will seek full approval for Elevidys in DMD indication. Top-line results from the EMBARK study are expected before this year’s end.To satisfy regulatory requirements for Elevidys’ approval outside the United States, Sarepta recently initiated the phase III ENVISION study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of gene therapy in non-ambulatory and ambulatory DMD patients.During the second quarter, Sarepta successfully dosed the first patient in the phase I NAVIGENE study, which is evaluating SRP-6004, an investigational gene therapy candidate for treating ambulatory patients living with LGMD2B/R2 (dysferlinopathy).Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.

With 71% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Johnson &amp; Johnson. View our latest analysis for Johnson &amp; Johnson ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Johnson &amp; Johnson?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Johnson &amp; Johnson. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Johnson &amp; Johnson, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Johnson &amp; Johnson. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.5% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.8% and 5.4% of the stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Johnson &amp; JohnsonWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Johnson &amp; Johnson. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$380m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 29% stake in Johnson &amp; Johnson. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   4 warning signs for Johnson &amp; Johnson  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

My name is Nicky, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Goodyear's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions). Today on the call, we have Rich Kramer, Goodyear's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Christian Gadzinski, Chief Financial Officer. During this call, Goodyear, we refer to forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements. For more information on the most significant factors that could affect future results, please refer to the important disclosures section of Goodyear's Second Quarter 2023 Investor Letter and their filings with the SEC, which can be found on their website at investor.goodyear.com, where a replay of this call will also be available. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that may be discussed on today's call to the comparable GAAP measures is also included in the investor letter. This call will focus on questions and answers.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from James Picariello with BNP Paribas.James Albert PicarielloIt's Jake filling in for James. First, I just want to talk about is the third quarter bridge items. So if I work through those, we get to about $300 million SOI in 3Q. I just want to make sure that I'm thinking about that right. And then looking at the fourth quarter -- or full year, it looks like the implied guide is not $50 million. So can you just talk about some of the puts and takes for the fourth quarter?Story continuesChristian GadzinskiYes. Sure. Jake, this is Cristina. So I'll start on SOI. And I would say, if you look at our outlook, obviously, we are layering in the trends in the industry that we're seeing as we look into the third and fourth quarters. And as we think about how this has played out, obviously, impacts in our earnings in Q2 due to transitory factors like destocking more in consumer, but also more recently in commercial. And so what that means is volume weakness still yet in Q3, and a lot of that is due to our plan for some additional destocking, particularly in Europe with volume approximately flat to up in the back half or the fourth quarter. When I think about the drivers of our SOI walk, I mean, we've laid out the industry such for you. unabsorbed overhead win -- I mean, we'll have lower Q2 production of about 4 million units, excluding [TBO]. That obviously will impact the fourth quarter. We've given you those values as well. Price mix versus raw materials should more than offset other cost inflation in the second half. I'd say that that's true on a full year basis as well. If I think about commercial truck and maybe this gets to the part of your question, what we said is big impact, $60 million in mix in the second quarter, that declines pretty significantly in Q3, and it's pretty much not an impact at all in our fourth quarter. When I look at fourth quarter price/mix versus raw materials, what I would say is, obviously, really strong benefits in lower raw material costs. We do have RMI indexes beginning to take effect but I would say that they're still relatively small here in the fourth quarter, something like 10% of that raw material benefit. So hopefully, that's a help.James Albert PicarielloAnd then most like channel destocking was a pretty big drag on the quarter. When should we expect that trend to start to reverse?Christian GadzinskiSo we -- I mentioned this just a minute ago, Jake, in the way that we're thinking about destocking in the back half of the year is that we're essentially complete in the U.S. seeing some incremental weakness in demand in Latin America. So America in the third quarter, down slightly, but more of the destocking to continue in EMEA consumer replacement, that's all driven by still higher levels of winter inventories versus last year. And so even though we had a tough industry in Europe last year, we're still planning for declines this year. And then as I think about commercial truck, obviously, a more volatile segment of the market for us, big destocking event in Q2 because we did see the spot rates for freight just decline so precipitously, spot rates were down 25% in the month of June. And so lot an immediate type of destocking happening with our commercial truck dealers and distributors. That will still continue on into Q3, but not nearly as severe as what we saw in the second quarter. So in truck, unit volume in commercial was down 600,000 units, it's going to feel something like $200,000 to $300,000 (technical difficulty) in Q3. And then by Q4, truck will normalize in line with what's happening in freight ton miles, and that's something that's just slightly down in the U.S. and a little bit more in Europe.OperatorWe will take our next question from John Healy with Northcoast Research.John Michael HealyI just wanted to ask a little bit about the pricing environment in the U.S. and in Europe. Obviously, some different status of where we've gotten to with pricing over the last 2 years. But is there any signs with raw materials now coming in a little bit that you're seeing, I don't know, any sort of behavior or erosion of the pricing environment, either by tiers of operators? Or has it remained pretty consistent and what's your confidence level that, that can continue into the end of the year?Richard J. KramerThanks, John. I mean -- sorry, it's a really relevant question. And I think as we look at what we're seeing today, price is still holding. And I think that's because everyone across the industry has seen the higher raw material costs and other inflationary costs. So we're all having to deal with that. And I think that's what you're seeing that revenue per tire is still holding in very well and pricing is holding in very well. If we look ahead, we see sort of the -- last year for us, we had over 30% raw material cost increases. We had headwinds in the first half that turns into some tailwinds in the second half. And in that period, the question becomes relevant, how will things hold up. I will tell you; we've seen this before in historical periods when this happens, we're traditionally able to hold our prices as we see raw materials come down. I think that's probably even more relevant now given that inflation really is sticking around. So in the past, we've been dealing with raw materials alone. But now if you look ahead, we've got our high labor costs. So we've got other energy costs. We have other inflationary costs that are more sticky right now. So I think as we look at this, I don't think that we've seen a reversal of the need to recover all our input costs through market pricing actions. So we still feel pretty good about where that's at. Now to your point on tiers, I mean, and you know this, I mean, Tier 3, Tier 4 have always been price competitive. That's not where we play, as you know that. But that's an area where units move by price, and we're always cognizant of that as well.John Michael HealyAnd then just a question on the OE business. Just any sort of preliminary thoughts about kind of model year '24 that are coming out and how you're positioned and maybe how you're positioned relative to previous years. And just as well as with the potential uncertainty on kind of labor for the manufacturers, any sort of guardrails or thought process to how you're approaching kind of the fall time frame?Richard J. KramerYes. So on the OE side, I will tell you, Christina sort of alluded to this, obviously, we missed in the quarter, and that was a lot of European replacement volume and truck volume across our RETs. A bright spot was the OE business in both the U.S. and in Europe. And I think that still is a -- it's still a factor of all the work that we've done on working with the OEMs to make sure that we're on the new models coming forward. And remember, we've talked about a win rate that's like in the 60% range, highly weighted towards EVs and at higher margins. And I think that trend is continuing for us, very positive. And also, I would tell you that our work with the OEMs has really shown a lot of promise. I think now we've done in just a quarter, I think, 3 fitments that have been virtual submissions, where we actually haven't even had to build tires where we built sort of digital submissions and then build only one tire for them to move forward with. And we did that on new fitments and we did that actually taking fitments away from some competitors. So I would say really confident that what we've done in OE continues to move in a very positive way.OperatorAnd we will take our next question from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.Emmanuel RosnerSo Chris, in the previous quarters, you indulge me essentially provided your latest thoughts on the full year free cash flow scenario for the company. And I was wondering if you would be so kind to update it in the context of obviously the pressures you've seen in the second quarter, some of them continuing in the third, especially on the mix front? And what would that do for your full year free cash flow?Christian GadzinskiYes. Sure, Emmanuel, thanks for the question. I have to say free cash flow certainly remains a top priority for us. And as we think about what our business should be able to generate in normalized environments and also as we think about our leverage going forward. As we look at 2023 right now, and we continue to expect some positive free cash flow this year, albeit less now than before some slightly positive free cash flow, and we set out all of the drivers for you that should help frame that up. With a smaller contribution coming from free cash flow that may be what we had expected when we last spoke. We are focused on additional actions in the near term to generate some cash, including sale-leaseback program. So we included in the investor letter, an expectation for cash proceeds of, call it, $150 million to $200 million this year from those transactions. But I do think it's important to say that we understand that our business is one that should generate free cash flow, and we'll continue to keep our focus on that as earnings improve in the nearer term, and we really get to see the underlying earnings power of our business. And all of that thought process will go into our next year's planning.Emmanuel RosnerMy second question is on the -- some of the reiterated comments in your letter -- shareholder letter around approaching or closing in on the 8% SOI margin in the back half of the year. It seems like based on the factors of outlook you're sharing with us for the third quarter. That's certainly not going to be the case in this quarter. I'm not sure if for this. If I guess, your thinking is you could get there in the fourth or that you're just saying directionally, there's some sequential improvement. And over time, you sort of could get there. I just -- I didn't see a change in language, even though it seems like the outlook at the very least for the third quarter is quite a bit weaker than you would have thought probably the last time. So can you maybe share your thoughts on that path towards 8% and timing?Christian GadzinskiYes, sure, Emmanuel. The way I think about the change from when we last talked, I think our second half outlook right now would take a more run rate scenario for EMEA's earnings into consideration in the back half of the year. Where we were at the end of the first quarter was a position where we thought that EMEA would have by midyear gotten to historical run rate earnings. And just given the weakness in the industry over the past quarter, we have really downgraded that expectation. So certainly, a big improvement sequentially margin into Q3 and then again into Q4 and EMEA still remains subject to a great deal of volatility. But what I would say is we still see a very strong recovery in Americas and in Asia Pacific. And this sees a realistic scenario where both of these businesses are going to be at or above the 8% target in Q4. And so I mean, I think it's relative to the first half margins and also really strong improvements in at least a couple of our businesses.Richard J. KramerYes. Christian listen, I'll jump in. I was going to reiterate the point as well. When we look at the exit rates for the Americas and Asia, we still feel pretty good about where those businesses are having, again, the destocking point. I think our inventory in the U.S. was down, I think it was 11% in Q1 and 14% in Q2 in terms of channel inventories. That bodes well add to that in the U.S. VMTs up and add to that the economy is actually probably stronger than we thought it would be. So we feel -- we still feel pretty good about where we're going to be in the U.S. and Asia as well. I think the numbers there speak for themselves. Europe continues to be the area that we need to focus on. We got hit much harder on truck and passenger on a declining industry. I mean, it was worse than our expectations for sure. The industry was down about -- consumer was down about 13%. And in Q1 was down another 12% in Q2, and sell-out was down about 4% in Q2 as well. I think that's indicative of the economic sort of malaise that we're seeing over there. Having said that, it doesn't do any good to talk about it. We need to get volume back in Europe to get that business back to the $50 million run rate that we're talking about per quarter. And we need to make sure that we're aggressive on our cost structure over there, both from an SAG perspective, from a footprint perspective, from everything we do over there. And last quarter, we alluded to some of the actions that that we were in process of taking those are in play. Those are things we're doing. One, you saw the action that we took in our plant in (inaudible) already, and you'll see more of that coming. In fact, some of this will move into some of the special committee work that we're focused on following the settlement agreement that we had with Elliot. And Europe is front and center on that. We just can't live with the cost structure and the results we have over there.Emmanuel RosnerAnd then one final one, maybe speaking of the agreement with Elliott. So you announced last week that you set up not just an operational review committee, but also a strategic review within this hired, I guess, a number of investment banks as part of that process. Can you maybe directionally talk to us about what is or isn't on the table in terms of strategic options for that review. Would you -- in terms of assets that may be for sale, is it only sort of like some of the adjacent businesses? Or could it be regions in some of your core ironing business? What is or isn't on the table as part of the strategic review?Richard J. KramerYes, Emmanuel, maybe I'll take one step back and just say that the discussions that we've had with the Elliot team that we've been speaking with have been, I would suggest, very constructive and collaborative. And I think when they look at us, they see an opportunity for improved margins on margin expansion, if you will, and a better balance sheet on reducing leverage. And I would tell you, we agree for obvious reasons. So that's where we stand. So as we think about that, special committee was as an addition to adding some new very qualified directors, we put our special committee together to start looking at these things. And as you said, that will be both operational and it will be strategic. And maybe I'll just talk a little bit about the strategic side for a moment. And then Christina, you can jump in on some of the things we're thinking on from an operational side as we move ahead. But I should also say we're not going to get ahead of the committee here and lay things out. But Emmanuel, to your question around assets, I think from our perspective, and as long as I've been with the company, we've been very open to looking at where decisions make sense to add value for the company. And I think if you go back and look at our track record, you'll find that that's true. Remember, we sold our EPD business, and we sold the wire business. We sold essentially our farm business where we get a royalty back. We've done a lot of actions like this. And I would suggest to you without getting into any specifics, it's that attitude and mindset that we're coming to look at the strategic analysis that we're going to undertake. And I think that makes sense to us. We'll make decisions that make sense for the business to achieve those goals. And as we do those, we will let you know. And obviously, strategic may take a little bit longer than the operational, but we'll be back soon talking about these things. But Christian, maybe you want to just jump in on the -- how we're thinking about some of the operational areas that at least come under the umbrella that we in the committee will be looking at.Christian GadzinskiYes, sure. Thanks, Rich. So [Manu], I think as we look at the operations side, we're going to take a comprehensive review across the organization, and it's going to be multiple facets of the business, multiple areas of focus. And so what I mean by that is we're going to spend time in R&amp;D looking at our portfolio work and understanding how to rationalize maybe R&amp;D demand. Rich mentioned digital a little bit earlier, harnessing that capability and leveraging that to drive increases in engineering productivity as another example. We'll also look at our brands and our SKUs and our product positioning and supply chain. We'll spend some time making sure that we have the right SKU placements for customer service levels. And of course, in manufacturing, we're going to spend time on labor productivity. That's a lot of changeovers material handling and the like. Of course, purchasing, SAG, non-FTE spend will all be in there as well as we look at the operations. And I guess I'll wrap it up to say we've always benchmarked really well on working capital, but that's still an area that we're spending some time on as well. And then I'll just comment in a second, Rich's comments on the portfolio of assets and brands. I mean, we'll assess what's creating long-term strategic value for our business and also what we might be able to monetize in order to redeploy capital. So more to come.Operator(Operator Instructions) We will move next with Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.Rod Avraham LacheI guess I wanted to firstly just ask about for a little bit more clarification on what happened during the quarter in May, 1 month into the quarter, when you published your investor letter, you had guided to global replacement volume -- consumer replacement volume being down 5%, and they were down 15% and I look at markets like Europe, the market for consumer replacement, not trough, consumer replacement was down 4%, and you were down 26%. So there is some clear and noticeable underperformance here. So what specifically are you attributing the underperformance to? And why did it seemingly accelerate so much from -- into May and June?Richard J. KramerYes, Rod. I think maybe we'll take a step back. First of all, you're right, right? We have to own it and we didn't see the industry fall off as dramatically as it did. And our forecast didn't show that. We had weaker-than-expected conditions in truck, and we had weaker overall industry environment in Europe, as I spoke of before, and they weren't just small industry changes. They were significant. And I would tell you, particularly on the truck side, when we look at the truck replacement market, the markets, the industry was much worse than we expected. Americas was down 21%, EMEA was down 15%, and that's in some case, double what we might have expected to see in the markets. Christian alluded to it before, Rod. I mean I think what happened on the truck side is the cycle that you've seen before. We know it's coming. It's just very hard to predict. As we came off some of the COVID situation where we had demand running so far ahead of supply. Finally, what we saw are lower ton miles. We saw lower capacity utilizations in the trucking industry. And as Christian mentioned, we saw significantly lower, particularly in June of freight rates that were out there. Those are signs that our distribution saw. It's not their first rodeo. This is true in Europe and in the U.S. And what they did is start destocking right away. They know that it's coming, they've seen it before and that's what they did, and that's why we saw the volume decrease in truck. I will tell you the positive side on the truck part of the business, our fleet business is holding up very well. In fact, we even won fleets at higher prices in the quarter. That business, the whole fleet service model with all the digital tools is proving to be very durable, which is what the plan was. And then secondly, on the positive side, as Christian mentioned, we'll still see some destocking in Q3, probably more so in Europe than in the U.S., but that will turn around as well as we go. So that's what happened in truck, and we're dealing with it, and you saw that in the forecast. We're kind of moving forward with industry trends, making sure we're not going to build tires that we can't sell that we need to move on price. So that's what we're taking into consideration. If the industry gets better, we'll benefit from it. And then on the Europe side -- on the passenger side, excuse me, [Rod], it's kind of what I said, I mean for us, we saw the industry members down 12% after being down 13% I think you'll see a lot of imports coming in as well. And on the low end of the market, a lot of those imports that came in last year are actually making their way to the market now. That certainly had an impact on the overall market. But from a member perspective, it was about 12%, following 13%. And then we had really weak sellout as well. I mean people just weren't buying as the economy continues to cause people to cause our distribution to not go long on inventory and causes consumers to be more cautious on how they're spending their money. That's not going to last forever. That will change, Rod. But right now, that's what we're seeing. And candidly, it was worse than we expected. What we're doing about it maybe is equally important, and that's one we're still strong on price and mix. European business, I think, Christina, for the first time in well over a year, we offset raw material and inflation with price mix. We'll see those raw material tailwinds come back into the second quarter. That's a positive, but we have to then take those actions on costs that I mentioned earlier. So we're not going to sit still, but Rod, the market was certainly weaker and we felt it.Rod Avraham LacheI understand what you're saying about the market, Rich, I'm really asking about Goodyear specific underperformance. So in consumer replacement, the market was down 4, the members were down 12%, you're down 26%. And in commercial replacement, the industry is down 15%, and you're down 34%. So what is -- I imagine that the delta versus your expectations, obviously, it's partly the industry was weaker, but isn't the magnitude of the underperformance relative to the industry of factor too?Christian GadzinskiWell, Rod, maybe I'll jump in here, and this was noted in our letter on the summary of the quarter reflections page. But in Europe, we gained a lot of share in the second quarter of last year versus the industry. So this year was more of a normalization of just sell a share. Now this isn't reflective of what's happening in sell-out. But last year, we picked up a couple of points of share versus the industry. So our volume much stronger than our major competitors. This year, we're giving that back, but that was essentially in our plan, albeit at better industry levels.Rod Avraham LacheAnd just lastly, on the strategic side, I mean Europe has been a challenge for Goodyear for as long as I've covered the company. And I'm just wondering if you believe that, that business is ultimately strategic to the company and whether there's alternatives that could actually create some value from that region?Richard J. KramerWell, Rod, I have to say there are alternatives that we have to look at in terms of everything from going to market to the brand portfolio to the segments that we play in. I think all those things have to be on the table. But to answer your question on it being strategic, I think as we look at the OEMs that work over there and we look at the technology trends that they tend to lead not solely, but that they tend to lead, it's a market that our technology plays very well there, and we have to be there. How do we turn up, I think, is the question that we have to continue to look at. But some of the most complex problems from a vehicle perspective, a mobility perspective, take place in Europe and that's where we have some of our best technology. So absolutely, we have to be there. That said, it is an incredibly difficult market, as you say. And as we look at ourselves there, Rod, and you know this and you know the actions that we've taken over time, we have a footprint tilted towards Western Europe rather than Eastern Europe or other low-cost countries. Our labor costs are higher, that got worse with inflation from COVID. We've been acting on taking factories out from Ambien to Phillipsburg now to folder, and I can go back in time. We will continue to do those things, and we'll continue to right size the business where we can make sure that the advantages that we have around our technology are coming to the bottom line. But when you look at a slow economy, you look at the volume coming out and you look at the high-cost footprint we have there, that's what we're struggling against. We recognize it, and we're going to continue to put the actions in place as we referred to last time, and I think you'll see more to come sooner than later.OperatorAnd this does conclude our Q&amp;A session as well as our conference call. Thank you all for your participation, and you may disconnect at any time.]"

Welcome to Moderna's Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised today's conference is being recorded.I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Lavina Talukdar, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Lavina TalukdarThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Moderna's Second Quarter 2023 financial results and business updates. You can access the press release issued this morning as well as the slides that we'll be reviewing by going to the Investors section of our website.On today's call are Stéphane Bancel, our Chief Executive Officer; Stephen Hoge, our President; Arpa Garay, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Jamey Mock, our Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, please note that this conference call will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please see Slide 2 of the accompanying presentation and our SEC filings for important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements.With that, I will turn the call over to Stéphane.Story continuesStephane BancelThank you, Lavina. Good morning, or good afternoon. Today, I will start with a business review of our second quarter. Stephen will then review our clinical programs before Arpa gives an update on our commercial progress and plans. Jamey will present our financial results, and I will come back to share some final thoughts.In Q2, we reported revenues of approximately $300 million, reflecting the seasonal nature of endemic respiratory vaccines. Given our investments in our 4 infectious disease vaccine programs, which are in Phase III and our oncology program also in Phase III, this off-season quarter sales resulted in a GAAP net loss of $1.4 billion, GAAP diluted loss per share of $3.62. We ended the quarter with a cash and investment balance of $14.6 billion. We continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy, prioritizing organic growth of our platform with investments in our business. In Q2, we invested $1.1 billion in R&amp;D, continuing investments in late-stage clinical programs and progressing our pipeline. SG&amp;A costs were approximately $300 million. Capital investments were approximately $200 million.Year-to-date, our external investments were all strategic collaborations with the exception of OriCiro in Japan, which was an acquisition. OriCiro was renamed Moderna Enzymatics and is being integrated into Moderna manufacturing process development organization. From a capital return perspective, we repurchased 4.4 million shares in Q2 for a total of $628 million. Now turning to commercial and late-stage clinical updates in the quarter. With the submission of our XBB updated COVID-19 vaccine applications to regulators globally, we are now awaiting approval to start fall of 2023 sales. As you will hear from Arpa shortly, we're updating for COVID-19 sales expectation for 2023 to a range between $6 billion and $8 billion. This range reflects additional contracts in the U.S. commercial market and other countries. This range is wide given the uncertainty on the U.S. vaccination rate.Our commercial team is also preparing for the 2024 launch of RSV, our next respiratory commercial product. Regulatory applications have been submitted in major markets around the world. We've also started to manufacture mRNA-1345 in preparation for the launch. As a reminder, at launch, this product will be in a pre-filled syringe presentation, which combined with a strong efficacy profile, we position very well on product to health care professionals.In oncology, for mRNA-4157, or Individualized Neoantigen Therapy or INT, we are continuing to scale up manufacturing to support clinical development and commercial markets. We are very pleased to report our Phase III study in adjuvant melanoma has begun enrolling patients in July. We will plan, on Slide 6, our updated company profile. The breadth of our late-stage pipeline means we could see multiple launches in '24, '25 and '26.Turning now to Slide 7. I am proud to share that Moderna has been named as one of the world's most innovative companies in 2023 for pioneering AI-driven innovation by the Boston Consulting Group. As many of you know, AI has been part of the foundation of Moderna's research and development programs for several years. We have built our own AI models for protein and mRNA engineering, data analysis, regulatory interactions and many more other use cases.As we continue to be an AI leader in biopharma, one of our key modular mindset is that we digitize everything possible as we recognize that this will be central to the impact we have with AI. As of 2023, AI training is required for all Moderna's team members and will facilitate this training at the corporate level through our AI Academy. We have challenged everyone across all of our business functions at Moderna to incorporate AI into their everyday's workflow.I'm happy to share our AI implementation is accelerating throughout Moderna. Our secure large language model is called mChat. As you can see on the graph, our mChat usage has grown rapidly amongst our employees since its introduction on May 18. Around 50% of our employees use it already only 60 days after launch.With that, I will now toss to Stephen for an update on development programs.Stephen HogeThank you, Stéphane. Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll review the progress of our key clinical programs in Moderna, and I'll start with our respiratory vaccines. On the left-hand side of the slide, we have our commercial and late-stage clinical pipeline program against 3 important respiratory viruses, COVID-19, flu and RSV. I'll share some updates on these programs in a moment. Our next-generation programs have made substantial progress over the first half of this year, including mRNA-1283, which is enrolling participants in a Phase III study and our next-generation influenza vaccines, which are both in Phase II. We currently have 6 combination vaccine programs addressing adult and pediatric populations. Our combination vaccines are designed to address the largest health care burdens caused by respiratory infections while providing multiple advantages such as increasing compliance and reducing administration costs.Turning to our COVID program. We have submitted our applications for approval and authorization of mRNA-1273.815, our updated monovalent COVID-19 vaccine targeting the XBB.1.5 variant. Recall that the June VRBPAC meeting, the committee recommended an XBB-targeted monovalent vaccine with a preference for the XBB.1.5 strain. This recommendation was adopted by the FDA and is in concordance with the EMA and WHO guidance. In the U.S., the CDC ACIP is expected to publish recommendations and guidelines for the use of updated COVID-19 vaccines following approval and authorization this fall.On Slide 11 are the clinical data our team presented during the June VRBPAC meeting. Data from a subset of our Phase II/III study with mRNA-1273.815 demonstrated potent neutralization against XBB.1.5 and other variants of the XBB lineage. We're proud that Moderna was the only company that presented clinical data with an XBB.1.5 candidate in advance of the season, which we believe may help uptake of this important vaccine.Moving to RSV. As Stéphane mentioned earlier, we are pleased to be on track for regulatory approvals in 2024. Earlier this month, we announced a rolling submission to the FDA, and we plan to use a priority voucher to accelerate that review. We also filed additional regulatory applications in Europe, Switzerland, Australia and the U.K. We're incredibly encouraged by the profile of mRNA-1345 and look forward to the expected commercial launch next year.Next, on the seasonal influenza program. I'm pleased to announce that our P303 study is fully enrolled, and we look forward to sharing an update this quarter. P303 is testing an update to mRNA-1010 that is designed to increase the HAI neutralizing titers against the B antigens. This is a safety and immunogenicity Phase III study that we believe will support accelerated approval of the updated mRNA-1010 candidate.Now turning to our latent vaccines on Slide 14. Our Phase III CMV vaccine study in women of child-bearing age is ongoing and I'm pleased to share that the trial has enrolled more than 80% of participants. We look forward to full enrollment of that study soon.In our early clinical programs, EBV, HIV and VZV vaccine trials are ongoing and our HSV program is in pre-clinical.Now let's look at our mRNA therapeutics portfolio on the next slide, and I'll highlight a few programs. We are excited to announce that our Phase III melanoma study with INT is now enrolling. And I'll share the Phase III design in a moment. Our rare disease programs addressing major unmet medical needs in propionic acidemia, methylmalonic acidemia and GSD1a are ongoing, and we will look forward to sharing updates when the data are mature.Indeed, during the quarter, we presented an update on some of our PA program data at ASGCT. The dose confirmation part of the propionic acidemia study is currently ongoing. And lastly, our collaborators at Vertex are continuing to enroll in dose cystic fibrosis patients in the single ascending dose portion of that Phase I study. Now on my last slide today, I want to take a moment to share the exciting Phase III trial design for our Individualized Neoantigen Therapy, or INT. This Phase III study is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of the combination of INT plus KEYTRUDA against placebo plus KEYTRUDA in patients with resected melanoma at high risk of recurrence. The study will enroll approximately 1,089 resected melanoma patients, Stage IIB through IV with a 1:1 randomization. Each patient will receive up to 9 doses of INT every 3 weeks and KEYTRUDA every 6 weeks in the active arm or 9 doses of placebo every 3 weeks and KEYTRUDA every 6 weeks in the comparator arm. The primary endpoint is recurrence-free survival and secondary endpoints include Distant Metastasis-Free Survival and Overall Survival. I'm incredibly impressed with the collaboration between the Moderna and Merck scientific and clinical teams to rapidly stand up and begin enrolling this Phase III study.And with that, I'll turn it over to Arpa.Arpa GarayThank you, Stephen, and good day to everyone. I'll start with a review of sales in the quarter and the first half of 2023.In the second quarter of 2023, we reported approximately $300 million of COVID vaccine sales, which was in line with our expectations given the seasonal nature of endemic respiratory vaccine businesses. Sales of $2.1 billion for the first half of 2023 met our expectations. As a reminder, the sales in the first half were predominantly from mRNA-1273.222, which is our COVID vaccine targeting the BA.4, BA.5 variant. As you heard earlier from Stephen, regulators and health authorities around the world have selected the XBB.1.5 variant for the fall 2023 season. We have submitted applications to regulators globally for our updated vaccine and we are now awaiting approvals and authorizations. Subject to regulatory approvals, we expect additional sales in the second half of 2023, primarily from mRNA-1273.815.Turning now to the 2023 COVID sales outlook. We are updating our COVID sales expectation for 2023 to be in the range of $6 billion to $8 billion with the key variable being vaccination rates from the United States. Our 2023 sales mix consists of $2.1 billion in sales already recorded in the first half of this year, another $2 billion in sales from previously signed advanced purchase agreements for the second half delivery from several countries, including those listed in the middle column on this slide.Recent discussions with customers around the world have resulted in confirmed contracts of $2 billion for delivery in the second half of this year, updated from the originally expected $3 billion. Approximately $1 billion of the original $3 billion are now expected to be deferred to 2024. Also now included in the total expected 2023 COVID sales range of $6 billion to $8 billion is an additional $2 billion to $4 billion in sales expected from signed and anticipated commercial contracts in the U.S. as well as other markets such as Japan and the EU. The U.S. commercial contracts are a sizable portion of additional new sales expected in the second half of this year, so let me provide some color on that market in particular.As you are aware, the COVID vaccine market in the U.S. has shifted to a commercial market with the transition from the pandemic to the endemic phase. In the U.S., the commercial vaccines market is made up of many different customer segments, including retail pharmacies, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, integrated delivery networks, health systems, government entities, employers and other providers. Today, I am happy to report that we have signed contracts in each of these customer segments and continue to work on additional contracts. We are ready with ample supply to be shipped upon regulatory approval.Our science contracts give us visibility into the expected U.S. launch in the coming weeks and confidence in the additional sales we expect in the second half of 2023 from new orders. Let me now turn to Slide 21 to help frame the fall of 2023 U.S. COVID market. As I mentioned earlier, a key determinant for the market size in the U.S. will be vaccine uptake or shots and arms during the upcoming September to December time frame. As I've mentioned before, our expected 2023 sales range of $6 billion to $8 billion will be primarily driven by vaccination rates in the U.S. market. Earlier in the year, we provided parameters that informed our U.S. fall volume forecast for 2023, which included the roughly 50 million doses administered in the U.S. in the fall of 2022, 82 million Americans in the high-risk category for those who are over 50 with a comorbidity or those over the age of 65 and an average of 150 million doses of flu vaccines given in the U.S. every year for the last 9 years, which we believe is a reasonable proxy for a seasonal respiratory vaccine especially given the higher burden of disease with COVID.These parameters supported a volume forecast of 100 million doses for the U.S. market for fall 2023, but the fact of the matter is, in this first transition year to a commercial endemic market, it is difficult to accurately predict market volumes and predict how many Americans will come in this fall for their shots. As such, we look to Southern Hemisphere countries where the COVID season occurs during their fall/winter months to inform potential vaccination uptake in the U.S. as well. Specifically in Australia, where they are just completing their 2023 COVID season, the vaccination rate was 19% and populations where the booster vaccine was recommended. The Australian data, combined with prior year comparisons indicate U.S. market volumes for fall of 2023 to be in the range of 50 million to 100 million doses and this supports our U.S. sales expectations for the second half of the year.Moving to Slide 22. I'm excited to share the fall vaccination campaigns for the updated COVID vaccine launch. Moderna's fall vaccine campaigns are two-pronged and are focused on: first, increasing the market size through disease awareness programs and secondly, on solidifying Moderna's market share with branded promotion. With our disease awareness campaigns, we are aiming to educate on disease burden, clarify the latest recommendations from ACIP and connect COVID-19 with seasonal flu vaccines with the goal to drive consumers to get vaccinated this fall. Branded promotion campaigns will focus on driving brand preference from Moderna's vaccine running direct-to-consumer campaigns across major media channels and conducting promotions with health care providers. The commercial team is highly energized for the launch of the updated COVID vaccine.Moving on to Slide 23. We are continuing to prepare for a potential 2024 launch of our RSV vaccine and are excited about the opportunity in front of us. We believe our vaccine has the best-in-class profile. This includes consistent high efficacy across vulnerable and older populations, as shown in the strong clinical data that we have shared. Additionally, our safety profile is well established. We now have administered more than 1 billion COVID vaccine doses using the same mRNA technology as our RSV vaccine.In our Phase III study, most solicited adverse events were mild to moderate. An mRNA-1345 in our Phase III RSV trial has not had any reported cases of GBS events as of the April 30 cutoff date. And finally, one important differentiator for us and for our customers at launch will be the presentation of the product, which will be exclusively in ready-to-use pre-filled syringes. This packaging allows health care professionals to conveniently dose consumers with a ready-to-use formulation. We believe this will save time and reduce errors in comparison to the reconstituted drug products on the market.We continue to invest in pre-launch activities and are prepared for next year's potential launch. Our commercial team is active globally, and our manufacturing organization is well prepared to deliver the vaccine. With that, I will turn it over to Jamey.James M. MockThanks, Arpa, and hello, everyone. This morning, I will cover our second quarter financial performance and provide a framework for our full year financial outlook. Starting on Slide 25.Total product sales were $293 million, down 94% year-over-year, mainly driven by lower sales volume. We continue to expect 2023 to be a transitional year as we move from a pandemic to an endemic commercial market with significant seasonality. In line with our expectations, sales in the second quarter were relatively low, while we came in at the high end of our communicated range. Cost of sales for the second quarter of 2023 was $731 million.In addition to unit-driven manufacturing costs, this includes the following charges: $464 million for inventory write-downs related to excess and obsolete COVID-19 product, unutilized manufacturing capacity of $135 million and losses on firm purchase commitments of $75 million. These charges, other than royalties, were primarily driven by a shift in product demand to our latest monovalent XBB.1.5 COVID vaccine candidate and an overall lower market size compared to our expectations at the beginning of the year.In order to have ample supply at the beginning of the 2023 fall season, we prepared for various outcomes of the strain selection resulting in additional cost to the P&amp;L. The fact that a monovalent was chosen also meant that we were not able to use previously manufactured semi-finished goods.R&amp;D expenses were $1.1 billion, which increased by 62% versus prior year. The increase in R&amp;D continued to be driven by clinical trial-related expenses, particularly with our Phase III studies for RSV, seasonal flu and CMB. The increase in R&amp;D is also attributable to increases in personnel costs due to increased head count to support our research and late-stage development efforts.SG&amp;A expenses were $332 million, reflecting an increase of 57% year-over-year. The growth in spending was primarily driven by continued investments in personnel and outside services in support of our digital initiatives, marketed products, related commercialization activities as well as our company expansion.Income tax was a benefit of $369 million for the second quarter, mainly due to a loss from operations. Net loss for the period was $1.4 billion compared to net income of $2.2 billion last year and diluted loss per share was $3.62 compared to diluted earnings per share of $5.24 in 2022.We ended Q2 with cash and investments of $14.6 billion compared to $16.4 billion at the end of the first quarter. The decrease was driven by our net loss in the period and an approximately $600 million of share buybacks. Cash deposits for future product supply declined during the quarter by approximately $100 million to $1.7 billion by the end of the second quarter, which was in line with our expectations.Now turning to Slide 27. I want to give an update on the progress we have made on our capital allocation priorities. Our top investment priority has been and will continue to be reinvesting in the base business. R&amp;D spending in the first half of 2023 increased 80% year-over-year to $2.3 billion, and we remain on track to invest $4.5 billion in R&amp;D for the full year. We are also investing in our digital capabilities, the commercial build-out of the organization as well as expanding our manufacturing footprint. We've accelerated our capital expenditures in 2023 as we expand both our international and U.S. manufacturing footprint.Our second investment priority is to seek attractive external investments and collaboration opportunities that will enable and complement our platform. We remain disciplined in our approach and are in multiple active discussions.After evaluating internal and external investment opportunities, we then assess additional uses of cash. In the first half of 2023, we repurchased 8 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion and we had $1.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining as of June 30, 2023.Now let's turn to our updated 2023 financial framework on Slide 28. We would like to share our thinking beyond the advanced purchase agreements. As Arpa mentioned earlier, we now expect product sales for 2023 in the range of $6 billion to $8 billion comprising of approximately $4 billion from existing APAs and approximately $2 billion to $4 billion from additional sales to the U.S., Japan, EU and other countries. As a result of recent discussions with customers around the world, we now expect approximately $1 billion of the original total $5 billion in APAs to be deferred to 2024. Second half sales timing will be dependent on timing of regulatory approvals across the world, and the number of days available in the third quarter to ship. We currently expect a sales split of 30% in Q3 and 70% in Q4.We now expect cost of sales for the full year in the range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. At this point of the year, our production costs are largely fixed and only a smaller portion is driven by the sales outcome. Therefore, we thought it would be more helpful to provide you an absolute dollar range for your modeling purposes.For R&amp;D and SG&amp;A, we continue to expect full year expenses to be approximately $6 billion, with approximately $4.5 billion in research and development. We now anticipate a full year tax benefit in the range of $0.7 billion to $1 billion, driven by an assumed operating loss, R&amp;D credits, international provisions and nonrecurring items. And finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion.That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Stéphane.Stephane BancelThank you, Jamey, Arpa and Stephen.Moderna has a promising commercial outlook, starting with COVID. While there is uncertainty in vaccination rates as we transition from a pandemic to endemic market, our APAs and U.S. commercial contracts underpin our expected 2023 COVID revenue in the range of $6 billion to $8 billion. We believe this first endemic here will provide visibility to recurring revenue stream. I believe we will be selling COVID vaccines for a very long time and we are working to combine COVID and flu into a single vaccine.Moving to RSV. RSV vaccine has a strong product profile and a differentiated pre-filled syringe presentation that should work through our advantage in the anticipated 2024 launch. In oncology, we are scaling our IoT manufacturing capacity to be ready for commercialization. The Phase II data are very strong, and we are now in Phase III with melanoma indication.With our partner, Merck, we are working to prioritize indications beyond those already announced, which are melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer.Stepping back and looking at the broad portfolio, I'm very excited that we are playing with a high-case scenario of Moderna with positive clinical data in infectious disease vaccine, in oncology, and in rare genetic disease of liver. Over the next 3 years, from '24, '25, '26, we anticipate multiple product launches across our vaccine and therapeutics portfolio that will position the company for strong sales growth. This is an incredibly exciting time at Moderna as we enter a new era with diversified revenue stream and a robust pipeline.The platform is working, and the result will be an unprecedented number of mRNA launches in a very short time.We look forward to updating you further at our upcoming R&amp;D Day on September 13. That event will be live in New York City and, of course, also available online. On December 7, we'll be hosting our second annual ESG Day. This event will be online. The mission of our company is to deliver the greatest possible impact to people through MRNA medicines. This mission is especially relevant now as we approach the launch of multiple new medicines that should extend human lives and alleviate patient suffering. All of our stakeholders are poised to benefit as Moderna continues to deliver on its potential. It is a privilege for all of us to be part of this company.We'll now take questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs.Salveen Jaswal RichterWith regard to the expected additional sales for second half deliveries, can you speak to the spectrum of factors in addition to the U.S. vaccination rates that might impact reaching the higher end of that range? And can you discuss confidence that additional contracts wouldn't be pushed to 2024 as the fall season plays out?Arpa GarayThank you for the question. So in terms of the additional sales of $2 billion to $4 billion, as you mentioned, the key factor of landing within that $6 billion to $8 billion is really around how many Americans this fall come in to get their shot. So vaccination rate is the biggest swing factor within that range. We are confident in our market share and the progress that we've been making with commercial contracts thus far in the U.S.Additionally, outside of the U.S., to your question on additional contracts potentially being deferred, we have met with all of the different countries where we have advanced purchase agreements and have already confirmed deliveries for the second half of this year, other than the $1 billion, which was pushed into 2024. So we're confident in staying at that $2 billion range.OperatorOur next question comes from Tyler Van Buren with TD Cowen.Tyler Martin Van BurenSo with the COVID-19 vaccine sales of $6 billion to $8 billion expected for the year, how should we think about what that implies for real demand as we think about the eventual COVID-19 vaccine franchise tail? Is it $2 billion to $4 billion since the $4 billion was already locked in from APAs at the start of the year from prior years? If not, what proportion of the $4 billion of APAs would you consider true annual booster demand? Perhaps, is it the $2 billion expected in the second half? Thoughts there would be helpful.Arpa GarayThank you for the question. So in terms of how we're thinking about 2024, I would look at the first half of 2023, where we have recently reported $2.1 billion of sales. A portion of that volume is volume that we do not anticipate as a recurring sale in the outer years, given most countries are going towards fall vaccination campaigns with annual shot. For the remainder of the $4 billion to $6 billion, we do believe that vaccine demand will remain. And over time, eventually increase as we think about the flu volumes that we believe the COVID vaccination rates will start trending to.So as I mentioned earlier, for example, in the United States, there are about 150 million flu vaccines given every fall. What we've modeled for 2023 is the range of 50 million to 100 million. And we think over time, given the high disease burden and also as we think about future combinations, we will start trending closer to about 150 million.OperatorOur next question comes from Gena Wang with Barclays.Huidong WangTwo very quick questions. Regarding the COVID U.S. commercial contract that signed, were there any definitive initial stocking order? And second, regarding the RSV vaccine, given that Pfizer and the GSK label language and a slow initial launch, any learning you could have for your approval and the launch prep?Arpa GarayThank you. So I'll take the first question around U.S. contracts first. In our contracting progress, we do have minimum volume commitments across many of our commercial contracts. But most of our contracts were looking at minimum commitments and depending on vaccination uptake that we will be monitoring closely with our customers, that volume could go up over time.In terms of the recent RSV ACIP meeting, we think the ACIP recommendation for a shared clinical decision-making will mean a more gradual uptake for the first two vaccines that have been approved. Though as we believe there is more data from both our clinical program as well as GSK and Pfizer's clinical programs, we do believe there is opportunity to potentially update that recommendation, which would, over time, lead to a broader uptake of the RSV vaccine.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies.Unidentified AnalystThis is Dina on for Mike. Just a quick question on the flu update. So I saw that you guys are doing a Q3 update for the second immunogenicity study and then going on to have data in Q3 with that, but how about the efficacy study from that second infection or that -- yes, that previous infection study, what are your time lines for that? Have that shifted? Are you going to share that? And also on PCV, are you going to be sharing any additional updates on the regulatory path moving forward? Or are you sharing any other updates on lung, et cetera?Stephen HogeThank you, Dina, for the question or questions. So -- so first, on the 1010 flu program, as you referenced, we have 2 ongoing. We have actually 3 ongoing Phase III studies, but 2 that are continuing to accrue data. We'll be providing updates on the efficacy study, the P302 study you referenced. And as you know, in our Vaccines Day, we talked about end of season update. And we'll also be sharing where we are in the pivotal P303 immunogenicity study. And as I said, we'll be doing that this quarter, and we're excited to continue to update on the progress in influenza.As it relates to INT. Now INT, not PCV, that program, we had a great opportunity to provide an update to you all and everyone at ASCO just a month ago. And we're going to be, of course, at our R&amp;D Day, reprising that and also talking to some of the other progress happening in the INT program. We are obviously working hard to get up and running in our non-small cell lung cancer, but we're really -- pivotal studies, but we're really excited by the start of the first Phase III with melanoma study now, and we'll be providing further updates in a month in New York.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Ellie Merle with UBS.Unidentified AnalystThis is Sarah on for Ellie. Just a follow-up on Tyler's earlier question. Thinking about COVID volumes going forward, can you give more color on how you're thinking about first half versus second half, particularly any color on your expectation for first half of next year? And then on CMV, any expectation on when you'll complete enrollment? And how we should think about when we could get data and maybe anything you're seeing on a blinded basis on the event rate?Arpa GaraySo I'm happy to take the first question and then we'll hand it over to Stephen on CMV.In terms of how we're thinking about the first half versus second half going forward, in the first half of the year, sales that we expect will come from the Southern Hemisphere where it is their fall and winter season. Additionally, in some countries in the higher-risk populations, there continue to be spring campaigns and boosters, particularly for immuno-compromise, elderly and highest risk patients. So we do anticipate some sales coming in for the high-risk spring boost for the Southern Hemisphere as well as any carryover from late winter of this year into January. The majority of our sales will continue to be expected in the second half of the year though as the majority of our sales will be anticipated from the Northern Hemisphere and the fall vaccine campaign.Stephen HogeGreat. And a question on CMV enrollment. Yes, we're really excited by the recent acceleration towards completion of enrollment there. We're past 80%. We do hope to complete enrollment shortly. We've made good progress in the first half of this year. And so we haven't specifically set a target on that, but we would hope to enroll it for sure this year.The -- then we will be accruing cases. And I think that's where it gets very interesting in tracking the CMV Phase III program. We've already started to accrue cases that we talked about in the Vaccines Day. And as we get to full enrollment, we will have more participants who can contribute cases to our first interim analysis of efficacy, which will be an event-driven analysis and so not something we can predict...OperatorOur next question comes from Luca Issi with RBC Capital.Luca IssiMaybe one, Jamey, if I can circle back on margins. I think your prior guidance implied 60% to 65% gross margin versus your new guidance today implies 47% gross margin at the midpoint. Can you just maybe expand a little bit more on what's driving that change today? And then maybe Stephen on flu, I think Sanofi argued that the lower immunogenicity for the B strain could actually be a class effect. So it'd be difficult for any of the mRNA player to actually have strong immunogenicity for the B strain. Wondering what are your thoughts there?James M. MockYes. Thanks, Luca. I'll take the first question. So on margins, yes, you're right. We were planning for 60% to 65%. I'd say it's largely volume driven, $1 billion of APAs pushing out to 2024 as an example. We still have the cause for those fixed into our $3.5 billion to $4 billion in addition to other markets as well. So I think our volume expectation prior to this quarter was a little higher, some due to push out, some just due to overall volume that we anticipate coming through here.Stephen HogeAnd I'm aware of the argument that Sanofi made about a class effect. I'm not sure I see it the same way. I think we'll look to the data to answer that question rather than conjecture. We'll look forward to sharing where we are in the P303 Phase III study in the next quarter. And I'll leave it at that.OperatorOur next question comes from Edward Tenthoff with Piper Sandler.Edward Andrew TenthoffGreat. Can you hear me okay?Arpa GarayLoud and clear.Edward Andrew TenthoffGreat. So thanks for all the detail in the update. And my question is kind of a little bit of a longer-term strategic one. As COVID continues to evolve and then as you ultimately seek approval of 1010 and even RSV. What is the plan for combining these from a regulatory standpoint and then also a commercial standpoint? So how do we get from where we are today with 1 approved, maybe 2 -- 3 approved vaccines next year to 1 combo approved or multiple combo approved vaccines?Stephen HogeThanks for the questions, Ed. So as you know, we've had -- as I said, we have 6 combo vaccines. We've got lots of clinical data out there. And we continue to look at new combinations. And if we're in a situation that we expect to be in, where we have a flu, RSV and COVID approved as well as second-generation COVID moving forward, you can be -- you can rest assure we'll be looking at multiple different combinations of those, trying to bring forward options that provide the greatest public health flexibility. Those studies, once we have the products approved, the monovalent vaccines, those studies are really just immune bridging studies, demonstrating that we can do the combination and achieve non-inferior immunogenicity and safety in those studies. They can be quite quick and they also don't need to be run in the season, as you know.And so our goal is going to be, as we've said throughout this year, is to complete the work to move towards approval, filing and eventually, hopefully, approval of the 3 monovalent vaccines and quickly progressing into the pivotal Phase IIIs for at least 1 and multiple combos. Our goal, again, is to be launching those in '25 and beyond. So the obvious reason that they will improve compliance, deliver more value and actually decrease the administration cost of health care.So the path is actually pretty clear from here, particularly given the strength of the RSV data and where we are in COVID, and we hope to be providing an update very shortly on flu that also provides a clear path for '24 in the monovalent launches we've guided. And then I think we'll clarify very quickly that we're starting the Phase IIIs to allow the combo launches very shortly thereafter.Edward Andrew TenthoffThat's really helpful, Stephen. And just to clarify 1 point, if I may. When you said the pivotal Phase IIIs, those would be immuno-bridging studies?Stephen HogeImmunogenicity -- correct. They're immunogenicity and safety studies. So very quick studies, just demonstrating. We do not believe nor is the norm from a regulatory perspective that you have to do subsequent efficacy studies once you've established the efficacy of the monovalent vaccines.OperatorOur next question comes from Manos Mastorakis with Deutsche Bank.Manos MastorakisBasically, I just wanted to ask in terms of the COGS guidance, does that apply regardless of the revenue range? And if not, what is the sensitivity range that you could provide?James M. MockYes. Thanks for the question, Manos. Yes, it does apply regardless, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, most of this cost is fixed at this point. We've already ordered the raw materials. We've already started manufacturing. Most of our -- we have got a lot of supply ready to go as soon as we are able to -- as soon as we get regulatory approval. So that $3.5 billion to $4 billion is not really dependent too much on the sales outcome that will happen either way.And maybe just to talk to longer term. So I think what we're suffering with this year is just an unpredictable market. So back to the prior question of the 35% to 40% or 60% to 65% gross margin. As it becomes more predictable, we will be able to order the right amount of material, you have the right amount of volume commitments that might not happen in 2024 as we've worked through some of our commitments. But we feel very confident in the overall 75% to 80% gross margin range in the long term.OperatorOur next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.Alec Warren StranahanThis is Alec on for Geoff. Can you talk about all the other potential indications you may pursue for the INT vaccine? And how will you decide which indications to pursue first? Will this be based on the facts like rationale or an unmet need? And then secondly, what commercial hurdles do you expect for flu and RSV given the entrenched competition and new entrants respectively?Stephen HogeGreat. Thank you for the question. So first -- so obviously, we're moving forward to melanoma, as you know. And we're moving forward to non-small cell lung cancer. I think the opportunity there, the unmet need there is obviously very significant. And as we know, that's one of the largest opportunity for immune therapies generally. And so it's an obvious place for us to go next. As we've said before, we have not yet publicly guided with our partner, Merck, on what the other indications will be, but we have said that we are going to follow the path of all the places where PD-1 KEYTRUDA have been successful, but where we think there is still headroom, still opportunity to significantly improve upon what's been achieved with the PD-1 antibodies. And so you can follow through the adjuvant settings as well as perhaps some of the Stage IV settings where there are those benefits and expect us to be moving there in short order. Ourselves in Merck are in the process of finalizing some of those plans and at the appropriate time, obviously, we will guide you on the start of those studies.But rest assured, as we've said and as they've said before, there is a quite large program of studies that will be ramping up here in very short order and melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer are really just the first 2.Arpa GarayAnd I can take the question on RSV and flu. We are very excited to be launching RSV next year. So while we will be bringing the third product to market, we're very confident in what we believe is a best-in-class profile with our consistently high effectiveness across high-risk groups, thinking about our well-established safety profile in the only mRNA platform for RSV and lastly, as I mentioned earlier, being the only product with a ready-to-use pre-filled syringe. So we're feeling really good about the RSV launch preparations, and we're ready to execute in 2024.From a flu perspective, we do think one of the advantages of 1010, which would be our first generation flu vaccine is our speed to market could give us an opportunity for better strain matching in the future. And as we get enhanced profiles for flu, as Stephen mentioned earlier, from a commercial perspective, we see a tremendous amount of interest in our combination vaccines both from patients as well as from health care systems. So having RSV and flu gives us an incredible opportunity for combinations in the future.OperatorOur next question comes from Evan Wang with Guggenheim Securities.Boran WangI just wanted some thoughts on COVID. And as we're thinking ex-U.S., any details you can share in terms of size orders and market positioning in some of your markets like Japan? And what could change in 2024? And in flu, just great to see the P303 study for enrolled. Just want some updated thoughts in terms of confidence on hitting on some of the B strain given some of the competitive updates?Arpa GaraySo I'll take the first question. From an ex-U.S. perspective, we have signed a minimum commitment with Japan that has been announced. The minimum commitment that we signed with Japan is just to get product into the country as soon as August and so we're ready to execute this fall. If their vaccine uptake expands, we do anticipate additional orders coming in from Japan.For the rest of the world, we have advanced purchase agreements that I have outlined already on in that first column as well as ongoing conversations with several other international markets, including those in the European Union. In terms of 2024 changes. What we expect outside the U.S. is we expect more and more markets to actually be transitioning from central government procured to more of an endemic commercial market such as the transition that the U.S. is going through today. So we do anticipate changes. Most of those changes will be around shifting where the procurement is happening as well as changes in pricing and reimbursement going forward.Stephen HogeThe flu question. So yes, we're fully enrolled in P303, ahead of schedule on that and we will provide data shortly on the P303 study this quarter as we said. As far as B strains goes, we already updated earlier this year that actually in the P302 study, we achieved non-inferiority in the B strains. You'll remember in the P301 we just -- we had missed that. And so we were learning as we went. And we actually made a series of changes into the P303 study that we were confident and remain very confident, we'll provide a benefit in the B strains that will improve immunogenicity there.So I remain quite optimistic that our understanding of science is really strong, we think best-in-class and that where we will be and when we look at that P303 data, ensure is in a very strong position as it relates to B strains and continue to be in a very strong position as it relates to the A strains.Arpa GarayAnd Kevin, we will take our last question.OperatorOur last question comes from Simon Baker with Redburn.Simon P. BakerJust 2 questions from me. One was, how has your view of the RSV opportunity changed in light of compared to 2-year data and the ACIP recommendation. In what regard do you think that you can achieve best-in-class profile? And the second question was just a little bit more about the CMV Phase III enrollment and if you think you'll be able to get full enrollment by this quarter?Arpa GarayI'll start with the RSV question. In light of the ACIP shared decision-making recommendation as well as some of the data that was shared this year around revaccination, we do anticipate a slower vaccine uptake at the start. In terms of our potential in that market, we do continue to be very confident that we have a best-in-class profile. And as we get additional data from our own vaccine program, we are hopeful that the ACIP recommendation will be broadened and could be -- will enable a faster uptick in outer years.Stephen HogeAnd the only thing I'd add to that in terms of the development side is we are obviously looking at multiple different versions of RSV combination vaccines and 1 of the advantages there will obviously be increased convenience and compliance. And that's where if we can create health care system value, I think it will be -- it will continue to evolve the recommendation that people have around that.As it relates to CMV, so we haven't set out a guidance on when we would expect the enrollment to complete. But we are actually confident given the trajectory that we're already past 80% that we will complete enrollment this year, I'm not saying this quarter, but this year. And as I said, what really matters is probably not whether we're at 80% or 99% or 100% enrollment, it's the accrual of cases and events that will drive the first interim analysis from forward. Now obviously, more patients, more participants enrolled will increase the number of and pace of those events over time. And so we are focused very much on that operationally, and we do hope to have that completed this year.OperatorI'd like to turn the call back to Stéphane for any closing remarks.Stephane BancelWell, thank you very much for your questions. We look forward to seeing many of you in the next days and weeks, but especially seeing you at the R&amp;D Day on September 13 to see many of you in person. Have a great day. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.]"

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Williams Companies' (NYSE:WMB) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Williams Companies:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.095 = US$4.1b ÷ (US$49b - US$5.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Williams Companies has an ROCE of 9.5%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Oil and Gas industry average of 20%. View our latest analysis for Williams Companies roceIn the above chart we have measured Williams Companies' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Williams Companies.The Trend Of ROCEWilliams Companies' ROCE growth is quite impressive. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 131% in that same time. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Williams Companies' ROCETo bring it all together, Williams Companies has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. Since the stock has returned a solid 48% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.If you want to know some of the risks facing Williams Companies we've found 2 warning signs (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you should be aware of before investing here.While Williams Companies isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

And now at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Danilo Juvane, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG and Investment Analysis. Please go ahead, sir.Danilo Marcelo JuvaneThanks, Abby, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release and the presentation that the President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and our Chief Financial Officer, John Porter, will speak to this morning. Also joining us on the call today are Micheal Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; Lane Wilson, our General Counsel; and Chad Zamarin, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development. In our presentation materials, you'll find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in the presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconciled to generally accepted accounting principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.Story continuesAlan S. ArmstrongOkay. Well, thanks, Danilo, and thank you all for joining us today. Another positive story to share with you this quarter, and you can see some of those highlighted here and called out on Slide 2. First of all, adjusted EBITDA up 8%, adjusted earnings per share up 5%, and our gathering volumes were up 6%. And certainly, while this growth and beat is impressive, our resiliency in the face of low commodity prices is even more impressive and gave us another opportunity to distinguish ourselves from the pack, which is largely posted declines this quarter. And our growth continues to compound despite these price swings in natural gas. This quarter was a perfect example where we saw an 8% EBITDA increase on the back of a very strong 14% increase for the same period last year. John will dive deeper into the numbers in a moment, but let me start out with a few highlights from the quarter. Our financial performance is our track record, but it is the day-to-day focus on execution by our teams that drives these results and really does set us apart. As an example, our teams have done a fantastic job of quickly integrating the MountainWest acquisition into our core business. And in fact, we're pleased to announce that we've already secured binding precedent agreements to support a significant expansion on the newly acquired Overthrust pipeline. This project was not even in our upside case for this investment and the team has identified even more growth to come that is beyond our original expectations. Much of this growth is centered around coal to natural gas conversions in the Western states. On Transco, we continue to advance our emission reduction program and recently completing completed our first large-scale compressor replacement project in Virginia. Our backlog of high-return pipeline expansion opportunities continue to progress, driven by a large wave of incremental demand that continues to exceed our expectations. As evidence of this continued wave of increasing demand, we recently concluded a nonbinding open season to advance another large-scale Transco project that will provide much needed capacity to serve our customers south of Station 165 in Virginia. Our customers' requested capacity that has been well in excess of the 800,000 dekatherms per day that we offered. Importantly, the minimum required term for this service offering was 20 years. This underscores our belief in the durable and fast-growing demand for capacity and the market's confidence in our ability to deliver this capacity with the lowest environmental impact, following the approval of the Mountain Valley Pipeline. We're now working to find a way to serve as much of our customers' needs as possible and hope to have an update on this exciting project soon. Moving on to financial performance. As I stated earlier, despite a weakened natural gas price environment, our financial results not only grew against the difficult comp in a difficult environment, but this quarter marked the 30th consecutive earnings print that either met or exceeded consensus estimates. Within our legacy base business in the Northeast, we produced record EBITDA and record gathering volumes, delivering growth that far outpaced the total production across the Marcellus. Our strategy to focus on connecting our producing customers to the best markets with the most reliable service available, has grown this business to the point it is nearing $2 billion per year of EBITDA. The completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, our Regional Energy Access project and continued growth of gas-fired generation in the local market will continue to provide market and volume growth well into the future. In the West, we also achieved record gathering volumes once again showing that our diverse geographic position is built to weather commodity price swings. In our Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico segment, we are enjoying the beginnings of a long runway of growth in the deepwater, gearing up for a long string of expansions on Transco and enjoying better-than-expected growth in our MountainWest acquisition, which speaks to our successful integration. Importantly, the strength of our base business more than offset weaker E&amp;P earnings and expected low seasonal cash flows from our marketing business. The quarter's results continue to prove out the inherent stability and stubborn growth of our business. However, when we see the market fail to appreciate our ability to deliver in low price environments, we will continue to execute on our authorized repurchase program, much like we did during the second quarter. And finally, a few notes on our sustainability efforts. Last week, we issued our 2022 sustainability report and completed our annual CDP climate questionnaire. These are both important markers that detail our progress on key issues like environmental stewardship, community support and workforce development. To us, sustainability means running our business in a way that will create value for the perpetual shareholder. So we're proud to have also be providing our shareholders with industry-leading returns on invested capital, and we expect our shareholders to further benefit from enhanced capital returns as we execute on our large growth backlog, which, among others, includes 7 out of 9 major pipeline projects that are coming online in the fourth quarter of '24 and that will be stacked on top of a solid foundation of a sustainable base business. And with that, I'm going to turn things over to John to walk us through the financial metrics of the quarter. John?John D. PorterThanks, Alan. Starting here on Slide 3 with a summary of our year-over-year financial performance. Beginning with adjusted, we saw another strong quarterly increase of 8% over the prior year, and this happens to coincide with an 8.6% CAGR over the last 5 years for the same measure. And this strong performance included a new record for gathering volumes, which increased 6%. Year-to-date, our adjusted EBITDA is now up 13% driven by the growth of our core infrastructure businesses, which continued to perform very well even as natural gas price decreased 61% for the first half of 2023 versus the first half of 2022, once again demonstrating the resiliency and strength of our natural gas focused strategy, our assets and our operational capabilities. For second quarter, our adjusted EPS increased 5% for the quarter, continuing the strong growth we've had in EPS over the last many years with our year-to-date EPS now up 23%. Available funds from operations, AFFO growth for second quarter was in line with adjusted EBITDA. And you see our second quarter dividend coverage based on AFFO was a very strong 2.23x, growing about 2% despite growing our dividend by 5.3%. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen with debt to adjusted EBITDA now reaching 3.5x and versus last year's 3.82x, and that's even after closing the Trace, NorTex and MountainWest acquisition and also repurchasing $139 million worth of shares since last year. By CapEx, you see an increase primarily reflecting the progress we're making on some of our key growth projects, including Regional Energy Access and Louisiana Energy Gateway. For the full year, there is no change to our consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance of $6.4 billion to $6.8 billion or any of our other guidance metrics. But in a moment, I'll provide a little color on our expectations for the remainder of the year versus the performance we've seen thus far in 2023. So let's turn to the next slide and take a little closer look at the second quarter results. A strong 8% increase in EBITDA over prior year even as average natural gas prices for the second quarter decreased 71%, walking now from last year's roughly $1.5 billion to this year's $1.6 billion, we start with our upstream joint venture operations that are included in our Other segment, which were down $43 million versus last year. Our Haynesville upstream EBITDA was down about $14 million despite substantially higher production due to much lower net realized prices and a lower working interest percentage on new wells beginning in January of 2023. Our Wamsutter upstream EBITDA was down $29 million due primarily to lower realized prices, but production also continued to be impacted throughout April from the historically difficult Wyoming winter weather we saw in the first quarter. Shifting now to our core business performance. Our Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico business improved $96 million or 15%, including about a $52 million contribution from our MountainWest Pipeline and NorTex acquisition, but with other increases in our transmission and deep water revenues as well. Our Northeast G&amp;P business performed extremely well with the $65 million or 14% increase driven by an $81 million increase in service revenues. And we did have a onetime $14 million favorable gathering revenue catch-up adjustment in that second quarter increase in service revenue. But this revenue increase was really fueled by a 6% increase in total volumes in the Northeast. Shifting now to the West, which increased to $16 million or 5%, benefiting from continued strong volume growth in the Haynesville and positive hedge results that partially offset the impact of lower commodity base rate. And then you see the $22 million decrease in our gas and NGL marketing business, and the majority of this decline was actually related to lower NGL marketing results from inventory valuation changes where we had a gain on NGL inventories last year but a loss this year. So again, the second quarter continued our strong start to 2023 with 8% growth in EBITDA, driven by core infrastructure business performance in spite of natural gas prices that were 71% lower than second quarter of 2022. So let's turn the page and touch on the year-to-date comparison. Year-to-date, we've seen a 13% increase over '22, walking now from last year's $3 billion to this year's $3.4 billion, we start with the upstream joint venture operations included in our Other segment, which were down $39 million versus last year. Now year-to-date, Haynesville is up nicely on very strong volume growth that has been significantly offset by lower realized prices. However, the overall Haynesville increase was offset by lower 1 set of results due primarily to the historically difficult winter weather we saw in Wyoming this year. Shifting now to our core business performance. Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico business improved $127 million or 9% and really similar themes as our second quarter, namely the impact of the MountainWest Pipeline and NorTex acquisition. However, we have seen other significant increases in our transmission and deepwater revenues as well. Our Northeast G&amp;P business has performed very well with $117 million or 13% increase, driven by $154 million increase in service revenue. This revenue increase was fueled by a 7% increase in total volumes focused in our liquids-rich areas where we tend to have higher per unit margins than our dry gas areas. And in the appendix, you'll find a slide that compares our 7% volume growth to the overall basin growth of just under 2%. Shifting now to the West, which increased $42 million or 8%, benefiting from positive hedge results and the Trace acquisition, but the West was significantly unfavorably impacted by the severe Wyoming weather and January processing economics at our Opal Wyoming processing plant. And then you see the $144 million increase in our gas and NGL marketing business caused by the strong first quarter that we had at the start of the year. So again, a continuation to the strong start to 2023 with 13% growth in EBITDA and driven by core infrastructure business performance with strength from our marketing business that dramatically overcame weaker-than-expected results from the upstream joint ventures. So as I mentioned earlier, there's no change to our consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance of $6.4 billion to $6.8 billion or any of our other guidance metrics. We've definitely had a strong start to the year with $3.4 billion of EBITDA through the first half of the year. And thanks to the performance of our base business, we have clear visibility to hitting at least the midpoint of our guidance even after a historic decline in natural gas prices and a historically difficult winter that continue to have impacts through April. So you may be wondering why we aren't raising our guidance on the back of such a strong start to the year and a bright future ahead. First, I will remind you that our guidance does include a range of $200 million above our midpoint. And second, while we usually experience stronger third and fourth quarters than second quarter, the third quarter does occasionally see hurricane outages for our deepwater business. Finally, we could also still see downward shifts in natural gas prices for the balance of the year that could unfavorably impact our upstream joint ventures in particular. While we are not suggesting there is a high likelihood of realizing these impacts, we do need to be prepared to overcome these scenarios. Therefore, it is too early to raise our full year guidance. But once again, we are confident in the continued performance of our base infrastructure businesses allowing us to once again meet or exceed the midpoint of our guidance range. We're setting our sights on continued growth in '24 before another big growth step in '25. And with that, I'll turn it back to Alan.Alan S. ArmstrongOkay. Thanks, John. Just a few closing remarks before we open it up for your questions here. First, I'll start by reiterating our belief that Williams remains a compelling investment opportunity. We are the most natural gas-centric large-scale midstream company around today and the integrated nature of our business from our best-in-class long-haul pipes to our formidable gathering assets, which are complemented by our Sequent platform that delivers upside to our base business is unique, and we have a track record to prove it. Second, our combination of proven resilience 5-year EPS CAGR of 23%, industry-leading coverage on our steadily growing dividend, a strong balance sheet and high visibility to growth, we think is unique amongst the S&amp;P 500 and unique within our sector. Let me emphasize that our natural gas-focused strategy has allowed us to produce a 10-year track record of growing adjusted EBITDA through a number of commodity and economic cycles, and it is continuing to deliver significant growth in the current environment. And we're now celebrating 7.5 years of delivering in line or better quarterly results. That is especially impressive when you consider the sector's ups and downs over this period. And the fundamentals are setting up stronger than ever for this long-term predictable growth to continue. And finally, as we think about our long-term strategy, we see that U.S. natural gas infrastructure is key to meeting both today's energy demand as well as projected growth of electrification and renewables build out in the future. Simply put, you cannot implement and accelerate when solar and large-scale electrification without having natural gas as a reliable, complementary partner to these big system changes. In fact, despite continued growth in solar and wind capacity, the country saw record natural gas power demand in July, reaching as high as 53 Bcf per day last week to meet summer power loads. This tops the previous record set last July by 6%, again, compounding growth, on top of compounding growth. And so if we truly do want to meet our country's growing power demand for things like data centers and EVs and accelerate wind and solar power generation, we must continue increasing natural gas infrastructure capacity. This fact has become evident to both the majority of our legislators and the Biden administration as they came out with unprecedented support for Mountain Valley Pipeline's completion. Williams is here for the long haul, and we are committed to leveraging our large-scale natural gas infrastructure network for the benefit of generations to come. And with that, I'll open it up for your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question this morning from Spiro Dounis at Citi.Spiro Michael DounisFirst question, maybe to start with gas macro. It looks like we're maybe approaching a trough here and some of the producer activity. So just curious to get your all's view on what your producer customers are seeing and doing? And really just how you're thinking about the volume and price trajectory from here as we head into '24 and really wait for LNG volumes to pick up a lot of the slack?Alan S. ArmstrongYes, Spiro. Well, certainly -- I wouldn't say there's one answer to that question, but maybe I'll try to summarize it a little bit. I think the majority of producers see a pretty bright future for demand right now. And as a result of that, they are making sure that they're not letting their systems fall into a decline in a way that would be hard to recover from. So I would say they're much like a cat kind of poised for demand growth in the future, but really watching costs and trimming up costs where they can kind of proving up their capabilities in certain areas. So I would say it feels to me like the producers are trying to maintain level volumes as much as possible, but being poised for future demand growth that's pretty evident down the road.Spiro Michael DounisGot it. That's helpful. Second question is just maybe moving to leverage. As you guys pointed out, you're down to about 3.5x now this quarter. So it's already below your target on the year. So just curious how you're thinking about utilizing the excess balance sheet capacity. Is that the plan or really maybe even thinking about operating at these lower levels?Alan S. ArmstrongYes. I would just say, I think we really enjoy the flexibility that we have right now, and we've been pretty clear about capital allocation. It's nice to have such a large pool of ability to invest in our rate base at some pretty decent returns. And I think probably even some higher returns once we get through the next rate case, given the inflation and the cost of debt that's gone up that will drive us to be able to earn even a higher return in our rate base. So that's really nice to have that pool of capital to be able to invest in and that really kind of sits at the bottom of our stack of capital allocation, but team is doing a great job of deploying that. As I mentioned, we completed our Station 180, which is a very large investor station and the team brought that in a little bit ahead of schedule. And Mike and I actually got to go up there a few weeks ago and see that great effort by the team of modernizing our facilities there. And so anyway, I would just say, to answer your question more directly, we have places to place capital for a nice return like that, and I think we'll continue to do that. But we certainly enjoy the flexibility that we have at this level to be able to place capital towards those kinds of opportunities.OperatorWe'll go next now to Jeremy Tonet at JPMorgan.Jeremy Bryan TonetJust want to start off with Appalachia, if I could. Northeast G&amp;P, quite a good quarter there. Recognize there's a little bit of timing with the revenue catch up there, but just wondering if you could talk a bit more about what a normalized EBITDA level in the Northeast GMP right now? And are you seeing kind of a shift in production wet versus dry. And is that impacting margins? Just trying to get a bit of color for what the trajectory is here.Alan S. ArmstrongYes, I definitely think we saw producers focusing where they have it available, we saw producers focusing on wet where there are producers that have that ability to shift. But while at the same time, I think keeping themselves poised for markets to open up. And so I would say that's kind of what we've seen. In terms of normalized EBITDA, I think the first 2 quarters are pretty good sign of that. I think any time you average that out over a couple of quarters. I think that's a pretty good sign of a normalized number. But I do think as markets open up through both MountainWest and Regional Energy Access and continued industrial and power generation demand in the local markets. I think we're going to see that. PJM certainly found itself very short power last year and during the winter time as well. And I think we're going to continue to see people build out power generation to take advantage of that. So I'm pretty encouraged, frankly, about in terms of the market outlook over the next couple of years for the Northeast. I do think that we'll see the Northeast have an opportunity to take back some of the market share across the U.S. as a result of some of these markets opening up.Jeremy Bryan TonetThat's very helpful. And just to clarify, when you say new markets opening up, is this regional energy that kind of prime in the pump for MVP or others?Alan S. ArmstrongWell, it's really -- there's really 3 distinct issues there. Mountain Valley Pipeline certainly, and it will be competing. There's been some confusion out there, I think, in the market. We have plenty of capacity to pull all that MountainWest can deliver. It's just a question of how it's going to compete with Haynesville gas coming in at Station 85 on the system. And so -- but there's -- it's just going to be a question of producers competing for those markets. But I will say that market and particularly in south of Station 165 as was demonstrated by a recent open season is going to continue to grow pretty rapidly. And last winter got caught in a very short situation on natural gas. And so we're going to continue to see the markets in the Carolinas, there and Virginia and the Southeast continue to expand. Mountain Valley Pipeline is going to be that connection. In addition to that, regional energy access is also going to provide new market and that will take some time. It's not going to be a snap of fingers and we'll see that kind of growth pulled out of that area, but it will open up new markets and new demand. And then finally, as I mentioned, regional loads in the area as well and people taking advantage of low-priced natural gas. And in fact, the shell, big cracker there is just 1 good example of the industry growth, but as well, we're seeing power generation load to continue to build there as well in the PJM area. So I think really pretty clear examples of market growth for the Northeast.Jeremy Bryan TonetGot it. Very helpful. And just one more on gas, if I could. I think in our stakeholder conversations across various states, we're starting to see gas peakers come back into integrated resource planning that we had not seen in recent years or maybe had fallen out in recent years. I'm just wondering if you're seeing this trend as well particularly as it relates to Transco and its unique positioning? And could this lead to incremental opportunities beyond kind of what's in the slides today?Alan S. ArmstrongYes. I think as we mentioned, the open season that we had for capacity south of 165 really kind of caught our attention, frankly, and far exceeded our expectations. And so when we say that it exceeded what we had to offer, it was a very large multiple versus what we had to offer there. So yes, we definitely are seeing the signs of people taking advantage of low-priced natural gas. And importantly, I think this is something that gets missed too often, Jeremy. I know you follow this, but I think sometimes the broader investor base misses this. That what we have to sell is capacity. It doesn't mean that that's going to be an annual average increase in volume as much as it does mean that people are absolutely going to have to buy capacity for those peakers and for baseload. And we actually -- I think we're going to see quite a bit of baseload pickup as well because the amount of data centers, the amount of electrification load that's going on is well in excess of what our increasing wind and solar generation can keep up with. And so we're not only going to see peaking. We're going to see baseload increase as well. But again, all of that boils down, whether it's peaking or it's baseload, people still have to buy the full amount of capacity on our pipeline, and that's certainly coming through in these open seasons that we've been having in that area.Jeremy Bryan TonetGot it. Right. Makes sense. Coal to gas baseload conversion clearly there, but the peaking needs, I think seems a bit underappreciated. So very helpful color.OperatorWe'll go next now to Jean Ann Salisbury at Bernstein.Jean Ann SalisburyI just wanted to follow up on the comment that was just made, Alan, about there being plenty of capacity on Transco and it kind of being a competition between the Haynesville producers and the Appalachian producers. I think that for the open season for the 800,000, that time line is kind of set for 2027. So is it accurate to say that, that capacity is there, but sort of needs to be unlocked to be usable over the next few years?Alan S. ArmstrongWell, also, Jean Ann, you have to realize, I think we have 6 projects along that corridor or 5 along that corridor, excluding regional energy access that are also expansions in that same area that were not dependent on Mountain Valley Pipeline supplies coming into that area. And so there's a number of projects that -- and we've got them listed there in our materials. So that is -- obviously, those come on before this latest open season would. But those are increments to serve increasing demand for power generation in the Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia areas.Jean Ann SalisburyOkay. But they're kind of -- I guess, maybe my broader question is like if there need to be projects that Williams does that are kind of negotiated rate incremental?Alan S. ArmstrongWell, the point I think that's misunderstood, Jean Ann, is that we have the physical capacity to move that gas from Station 165 period in the Senate, not very complicated. We have plenty of capacity to move from that point. The piece, I think, that got missed by some of the market consultants was the fact that how much would actually move from that point, because people are already buying supplies from Station 85 and moving it north. But those same shippers have the ability to pick their gas up at 165 if they choose to. So it's just going to be a matter of where they decide to pick their gas at. But we have plenty of capacity to move gas out of station, the 2 Bcf a day out of 165. So the physical capacity exists. The shippers actually are the ones to decide how we operate the system and where we move the gas from. And if they decide they want to buy it at 165, 85 will get backed off and 165 will get picked up for supplies.Jean Ann SalisburyGot it. That makes sense. And then as a follow-up, there was a big tick up in NGL and crude volumes that you classify as Overland Pass and Rocky Mountain Midstream this quarter. What was driving that?Micheal G. DunnJean Ann, this is Micheal. Some of that was Bakken volumes coming in on the OPPL line from a third party as well as some ethane volumes that picked up in the quarter.OperatorWe go next now to Brian Reynolds at UBS. .Brian Patrick ReynoldsMaybe to start off on the 23 outlook. John, you talked in the prepared remarks about year-to-date outperformance, which supports at least the midpoint -- but just kind of curious if you can give some commentary around uncertainty around these hurricanes and nat gas pricing? Is that baked into your confidence over the midpoint? And thus, just assuming constructive or normalized second half fundamentals, just kind of curious if you could sensitize the upper end of the range as well?John D. PorterYes. I think we want to have a lot of confidence in hitting our midpoint. So we do account for things that could happen around the hurricane season and perhaps additional weakness that could come, as I mentioned, from a further decline in natural gas prices. So we've built in some ability to handle those kinds of downside relative to making sure that we can hit our midpoint. So I think conversely, the things that would move us higher in the range it would just be better than forecasted performance in the underlying gathering and processing systems in the base business, which is always possible. And it is also possible that we could have a stronger marketing result in the fourth quarter. Sometimes we have fairly strong for example, Novembers and Decembers, but that is unpredictable. Most of that performance comes in the first quarter. So we don't like to overly depend on any kind of a marketing result that -- to make the numbers. And so we've got a lot of confidence just from the base business around hitting the midpoint of our guidance and certainly think we could exceed it as well, but it's still fairly early in the year and just weren't comfortable yet in raising the guidance.Alan S. ArmstrongYes, I would just add to that on the natural gas -- I'm sorry, on our marketing business that I think it's really important to recognize that really what drove the negative in there was primarily just the markdown on NGL inventory. So that's just -- that's not really cash moving through the books. It's just a change in price on the inventory that we hold. And so unless you -- if we were to mark that book right now, obviously, you'd see a pretty big step-up in that, just because ethane prices have come up so much. But I think that's really important for the Street to understand relative to the balance of the year.Brian Patrick ReynoldsAppreciate that. That makes a lot of sense. As my follow-up, great to see the environmental assessment for the Texas to Louisiana Energy Pathway project to bring nat gas from Texas into Louisiana border. LNG demand continues to be a theme, particularly on gas E&amp;P calls this quarter. So just kind of curious if you could discuss perhaps further greenfield opportunities beyond [TLAP] that Williams could pursue to bring even more natural gas from Texas across to LNG to support that future demand? .Alan S. ArmstrongYes. Thanks, Brian. Well, I would tell you, we are engaged in a number of projects there, and we're not in a position to be able to disclose those at this point, But we are involved in pretty large-scale projects that we're excited about, we think will add a lot of value to our shareholders as well as the industry in general and much needed. So we're pretty excited about that, but we're not in a position yet to disclose exactly what's going on there.OperatorWe go next now to Praneeth Satish at Wells Fargo.Praneeth SatishI guess on Southeast supply enhancement, first, do you think that the project could be upsized given that you noted a very strong open season? And then I guess I'm still confused maybe a little bit on the lead time. The lead time for the project seems pretty long. It has in-service date of Q4 '27. Is there anything in particular causing the time line to be that long? Or is there maybe a contingency in there for permitting?Micheal G. DunnPraneeth, this is Micheal. Yes, the open season results were a pleasant surprise, and we're currently working through the scenarios with various customers that requested capacity there. It definitely can be upsized from the 800,000 we published in the open season notice and we're just working through that today. So hopefully, we'll have some more information on that in the very near future in regard to the outcome of those negotiations. But it's really just a combination of looping and compression additions alongside our brownfield Transco pipeline order work and it's just getting the hydraulic modeling done and developing the proper scenarios and then ultimately giving the rates to the customers that would be identified by the looping compression on those scenarios. So it's a little bit of an iterative process, which we're going through right now, but it can definitely be upside from the 800,000 a day. I'd say the schedule -- right now, a lot of that is driven by the customer's desire to service dates and so a lot of this capacity is for new gas-fired power generation and anticipating when those new power plants come online is the expectation that the customer is laying out there for us. I do think there may be an opportunity to accelerate the project at some point. But obviously, we have to have customer agreements in place before we can start designing the desired schedule for the customers as well as our capital cash flow. So that's really what we're looking at right now. I think 2027 is probably the outside date that we'd be looking at, and we'll try to pull that in where we can.Praneeth SatishOkay. That makes sense. And then I guess just looking at the futures curve for natural gas, it's in [Contango], pretty wide winter-summer spread right now. Just wondering if you could kind of talk through your ability to capture that at Sequent. I guess, how much storage capacity does it have right now? And how much of that is open and able to take advantage of these wider spreads?John D. PorterYes, absolutely. The Sequent has a very large storage portfolio. I don't know that we've actually disclosed the aggregate size of it is, but it is a very large storage portfolio, and we would expect them to be able to lock in the intrinsic value of that storage, And they also have a lot of deliverability -- capabilities out of that storage and can optimize around that storage position as well. I don't think we've given a lot of the specifics about the aggregate size of that storage position, but it is a strong storage position that we would expect them to be able to lock in a lot of value around.Alan S. ArmstrongYes. I would just add to that, the way we would book those earnings, we actually would not book those earnings until we deliver. And so that's really why our fourth -- sorry, our first quarter is usually pretty sizable for us is that's when you see the pricing and the most value for that storage is usually offered in that period. And so that's a great example of why our first quarter tends to be so large. Some of that like we said, may come into fourth quarter depending on what pricing looks like and if we can cycle that storage twice. But we do have to cycle it to be able to take the earnings on that.OperatorWe'll go next now to Colton Bean at TPH &amp; Company.Colton Westbrooke BeanJust following up on the question on the Northeast saw a pretty significant sequential increase in G&amp;P revenue. I know you mentioned the $14 million benefit from a catch-up payment there. But even after adjusting for that, it seems like the year-on-year increase is still well above what we would have expected from inflation escalators alone. So -- are there any other contractual provisions that are pushing unit rates higher across the basin there?Alan S. ArmstrongNo. I think really, as was asked earlier, the question of rich versus lean, obviously, when there's more rich gas drilling, there's a lot more services that we offer around that. And so that does -- that shift to richer gas does tend to drive our margin -- our unit margin up across the basin.Colton Westbrooke BeanOkay. And that's primarily showing up in gathering. I think on a processing basis, volumes looked pretty consistent.Alan S. ArmstrongYes. right.Colton Westbrooke BeanGot it And then 2 related questions on cost control. I think when you look at the transmission segment, it looks like OpEx is roughly flat to your pre-acquisition levels after adjusting for the transaction expenses there. So are you seeing MountainWest synergies materialize earlier than expected? Or should we expect some degree of cost increase moving forward? .And then just more broadly, it looks like pretty impressive cost control across all segments, expenses flat to down on a year-over-year basis. So if you could just comment more broadly on your cost control initiatives and expectations through the balance of the year?Micheal G. DunnYes, Colton, thanks for that recognition. The team is doing a great job controlling our cost even in this inflationary environment, we have found some ways to actually continue to take cost out of the business and as you've indicated, the MountainWest acquisition is really the cost increase that we're seeing there on the e-com side of the business. And so I think going through the balance of the year, we would have an expectation that we can continue that cost control. Now there's always a lot of variability throughout the second and third quarters with our maintenance activities and our overhauls that are occurring, and that would be the only variance that we would see there, typically coming up between the second and third quarter. But other than that, I think doing a great job controlling costs this year.OperatorWe'll go next now to Neel Mitra of Bank of America.Indraneel MitraI wanted to clarify on Jean Ann's question, the available capacity on Transco. So if I understood it right, are you saying that there's available capacity on Transco from MVP if you were to back off volumes from Zone 4, so it essentially would be shifting volumes from one area to another to accommodate the existing utility demand? And then I guess the follow-on to that would be to accommodate new growth and new demand from utilities, there would need to be Transco expansions. Am I thinking about that the right way?Alan S. ArmstrongYes. Neel, let me try to explain it one more time. The way most of the system rates work on there, the shippers have pay the same price. They pay us no matter where the gas is moving from generally, those utilities in that corridor have the ability to pick up gas and they have volume available that they can pull from at various receipt points. And so they basically are out trying to buy the lowest-priced gas on the system that they can have delivered into their meters every day. And when we talk about system capacities, we're actually talking about kind of the delivery capacity to those locations, and it's a particular path that somebody buys capacity from -- on the system. But the big long-haul system in the original base system, the shippers have the ability to choose where they want to pull their supply in from. And so even if the -- we have a number of expansions going on, but even if you just looked at it in a static environment, if somebody today was buying gas Station 85. That gas is likely coming in from either system gas on -- in the offshore or Haynesville or gas that's made its way in from the Permian. But Station 85 or 65 would be a place that customers would be nominating their supplies from and they'd be buying gas from maybe a Haynesville producer at Station 85. If they -- if somebody from the Marcellus decides they want to sell their gas cheaper at 165, then that customer is going to be able to say, well, I'm going to nominate from station at the 165 location instead of 85. Same amount of gas eventually flows to their delivery point. But it's just a matter of where they source their supply from. So it's just going to be a question of where producers decide to sell their gas at and who wants to compete the most for those supplies. As we build out the system and the demand then matches back up to that supply, then the system would be back in balance. And -- but that's the way it always works. There's always periods where supply builds up, because you have more supply locations, then you have delivery and then eventually, you build out the delivery market like we're doing in all these projects. and then more supply is needed, which is kind of the situation at station -- sorry, at Zone 5 right now, people got caught short there in the winter, because there was not enough supply coming in there. So MVP will provide that needed supply that was missing this last winter.Indraneel MitraYes. I think maybe the confusion is whether if all things are static and you didn't back anything off of Zone 4. How much could you move south on Transco down from Zone 165 with the MVP volumes that are coming in?Alan S. ArmstrongWell, it doesn't have to just move south. It can move north and south. So I think that's maybe the missing concept there is, the gas will move wherever the market is, but we certainly have more demand on the system in both directions from 165 to 2 Bcf a day.OperatorWe will go next now to Tristan Richardson of Scotiabank.Tristan James RichardsonJust curious your views on the transmission M&amp;A landscape. I mean it seems like the funnel of assets in the market is really only growing. And clearly, we've seen a lot of transactions clear the past 12 months, even if they're passive stakes. Have you seen more opportunities that would potentially be a strategic fit? And then where do you see these multiples as attractive and transmission with some of the transactions we've seen clear?Alan S. ArmstrongYes. Good question, Tristan. I would just say we were really pleased with the multiple we were able to pick up the MountainWest assets, pretty seldom that you get assets that are that well contracted that have that much growth around them, which frankly has been more than we even expected, pretty rare to see that kind of multiple. I think the issue there that kind of dampened the market was the concerns over Hart-Scott-Rodino that had been raised earlier in the Berkshire Hathaway and Dominion transaction that involve those assets. And I think that had the market a little bit spooked on that. So maybe that's why we were able to bridge over that in that case. But yes, so I would say we're going to keep looking for those anomalies like that and where we have confidence in our ability to add value to assets. But I think it's going to be rare circumstances that we see those kind of multiples. There's usually a reason. In this case, I think a lot of the issue was the risk around Hart-Scott-Rodino that it already surfaced itself on those assets earlier.Tristan James RichardsonThat's helpful, Alan. And then maybe just a question on MountainWest, I mean with the overthrust expansion. It sounded like that was maybe incremental to your expectations or at least what you saw as the opportunity set for the acquisition at the time of close. Maybe curious kind of is this one of potentially other expansions that could occur? And then maybe if there's anything on the scale and timing of that project that you didn't already mention?Alan S. ArmstrongMike, do you want?Micheal G. DunnYes. Tristan, that was not in our pro forma economics for the acquisition. So it certainly was an upside there with the MountainWest acquisition. This is about an 11% increase in the Overthrust capacity with a 325,000 dekatherms a day expansion. And it's a pretty simple expansion. It's 2 compressors that we're adding at existing compression facilities on that system. But there's definitely more upside opportunity there. There seems to be a desire to get more gas west bound for the Opal pricing going. That's been a pretty solid pricing point for a number of years now. And even this summer, we've seen gas trading at $4 there at the Opal hub even higher than that. Just driven by California economics with the [E that hit] California this summer gas right generation that's picking up there. So I would expect to see a lot of desire for customers to get to that Opal pricing pooling, and that certainly bodes well for Overthrust that's a direct connection into that hub. And as far as the rest of the MountainWest system, we see a lot of opportunity there for coal to gas switching, there's a number of very large coal-fired power plants in Wyoming and Utah that do have opportunities for conversion to natural gas and some of those we've already acquired, and we're actually building expansions for Overthrust system today, Jim Bridger Units 1 and 2 in Wyoming on the Pacific or system or converting to gas and we are building a pipeline over to that facility this year. So we're continuing to see opportunities like that on the MountainWest system, and those are certainly upside opportunities, not only for us, but gas that we source out of the Wamsutter field with our upstream production, and we're driving that gas to those markets as well as the secret platform.OperatorWe go next now to Gabriel Moreen at Mizuho.Gabriel Philip MoreenIt looks like you had a lot of E&amp;P hedges since your last update in 1Q. I was just wondering if you can -- not to beat a dead horse on '23 guidance, which I know I'm doing, but just what the exposure is at this point on the E&amp;P side? And then also as you think about hedging '24 for -- on the E&amp;P side, what you're thinking and maybe in light of also potentially doing some transactions around E&amp;P with the gas curve having creeped up a little bit here?Alan S. ArmstrongYes. John, you want to take the first part of that, and I'll take the last.John D. PorterYes, absolutely. We have continued to add hedges on the expected upstream JV production. We generally don't go too far in hedging. We like to have a comfortable spread between what's hedged and what's not hedged just to account for the potential for any kind of production upsets. So there is a fairly significant portion that remains unhedged. We do provide in our materials, all of the current hedges that we have outstanding against the upstream business, and that's in the appendix.Alan S. ArmstrongYes. And Gabe, I would just add to that. I think in terms of our approach to hedging on the E&amp;P side, we have been putting on some April through October hedges for gas in '24. And as John said, large -- so part of that is driven by the fact that we don't really want to get caught short in an up market. I think everybody experienced that a couple of years ago. And so we tend to not get ourselves in a position where we could get caught short on production, particularly since we don't operate that production. So that's -- that's how we think about hedging on the E&amp;P side there. So -- but in terms of in the broader scheme of things in terms of transactions around E&amp;P, I would just say we continue to entertain a lot of interest in that. And I would just say, as we look at the landscape and the demand that's building for not -- everybody is very focused on LNG, and we think, obviously, that's going to continue to be a big driver for demand. But the macro picture we're seeing around electrification, and the amount of power demand increase that continues to build in this country is pretty impressive. And we're also seeing a lot of industrial demand pick up in and around our assets as well and things that were previously powered by either fuel oil or coal or onshoring ammonia production here in the U.S. There's just a lot of demand building and we have a pretty good insight to that. So it's kind of seems shortsighted to get in a hurry to sell out particularly like the Haynesville, where the theme, the GeoSouthern team has done a great job there, and they continue to find ways to lower cost and increase production there. So we think both from their operational capabilities, which we're enjoying and the macro fundamentals around gas is just not really a compelling reason to liquidate in this environment.Gabriel Philip MoreenAnd then maybe if I can just have a follow-up on the ERP spend at Transco, and I recognize it's Transco got an awfully big rate base to it, but as you think about having to file the rate case at Transco, and it's upcoming. How do you think about ERP spend within that context? Does it matter at all with the rate case coming up as far as accelerating it or refraining from doing that?Micheal G. DunnGabe, it's Micheal. Yes, we just put in service that Station 180 replacement. We replaced 14 units there with new state-of-the-art turbines. And we've got 3 more stations that will be very similar fashion coming on before the test period closes on the rate case. And so that's the anticipated pin curve there, similar to what we did on 180. And it's really highly dependent after that on the rate case outcome and whether we get an emissions tracker, which we would certainly hope to achieve on the Transco rate case similar to what we were able to do on Northwest Pipeline.And that would really drive our decision-making in the near term on spending beyond the 2024, 2025 time frame. And we layer that into what our next rate case tranche looks like on the Transco system and really try to balance that spending curve with what we think those cases are going to line out there in the future. But obviously hoping to go into this one with an emissions tracker, modernization-type tracker coming out of the negotiated settlement that we hope to achieve with the Transco customers, and we'll see how that turns out.OperatorWe'll go next now to Neal Dingmann at Truist.Jacob Samuel NivaschThis is Jake Nivasch on for Neal. Just a quick one on cap allocation. I think you guys might have covered it, but I just want to make sure that I heard it correctly. Just in regards to distribution growth, I mean, you guys are pretty well covered even after that 5% boost this year. Are you looking -- I know you might have covered this already, but are you looking to accelerate that at some point in the near term? I'm just curious how you guys are thinking about that?Alan S. ArmstrongYes. Really good question. I would say that we've said all along that we expect this business to generate in the 5% to 7% growth on EBITDA and that we would expect that to keep our dividend somewhat in line with that. And so I think as we think about it looking forward, AFFO per share really is the number, I think, to keep your eye on that will drive our decisions on dividend looking forward. And so I think that's a really good number for you to focus on. But yes, we certainly have plenty of room, plenty of capacity, and in terms of that dividend increase, and it's just going to be driven by what we're seeing as kind of long-term sustainable AFFO per share is really what's going to drive our dividend decisions.OperatorAnd we go next now to Robert Catellier at CIBC Capital Markets.Robert CatellierRobert Catellier here. I just wanted to follow up on capital allocation this time on M&amp;A. So understanding that you've been quite active in the last 18 months or so. Can you comment on the company's appetite for additional acquisitions and maybe on the state of the M&amp;A market, understanding that maybe MountainWest was a little unique. So just how the low commodity prices and higher interest rates are impacting bid-ask spreads?Alan S. ArmstrongYes. I would say that's not completely clear to us yet. It's a good question. And you would think it would ultimately have some impact, particularly people that are exposed to floating rates. That certainly would drive some transactions, but I would say we haven't seen great evidence of that occurring just yet. I would just say we're going to be like we have been hanging around the hoop, looking for things where we have a unique competitive advantage that drives really strong accretion and value to our shareholders. And so far, that patience has paid off really well for us. And I don't see any reason we would change that patience to keep kind of looking for those things that are very unique and that we have a unique competitive advantage on. And so that's what I would tell you to expect more of. But I'm not sure that I yet see the market being flooded or depressed with assets yet from people that might be sitting on floating rate capitalization. So we're very fortunate where we stand from both the debt capacity and an interest rate standpoint without floating rate exposure. So we're really excited about where we stand. But there may be some businesses and assets that get a little bit damaged and have to look for transactions to solve the problems, but that's not evident to us just yet.OperatorAnd we do have no further questions this morning. Mr. Armstrong, I'd like to turn things back to you for closing comments.Alan S. ArmstrongOkay. Well, thank you all for the great questions this morning. Thank you for your continued interest in the company, and we just want to reiterate how excited we are about our continued growth on top of growth here in the business and our ability to demonstrate our resilience this quarter, and we appreciate your confidence in our company. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Again, ladies and gentlemen, I will conclude the Williams Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. We thank you all so much for joining us and wish you all a great day. Goodbye.]"

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Quanta Services (NYSE:PWR). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. View our latest analysis for Quanta Services How Quickly Is Quanta Services Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Over the last three years, Quanta Services has grown EPS by 16% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. While we note Quanta Services achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 19% to US$18b. That's a real positive.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Duke Austin, Quanta's President and CEO. Duke?Story continuesEarl C. AustinThanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary, and we'll then turn it over to Jayshree Desai, Quanta's CFO, to provide a review of our second quarter results and full year 2023 financial expectations. Following Jayshree's comments, we welcome your questions.Our second quarter results continue our solid start to the year with strong double-digit revenue growth that resulted in record quarterly revenues exceeding $5 billion for the first time in our history as well as a record total backlog of $27.2 billion. We added approximately 3,000 employees during the second quarter due to the building momentum and increasing demand for our Infrastructure Solutions.We are investing in safety and training programs for our employees expanding various service lines and advancing our supply chain and other solutions. We are positioning Quanta for decades of necessary infrastructure investment and continue to believe our operational portfolio is a strategic advantage that provides us the ability to manage risk and shift resources across service lines and geographies, which we believe will become increasingly important as the energy transition accelerates.We believe our portfolio approach positions us well to allocate resources to the opportunities we find the most economically attractive and to achieve operating efficiencies and consistent financial results.Our Electric Power Operations are performing well overall, though segment margin experienced some pressure from lower utilizations in Canada. Demand for our Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions is strong, driven by broad-based business activity from utility grid modernization, grid security and system hardening initiatives as well as our reputation for consistent and safe execution.Accordingly, we are investing in resources ahead of the anticipated start-up of multiple multiyear utility programs and projects. Additionally, our Communications operations continue to execute well from both a revenue and margin's perspective.Going forward, our utility customers' multiyear CapEx plans remain strong and we are having discussions with a number of them about capital plans and programs looking out in years. North America's power grid continues to be challenged by a number of demands, including the need to increase the pace of modernization and increase the grid's resiliency and reliability through system hardening, enabling new technologies, facilitating higher levels of electric vehicle penetration, meeting growing power load demand and capitalizing on favorable federal and state policies designed to accelerate the energy transition.We believe Quanta Solutions' offering and ability to safely consistently execute is industry-leading. We are uniquely positioned to collaborate with our clients on their multiyear grid operations. Renewable Infrastructure Solutions segment revenues increased significantly in the quarter as construction of renewable generation projects within the multiyear programs ramped up and high-voltage electric transmission and substation work remained active.Segment total backlog reached a record $7 billion at quarter end, driven by the addition of SunZia transmission and HVDC converter station contracts in various renewable generation, transmission and substation projects. We believe the momentum in this segment will continue, and we are making the necessary investments to scale our resources and capacity to handle multiyear renewable programs that we expect will yield record levels of new renewable generation over the coming decade, driven by the [IRA] and acceleration of North America's energy transition.Additionally, we are pursuing billions of dollars of high-voltage transmission projects that are designed to support current and future renewable generation capacity growth and overall system reliability. As we have discussed on prior earnings calls and reported more recently in the media, federal and state policies, designed to accelerate the energy transition and the electrification of everything, are expected to significantly increase load demand and are already pressuring the power grid. At the same time, there are significant challenges to getting regional transmission infrastructure built in a timely manner, primarily due to obtaining necessary environmental permits and regulatory approvals. The need for collaboration at all levels to ensure grid reliability while minimizing cost impacts to the ratepayer remains the industry's greatest challenge. We remain pleased with the performance of our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, which delivered double-digit revenue growth and record second quarter profitability, demonstrating solid execution across our operations in this segment. Our Industrial Services Operations executed well, and we had strong demand for our gas utility and pipeline integrity operations, driven by regulated spend to modernize systems, reduce methane emissions, ensure environmental compliance and improve safety and reliability. We believe we are in the early stages of capitalizing on significant opportunities across our service lines and geographies, which are driven by our collaborative solution-based approach that is designed to ultimately benefit consumers. Additionally, the growth of programmatic spending, with existing and new customers, increased renewable generation activity and favorable megatrends provide greater visibility into our near- and long-term growth outlook.As a result of these dynamics and our solid year-to-date financial performance, we have increased our full year 2023 financial expectations for revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The energy transition towards a reduced carbon economy continues to progress, and we believe is gaining pace. Quanta is successfully executing on our strategic initiatives to drive sustainable and resilient operational excellence, total cost solutions for our clients and consistent profitable growth.We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers.We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for our stakeholders.I will now turn the call over to Jayshree Desai, our CFO, for her review of the second quarter results and 2023 expectations. Jayshree?Jayshree S. DesaiThanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced record second quarter revenues of $5 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $166 million or $1.12 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.65.Our second quarter Electric Power revenues were $2.4 billion and operating income margins were 10.1% consistent with our expectations for sequential revenue growth and margin expansion against our first quarter results.Our base business activities continue to lead the way for the segment of utility investments in hardening and modernization initiatives create growing demand for our comprehensive solutions. While the segment executed at a double-digit margin profile, it was negatively impacted by a lower-than-expected utilization of electric resources in Canada.Renewable Energy Infrastructure segment revenues for second quarter '23 were $1.4 billion, with operating income margins of 8%. The revenue strength in the quarter reflects the growing momentum behind Renewable Energy Infrastructure and our customers' ability to move forward with construction activities in this favorable regulatory environment. Margins improved sequentially as increased revenues contributed to better cost absorption and as we successfully executed through risks on ongoing projects. Underground Utility and Infrastructure segment revenues were $1.2 billion for the quarter, and operating income margins were 8.6%, a noteworthy second quarter performance. Both large projects and base business operations contributed to the elevated revenues with margins benefiting from improved fixed cost absorption.For additional commentary comparing 2Q '23 to 2Q '22, please refer to the slides accompanying this call. Regarding backlog, with the inclusion of 2 of the 3 contracts with the previously announced SunZia Award and continued robust activity in our Renewable segment, we achieved another record level at quarter end.At June 30, 2023, backlog was $27.2 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion compared to March 31. Our 12-month backlog is also at a record level of $15.6 billion, approximately $1 billion higher than March 31. For the second quarter of 2023, we had free cash flow of $46 million. DSO measured 78 days for the second quarter, lower than our historical average and aided by favorable billing arrangements associated with certain awards during the quarter. Regarding the Canadian Renewable Transmission Project, we've discussed in prior quarters, based on operating conditions and our ability to achieve stakeholder targets while overcoming the COVID-19-related challenges encountered throughout the course of the project, we decided to accelerate the construction schedule into the spring and early summer.As a result, the contract asset balance grew during the quarter and continues to pressure DSO, and will do so until we finish the project. Given our successful execution in the field and the ongoing discussions with the customer regarding significant portions of the balance representing approximately 6 to 7 days of DSO as of June 30, we remain confident in our position.As of June 30, 2023, we had total liquidity of approximately $1.8 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5x as calculated under our credit agreement. We expect second half earnings growth and cash generation to support our ability to delever over the coming quarters while continuing to create stockholder value through opportunistic capital deployment.Turning to our guidance. We are pleased with our performance through the first half of the year and see significant strength in the back half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter. From a segment perspective, we continue to expect Electric Segment revenues between $10 billion and $10.1 billion for the year. However, we expect full year margins will be impacted by the costs incurred this year in preparation for the anticipated growth in multiyear utility programs. That, along with pressure from our Canadian operations, is leading us to lower our full year margin expectations for the segment to range between 10.5% and 11%. Regarding our Renewables segment, given the performance of the second quarter and increased visibility into project activity, we are raising our full year revenue expectations for the segment by $700 million, now ranging between $5.2 billion and $5.4 billion. We continue to expect margins around 8.5% for the year as much of the work is just getting started, and we will need to execute through project risks before margins have the opportunity to improve.After a good second quarter, we now expect revenues from our Underground segment to range between $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion, a $250 million increase at the midpoint and we continue to expect full year margins for the segment to range between 7% and 7.5%. As Duke said, given our performance to date and improved visibility, we are raising our full year revenue expectations, which we now expect to range between $19.6 billion and $20 billion, a $950 million increase at the midpoint of our range.We've increased our expectation for full year adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to now range between $6.90 and $7.30 and increased our expectation for full year adjusted EBITDA to range between $1.88 billion and $1.97 billion for the year. With regard to free cash flow, we are modestly raising our full year expectations, primarily due to the expected increase in renewable revenues, which typically have a favorable working capital profile compared to our other segments. Therefore, we now expect free cash flow for the year to range between $800 million and $1 billion, with the highest levels in the fourth quarter as is typically the case.We slightly modified other aspects of our guidance, the details of which are included in our outlook summary, which can be found in the Financial Information Section of our IR website at quantaservices.com. Looking ahead, we are excited by the momentum and highly visible and growing multiyear outlook behind our Electric and Renewable segments. Additionally, we are encouraged by the strength of our underground utility and infrastructure segment, which continues to grow and execute at a high level. With this core operating portfolio, we are confident in our ability to deliver comprehensive solutions to support the energy transition and to create significant shareholder value through organic growth and strategic capital investment.I'll now turn it back to the operator for Q&amp;A. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.Brent Edward ThielmanA nice rebound in Renewable margin this quarter. I was wondering if you could just provide an update on solar supply chain pressures previously seen, maybe how that may or may not still be impacting the renewables business? And should that sort of be a factor here still for you for the rest of the year?Earl C. AustinWe're seeing what we thought would happen with the solar supply chain slashing in general, I think we are operating through those issues, and we had 6 months really where the industry stopped. And as we move forward, we thought there would be cadence to the segment to solar in general. That cadence is playing out like we thought. We're certainly increasing guidance due to some of that. And I think as you go through '23 and you operate through '24, you'll get a more balanced quarter-over-quarter type margin profile, but the margin pickups and the opportunities that we see on the other side of the year -- second half of the year into '24, '25 and beyond, are certainly what we thought or greater.Brent Edward ThielmanGot it. And then just my follow-up. Can you talk about what from SunZia is reflected in bookings this quarter? Is there still more to come as you're likely still in negotiations? Is it all represented here in the financials?Earl C. AustinNo. We're still negotiating a third contract there on the wind side of the business. So that will be -- we believe we'll have that finished up here in the second half of the year, third quarter, fourth quarter, somewhere in there.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners.Michael Stephan DudasDuke, I want to follow up on your prepared remarks, you talked about the challenges that the customers, utilities and regulators are facing. Have -- I assume to date, they've been overcome? Are there -- do you anticipate or given your discussions with your utility clients that there's going to be much more coming ahead like in the next 12 to 18 months? Or is it sooner? And is that impacting any of the mix of what type of either wind or solar development or what -- from regulators and customer base are looking at as you pace out your backlog opportunities?Earl C. AustinYes, Mike, good question. When we look at regulation and you look at the -- what's going on at the consumer level, when you rebate EVs, the way we're rebating and then the grid itself at the distribution level certainly needs a rebuild, a significant modernization. So that needs to get started now, not when the consumer is getting his car and bringing it to the home, and they have no way to power their vehicle or it's intermittent power.So I think as an industry, we've always been in front of what we anticipate. In those levels, we have to get in front of that. So at a federal level and state level, the collaboration with -- along with utility customer is necessary and where you have states that are worried on the bill and the capital at the consumer level, which we are as well, and you have federal pushing in the other direction. We've just got to get a better mechanism to make sure that we can service what's coming at us.I think when you listen to the car manufacturers, when you listen to anything that we've been talking about, we thought that generation would double, we're here in triple now. There's no question, it's moving forward. If it's double, if it's triple and you're also decreasing the decarbonization of coal and gas with renewables, the impacts for interconnections for transmission, the rebuilds that are necessary are monumental and the necessary capital to go into the grid, although when you look -- when you go forward and you try to net present value, total cost of energy, I think it's the right answer. It's just we have to get started with the capital plans and they're greater than you may anticipate or anyone may anticipate as you move forward. So it's just trying to put people in front of that and make sure the industry is collaborating. When we look at our clients even with inflation, even with everything that's going on, the capital is moving up. It's just the pace of where we need to be 5 years from now. It's not a matter of tomorrow. It's a matter of 3 years from now, 5 years from now and the industry itself is certainly I'm talking about the need for transmission and also the modernization of distribution systems.Michael Stephan DudasSo I guess from a -- the industry has been growing (inaudible) at very slow rates. And are your customers seeing that going to be accelerating in the next 5 years? And again, are the plans there to -- that you have the ability to capacity given your 3- to 5-year outlook to execute on that?Earl C. AustinI think when you look at transmission, certainly, it's necessary if you're fuel switching and then where the load is going from data centers, AI to just about everything, you're seeing load growth now in the industry across the board, you've got 110-degree heat. You had a [load], what I would consider a mild winter, first quarter was pretty mild for the industry. But July into August, you're 100 plus in many areas. It just -- those impacts to the way capital is spent and where it's necessary to spend. You start moving up deviations of temperatures on this grid from a planning standpoint, it's exponential of load.OperatorOur next questions comes form the line of Steven Fisher with UBS.Steven FisherObviously, the -- some of the investments you're making for growth are weighing a little bit on the electric margins for now, but it's not really a new concept you've long talked about how you need to make investments to prudently support the growth. So can you maybe just talk a little bit about some of those investments that you've made this year already to support the growth, if you can kind of quantify year-over-year what that impact is? And how should we think about the investments for the second half versus the first half kind of where you're making these investments and out of frame what that might look like in '24 relative to the investments in '23?Earl C. AustinYes, Steve, I think when you look at the quarter, we added from around 3,000 employees. We normally add about a 1,000. So when you start thinking through that, it does pressure where the company is capable of training, doing all the things that we need to do, the investments are already made. It's just pressure, there's 4 or 5 things that we could call out that's pressuring inflation, and you can call out whether we can make all kinds of excuses about it. Really, we can operate much better in Canada than we have been operating. The transition is a little bit behind in Canada, where we can operate Canada at normalized margins. We've been through the pandemic there. We've made different levels of, I would say, balance from [G&amp;A] to training, to [interacts] and all those kind of things in Canada. As we move out of '23 into '24, you'll get into more normalized Canadian execution, and I think you'll see much better results that we can absorb just about anything. The portfolio that we put together in the segments, which should allow us to train, to put people in place for the foreseeable future. And still even in outward growth years, produce the type of margins that we produced in the past. I see no reason why we cannot. And I do believe we can operate the renewable segment in double digits. I'll stand by it.Steven FisherOkay. And maybe just to follow up there. Jayshree mentioned that the Renewables margins are staying in this range until you can get comfortable with, I guess, execution and some of the other risk factors. So how should we think about the timing for allowing some of that upside to be realized in the margins and when could we see that better margin come through Renewables?Earl C. AustinYes, Steve. We're starting quite a few large transmission projects in the segment. We're also starting thousands of renewable-type utility-scale solar win. So when we look at that and where we're at, the cadence itself, we thought it would be back end loaded, so the start to the jobs, as we operate through those contingencies, I think you'll see a more normalized margin profile into '24. We have to operate in double digits in the second half or you won't get to the numbers that you -- what you see. I do think there's opportunities all the way through for us, we took a prudent approach to it. We tried to hit it down the middle. That's what we've done here. And I do think there's opportunities into '24 to get on a more normalized cadence.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.Andrew Alec KaplowitzBacklog does continue to rise in your Underground Utility business and revenue has actually continued to pick up. I know last quarter, you were modestly concerned. You did raise the forecast there for the year -- for this year. So what are you seeing on the ground there? And how are you thinking about the business moving forward? Could it end up being more resilient even into '24 than you expected?Earl C. AustinWhen we look at the UUI segment, we've said that we thought we could get scale through some regional offices through the portfolio. I think you're starting to see that show up in the segment. We did -- we've operated great. We've had good industrial performance in the first half of the year. When you get into the back half, we do see some -- we have some pipe awards that we were awarded. We have some good things going on. We don't need those things to make the numbers. So we do see opportunity but you also have the weather impacts.We're doing more electrical underground. And so that will shift some of our UUI segment over in the Electric segment. Just the way the segment reporting works, but as far as the crews and what we're doing from the scalability, it should rise our returns on the company. It will rise returns on the company overall. And the segment is also doing nicely in our service lines.Andrew Alec KaplowitzDuke, maybe if I could follow up on that. You did 8.6% in that UUI segment, which is basically as high as we've seen Quanta deliver but it's maybe the consistency over the last few quarters that's been interesting in that segment. So based on your comments, scale, balancing of the businesses there, could you continue to see more consistent and higher margin in that segment moving forward?Earl C. AustinAlways, we would operate in upper single digits, and I see expectation. We are prudent about how we got in the second half due to the weather in northern climbs and things of that nature. But I do think that overall segment can operate in that upper single-digit range. We are pushing -- you are getting absorptions throughout due to the fact that you're doing electric and gas and telecom and renewables out of the same offices, you're going to see some scale out of that. And those margins are going to rise a bit, and that's what you're seeing show up.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Justin Hauke with Baird.Justin P. HaukeI guess I wanted to ask a little bit in the Electric segment, the equity income contribution, which I know is multiple things, but it's mostly LUMA, at $9.4 million this quarter, it's -- it was kind of light last quarter as well. It looks like you took your guidance down a little bit for the contribution from there. Given that last year, it was kind of running almost at double these levels, is there anything that's kind of changed in that business that maybe we should think about that this is kind of the more appropriate run rate with the contribution from that?Earl C. AustinLUMA is performing as expected. There are some investments that we have in other businesses there that are off on the first half. We expect those to pick up in the '23 and into '24. But Jayshree, you can comment.Jayshree S. DesaiYes, Justin, we had a couple of outsized events from last year. We had a storm that helped our -- some of those entities in that part of the segment. And we also had some catch-up in LUMA, that's what you were seeing last year. This year, in general, the -- that part of the segment is performing very well. We continue to see the operations going as we would expect, a little bit of pullback, but nothing systemic, and we believe we can operate through a lot of that and continue to perform at these levels.Justin P. HaukeOkay. And then maybe following up on Andy's question on just the margins in Underground. Obviously, they were quite strong. Usually, you would have more margin in the second half than you do in 2Q, but your guidance would imply a little bit softer than it was in 2Q. But is there anything unusual like project closeout or something like that, anything quantifiable that was in the quarter that made those margins unexpectedly high?Jayshree S. DesaiNo.Earl C. AustinNo. I mean we said our Industrial business performed really well in the quarter as well. So that certainly was strength in the quarter. And I do think when you start to look out, you do not have great visibility in the fourth quarter in the Industrial business. So that said, the prudent guidance would be to pull it down a bit in the fourth quarter. And that's kind of what you're seeing show up.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.Neil Singhvi MehtaA couple of big picture questions. Duke, maybe your perspective on the M&amp;A markets here. It has clearly been a core competency for you guys, particularly as we saw with Blattner, what do you think the market looks like for M&amp;A? And are you thinking to the extent it is opening up smaller bolt-ons versus larger strategic?Earl C. AustinYes. M&amp;A, we have a strategy. We have a 5-year strategy to provide solutions to our customers. We see opportunities across the board related to add-on, bolt-on, provide solutions, do some things that we talked about our front-end services. There's no shortage of opportunities out there. We're picky about how we go about it, and we'll follow the strategy. We're watching our cash generation. We're making sure we can absorb what we have, and we'll be prudent about how we go forward. And anything that we're doing is following the 5-year plan, the strategy we laid out to our investors and we're ahead of those plans significantly.And I feel like the company is in a great position to provide those solutions that are necessary to keep the company moving forward at the pace that we've seen in the past. And we have good visibility into the next decade. And we're known for execution. We have to keep executing in the field, while looking at the strategy to add on and deploy capital in the proper manner for our stakeholders.Neil Singhvi MehtaThat was the follow-up. If I go back to last April, you talked about the glide path of $6 to $6.50, I believe it was to $8 to $8.50. So like a 7% to 10% EPS CAGR. But then you talked about upside scenarios where you could get as high as $11 or $12. Just could you just give us a status update on how you think you're tracking relative to that plan? And remind us again, what are the levers that would get you beyond the base case of that $8 to $9.50 to some of those upside scenarios?Earl C. AustinI think when you look at our guidance at the EPS level, which is what we're measured upon, we're ahead of the 10% guide now on a growth basis this year, relatively 13% or better. So when I think about it, we're already doing that as we sit here today. And I do think we set all levers of the balance sheet, the opportunities that we see going forward. We'll continue to (inaudible) big numbers and those kind of things. We're executing at the local level. We're executing across the strategy and doing the things we need to do to drive EPS. And it's not just the top line, it's the quality of earnings. We're constantly talking about quality of earnings. If you look at our returns -- return on invested capital and all of our returns, they are moving in the right direction as we go forward.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Martin Malloy with Johnson Rice.Martin Whittier MalloyCongratulations on the quarter. My 0first question, I wanted to ask about the outlook for CO2 pipelines related to the carbon capture and sequestration. And just following on Exxon's acquisition of Denbury in part related to Exxon wanting to get larger in terms of the CO2 pipeline infrastructure. And just kind of curious what you're seeing out there in terms of outlook for potential building on those kind of pipelines.Earl C. AustinYes. We see opportunities there across the board on hydrogen and also carbon sequestration. We do see that market as being a nice market. The blinds are usually smaller that they run longer, but they're smaller on that type of builds. But we're in constant discussions with the operators as well as the end users of hydrogen and also carbon the way we're looking at it. So I do think you'll see some of those lines move forward in '24, be some opportunities for us. The bill, the RA certainly provides economic benefit on both sides of that. And I do think that will help the market as well. So we are seeing opportunities in that area and staying in front of it. We've had some nice pipe awards. So we're happy with the business. We certainly said we would be able to handle those type of things and we can, and we are. So I think it's opportunities for us. It's not the mainstay of the business, but we certainly like it.Martin Whittier MalloyOkay. And then for my follow-up question, I wanted to ask about undergrounding of transmission distribution lines. And it seems like it's appearing more in the press and utility company commentary about these multiyear programs to underground electric lines. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what you think out there from a customer's perspective, is that -- is it investment in those type of programs? Is it picking up meaningfully?Earl C. AustinI mean you see it in the West, the fire hardening that's going on and the fires outwest from an insurability and what the punitive nature of a fire is to utility at this point, you have no choice but to start undergrounding. And I think you've seen that in the West. We're in early stages of that. It will continue on. It's decades of type reconstruction, but many of the lines that are out there in fire-prone areas will go underground. They're not -- the insurance rates, things of that nature make it economical to underground, which you would have never said that a decade ago. And today, it's the only way.So I do believe you'll see the prevalent underground transmission in the corridors that we are. You have large wire constraints when you start looking at the larger transmission, the wire in Europe and things of that nature, that supply chain is tight, I do believe when you move forward some of those bigger projects that are undergrounding transmission will come about. We're certainly around the edges on those.But I mean, the mainstay work is overhead, long haul will still be in the air. Where in the fire-prone areas, you'll see some undergrounding.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein.Chad DillardSo my question is about the large versus small project mix, particularly for Electric Power and Renewables. Can you talk about what that mix is in the first half? What do it look like in the second half? And what did that second half exit rate mean for '24 and ultimately margins?Earl C. AustinYes. I don't look at it. We don't look at it like that from our standpoint. It's really utilizations. The utilizations are great on all segments. You'll see bigger work. If you want to talk about a project, it will be more in your Renewables at this point. Your bigger programs, your multiyear programs will be more in Electric. It's just the deployment of capital, same crews, same people, cross and segments. So we're cognizant of that. The utilizations on both sides will be at high levels. What I will say is the company itself, no matter what segment you're in, the project starts are significant, and the cadence will start to stack versus just being a starting -- on the starting line. And right now, we're kind of in the early stages of a lot of large projects and programs. So those early stages will as you move in out of '23 into '24, into '25, you'll start to stack on top of that, and you'll get a normalized cadence where you'll see it as we operate through them contingencies move out, things of that nature as long as we execute like we have the last 25 years, we'll be in good shape, and we'll see those contingencies flow into future earnings.Chad DillardThat's helpful. And then my next question is on the Northwest Lineman College. Just trying to understand your ability to scale that just to meet the demand in labor if we're looking over the next 3 to 5 years? Maybe you can talk about like what the capacity is today and where it can go over that time period? And then also the 3,000 people that you brought on what was -- how much came from Northwest versus other channels?Earl C. AustinWe recruit just internally across the board, Northwest certainly is some -- there's a lot of curriculum work, a lot of work that's necessary to be able to scale. It's one thing to -- it's another thing to add 3,000 every quarter or 1,000 every quarter. And also while we're not totally pleased with the Electric margins, it's down 25 basis points or whatever it is on the guide. There's opportunities to operate at the same level we thought. That said, it's not as easy as we make it sound. They are certainly contributing to our ability to put the people in the field and execute very quickly and as we get absorption and things of that nature, that's only -- will only scale. And I do think we've invested in those colleges. We've invested in those curriculums and we're not having issues with cross-skilled labor or front-end engineering. Could we use more? Yes. But we're able to meet the demands and the foreseeable demands on any type of curve we're looking at. We hope that supply chain catches up with us.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.Jamie Lyn Cook(technical difficulty).OperatorJamie, you're breaking up. Jamie, you're breaking up. I can't hear you. You got to do it again.Jamie Lyn CookCan you hear me now?OperatorThat is it.Jamie Lyn CookSo my first question, if I think about your guide for 2023 and the back half earnings trajectory, it's $2.10 a quarter or so, which implies if we just annualize that earnings of, let's say, a base of $8.40 and that's without SunZia, so I'm just trying to think about the back half of earnings in the setup and what that implies for 2024 is like can we think of an $8 base for 2024 without SunZia and that would imply upside to that? And then my second question Duke is more to you, strategically. I understand you're fairly comfortable with your ability to ramp labor in this environment and capitalize on the growth opportunities. But to what degree do you get concerned just with projects like the size of SunZia that you want to limit the number of big projects you want to take on just in terms of more from a risk management perspective.Earl C. AustinThanks, Jamie. I figured I'd get '24 guidance. So I think when we look at it. '24, you have some seasonality in the numbers and the run rate. I do think we talked about double-digit type growth at the EPS line. I don't see no reason why we won't continue those kind of numbers. Can it get outward, yes. We're not ready to guide to that. We see a great market. We're starting on great markets. I agree with you. We're stacking and it certainly bodes well for us going into next year. When we look at the projects, the larger projects have been through that before with CREZ and other things in the company, we're highly focused on the customer and the customer level, the baseload work, we're still at a baseload work of 80-plus percent. That hasn't changed. I don't think it will. We will get large projects as we move forward. We are in negotiations constantly around programs and projects, you have to think about some of them being multiyear, 5 years in nature. Some of them are short nature. So it's just different type of projects. The company itself is focused on execution on those projects.I see both sides of it, I think we're seeing more material content within our EPC business. So just different things that the company is capitalizing on. So when you look at a return basis, our returns go better if we're able to sort of the material content as well. So lots of things going our way on that. And I think it's a competitive advantage for us moving forward as we start to be a large purchaser of material. So I like it. I like what we're doing. I think it will only enhance -- the larger projects will only enhance the business and the base business as well as how we provide that solution to the client.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis &amp; Company.Adam Robert ThalhimerNice quarter. What's the outlook for large T&amp;D projects in Canada? And if it's not good, can you shift some of those resources back to the U.S.Earl C. AustinGood question. We see a good market in Canada. We have some awards already that we anticipate starting on by the end of the year. We have some great clients partnering in Puerto Rico. So -- and a lot of customers in Canada. We are able to move resources, engineering capacity, some of the things that we do in Canada over in the Lower 48. I wish it was easier. I wish the [border] was easier. It would certainly help us from a skill set standpoint. But that said, the company has done a nice job moving resources and doing some things in Canada. In general, when I look and step back at it, COVID played a big impact much more than we had here in the Lower 48, and we forget about it a lot. And we think, oh, well, it was nothing. It was significant. And we were in camps, we were doing some things there that were different. If we don't see the market will downsize the market, but we do see that -- what we see right now is the transition happening there as well. We're seeing more -- we're seeing wind, solar, some hydro different things in Canada to decarbonize as well. We're right in the middle of those things. It's just a little bit behind the Lower 48. And as we catch up, I think you'll see more normalized margins in Canada and a great market.Adam Robert ThalhimerOkay. And then in the Renewable segment, I hate to ask about '24. But Jamie started it. You guys kind of blew me away top line for Renewables for 2023. And I'm just curious if you can -- or how you think you might build on that next year.Earl C. AustinI think we can continue to grow the business in the Renewable segment. We said it when we purchased Blattner kind of the cadence of that, and you're coming off of a year where the outward -- what I think pullback was primarily due to the solar panel discussions. And when that cleaned up, there was pent-up demand, but I also see a great future in a future market. You're going to see quite a bit of wind repowering coming up as well as wind projects. And I don't even think you're seeing that yet. And when you start to see the programmatic [spends] of the wind repower on that as well, the company is positioned nicely for those things, and we'll take advantage of that. That was what led us to the Blattner acquisition, and I think that strategy is playing out. And we see decades of renewable switching, you have load growth as well that will go towards a renewable state. So as you see load growth double and you start to say, okay, well, how much the carbon are we going to take out of the system while you're getting the load growth, it's significant. EV penetration, all those things are starting to hit the electrification of everything and then you have the security issue of North America where you're onshoring. All these things are happening at once, and I see really, really good markets for a long time. Can you have some blips in the radar, of course, but on a CAGR basis over time, we like what we see, and we'll continue to execute in the field, which is our main concern, is to make sure that we execute, build projects on time, on budget that are at cost that's what we feel economic to the consumerOperator(Operator Instructions) our next question comes from the line of Gus Richard with Northland.Auguste Philip RichardIn terms of energy storage. Are you starting to see an increase in demand for that in the Renewables segment. If so, what regions and as storage is incentivized at residential, does that have any impact on transmission and distribution.Earl C. AustinI think energy storage can certainly benefit and we're seeing quite a bit, I would say, it probably doubled in size, take it plus or minus 10, but we're seeing quite a bit of storage projects. We'll continue to see that to the West. And we see it all over, honestly. It's something from a utility skill standpoint that's necessary with the markets there. We're participating in it, albeit we -- it was a low piece of the business. So don't take that the wrong way. It definitely is growing. We were in front of it. We're doing nicely in the storage business. I do think it can help. It can help alleviate some transmission. But it's not -- batteries will continue to get better as you move forward. The storage capacity will get better. We're not there yet. It will be a small piece of the business for a foreseeable future -- but growing. So like the business, like it, it fits nicely with our solar win. We're looking for ways to even get more efficient in batteries. So as we see that, the transmission as well, it can alleviate a bit, not to the point where you would see any kind of downturn in transmission at this point.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.Sean D. EastmanI wanted to come back to the comment about adding basically 3x the normal run rate of people in the quarter? I mean, obviously, that's pretty notable. I mean other than the obvious signal that -- that's positive for underlying demand trends. What else we should take away from that? Is this showing an ability for the training infrastructure to flex up? Maybe we've hit a new kind of throughput level there? Any additional thoughts on this addition to the human capital story this quarter?Earl C. AustinI think, Sean, it's just a great example of what we've tried to say for a long period of time that we're able to scale the business. And a lot of people can talk about it and a lot of people can talk about scaling it. I want to see somebody add 3,000 and put the projects in there and execute at the levels we're executing. So I think we put the infrastructure in place to be able to do this, not 1 quarter but over time, and it surprised me a bit from a seasonality standpoint, we added quite a bit in Renewable segment. And their ability to scale their business to these utility scale projects is many reasons why we acquired Blattner and we have the resources that we have internally. I just can't say enough about what we do from an execution level in the field every day to put the numbers up we put up. And they're just doing a really, really nice job. And we have great curriculum, great people. We'll continue to build upon what we have. It's exponential the way I see it in the curriculum and the things that we're doing from technology and training and things of that nature. We're certainly in the forefront. I look forward to us continuing down the path that we're on.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen.Marc Gregory BianchiI wanted to ask about the renewable power growth and kind of as it relates to the CAGR that you outlined at the Analyst Day last year of 10% to 12%. It would seem like you're well above that rate here, exceptional year in '23. But how should we be thinking about that 10% to 12% now? Is there upside to that? And how much of a bottleneck is interconnection?Earl C. AustinI think when you look at it, we talked about kind of a 10% derisk at the bottom on a CAGR basis and then all levers of the balance sheet, the megatrends that we see, you'll have some 15% outer years as you make acquisitions as you do other things or use your balance sheet with free cash. So those things are there when you look outward, if you take those things into account, if we invest the same way we've invested our capital in the past, I like our chance is on the upper end on the [outward looks]. But when you look at just organically, the business the way it sits in the queues and things of that nature, yes, there's tightening of your queues. Your transformers are 24, 36 months out on your HVDc. So if you have a project today and you're talking about it and you haven't ordered your transformers to have a spot, you're 24, 36 months out. I don't think it affects our clients, the clients that we work for. Your bigger clients already have transformers or have slots. So there's no real issue for them. But others that are looking for projects, it's not just, hey, I need in the queue -- Hey, I need in the queue, but I have my transformer capacity. I have my lines, I have the things that are necessary there. So that planning and things of that nature is a piece of it. I do think you're getting some clarity of regulation. I think the federal government, FERC and the states and the utility business, everyone is trying to collaborate here, more so than I've seen in my career. But I'll say this, it's necessary for us to do this as a group. And we need to collaborate as a group here for the next decade and beyond.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Alex Rygiel with B. Riley Securities.Alexander John RygielA very nice quarter. DSOs have improved into the 70s from past historical ranges of the high 70s to 90s. Can you talk about the catalyst to this and whether or not mix or contract terms have been a factor? And maybe expand a little bit more on contract terms today versus a handful of years ago and if they've become a little bit more favorable to the contractor?Earl C. AustinYes. I'll say a little bit. We're acquiring more materials and things of that nature, Alex, so it's helping us a bit on some of those projects from a DSO standpoint, but I think that's the bigger piece of what you see from a term standpoint. We need to be able to order outward and you've seen some inventories. Our inventories move up a little bit here or there on some of those things. But that said, I think that's the better terms. Jayshree, you can comment on the DSOs.Jayshree S. DesaiYes. I think we've talked in the past about our expectations will improve on our DSOs and our working capital, and we're starting to see that. In terms of contract terms, certain parts of our renewable projects definitely allow us to -- because the materials or the way the work is performed, allow us to run in a positive working capital and you're seeing some of that benefit coming in now. But in general, we're feeling good about where our DSOs are headed as well as our cash flow projections. And you see that's why we modestly increased our cash flow for the year. It's moving in what we expected and we -- we'll continue to see that improvement as our business grows in the Renewable segment.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.Earl C. AustinThank you. We want to thank the 52,000-plus employees of Quanta for their commitment to safe execution. It does not go un-noticed that you're working in a 100-plus degree heat every day. Thank you. And I want to thank all the participating people in our conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you. This concludes our call.OperatorThis concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

PWR reported mixed results for second-quarter 2023, wherein adjusted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues surpassed the same. Both metrics were up on a year-over-year basis.The company continues to experience high demand for its infrastructure solutions that support energy transition initiatives and increase reliability, safety and efficiency. Project activity associated with renewable generation has been going strong and is expected to continue throughout the year.Backed by solid first-half performance and a strengthening outlook, particularly for the Renewable Infrastructure Solutions segment, the company raised its full-year guidance for major metrics.However, shares of this leading national provider of specialty contracting services dipped 1.1% in the pre-market trading session on Aug 3.Detailed DiscussionQuanta’s adjusted earnings of $1.65 per share lagged the consensus estimate of $1.67 by 1.2% but increased 6.5% from the year-ago quarter’s $1.55. The upside was backed by strong demand for its services driven by the customers’ multi-year programs designed to modernize and harden utility infrastructure, increase renewable generation and transmission infrastructure and move toward a reduced-carbon economy.Quanta Services, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Quanta Services, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseQuanta Services, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Quanta Services, Inc. Quote Total revenues of $5.05 billion surpassed the consensus mark of $4.7 billion by 7.5% and increased 19.3% year over year.The operating margin for the quarter expanded 60 basis points (bps) to 5.5% from a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA of $472.1 million improved 11.8% from $422.1 million in the year-ago quarter. We projected operating margins to be 6.6% and adjusted EBITDA to be up 12.5%.The company reported a 12-month backlog of $15.64 billion and a total backlog of $27.2 billion at June 2023-end. This compares favorably with the December 2022-end’s 12-month backlog of $13.79 billion and the total backlog of $24.09 billion. The reported metrics were also up from the year-ago respective figures of $11.58 billion and $19.85 billion. Our model suggested a total backlog of $24.01 billion.Story continuesSegment DetailsIt reports results under three segments: Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions, Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions and Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions.Revenues from Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions totaled $2.42 billion, increasing 10% year over year. The upside was primarily backed by growth in spending by the utility customers on grid modernization and hardening as well as revenue growth from acquired businesses.The operating margin, however, contracted 50 bps to 10.1%. Lower equity in earnings from its integral unconsolidated affiliates and lower utilization of Canadian resources offset the improved margin growth associated with communications projects.Nonetheless, the segment’s 12-month backlog was $7.53 billion, up from $6.38 billion a year ago. The total backlog of $13.58 billion grew from $11.72 billion reported in the prior-year quarter.Revenues from Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions totaled $1.39 million, up 50% year over year. This was driven by increased renewable infrastructure project activity and its customers' ability to move forward with construction activities in the current favorable regulatory environment and through acquisitions.Operating margins contracted 85 bps to 8% from a year ago due to increased costs related to higher levels of resources required to support the expected increase in project activity in the second half of 2023 and into 2024.The segment’s 12-month backlog was $5.17 billion, up from $2.35 billion a year ago. The total backlog of $7.01 billion increased from $3 billion reported in the year-ago period.Within the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, revenues rose 12% from the prior-year quarter’s levels to $1.24 billion, backed by higher demand from gas utility and industrial customers as well as large pipeline projects in Canada.The operating margin of 8.6% was up 50 bps from 8.1% reported in the prior-year quarter. Segment’s 12-month backlog totaled $2.94 billion, up from $2.84 billion a year ago. The total backlog increased to $6.6 billion from $5.12 billion in the prior-year quarter.LiquidityAs of Jun 30, 2023, Quanta had cash and cash equivalents of $362 million, down from $428.5 million at 2022-end. The company’s long-term debt (net of current maturities) amounted to $4.22 billion, up from $3.69 billion as of Dec 31, 2022.Net cash provided by operating activities was $127.4 million in the second quarter, up from $118.7 million a year ago. The free cash flow for the quarter was $46.3 million versus $13.5 million reported in the year-ago period.2023 Guidance LiftedQuanta now expects revenues between $19.6 billion and $20.0 billion versus prior expectations of $18.6 billion and $19.1 billion.The company now expects adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings within $6.90-$7.30, up from the previous projection of $6.75-$7.25. Adjusted EBITDA is now projected within $1.88-$1.97 billion compared with $1.84-$1.95 billion expected earlier.Quanta’s non-GAAP free cash flow projection is now expected to be $800-$1.00 billion compared with $750-$1 billion expected previously.

Earnings and net sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined year over year.That said, LP's strategy positions it well for long-term growth as the housing outlook continues to improve.Weyerhaeuser Company WY reported mixed second-quarter 2023 results, wherein its earnings handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but net sales missed the same marginally. On a year-over-year basis, the top and bottom lines declined.Meanwhile, in July, Weyerhaeuser made a significant acquisition, purchasing 22,000 acres of timberlands in Mississippi for around $60 million. These timberlands are known for their high productivity and have been strategically chosen due to their proximity to Weyerhaeuser's current operations. The acquisition is expected to bring about immediate synergies and create additional opportunities for real estate and natural climate solutions.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Please go ahead, sir.Scott GammillThank you, Tommy. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer.Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information.

WomackThank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for what is such a pivotal and exciting time for our company. As many of you know, on Monday, we announced that Plant Vogtle Unit 3 successfully achieved commercial operation. While work remains to bring Unit 4 online, this incredible milestone is something to be celebrated. This decade-plus journey, which involved development in global supply chain, managing through a global pandemic, tens of thousands of American craft workers and engineers and millions of labor hours, combined with a group of committed co-owners and regulators that had the courage to support new nuclear power as an option when others didn't, proves that we can accomplish monumental things when we share a common vision. Vogtle Unit 3 is now serving Georgia customers with over 1,100 megawatts of 24-hour, 7-day a week carbon-free electricity.Turning now to Unit 4. Since our last call, the project team continues to make substantial progress as highlighted by completion of hot functional testing, receipt of all 157 fuel assemblies, submittal of all ITAACs and most recently, receipt of the 103(g) finding from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission signifying that license acceptance criteria for Unit 4 have been met. The project team's current focus is on working through final testing and system turnover to operations that when complete, will allow fuel load for Unit 4. Recall, as we contemplated in the VCM 17 order, Georgia Power can file its prudence request with the Public Service Commission following fuel load on Unit 4.Following fuel load, the project team will conduct final preparations and testing of systems primarily associated with the electrical power production side of the plant. And achieving the pristine conditions in the nuclear island necessary for start-up activities and initial criticality. Importantly, the project capital cost forecast is unchanged since last quarter and we're continuing to project Unit 4 will be placed in service between late fourth quarter 2023 and end of the first quarter 2024. The successful completion of this important project is critical for Georgia's and our nation's energy future. We look forward to these units providing reliable, carbon-free energy to customers for decades to come.Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for a financial update.Daniel S. TuckerThanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter of 2023, our adjusted earnings were $0.79 per share, $0.04 higher than our estimate and $0.28 lower than last year. The primary drivers of our performance compared to last year were milder than normal weather conditions, higher depreciation and amortization and interest expense and changes in rates and pricing, somewhat offset by lower income taxes and O&amp;M expenses. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results as compared to 2022 is included in today's release and earnings package.Weather in our electric service territories during the first half of 2023 has been the mildest on record with the fewest aggregate degree days in the 129-year history of climate data reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, more commonly known as NOAA. The negative $0.16 per share EPS impact relative to our weather normal EPS guidance range is our largest ever negative weather-driven variance for the first 6 months of a year, which is a significant headwind for the full year.While 2022 was a year in which we were able to fix the roof while the sun is shining and position the company well, coming into 2023, we have been and will remain keenly focused on cost management, along with our constant focus on safety, reliability and customer satisfaction in the second half of this year.Our adjusted earnings estimate for the third quarter of 2023 is $1.30 per share.Turning now to retail sales in the economy. Year-to-date 2023, weather-normal retail sales were in line with sales levels for the first half of 2022. We've seen positive residential and commercial growth and strong commercial usage offset by lower industrial sales. Year-to-date, we've added nearly 24,000 electric customers and 13,000 natural gas customers, trends which continue to outpace pre-pandemic levels.Chris, I'll now turn the call back over to you.Christopher C. WomackThank you, Dan. In closing, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge that Southern Company was recently awarded the #9 overall spot on Forbes ranking of America's Best Employers for Women, the highest ranking within our industry. We are honored to be selected to this list once again. Workforce and leadership diversity is a tenant of ours and ensures we have the variety of experiences and perspectives to better serve our customers. We will continue to emphasize a culture where all employees feel valued, respected and able to accomplish their professional goals.Thank you for joining us this afternoon and for your interest in Southern Company. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.Question and Answer SessionOperatorI will proceed with our first question on the line is from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.Shahriar PourrezaChris, that was the world record for the fastest prepared remarks. So congrats there on that one.Christopher C. WomackThanks. Always appreciate your comments and your analysis, and your perspective.Shahriar PourrezaJust starting on Georgia's economic backdrop. And obviously, you guys have seen a step change in the pace that major industrial customers have been announcing new capacity needs. How many, I guess, new gigawatts are you seeing now in Georgia versus the prior update with the state? What is the prior IRP embed? How should we sort of think about any updates to capacity needs, including the viability of the remaining coal assets as you're thinking about this incremental demand? So could we see a drastically different IRP being filed?Christopher C. WomackAnd Shar, we're working through that analysis now. I think we have said to you before, and we've commented about all the wonderful economic development activity that we've seen across the state of Georgia over the past couple of years. Some 250-plus projects, some $20-plus billion of investment, some 60,000 jobs that I know the governor has reported.So I think we've talked about the impressive activity that we've seen. We've not turned that into the capacity needs at this time. That's some work that we're doing. And I'm sure forthcoming, we'll work with the commission on what all that means and then figure out what it means for us in terms of capacity needs going forward. But I think it's a little bit premature.Daniel S. TuckerJust order of magnitude. Shar, look, again, we're kind of going through the analysis, but it's fair to say what we've seen from an economic development announcement perspective in the past is hundreds of megawatts at a maximum in a given year. And now we're having instances where it's thousands potentially in terms of the announcements. And so just the pace has accelerated.And you mentioned industrial. There's certainly a lot of large industrials involved with that, particularly around the electric transportation sector. But it's also data centers. It's a story that's playing out in a lot of places. Just as an example for ours, I mean, as we sit here today, data centers are roughly 2.5% of our overall electric load Five years from now, that will be well into the double digits in terms of percentage of our load. That's the pace of growth we're seeing.Christopher C. WomackSo Shar, bottom line is, it's something we're very excited about. We're very excited about it. I think it's a real positive contribution, positive factor that we're excited about here in the state.Shahriar PourrezaDo you have a sense, Chris, on when you and Kim and Dan and the team could update us around that potential opportunity? I know it's really early in the process, but we're obviously seeing the amount of customers that are moving to Texas, and it's very material. So I mean, to Georgia, which is really material. So I'm just kind of curious on what the timing of that could be.Christopher C. WomackYes. Shar, I think it's a little bit premature. But as soon as we get to that point and we figure out and have a conversation with the commission, I'm sure we'll share that with you -- share that with the industry.Shahriar PourrezaOkay, perfect. And then lastly, Chris, we're obviously approaching the prudency case once we see Unit 4 fuel load. Anything you can provide and how we should be thinking about a potential settlement? Or should we be thinking about this as like a rate case? And whether the potential for like a special election could impact the process, if at all, especially if fuel load takes longer than planned?Christopher C. WomackYes. Shar, I think there are a couple of questions. You embedded there together. First, around prudence, we have to get the fuel load. Once we get the fuel load, we'll figure out what happens. Having transparency in the process is very important. But right now, once we get to fuel load, then we'll figure that out. We'll work with the commission and the staff on that process.I think the other -- you made reference to the makeup of the commission. I mean, I -- the sense is that we'll get through prudence with the current commission. We have no idea what will happen in the ROE's case. So we're still waiting for that order -- for that decision by the courts. But there's nothing more I can say about that decision at this point in time.OperatorAnd we'll get to our next question on the line. It is from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs.Carly S. DavenportMaybe just starting in terms of what we saw during the quarter for weather-normalized demand, a little bit weaker on the industrial side, but commercial still looks quite strong. Can you just talk about how things are evolving relative to your forecast and kind of how you could see that evolving as we continue to move through the year?Daniel S. TuckerYes, absolutely, Carly. And we saw this earlier this year as well. From an industrial perspective, we're seeing 2 different dynamics play out that are negatively impacting growth. And those -- one is the housing sector. So when it comes to things like lumber, stone, clay and glass, to a degree textiles, particularly where it involves carpet, just given the broader trends in the housing industry, we're seeing that impact some of our usage in the short term.And then the other thing is chemicals from an industrial perspective. So we've had one particular facility in Alabama that has slowed pretty significantly. Again, some of that was anticipated very early in the year, and so it's just playing out as we anticipated, just wasn't anticipated when we kind of put our forecast together right before the end of the year. What we're really encouraged by is what we're seeing on the commercial and residential side. I spoke to the customer growth that we're seeing from a residential perspective. Again, we've seen sustained levels well above what we were seeing pre-pandemic.And then from a commercial perspective, just a lot of different stories playing out in that regard. Some of it's economic development, some of it is data center dynamic that I mentioned. And certainly, a lot of it is just commercial naturally following the residential growth. As it pertains to how it's impacting our results, what's important to remember is kind of the revenue contribution of these 2 classes on a relative basis. A 1% change in industrial sales is only about $20 million of impact where as a 1% change in residential and commercial is more like $40 million to $50 million. So in terms of a net implication for us, we're getting the benefit of the residential and commercial more than offsetting what we're seeing on industrial.Carly S. DavenportGot it. That's super helpful. And then maybe just on the financing front in the context of the current rate environment, just you've got some financing kind of still outstanding for the rest of this year. Just how are you thinking about execution of the plan that you have as we move through '23?Daniel S. TuckerYes, Carly. Look, we're always going to kind of keep our options open, the flexibility. You've seen us do the convertible debt instrument early this year. We typically lean on an ongoing basis towards just senior unsecured stuff of the parent. Lot of different instruments we've used across the utility franchises. I wouldn't characterize anything in our plans as out of the ordinary. We're going to be monitoring the market and making sure we're being thoughtful about as we always are, maturities, about the mix between fixed and variable and like everyone is doing, monitoring the rates as actively as we can to make sure we're getting to the market when it makes sense.OperatorAnd we'll get to our next question on the line. It is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithJust coming back to the other subject here on procurement and renewables -- on the renewables front, I know we talked about this last quarter here. Curious to hear your latest thoughts, both on the utility side and ownership. Think that had always been kind of back half of this year. How is that looking on that front in Georgia? And then separately, I think, Dan, last time we connected here, you were talking about the Southern Power effort. Looking like it was a tad -- more competitive in this environment in terms of your ability to actually win and accrue projects from that side of the house. Do you want to talk about some of the progress and maybe the evolution just with the rate environment where it is?Christopher C. WomackYes, Julien, let me start with -- on the renewables front. As you know, in the '22 IRP, Georgia had another 2,100 megawatts of renewables approved doing that proceeding. The first IRP will begin later this year, targeting some 1,300 megawatts of renewable resources with operation dates between 26 and 27. I think you may have also seen Alabama Power got its renewable generation certification modified some 2,400 megawatts over a 6-year period. So I think that will also be later this year. So we're proceeding and we're looking forward to opportunities for us to own some renewables. Clearly, we'll take advantage of the normalization of tax treatment between PTCs and ITCs and pursuing it from a best cost perspective. And we think we've got support from our commissions to -- for us to own more renewables. So we're looking forward to those processes as they proceed later this year.I think your other question, Dan, you want to talk about pricing?Daniel S. TuckerWell, I think the other question was around Southern Power. And yes, Julien, the same continues to hold true. The radar screen of active, viable opportunities for Southern Power is as strong as it's ever been. And look, we fully expect to be able to continue to deploy capital in the right way there. We'll keep the same discipline we've always had in terms of the hurdles we look for, the risk profile, long-term contracts, creditworthy counterparty. But I think my short message there on Southern Power would just be stay tuned. There's good things happening.Christopher C. WomackSo bottom line, Julien, I think we're very optimistic on the regulated side of what the future holds for renewables. And we'll see how that plays out -- begin to play out later this year.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithGot it. Excellent. And then just as you think about the generation needs that the prior questioners have been really kind of poking at here, aligned with, as you alluded to a second ago, the added ability to own some of this renewable generation through utility tax credit optimization, if you will. Can you talk about that opportunity coming together and maybe specifically the time line that you could see that starting to play itself out? I know we just alluded to the prior IRP cycle, but getting the CapEx proposals, RFPs and ultimately just seeing that load forecast updated.Christopher C. WomackYes, Julien, once again, I think it's a little premature in that regard. Clearly, as I spoke to earlier, about the renewable process and the RFPs, we see that forthcoming later this year. Clearly, we've got some more work to do as we -- as we analyze the implications of the second high development activity and what is meaningful for loads. And so we simply right now need to let the RFP process play out over the next few months and next few years. But we'll keep you updated as we move through the process.Daniel S. TuckerYes. As we've said before, consistent with what Chris just said, this will come together from a plan and capital deployment perspective in the latter part of our forecast horizon. So it was not a '23 thing in terms of capital deployment, might but probably not a meaningful '24. But beyond that is where the real opportunity exists.And the other thing that's coming together to help drive this and I think you mentioned the economic development aspect, Julien, as all these customers are choosing to locate in our service territories, they are increasingly demanding to be served with renewable generation and that's just helping support everything we're trying to do.OperatorWe'll get to our next question on the line. It is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.Jeremy Bryan TonetJust want to see, I guess, with start-off Vogtle here, some of the issues at the finish line here, just wondering what learnings you take away from that? And do you see the same type of issues materializing for Unit 4 or there weren't here that can kind of head off any issues like that?Christopher C. WomackAnd Jeremy, one of the things we've commented for -- we set a product for a few years now that there would be lessons learned as we transfer over from Unit 3 to Unit 4. Let me just give you some examples of how that is playing out. On Unit 3, hot functional testing took 94 days. On Unit 4, it took 88 days. It moved forward from 94 to 42 days. Hot functional testing to complete to 103(g) was 371 days on Unit 3, 88 days on Unit 4. And from coal hydro to hot functional test start was 191 days on Unit 3 to 103 days on Unit 4. So I think you're seeing clear examples of how lessons are being learned from Unit 3 over Unit 4. And that work -- those lessons learned will continue, I think, to show itself as we move through Unit 4.Jeremy Bryan TonetGot it. That's helpful. And just kind of pivoting gear. I think you saw that the D.C. core overruled for its approval of the Southeast Energy exchange market. Just what do you make up this year? And what's the path forward?Christopher C. WomackYes. I mean, it remanded it back to FERC to clarify a couple of issues around the power pool, and there are some questions about who is -- who could participate in SEEM that it has to be interconnections. So I think they're simply remanded back for clarification of a couple of issues, but nothing big there. I mean SEEM continues to operate and performed very well. Everybody is very pleased with the results of SEEM. So it will be -- it's going to be remanded back to FERC, like I said, with just a couple of issues that they'll clarify for SEEM going forward.Jeremy Bryan TonetGot it. That's helpful. And just last one, if I could. What are you expecting on hydrogen reg from treasury? And what do you think Southern Power's potential to participate could be with Vogtle and the potential for green hydrogen here?Christopher C. WomackLet me say something quickly about hydrogen, and I'll let Dan to touch on any rules from treasury. We're participating in a number of processes DOE has with hydrogen hub. So we're excited about that. As you may recall, we did a 20% blend at our Plant McDonough Gas site. So we're excited about all the technology activity and the considerations that are going on around hydrogen. We look forward to seeing if we can develop this market and get the pricing right, get the transportation of the product right and then we can find off-takers. I mean so we're thrilled by the possibility and how Vogtle can continue to serve customers in Georgia. So there are a lot of aspects of hydrogen that we're really excited about. Clearly, there's a lot of work that's got to be -- that we've got to work through to get to that point to make it viably commercial -- commercially viable.Daniel S. TuckerYes. And Jeremy, in terms of the treasury rig, certainly, like most in the industry, I think for us, it makes sense that those are as broad as possible going in to help kind of drive the deployment of the technology. Otherwise, it just may be cost prohibitive for a lot of people to get it out there. And whether that's a permanent broadness or it's a temporary broadness that transitions to something more specific, I think that's going to be in the hands of the Treasury Group.In terms of Southern Power's opportunity to play there, certainly, Southern Power's wheel house is providing utility scale, renewable generation to counterparties. And to the extent that we find opportunities in this space to serve an electrolyzer or another entity with a long-term contract, and it's a creditworthy counterparty and it meets all of the same criteria, it certainly expands our universe of opportunities.OperatorAnd we'll get to our next question on the line. It is from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.David Keith ArcaroWondering if you might be able to touch a little bit on Form Energy. You had an agreement reached to Georgia Power this quarter. I was wondering how you're thinking long duration energy storage might play a role in your system over time?Christopher C. WomackOnce again, we're excited about the relationship that we've established with Form. We have utilized the kind of 4- to 6-hour batteries, but we think a 100-megawatt -- 100-hour long duration storage batteries on 15 megawatts has got to be a part of the mix and it's got to be a part of the system and the grid going forward. So we're excited about what Form is doing, and we were at their ground breaking ribbon cutting up in West Virginia a month or so ago. So we are excited about Form and looking forward to their development as we go forward. But we think this has got to be a part of their technology mix as we go forward, and we're hoping they're going to be successful.As you know, we pay a lot of attention to research and development. And we think as we look at a lot of solutions, whether it's submissions control or just making sure we maintain a reliable and resilient grid, we think technology advancement is very, very critical. And so we're excited about the work that Form is doing, and we're glad to partner with them.David Keith ArcaroGreat. That makes sense. And then secondly, obviously, a big weather headwind that you're working through. And could you touch on the cost control, just your confidence level in being able to manage and find flex in your O&amp;M budget for this year? And where are the key areas that you're looking at in terms of offsetting the headwind so far?Christopher C. WomackYes. I think -- and Dan said it in the conversation earlier that we'll remain keenly focused on cost management. And so we know the weather we've seen is unprecedented is the lowest -- the warmest we've seen in history. And so we've got to correspond with that with similar focus on cost management. And so there are a number of efforts going on across the company to make sure that we are executing around cost management controls. And right now, we feel good about kind of where we are, but we know we've got a lot more work to do as we go forward through the rest of the year.David Keith ArcaroCongratulations on Vogtle Unit 3. I appreciate it.Christopher C. WomackThank you very much.OperatorWe'll get our next question on the line. It is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.Durgesh Chopra7 minutes and 58 seconds of prepared remarks. I'll keep it real brief, hopefully. Just following up on David's question. So this quarter, we had $0.04 of unfavorable weather versus normal, but you actually delivered $0.04 higher than your estimates. Is that all just cost cuts? Or are there other things that we should think about onetime or there's been other things?Daniel S. TuckerYes. It's primarily cost reductions, Durgesh. I mean there's always some little puts and takes here and there that are a little different than our forecast. But overall, it's just the fruit of our labor. And kind of going back to Dave's original question in terms of where, frankly, it'd be doing a disservice to highlight any particular area of the business where we're doing that because we're doing it everywhere. This is a significant lift, and we're doing everything we need to do and pulling out all the stops to deliver.Durgesh ChopraOkay. solid. And then just maybe if you can -- otherwise, I'll just follow up with Scott. Just any sort of initial takes on July weather?Daniel S. TuckerIt hasn't looked like the first half.OperatorWe will get to our next question on the line. It Is from Nick Campanella from Barclays.Nicholas CampanellaCongrats on the Unit 3 news. So just looking forward to Unit 4 soon and then knowing that we're getting closer to that $700 million uplift that you detailed in slides here on the CFO. Dan, maybe you can just remind us your preferred use of those cash flows as you roll forward your plan in the fourth quarter. And I know we talked about improving balance sheet in the past, but I'm also cognizant you're talking up a lot of different CapEx opportunities in your region.Daniel S. TuckerYes. Nick, and thanks for that question. It really is kind of all of the above strategy, if you will, in terms of the opportunity to use this cash. And the 3 things that we're primarily focused on, you said one, which is to fund the capital plan, right? So we'll be positioned as we had been historically kind of pre-penalty ROEs and heavy construction on Vogtle 3 and 4, where our operating cash flow represents over 3x the size of our common dividend. And so that leaves an awful lot of cash flow to deploy against this capital plan that we expect to continue to grow. That's thing one. The #1 priority of the things we're focused on, you also mentioned this is credit quality. And what this does is provide an uplift to our credit metrics such that we're more in the 17 -- 17-plus range for FFO to debt. And the opportunity there is not to raise at these levels well above our thresholds and then use that as some sort of currency to do things, that's the opportunity to just once again get back to being a premium credit utility and maintaining that position for the foreseeable future. So that's thing two.And then the third thing that we've talked a lot about is the opportunity that we'll have as our payout ratio gets kind of sustainably at or maybe a little below 70%, so call that maybe 2024, but more likely 2025, an opportunity to go to our Board and for Chris and I to make a recommendation to increase the rate of the dividend growth to be more aligned with our earnings growth. So it's, again, all of the above, but really important things that this enables us to do.OperatorAnd we'll get to our next question on the line. It is from Angie Storozynski with Seaport.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiSo just -- you guys have been in this combat mode for the last -- well, for a decade it feels like. And I know that there's still the prudence review ahead of you. But I'm just trying to picture Southern back to basics mode. So I mean, what does it even look like? So that's one. And number two is, I mean, you clearly -- the stock has rerated somewhat. What is it that you think you can do, well, besides just putting Unit 4 online to further rerate the stock from here?Christopher C. WomackAnd Angie, let me start with the first part of your question in terms of being in combat mode. During this Vogtle period, I'd say we're going to stay in combat mode in terms of execution. Yes, hopefully, we're going to be a little boring. We think boring is beautiful. But we're going to be incredibly aggressively focused on customers being at the center of everything that we do, focused on the circle of life, making sure we're maintaining a constructive regulatory environment, providing world-class service and using your language of in combat mode, but doing that in a very aggressive way that make sure we're giving customers what they need from a reliability, but also a resilient perspective, but also making sure we're paying attention to issues around affordability.So we have a lot of work to do. And so we're going to be very singly focused on execution. And I think that's going to be very important as we also make the case that we deserve that premium valuation and returning back to the days of old Southern classic.Daniel S. TuckerIt is no mistake and no accident that the first page of our deck has a circle of life on.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiOkay. And then just maybe a smaller point, but you guys have, just like everybody else -- more violent and impact storms going through your service territory. Is there anything from one investment perspective to regulatory setup that could help you hardening the grid and also assure timely recovery of any costs associated with those with the climate change basically?Christopher C. WomackAnd I would say, I mean, if you look at our capital budget today and getting passed, there are no really large projects, but it's a lot of blocking and tackling with transmission, distribution, with grid improvement programs, with undergrounding, with changing out circuits and improving technology scale systems, so a lot of that work to enhance and improve reliability, but also improve resiliency so that storms are more different, paying attention to more extreme weather. So doing the basic work to prepare for these kind of conditions and help us to maintain our focus on reliability and the resiliency of our system.OperatorAnd that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?Christopher C. WomackOnce again, let me thank everybody for your call today. It's a wonderful time for Southern Company as we brought Unit 3 commercial and with the progress that we're making on Unit 4. And we'll continue to press ahead and move forward. But again, thank everybody for joining us today. Thank you very much. And everybody, be safe.OperatorThank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Southern Company Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect, and have a great rest of the day.]"

""Our Next Generation Natural Gas supply is certified to be produced with lower GHG emissions than traditional natural gas supply. Our customers can feel good knowing we have strong relationships with environmentally conscious suppliers focused on reducing methane emissions efficiently and effectively during the production cycle.""Story continuesThe procurement is also a result of the Tennessee Natural Gas Innovation Act, Senate Bill 1959, which was passed and signed into law in 2022. The state legislation enables natural gas utilities to build and procure innovative natural gas resources including, but not limited to, farm gas, biogas, renewable natural gas and renewable natural gas attributes, hydrogen, carbon capture, qualified offsets, Next Generation Natural Gas and energy efficiency resources.The legislation also allows the Tennessee Public Utility Commission the authority to authorize a mechanism to recover costs related to incremental innovative natural gas costs to procure resources from third parties, while the total incremental costs cannot exceed 3% total annual cost of gas.""As we look to a low-carbon energy future, Williams is committed to leading our industry with credible solutions to benefit our customers,"" said Chad Zamarin, executive vice president of Corporate Strategic Development for Williams. ""We are proud to work with Chattanooga Gas to provide clean energy solutions through our NextGen Gas program that proves the quality of low-carbon intensity natural gas. Through our industry-leading Sequent marketing platform and large-scale infrastructure network, we are committed to connecting the best U.S. production basins with credible low-carbon solutions that help our customers meet their sustainability goals.""Chattanooga Gas' milestone is one of several similar efforts underway at utilities across the country owned by Southern Company Gas. Southern Company Gas subsidiary and Chattanooga Gas sister company Virginia Natural Gas first procured Next Generation Natural Gas for its customers in 2019, and today up to one-half of its customers' energy demands are being supplied with this lower-emissions product. Southern Company Gas' Illinois-based utility, Nicor Gas, has also sourced fuel from environmentally conscious suppliers.This system-wide initiative at Southern Company Gas is complementary to the business's sustainability efforts, including its long-term effort to reach net zero GHG gas emissions from its operations by 2050. For more information on sustainability efforts at Southern Company Gas and its utilities in Tennessee, Georgia, Illinois and Virginia, visit www.southerncompanygas.com/resources.About Chattanooga GasChattanooga Gas is one of four natural gas distribution companies of Southern Company Gas, a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company (NYSE: SO).

(SO) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.79 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.74 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.07 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6.76%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this power company would post earnings of $0.71 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.79, delivering a surprise of 11.27%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Southern Co. , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $5.75 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.68%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $7.21 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Southern Co.

(Operator Instructions) We'll begin by turning the conference over to Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead.Ralph GiacobbeThank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, The Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Evanko, Chief Financial Officer; and Eric Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evernorth Health Services. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including our second quarter financial results and our updated financial outlook for 2023. Following their prepared remarks, David, Brian and Eric will be available for Q&amp;A. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of thecignagroup.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2023 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Regarding our results, in the second quarter, we recorded after-tax special item charges of $5 million or $0.01 per share for the integration and transaction-related cost. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2023 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2023 dividends. With that, I will turn the call over to David.Story continuesDavid Michael CordaniThanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. For the second quarter, again, we delivered a strong performance, fueled by continued growth across our diverse portfolio of businesses. Today, I'll review key strategic drivers contributing to our momentum and while we believe we're well positioned to sustain our growth as we continue to support the health and vitality of those we serve with our differentiated solutions and capabilities. Brian will cover additional details about our financial performance in the quarter and our 2023 outlook. As part of our ongoing effort for you to hear more from members of our leadership team, Eric Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evernorth Health Services, will be joining our call and is available to take your questions. With that, let's get started. In the second quarter, we delivered total revenues of $48.6 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $6.13 and cash flow from operations of $2.5 billion. We're pleased with our performance overall during the quarter and through the first half of the year. With focus on affordability and innovation, we are continuing to strengthen our competitive position and grow our businesses. In Evernorth Health Services, we saw another strong quarter of our market-leading pharmacy, care and benefits portfolio. Express Scripts, our pharmacy benefits business harnesses our deep relationships, extensive clinical expertise and is delivering innovations and innovative solutions for those we serve. We've long been a leader in supporting access to prescription drugs and to further enhance our efforts, we took a series of actions in the quarter including launching co-pay assurance to support further affordability for patients and ClearCareRx to provide our clients with broader choice. We also introduced independent Rx, which is a first of its kind support program for rural pharmacists that recognizes the critical role they play in improving access for millions of Americans. We will continue to lead the way to the current environment of elevated legislative and regulatory activity, and we're encouraged by the positive recognition of our work to make safe, effective and affordable access of prescription drugs within reach for millions of people who need them. Our client retention is also strong, and we are continuing to build and expand new relationships. For example, we're making good progress for our implementation with Centene, which begins on January 2024. Our teams are working collaboratively, and we are on track as we prepare to further improve affordability in serving 20 million Centene customers. In the quarter, we had strong growth in Accredo, our specialty pharmacy business. In a moment, I'll profile the deep clinical expertise and capabilities that make Accredo a differentiated leader in the space. Turning to Cigna Healthcare. We delivered another quarter of organic customer growth, reinforcing how well our consultative approach and capabilities continue to resonate in the market. Our U.S. commercial business continues to build momentum. We've had sustained success with commercial customer growth outpacing the overall market, and 2023 is shaping up to be another very strong year for this business. With our affordability initiatives and deep consultative sales approach, we're delivering highly competitive total cost of care for employer clients as well as providing programs supporting healthy engaged workforces that they need. In U.S. government, our Medicare Advantage business is achieving above-market customer growth with high-quality affordable pains and targeted investments that we continue to make to further strengthen our network and offerings. In our individual exchange business, we will continue taking a focused approach by engaging customers to improve health outcomes and managing risks in the expanding population we serve. In the quarter, while our medical care ratio is generally in line with expectations, we did have an increase to our 2023 risk adjustment payable. Relative to the risk adjuster impact, we expect this to be a 2023 event, and we've already taken actions for 2024. In our international health business, we drove continued innovation and growth in target markets with solutions for the globally mobile population and employees of multinational corporations as well as into governmental organizations. Overall, our second quarter results show that the Cigna group is performing well with underlying strength in our complementary businesses. We believe we're well positioned to continue growing our company and deliver on our commitments. With the strength of our results, we are increasing our outlook for full year revenue and customer growth as well as cash flow from operations, and we are reaffirming that we are on track to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $24.70 for full year 2023. Now I'll talk about how we are working to sustain our momentum with our differentiated and diversified capabilities and our durable strategic growth framework. Our framework guides us in continuing to respond to customer, patient and client needs as well as capturing growth opportunities within our foundational businesses and our accelerated growth businesses. Additionally, we harness the power of our talent, client relationships and partnerships as well as an expanding technology portfolio for cross enterprise leverage. Technology increasingly provides us with opportunities to accelerate innovation and growth. Artificial intelligence and machine learning, for example, capabilities further enhancing ways for us to support patients in their clinical care teams as well as drive additional efficiency initiatives. Today, I'll talk more about one of our accelerated growth businesses, Accredo, our flagship specialty pharmacy, where we have a competitive advantage in an area of growing need and opportunity. Earlier this summer, we welcomed a group of investors to Warrendale, Pennsylvania at one of our Accredo clinical care sites. The visit provided an opportunity to see the breadth of our specialty capabilities and the depth of our clinical expertise, a critical driver for the positive outcomes and impact we achieved for patients requiring complex and high-cost treatments for chronic conditions. Here are a few headlines from the day at Warrendale. First, Accredo has a proven track record of growth. Only 5 years ago, when Express Scripts combined with Cigna, Here are a few headlines from the day Warrendale. First, Accredo has a proven track record of growth. Only 5 years ago, when Express Scripts combined with Cigna, Accredo was approximately a $30 billion business. Today, Accredo has grown to approximately $60 billion. In 2023, serves approximately 900,000 patients with some of the most complex conditions and needs. Accredo now represents about 40% of Evernorth's total revenue and because of its unique strengths, Accredo has grown faster than the overall marketplace. Second is secular tailwinds in the market creates significant growth opportunities as we look to the future. Those who need specialty drugs make up about 5% of the population and they drive more than 40% of total health care costs across medical, behavioral and pharmacy services. This is fueling expected mid- to high single-digit annual growth in what is already a specialty pharmaceutical market of approximately $380 billion. Biosimilars represent a force of change and a substantial opportunity for further growth and impact, and we will leverage them for greater affordability for clients and patients. We've long been a leader in supporting greater adoption of biosimilars as we did with the wave of generic medications when they became available decades ago. And like generics, we believe biosimilars will drive much needed affordability improvements for those we serve and thereby, create more financial capacity to pay for new pharmaceutical innovations today and as we look to the future. Third is the breadth of our clinical capabilities and use of data that further fuels precision and impact. We've built and strengthened our clinical capabilities and far-reaching operating model over decades. Within Accredo, we have therapeutic resource centers with clinical teams of pharmacists, nurse, dietitians and social workers, specializing in different disease states such as blood and neurological disorders and multiple types of cancers. Unlike many of our competitors, we directly employ hundreds of field-based infusion nurses. Today, they are located within 75 miles of approximately 90% of the U.S. population. And as they care for patients inside their homes, they provide better, more coordinated and personalized experiences, including addressing social determinants of health. With the clinical care models focused on each individual patient, we're able to provide a level of personalized clinical support that is vital in specialty pharmacy. Many new high-cost drugs for oncology, gene therapies and reconditions are coming to market, further pressuring affordability for clients and requiring greater support for patients that take these complex medications safely and effectively. I would note drug manufacturers also recognize our expertise and capabilities as well as our superior outcomes that we produce with our unique coordinated clinical model. Putting all this together, we're excited about the accelerated growth opportunities we have with Accredo's differentiated specialty pharmacy and view it as a powerful growth engine for our company today and into the future. Now stepping back to the enterprise level, I'll briefly recap. We drove strong earnings that built on our momentum from the first quarter and last year. We delivered adjusted EPS of $6.13, strong customer, revenue and cash flow growth. Our progress gives us confidence to reaffirm our guidance of adjusted EPS of at least $24.70 for full year 2023, and we also remain on track for adjusted EPS of at least $28 in 2024. This reinforces how we are creating value for our customers and clients and leveraging differentiated capabilities to give us flexibility to continue performing well in a dynamic environment. Now Brian will share additional perspective about our performance in the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Brian?Brian C. EvankoThank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review Cigna's second quarter 2023 results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year. Second quarter results were strong, reflecting continued execution across the enterprise. Looking at the quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights include revenue growth of 7% to $48.6 billion, after-tax adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $6.13 and cash flow from operations of $2.5 billion. Revenue and cash flow both exceeded expectations, while adjusted earnings per share were slightly ahead of expectations. Our 2 platforms continue to perform well, with Evernorth posting solid top and bottom-line growth, while Cigna Healthcare delivered results in line with expectations despite an unfavorable risk adjustment impact in our individual exchange business, which I will discuss shortly. First, turning to Evernorth results. Evernorth continues to deliver strong performance, with second quarter 2023 revenues growing 10% to $38.2 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by continued strong performance in our differentiated specialty pharmacy business, which had year-over-year revenue growth in the mid-teens, and our focus on providing a variety of solutions that drive affordability and lowest net cost for our customers and clients. Additionally, we continue to build out our cross-enterprise leverage capabilities harnessing data and technology to accelerate innovation for customers and clients. And we also continue to make strategic investments to further enhance and expand our client relationships, diversify our portfolio of products and services, prepare for new clients in 2024 and advance our technology capabilities. Overall, Evernorth has delivered strong first half results and we are well positioned as we look to the back half of the year. Our diversified solutions allow us to sustain momentum by delivering differentiated value to our customers and clients, helping them overcome key healthcare challenges. Turning to Cigna Healthcare. Second quarter 2023 adjusted revenues grew 12% to $12.7 billion. Pretax adjusted earnings were $1.2 billion, and the medical care ratio was 81.2%. The medical care ratio reflects some items specific to our individual exchange business that largely offset one another in the quarter. After receiving our first view of industry-wide risk adjustment data in early July, we increased our full year 2023 estimated individual exchange risk adjustment payable. It's important to note, this was primarily driven by 2 states. Within those 2 states, the unfavorable impact from the first half of 2023 was about $80 million and was recognized in the second quarter. We expect a similar magnitude of impact in the back half of the year. Additionally, this impact is isolated to the 2023 calendar year as we have taken corrective pricing actions in the impacted geographies in our 2024 REIT filings. Specific to the second quarter, the unfavorable risk adjustment payable impact was largely offset by a favorable update to our 2022 risk adjustment receivable within the individual exchange business. Underlying fundamentals across the Cigna Healthcare segment continued to perform well as we further expanded our relationships and delivered affordability for our customers and clients. As we have mentioned on prior calls, we planned and priced for more normalized levels of utilization this year. Our year-to-date claims experience has been broadly in line with this expectation, across both commercial and Medicare Advantage. Turning to Cigna Healthcare Medical customers. We ended the quarter with 19.5 million total medical customers, growth of approximately 1.5 million customers year-to-date across all businesses. Within our government business, medical customers grew sequentially and year-to-date Medicare Advantage has grown 12%. Overall, Cigna Healthcare's results in the quarter were solid as we demonstrated strong underlying fundamentals despite the increased 2023 individual exchange risk adjustment payable previously mentioned. And we continue to grow our customer and client relationships, providing differentiated value and driving affordability. Now turning to our outlook for full year 2023. We have increased our expectations for full year 2023, consolidated adjusted revenues to at least $190 billion, driven by continued strength in our businesses as we continue to deliver innovative services and solutions for the benefit of our customers, patients and clients. We are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $24.70 per share. And we expect adjusted EPS to be split approximately evenly between the third and fourth quarters. In Evernorth, we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $6.4 billion. With respect to Evernorth earnings' cadence, we expect mid-single-digit year-over-year adjusted earnings' growth in the third quarter and mid- to high single-digit adjusted earnings' growth in the fourth quarter. In Cigna Healthcare, we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $4.425 billion. We expect third quarter Cigna Healthcare adjusted earnings to be slightly below 55% of second half adjusted earnings to reflect seasonal patterns as well as the rate and pace of investments. This incorporates the impact from the estimated individual exchange risk adjustment payable in the second half of the year, which is offset by other items in Cigna Healthcare, including expense efficiencies. Additionally, we continue to expect our 2023 medical care ratio to be within the range of 81.5% to 82.3%. Switching gears, let's move to our 2023 capital management position and outlook. Year-to-date through August 2, 2023, we have repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares of common stock for approximately $1.1 billion. The continued strength of our cash generation gives us the confidence to increase our full year 2023 expected cash flow from operations by $500 million to at least $9.5 billion for the full year. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based model that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. Now to recap. Second quarter results were strong, reflecting high-quality underlying fundamentals in our foundational and accelerated businesses, giving us confidence to deliver on our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $24.70. And we continue to expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $28 consistent with our prior commentary. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&amp;A portion of the call.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mr. Scott Fidel with Stephens.Scott J. FidelAppreciate the color on the risk adjustment dynamics. I think that helps also explain some of the rate increases that we've seen you filing in some of those pertinent states like Georgia for 2024. My question is if we back out the risk adjustment impacts from both '22 and '23, can you give us an update on how you view sort of underlying utilization and cost trends in the marketplace and the individual business for 2023? And how you'd say sort of core, I guess, its exchange margins are tracking towards your longer-term view in '23. And as you put these price increases in for '24, how that will sync up relative to the long-term sort of 4% to 6% pretax margins that you've historically sort of manage the individual business for?Brian C. EvankoScott, it's Brian. I'll try to take each of those bites kind of one at a time. So as I mentioned in my comments, in the quarter, we had an $80 million impact from the risk adjustment payable matter in 2023, which reflects essentially a true-up for the first 2 quarters of the year. But that was largely offset in the quarter by the favorable true-up we had on the 2022 risk adjustment settlement. The other residual piece within the individual exchange business is we had some favorable claim cost experience in the first half of the year. So the $80 million was offset largely by the 2022 risk adjustment settlement, but also, to a lesser degree, by favorable cost trend within our individual exchange business, which reflects a younger, healthier population than what we had in 2022. So claim costs there, certainly within check, but we had the larger payable, which creates the pressure point for the year. As it relates to the profit margins and how to think about where we are in '23 and the rate increase impact on '24. Just for some context here, you can think of this business being approximately a $5 billion block for us in 2023 in terms of premium revenue. And we had shared on a prior call that we were anticipating the individual exchange book to run below our target margins within 2023. As you noted, our long-term target for this business is 4% to 6%. For the remainder of this year, we're expecting another $80 million of risk adjustment payable impact across the second half, which, as I mentioned, will be offset by the strength across the broader Cigna Healthcare portfolio including expense efficiencies. When you put all this together, the individual exchange margins in 2023 will be below our prior estimates. And for 2024, we have taken sizable price increases in our 2 largest states. So we would expect some degree of margin expansion in the individual exchange book overall in '24 relative to '23. The exact amount of that margin improvement will end up being a function of our geographic and customer mix in 2024 as we are likely to have fewer customers in the individual exchange business in 2024 relative to where we are in 2023. So thanks for the question. Hopefully, you can follow all those moving pieces.OperatorOur next question comes from Mr. A.J. Rice with Crédit Suisse.Albert J. William RiceI know at this point in the year, large employers are well on their way to thinking about their '24 outlook both from health benefits and also on the pharmacy benefit side. I wondered if given you've got a great window on all of that, anything interesting to call out in terms of priorities for employers around benefit design, focus on particular categories of healthcare, whether -- I know sometimes it's diabetes, sometimes payment planningAnything on the cost management focus? I know there's a lot of discussion about GLP-1s and wonder whether they're focused on trying to manage that more effectively. And then just overall expectations in those customers around cost trends and -- are they assuming it's sort of a more normalized outlook going into '24? Or are they making any assumptions about pent-up demand or anything?David Michael CordaniIt's David. Let me describe a little bit of the -- we'll say the buying characteristics and areas of focus in the market more broadly, and then I'll ask Eric to give you a little bit more color in terms of the pharmacy-specific space and using your GLP-1 as an example. So stepping back, and it's for the latter part of your comment to reinforce it. The buying behaviors continue to have an intense focus on what I will call base-buying needs focus on affordability, coupled with consistent high-quality service levels. There's 2 additional dimensions, I would say, that have intensified recently relative to need state. One, as employers, because you're coming at through the employer lens continue to intensify their focus on having healthy, engaged, highly productive workforce. They're intensifying their focus and need and awareness of the complex behavioral health needs from their population, inclusive of, but also beyond the more intense behavioral health dimensions. This includes anxiety, stress, depression and complexity to come along with that. Here, I would note that within our Cigna Group, portfolio of solutions, we're well positioned to meet the needs because there's a lot of coordination that's necessary to advance there. The second trend I'd highlight is what the marketplace is sometimes calling point solution fatigue, where over time, employers have aggregated many individual point solutions that made sense at a given moment in time, but they find themselves stepping back and looking at that inventory questioning whether or not either, a, they're getting all the value out of each individual solution; or b, the friction and/or abrasion for their coworkers or medical professionals is worth the value of the fractured point solutions, and therefore, are challenging more opportunities to coordinate or integrate solutions to get more value, leverage and better service from that standpoint. And again, our portfolio is really well positioned there and continues to resonate in the market as evidenced by our growth. I'll ask Eric to provide a little bit of color of areas of focus for buyers more broadly in pharmacy, including the GLP-1.Eric Paul PalmerGreat. Thanks, David. I'll start with the GLP-1. GLP-1s are definitely top of mind for many of our clients. There's been a meaningful uptick in utilization here. And as I think you know, we have coverage for these medications on our formularies from early on for value-based arrangements with pharma manufacturers, we've seen contributions for the benefit of patients and our clients by result of the structures. We have recently launched a program called InCircleRx, which brings together management of the GLP-1 cardiac, diabetic conditions, obesity. So these conditions often tend to be interrelated, to bring together a benefit plan design, the clinical support as necessary and the overall resources we can bring to help these patients, better manage their health and ultimately get to a better plan costs. So at GLP-1 and the broader cardiac, obesity, diabetes space is a real area of focus. I would also note as David touched on in his comments, continued interest in behavioral solutions. That's an area that we've got strong expertise within Evernorth, and we're excited about the opportunities in that market and the need to help manage behavioral care more effectively. Those will probably be the top couple of specific themes I would call out at this point, A.J.OperatorOur next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.Justin LakeA couple of quick questions. One, just so I appreciate your comments on cost trend, but did see a pretty big pickup in medical costs payable in the quarter relative to reserve growth. Just curious what drove that. And then, just stepping back, the Stop Loss business has seen a nice acceleration this year up in the teens. Just curious what you're seeing there? And do you expect that to be the kind of the trajectory after we've seen a bit of a slowdown over the last few years?Brian C. EvankoJustin, it's Brian. I'll start, and I think David will pile on in terms of the Stop Loss component. So as it relates to our medical cost payables or reserves, nothing particular I flag here. We continue to employ a consistent methodology as it relates to how we set our reserves. There'll be some natural variability in this metric as product mix shift tends to occur from quarter-to-quarter. And I know the days claims payable metric is one that's commonly looked at. We don't target or forecast any specific level of DCP rather this is more the output of our detailed assumption setting that's been aggregated up to the enterprise level. So we remain comfortable with our reserving methodology and confidence in the adequacy of the balance sheet. As it relates to Stop Loss, you're right. We're seeing nice growth in that product line. We've got 13% year-on-year premium growth. We're on track to achieve our target profitability in that business this year. So nice performance, and it continues to resonate with our clients. David, anything you want to add in that regard?David Michael CordaniYes. Thanks, Brian. The item I amplify is just a recall from prior conversations, part of our consultative approach and go-to-market approach is when you work with clients of a variety of sizes around the benefit design that matches their strategy, the clinical programs in support of that, the master strategy, the service support program for the master strategy. The final thing we work on is the funding mechanism. And as the market conditions change, we have the ability to flex between risk or guarantee cost, shared returns and/or self-funded with Stop Loss and our stop-loss program, as you call out, continues to perform well, grow well and resonate in the marketplace because it provides that peace of mind and predictability for employers around their cash flow and any dislocation that may happen in a given year. So our specialists in that space have a high-performing book. It continues to resonate well. And you'll see ebb and flow over time based on market buying conditions, but continued growth.OperatorOur next question comes from Ms. Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.Lisa Christine GillI just want to come back to the pharmacy side of the business for a minute and ask a couple of questions. When I think about the quarter, can you talk about the margin impact from, one, GLP-1s, I know you talked about strength there; two, the shift to biosimilars; and three, the Centene implementation costs. Can you just talk about how each of those had an impact on the margin in the quarter? And then just as a follow-up, when you talked about the 2024 selling season, more specific on the PBM side. Can you maybe just give a little more detail as to how renewals went and what your retention rates are expected to be for '24?Brian C. EvankoLisa, it's Brian. I'll start. I think that's a multiparter, and then Eric is going to chime in with some comments on the sales season. But as it relates to the quarter, overall, Evernorth continues to perform really well. So I'd start there and largely in line with our expectations when you put all the different moving pieces together. The individual components you kind of called out there, Eric referenced earlier, GLP-1 utilization does continue to build, which in the Evernorth business is a positive contributor to our earnings at this point in time, whether that be for diabetic indications or nondiabetic indications. So that's certainly a net positive relative to the Evernorth business in 2023. On the biosimilar side of the house, you should think of, thus far, relatively low adoption of AMJEVITA in the first half of the year. On the second half of the year, we obviously added 2 additional biosimilars into the National Preferred Formulary. And one of the reasons we expect acceleration in income growth in the third and fourth quarter is the impact of greater biosimilar adoption as well as improved overall positioning relative to the dynamics of competitiveness across the 4 drugs that will be on the National Preferred Formulary. But in the second quarter, I wouldn't characterize biosimilars as a particular driver of the margin profile. On the Centene impact, we remain very much on track relative to the implementation against our commitments as we mentioned before, we expect to spend about $200 million over the course of 2023. You should think of that as gradually building quarter-to-quarter over the course of the year. And so the money is being spent as we speak. And all those factors did impact the second quarter. But again, nothing in particular I would call out being significantly deviating from our expectations compared to what we expected 3 months ago. Eric, maybe you can pick up both on Centene and the selling season.Eric Paul PalmerGreat. Thanks, Brian. So just a couple of other comments on Centene. I'm really pleased with how we are working together to deliver an implementation program to serve Centene's customers. We are on track, and there's good momentum in the readiness for our January '24 implementation. So continue to be excited about that opportunity. With respect to the selling season more broadly, we operate in a competitive market, and the strength of our solutions really continues to resonate. We will deliver another strong retention rate. As we look to the 2024, I think mid-90s are higher and consistent with our prior commentary around what a strong retention rate looks like, we'll have additional new growth, new client wins on top of the large Centene wins as well. So feeling good as we kind of wind down the 2024 selling season at this point, and we'll provide more detail on that when we provide our 2024 guidance later on.OperatorOur next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.Kevin Mark FischbeckI wanted to get a little more color on the increased enrollment outlook. I guess you've indicated in the past that you're being a little bit conservative about the session and determinations. Were those -- anything changed there to drive that? Or was it new customer growth? Just a little color.Brian C. EvankoKevin, it's Brian. So I'll start, and I think your question is specific to Cigna Healthcare, which is where I'll go. So first off, we're really pleased with the strong growth momentum across the Cigna Healthcare book. If you look at our year-to-date customer growth, it's running ahead of expectations at $1.5 million net growth, and that builds off of a strong performance we had in 2022, where we added nearly 1 million customers across the Cigna Healthcare platform. As it relates to our refreshed membership outlook for the year, you can think of the primary driver of that being an elevated expectation for individual exchange customers by year-end 2023. The other components of the Cigna Healthcare customer outlook are broadly unchanged from our prior projections. We're not yet seeing meaningful signs of any economic pressure within our commercial book of business. But that said, we have assumed some elevated disenrollment in the U.S. commercial business in the second half of 2023 in order to be prudent. We continue to exclude any potential Medicaid redetermination lives from our commercial forecast for the balance of the year. And taken all together, again, pleased to see a full year outlook of 8% growth in total medical customers across Cigna Healthcare. One minor refinement we made this year or this quarter relative to the individual exchange businesses, we are now forecasting some level of Medicaid redeterminations coming in through the balance of the year. So you should think of the commercial business, excluding Medicaid redetermination of the individual forecast now including some level of redeterminations for the balance of the year.OperatorOur next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.Joshua Richard RaskinJust clarification on the exchange true-ups and the impact there. I just want to make sure I get this right. I assume you've got a bigger payable, but that probably means that your claims costs are coming in a little bit better. So I just want to see if there's actually any offset from the receivable from last year. So I just want to see if there's actually an EPS impact expected for this year.And then my real question is just could you speak to your MA bid strategy for 2024? I'm specifically interested in how you're thinking about benefit design in light of rates and the risk model changes? And then if there's anything to talk about the VillageMD partnership, if that impacts any way you're bidding in certain markets?Brian C. EvankoJosh, it's Brian. So I'll take the first one, and then David will pick up on the Medicare Advantage question. So as it relates to the different payable dynamics, let me try to give you the full picture here. So just for some context, we ended the quarter with about 820,000 customers in the individual exchange business. That was up significantly from where we were at the end of 2022. And during the 2022 year, we were in a risk adjustment receivable position on this business. So when we stepped into '23, we had been anticipating that, that would switch over and that will -- we'd be in a payable position for 2023. The first look we got at the industry-wide risk adjustment data that we received in early July indicated that will be in an even greater payable position for the 2023 plan year, and that was driven by 2 large states. Those 2 large states represent about half of the individual exchange premium base. And the adjustment in the first half of the year that came through the second quarter was an $80 million increase in the payable. That was offset largely by a favorable true-up on the 2022 receivable, you can think of that in the range of about $50 million, and then the residual is primarily driven by favorable claim costs in 2023 relative to our expectations. So that favorability in the 2023 claim costs partially offset the increased payable that we have, that ran through the second quarter. So hopefully, that helps to square the picture a little bit on the individual exchange business. David, do you want to pick up on that?David Michael CordaniSure, Brian. So you had 2 questions. Specific to MA and our bid strategy, I'll just speak more broadly. I'm not going to go into detail specifically, Josh, just to manage expectations given the time cycle and the competitive nature. First and foremost, as I noted, we're pleased with our growth in 2023, point one; two, as we look to 2024 to some of the points you made reference to, we expect to see larger-than-average local market variability in terms of offering and positioning by competitors.And at this point, I would highlight and reinforce that we remain convicted to and comfortable with our bid assumptions relative to underlying medical costs based upon what we've seen through the first 2 quarters of the year and our outlook for the year. I'd also note that our starts position coming into the cycle is consistent and strong and our early look at the starts on a go-forward basis remains consistent and strong from that standpoint. Specifically to your last point around Village, first and foremost, I'd ask you to think about initiating the relationship with Village, we seek to have a long-term strategic positive impact. I would note that day 1 for the benefit of our customers who are experiencing Village and Summit relationships, they began to see benefits immediately by the nature of the structure of our relationship and then we continue to collaborate, innovate on value-based care, whether it's leveraging some Evernorth capabilities like behavioral, virtual or other services, and/or go more deeply into individual markets around more precisely leveraging data and insights to curate subspecialty networks to get the best possible quality and cost and affordability. That benefit will continue to mount as we go forward. And to the core of your question, contribute to market by market, our posture in MA. But specifically, we're driving this initiative with Village and with our Evernorth team to benefit our commercial space as well. So we're pleased with the early traction, a lot of work to do, and it will continue to yield dividends both today and into the future. Thanks, Josh.OperatorOur next question comes from Mr. Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.Nathan Allen RichI wanted to go back to biosimilars. How has the pricing of biosimilar HUMIRA compared to expectations as more competition come to market? And given what appears to be a very significant reduction in pricing, does that pull forward the benefit from the HUMIRA biosimilar at all? And for the different options that you added to the formulary, should we think of the economics of each of those as being similar to Evernorth? And then just a quick follow-up on the Cigna Healthcare segment. Brian, could you maybe help us think through the seasonality this year and maybe why that's different than a typical year? And as we think about the 2024 and going forward, do you go back to more normal seasonality in that business?Eric Paul PalmerIt's Eric. I'll start. So as you noted and implied in your question, biosimilars are a really important opportunity to drive competition and for us to then help to make the competition efficient to drive improvements to the affordability of these high-cost specialty medicines. Now in 2023, we've continued to co-prefer HUMIRA on the formulary towards the beginning of the year, we added AMJEVITA to our National Preferred Formulary and recently added Cyltezo and Sandoz's products, both the low and high anti-wax versions onto the NPF. So that's the activity that's gotten us to this point to date. I would note, we work through with the manufacturers on the terms of those to drive to the best available cost, the best available expense for our clients. And we have visibility into that pretty early on. So we've navigated and made our arrangements in constructing the placement such as we came into this year, and so I wouldn't want you to think about there being dynamics kind of playing out simultaneously. These are things we have negotiated in advance. We have visibility into as the products come into the market and we work to leverage the competition to continue to improve affordability for the benefit of the clients we serve. Over time, as we drive even more products, more competition, we'll work to continue to bring improved levels of affordability to our clients and continue to construct our offerings in a way that best meet their needs. I hand it over to Brian on the second part of your question.Brian C. EvankoIt's Brian. So as it relates to the Cigna Healthcare seasonality, I'd start to remind you, we expect the second half earnings to be a little bit less than 55% in the third quarter. Relative to the MCR component of that, our prior expectations on the MCR seasonality have not changed. So what I mean by that is the directional pattern we saw, for example, in 2022 on MCR is a reasonable proxy for we'd expect the 2023 quarterly pattern to be, and as a result, the fourth quarter MCR is likely to be the highest quarter of the year as we see more customers meet their deductible and out-of-pocket maximum obligations. However, we do expect the pace of SG&amp;A spending to look different than it did last year. For example, we had a step-up in SG&amp;A in the fourth quarter of 2022 that we would not expect to recur in the fourth quarter of '23. The other item that I call your attention to is our net investment income in the fourth quarter of '22 was considerably weaker than what we're expecting to see in the fourth quarter of '23. So those are the primary things to think through as it relates to the seasonality pattern. As it relates to '24, at this point in time, there's nothing I'd call your attention to that will lead us to think there's any abnormal pattern.OperatorOur next question comes from Mr. Steven Valiquette.Steven James ValiquetteSo I guess to the extent that your Medicare Advantage book is seeing a more normalized utilization trend this year that you baked into your pricing and guidance. Just curious if you have any additional color just for the second quarter and whether it normalized more in the outpatient setting versus inpatient. I just want to hear a little more color on some of the trends by cost category, just given the topic of this is for the industry this quarter?Brian C. EvankoSteve, it's Brian. So as you noted, we planned and price for more normalized utilization levels in 2023, and our claims experience is largely consistent with that expectation. So within the MA book specifically to the core of your question, we have seen elevated utilization of both outpatient and professional services all year. But important, this should be viewed in the context of what we had forecasted and priced for. So the overall cost trends are largely in line with our expectations in both our second half 2023 guidance and our 2024 bids anticipate that, that dynamic will continue as it relates to specifically within outpatient and professional, surgeries are the area that I'd call your attention to, in particular, orthopedic and cardiovascular. We did see some level of favorability in inpatients. So those are a few of the subcategories that I'd call your attention to, but all in line with what we had anticipated coming into the year.OperatorOur next question comes from Mr. Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.Stephen C. BaxterI wanted to ask about some of the moving parts in the P&amp;L this year for Evernorth. In the first half, there's a pretty notable divergence in the growth of revenue and gross profit. And then what you're seeing drop through to earnings? I know that Centene is a big part of that and the investments you're making there. But the trend underneath that still feels like it's pretty notable. Any additional color on what's going on within Evernorth SG&amp;A would be helpful, whether that's investments or mix or anything else that we should be keeping in mind?Brian C. EvankoSteve, it's Brian. So a few things I'd call your attention to in regards to the profitability margins relative to revenue. We had an expansion of our relationship with the Department of Defense that was effective on January 1, and we had some additional spending that we're kind of working our way into in terms of growing into that. So that certainly weighed down the income growth a bit in the first half of the year. To your point, the rate pace of investments, particularly around the accelerated growth businesses in Evernorth, both the healthcare services as well as the Accredo specialty pharmacy also impacted the income growth. And then for the back half of the year, we expect accelerated income growth, again, mid-single digits in the third quarter, mid- to high single digits in the fourth quarter, largely driven by the increased ramp for biosimilars. And I would note that, that's not predicated on any meaningful share shift. We have strong visibility to that income emerging in the back half of the year.OperatorWe'll go ahead to Mr. George Hill with Deutsche Bank.George Robert HillI know it's a small piece of the business, but the other revenue inside of Evernorth grew 35% this quarter, accelerating actually versus the prior quarter. I guess it's becoming to some degree, a meaningful portion of the segment. I guess, could you talk about what's driving that growth? And how should we think about the margin profile that's attached to that business?Brian C. EvankoGeorge, it's Brian. I'll start and then Eric can pick up a bit. So yes, the fees and other revenue in Evernorth is a strong driver of growth granted off of a low base. So important to keep that in mind as you think about the overall P&amp;L. Multiple areas of growth underneath this line. One I'd call out is we're seeing increased demand for PBM service-based solutions, meaning more fee-oriented relationships as we have more and more clients looking for those types of mechanisms. We also have contributions from our Evernorth Care businesses reflected here. So for example, MD Live and Evercore are both contributing to that. And then if you're looking at pharmacy other revenue, the CuraScript specialty distribution business has been a strong grower year-on-year. You also recall from some of our prior conversations that we're very focused on driving cross-enterprise leverage between the Cigna Healthcare business and Evernorth. So as Cigna Healthcare procures more and more services from Evernorth, we have some benefit that comes through the fees and the other revenue lines in Evernorth from that as well. So Eric, anything you want to add in terms of further color?Eric Paul PalmerBrian, thanks. You hit the headlines in terms of the main drivers here financially. We'd just note on the fee-based portion of the PBM in particular. This is an area that we've continued to accelerate, David made reference in his prepared remarks around our ClearCareRx program. This builds off of a couple of years of experience that we've got in providing fee-based fully aligned mechanisms in terms of providing the pharmacy benefit and so those fee types of arrangements will come through there. I would say, have you think about the margin profile for that business is very consistent with the other businesses in Express Scripts and the like and then likewise, the growth in our MD Live and behavioral platforms, continue to be an area of real focus for us and continued momentum and into that a driver as well. And I would have you think about those margins is also generally in line with the Evernorth segment overall. So we continue to be excited about the opportunity and the momentum that we're building in all of the different lines across the Evernorth portfolio, and you're seeing the growth there come through that line.OperatorOur last question comes from Mr. Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.Lance Arthur WilkesA question on the specialty products in the Healthcare segment. And just had kind of 3 elements to it. One was what sort of utilization trends you were seeing in behavioral, dental and some of the other areas where you're taking some risk? And then a broader question, just understanding how much specialty is contributing to the earnings' power of the business versus just the core medical? And what do you think the cross-sell opportunities might still remain for that business?Brian C. EvankoIt's Brian. I'll start, and then David, if you want to chime in with anything, feel free. So for a long period of time, as I think you know, our specialty products within Cigna Healthcare has been a really core part of the value proposition as we seek to expand client relationships. So we have few clients that only purchase medical services from us more and more, purchase a full suite because we've demonstrated over time our clinical models perform best when we have a fuller suite of services.As it relates to what we're seeing in terms of trends in terms of utilization, behavioral health has certainly been growing at a strong clip, not just this year, but for the past few years. Part of that is by design as we engage with our customers. And over time, that's a good thing because the more utilization we see in behavioral health services, it helps to defray core medical costs over time. We've also seen an uptick in dental utilization this year as well, but all of these things are within, again, the boundaries of what we had forecasted and planned for and priced for within our Cigna Healthcare book of business, which is why you're seeing our commercial employer business continue to perform so well financially. And again, that line is on track to achieve target margins here in 2023. And David, anything you want to pick up on here?David Michael CordaniSure, Brian. A few items to highlight, specifically, just clicked on one more notch in behavioral, as Brian noted, elevated trend and as you would expect, and over a prolonged period of time, I think the last 3 to 5 years, as you click down in it, think about the professional services as such, we continue to innovate new products, new programs, expansion of network, both physical network. We operate the largest virtual behavioral network in America today and then expanding behavioral services even further in our value-based care programs to help medical professionals be a first line of screening and support from that standpoint.To the last part of your question around the expansion opportunities within our portfolio, you know our portfolio well in terms of the healthcare side of the equation. If you think about the old monitors of Select, I think under 500 employees, middle market, 500 to 5,000 old monitors and Nashville above 5,000 multi-geographic Select to still think about that as totally cross-sold and penetrated. We go to market with bundled solutions. It's a big part of our value proposition, helps us generate a predictable high quality, low trend and outcome. Middle market remains and has a high level of penetration yet there are cross-sell opportunities and national accounts, a lower level of penetration versus the other segments. However, as I noted to A.J.'s question, the point solution fatigue in the marketplace present at even further opportunity as you coordinate those services. The last note I would make is as we leverage the breadth of the Evernorth capabilities today and into the future, we're innovating new solutions. So you'll hear us talk more about Pathwell programs to take specific diagnoses and look at reengineering those episodes of care end-to-end. And in cases, to your phraseology, we take risk based on the performance, we hold ourselves accountable based upon the clinical service and financial outcomes. So strong penetration down market, opportunities upmarket, market buying behavior is evolving because of point solution fatigue and importantly, continued innovation will continue to drive growth for us there. Thanks, Lance.OperatorI will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.David Michael CordaniThank you for your engagement and questions today. I just want to highlight a few items. We stepped into 2023 with strong growth and have been successful in building beyond that momentum throughout the first half of the year. We remain confident that we'll deliver on our commitments, including our adjusted EPS outlook for 2023 of at least $24.70 and our commitment for at least $28 of EPS in 2024. I'd also note how proud and appreciative I am of our colleagues around the world who continue to be dedicated to driving innovation and delivering on the programs and solutions as well as partnerships that support every day in the health and vitality of our customers, our patients and our clients. As always, we look forward to talking to you again soon about how we're working to sustain the growth of our company and capture more opportunities to serve more lives and achieve a greater impact and we continue to invest in our future every day to drive further innovation. Have a great day.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna Group's Second Quarter 2023 Results Review. Cigna Investor Relations will be available to respond to additional questions shortly.

QuoteSkyworks’ earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 1.92% on average.Let’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.Factors Likely to Have Influenced Q3 PerformanceSkyworks’ fiscal third quarter results are expected to reflect sluggish smartphone demand, particularly for Android-based devices. Moreover, the challenging macroeconomic environment globally is expected to have hurt the growth rate.Further, the slowing deployment of 5G in North America due to sluggish spending is expected to have hurt top-line growth.Our model estimate for the United States segment is pegged at $780 million, indicating a 4.1% year-over-year decline. Meanwhile, China revenues are pegged at $84.7 million, suggesting a 14.3% year-over-year decline.Nevertheless, robust uptake of Wi-Fi 6 and 6E solutions is expected to have driven Skyworks’ top line in the fiscal third quarter.

During the 2018 national championships at TD Garden in Boston, walls usually plastered with signage from companies looking to align with a program that had become the gold standard in the sport were largely barren.Li Li Leung, who in March 2019 became USA Gymnastics’ fourth president in less than two years, believes the organization has come “full circle.”“It is incredible that a corporate partner such as Nike ... (has) the trust in us and belief in us that we have turned around,” Leung said.On the day she was hired, Leung stressed her primary goal was to build an organization focused on athlete health and safety while creating an infrastructure that would make sure all stakeholders in an organization with roughly 200,000 members felt heard, supported and safe.The changes include implementation of the vast majority of the 70 recommendations made by a former federal prosecutor hired to independently review the organization’s handling of abuse cases and a nearly complete overhaul of leadership at the top. The finalizing of a $380 million settlement between USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee and hundreds of victims of sexual abuse in December 2021 also assured USA Gymnastics of its survival and cleared the way for it to court sponsors without legal matters looming in the background.Story continuesNike saw enough progress that it felt comfortable expanding its relationship with an organization whose brightest lights often become crossover stars while competing under the Olympic rings.An American woman has won each of the last five Olympic all-around titles, including 2016 champion Simone Biles and 2020 champion Sunisa Lee, both of whom will be competing Saturday at the U.S. Classic outside Chicago. Gabby Douglas, the first Black woman to win gold in the all-around, also has returned to training in the run-up to the 2024 Paris Games.“The USA Gymnastics partnership represents Nike’s commitment to expand sport for the next generation,” Karie Conner, vice president and general manager of the North America Kids division at Nike Inc., said in a statement. “Together we’re providing opportunities for all kids to experience the joy of movement — and the confidence it builds — from their first forward roll to first back handspring and beyond.”As part of the settlement, every sponsorship agreement signed with USA Gymnastics now includes money earmarked to support athlete wellness, a broad term that can cover a wide spectrum of programs.Apparel provider GK Elite's deal included funding to reimburse national team members and coaches for visits to mental health professionals while training outside of team camps and national and international competitions. More than a dozen current national team members have taken advantage of the program since it launched last fall.Where the money set aside for athlete wellness as part of the Nike deal — terms of which were not released — is yet to be determined.Leung pointed to the initiatives as proof that the shift in mission she was hired to oversee is beginning to gain traction.“I think that we have hit a point where we are showing very tangible results in this cultural transformation,” Leung said. “And cultural transformation, it can be difficult to measure at times. But I think now we actually have some measures and metrics that we can tie to that transformation.”An internal survey among national team athletes in 2022 revealed that 73% of the 178 athletes who responded believe they have an avenue to “freely express their ideas for change.” Among female artistic gymnasts, 78% said they believe USA Gymnastics has created a “supportive” environment.For Nike, the partnership allies the company with a women's program that will head to Paris with perhaps a gymnastics version of “The Dream Team” U.S. men's basketball team that captured the world's attention during the 1992 Barcelona Games.The easing of name, image and likeness rules at the NCAA level has allowed athletes like Lee, 2020 Olympic floor exercise champion Jade Carey and Olympic silver medalist Jordan Chiles to compete collegiately while cashing in on their success. Interest in NCAA gymnastics has exploded, and the U.S. women — led by Carey and Chiles — dominated the 2022 world championships, winning seven of the 19 medals awarded.The Americans could find themselves standing atop the podium with “The Star-Spangled Banner” playing with regularity in Paris.For Nike, the chance to have those women sporting a “swoosh” on their sweats, their leotards or their shoes as a medal is draped around their neck may outweigh any lingering concerns about being associated with a program once considered toxic at the height of the Nassar case.“A decision to sponsor USA Gymnastics mostly indicates that there is more financial benefit associating with the top world class American athletes in upcoming two Olympic Games, than risk of backlash for being associated with the sexual assault scandal,"" said Yoav Dubinsky, an instructor of sports business at the University of Oregon.Nike did not immediately respond to a series of questions by The Associated Press about what led to the decision to become more deeply involved with USA Gymnastics.Leung believes the increased confidence in the organization by outside entities like Nike comes from the diligent work done at many levels of the organization over the last four-plus years.“(The support) comes from our actions, not our words,” she said. “I think our actions are showing the true tangible results (of what we're doing) from a corporate partnership perspective.”___AP coverage of the Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games]"

These initiatives target the improvement of medical regulation, standardization of clinical studies, enhancement of reimbursement policies, and acceleration of product approval processes, all of which are expected to create profitable growth prospects for the biotechnology sectorDon't Miss: 12 Best Agriculture ETFs To BuyTo name a few hindrances plaguing the biotech industry, EY in a report observed that the 2022 revenue of public biotech companies declined by 1% compared to 2021 due to decreased demand for COVID-19 vaccines and antiviral treatments. 2023 is anticipated to see five patent expirations for well-established biologic products, resulting in a significant loss of revenue. Furthermore, over 20 products, accounting for nearly $200 billion in annual sales, are expected to lose patent protection by 2030. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) experienced a decline in approvals for new molecular entities and biologics license applications in 2022, which was attributed to staffing shortages. However, approvals returned to pre-pandemic levels in Q1 of 2023. Lastly, in 2022, all forms of biotech financing, including venture capital investment, debt financing, IPOs, and follow-on offerings, decreased substantially. According to Ashwin Singhania, Principal at EY-Parthenon: “Innovation is the engine that drives the biotech industry. While the approaching patent cliff is an unavoidable challenge, the pipeline continues to be very robust and the pace of innovation continues to accelerate. If executives can prioritize streamlining processes and the ongoing investment in organic innovation and inorganic growth, they will set themselves up for future success.”Story continuesAlso Read: 12 Best Energy ETFs: Top Oil, Gas and Renewable Energy FundsOn a positive note, RBC Capital Markets predicts that large-cap biotech companies with revenue resilience, less binary risk, and optimistic earnings guidance will maintain momentum in early 2023. While some larger companies have set themselves up for future growth and diversification, 2023 may be a flat earnings year for many large caps due to patent expirations and COVID-19 revenue declines. On the other hand, smaller-cap biotechs, though recovering from mid-year lows, have underperformed compared to larger and mid-cap biotechs and pharma. However, some high-quality, catalyst-driven smaller-cap companies are forecasted to perform well in 2023, driven by increasing regulatory permissiveness and potential M&amp;A activity. M&amp;A activity is also expected to rise as large biopharma companies sit on strong balance sheets, face patent cliffs, and experience better policy clarity. This potential uptick in M&amp;A could act as a catalyst for biotech stocks, driving growth and diversification among larger-cap companies facing challenges.Some of the best biotech stocks to invest in include Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Pfizer Inc.

Never be left in the dust again.Apple sales disappoint despite earnings beatApple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) were down 1.7% in premarket trading Friday after the iPhone maker reported its third consecutive quarterly sales drop, even though fiscal third-quarter results topped estimates.iPhone revenue, which makes up nearly half of total revenue, fell to $39.67 billion from $40.67B a year earlier, missing estimates of $39.91B. And revenue overall totaled $81.B - better than the $81.73 consensus, but down from $83B a year earlier.Strength in Apple's services business helped offset the soft iPhone sales: Revenue from Apple News, Apple TV+, and iCloud, among other service units, grew to $21.21B from $19.60B a year earlier, ahead of estimates of $20.76B.As for its bottom line, earnings per share came to $1.26, also topping estimates for $1.19.Regarding the iPhone softness, in the earnings call, CFO Luca Maestri said the company expects iPhone and services performance to ""accelerate from the June quarter"" year over year. He also predicted more double-digit declines in Mac and iPad sales, ""particularly on the Mac,"" due to difficult comparisons vs. the prior year.In fiscal Q3, iPad revenue fell by 20% to $5.79B year-on-year in Q3. missing Wall Street estimates of $6.41B.After the report, Morgan Stanley trimmed Apple's price target to $215 from the prior $220 while maintaining its Overweight rating on the stock. Barclays, for its part, raised the tech giant's price target to $167 from the prior $149, keeping its Equalweight rating.AMD slips on concerns around AI exuberanceAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) on Tuesday came in a penny better than consensus on EPS and edged out revenue estimates, while also delivering above-par Q3 guidance.Story continuesBut shares fell 7% in the next session amid a broader tech selloff amid analyst concerns. Bernstein said it fears estimates ""remain too high"" amid optimism around AI ""and the stock... looks a little stretched to us,"" according to Reuters.Oppenheimer was also cautious, writing:""Difficult to confidently model given lack of design-wins and/or timeline. [Gross margin] expected to improve 130 [basis points] to 51% in 3Q (mix). We remain sidelined as AMD’s AI strategy proves out.""CEO Lisa Su, meanwhile, said the company's artificial intelligence (AI) engagements climbed by more than seven times ""as multiple customers initiated or expanded programs supporting future deployments of Instinct accelerators at scale.""The company earned $0.58 per share in the second quarter on $5.4B in revenue vs. Wall Street expectations for $0.57 and $5.32B, respectively, per analysts polled by InvestingPro.Data Center sales declined 11% year over year to $1.3B, mainly attributed to lower sales of AMD's 3rd Gen EPYC processor, while Client revenue plummeted 54% to $998 million amid a slump in processor shipments due to a weaker PC market and a significant inventory correction across the PC supply chain.Citi, for its part, upgraded AMD to Buy from Neutral after these results, bumping its price target by $16 to $136 per share.""We thought AMD’s AI products (MI300) would be margin dilutive and investors would eventually care about the expensive valuation on AMD, and we were wrong on both counts,"" the analysts said.Shares partially recovered on Thursday, rising 3.5% to $113.15.Starbucks comes in ahead, but concedes challenging backdropStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) beat earnings estimates even as global comparable sales missed amid signs of slackening demand for the coffeehouse giant's drinks and food in North America.Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.00, topping InvestingPro consensus estimates of $0.95, thanks to a sharp recovery in sales in China. That also represented a 23.4% rise from the prior year. Tapering commodity costs also offset the impact of spending on wages and worker benefits, boosting profit margin for the quarter ended July 2 up to 17.4%.Comparable store sales in North America grew by 7%, missing expectations. On a global basis, comparable sales at Starbucks grew by 10%, below analysts' projections for an 11.1% jump.Speaking to investors following the earnings, executives at Starbucks flagged that they expect to see continued revenue pressure in the fourth quarter due in part to a normalization in pricing trends after several months of price increases.KeyBanc believes the company should be well-positioned thanks to its ""scale, best-in-class digital platform, innovation competencies, and forward-thinking business mentality,"" but that ""the operating environment remains challenged.""Stifel said it is ""encouraged by the continued momentum in the U.S. business and the faster-than-expected pace of recovery in China during F2Q,"" but it maintained its Hold rating on the stock and lowered its price target by $7 to $110. The analyst added, ""We would prefer a better entry point given the risks of softening consumer spending later this year and near-term setbacks in the pace of the China recovery.""Shares ticked higher by 0.9% Wednesday.Pfizer beats, but sales slideFinally, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) on Tuesday slipped 1.3% after the pharma giant reported better-than-expected Q2 results, but also said revenue plummeted amid a major decline in COVID-related sales.The company also cut its full-year revenue guidance warning of “near-term revenue challenges"": It now expects sales of between $67B-$70B, with the high end trimmed by $1B vs. the prior range. Analysts are looking for $61B.For Q3, Pfizer booked a profit per share of $0.67 on revenue of $12.7B, beating the analyst consensus for $0.57 on revenue of $12.08B, per analysts polled by InvestingPro.The company sees full-year EPS at $3.35, better than the Street's $3.01 expectation.CEO Dr. Albert Bourla said the company looks forward to ""continuing our progress in the second half of 2023.""After these numbers, several firms - including JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo - maintained their neutral ratings on the stock, with price targets ranging between $38 and $40.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Fox's current trading price of US$33.33 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Fox’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Fox What Is Fox Worth?According to my valuation model, Fox seems to be fairly priced at around 9.25% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Fox today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $30.51, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. In addition to this, Fox has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.What does the future of Fox look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 31% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Fox. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? FOXA’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor?

However, markets turned higher mid-morning amid a busy batch of economic data and earnings reports.One of the more notable headlines to emerge from today's jam-packed economic calendar was that worker productivity increased 3.7% in the second quarter, while unit labor costs rose at their slowest annual pace since 2021.""Labor productivity, while still weaker than in previous cycles, recovered during the second quarter of the year and has continued to push down unit labor costs,"" says Eugenio Alemán, chief economist at Raymond James. This is good news for the Fed, the economist adds, as it ""weakens the argument that labor costs are a threat to the disinflationary process going forward.""In other econ news, ahead of tomorrow's key July jobs report, data from the Labor Department showed that initial jobless claims rose by just 6,000 last week to 221,000. The figures reveal a resilient labor market, and it's likely tomorrow's payrolls data will show more of the same.""Job growth tends to remain strong in July when the labor market is tight – reflecting strong hiring of youth summer workers – and three of the alternative measures of employment growth we track indicate a strong pace of job growth,"" says Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs.PayPal, Qualcomm stocks sink after earningsAs for today's earnings reports, PayPal Holdings (PYPL) fell 12.3% after the fintech firm disclosed its second-quarter results. While PayPal beat on both the top and bottom lines, its adjusted operating margin of 21.4% fell short of company guidance.Still, Argus Research analyst Stephen Biggar maintained a Buy rating on the financial stock. ""We expect PayPal to benefit over time from secular trends that have boosted growth for credit card processors, such as the increasing use of digital payments over checks and cash for both convenience and security,"" Biggar says. Additionally, the analyst expects PYPL to expand its market share as ""the company leverages its platforms globally and takes advantage of its strong brand recognition and rapid growth in merchant acceptance.""Story continuesQualcomm (QCOM) was another stock that declined despite reporting higher-than-expected earnings and revenue. The semiconductor stock fell 8.2% after Akash Palkhiwala, chief financial officer of Qualcomm, said on the earnings call that revenue growth in its upcoming fiscal year ""will largely depend on macroeconomic environment, global handset units and [a slower] China recovery.""Energy stocks pop on Saudi Arabia newsEnergy was the best-performing sector today, jumping 1.0% as U.S. crude futures climbed 2.6% to $81.55 per barrel.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for International Business Machines The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At International Business MachinesIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the CFO and Senior VP of Finance &amp; Operations, James Kavanaugh, sold US$5.2m worth of shares at a price of US$134 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$144. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 30% of James Kavanaugh's holding.All up, insiders sold more shares in International Business Machines than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Story continuesInsider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It appears that International Business Machines insiders own 0.07% of the company, worth about US$98m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About International Business Machines Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded International Business Machines shares in the last quarter. We don't take much encouragement from the transactions by International Business Machines insiders. The modest level of insider ownership is, at least, some comfort. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that International Business Machines has 4 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore these.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while revenues missed. Earnings declined on a year-over-year basis, while sales improved.Top and bottom-line growth reflected business momentum, owing to relentless execution, investment in its brands and accelerated digital transformation. Results also benefited from continued consumer demand for its brand portfolio. Backed by the ongoing business momentum, the company retained its view for 2023.Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 4.6% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 1.2%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Q2 HighlightsAB InBev reported underlying EPS (normalized EPS, excluding mark-to-market gains and losses related to the hedging of share-based payment programs, and the impacts of hyperinflation) of 72 cents in second-quarter 2023, down 1.4% from the 73 cents earned in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 66 cents.Revenues of $15,120 million improved 2.2% from the year-ago quarter. However, revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,329 million. The company registered organic revenue growth of 7.2%, primarily driven by robust revenue per hectoliter (hl) growth and improvement across more than 85% of its markets. Revenues benefited from pricing actions, continued premiumization and other revenue-management initiatives. Accelerated digital transformation also contributed to top-line growth in the quarter.Revenues reflected strong performances of its three global brands — Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois — which advanced 18.4% outside their home markets in the second quarter.Revenue per hl was up 9% on an organic basis, backed by revenue-management initiatives, the expansion of the beer category across the company’s key markets and premiumization efforts. However, the company’s total organic volume declined 1.4% as growth across most of the markets was offset by a decline in the United States. The total organic volume included a 1.8% decline in the own-beer volume, offset by 0.5% growth in the non-beer volume.Story continuesAnheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAnheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV QuoteAB InBev has been keen on making the most of investments in its portfolio over the years, as well as rapidly growing its digital platform, including BEES and Zé Delivery. The company’s digital transformation initiatives have been on track, with the B2B digital platforms contributing about 64% of its revenues in the second quarter. The company noted that the monthly active user base of BEES reached 3.3 million users as of Jun 30, 2023. Its omnichannel direct-to-consumer ecosystem generated more than $385 million in revenues in second-quarter 2023.The company has been focused on expanding its Beyond Beer portfolio, which has also been aiding the top line. Notably, the Beyond Beer portfolio contributed more than $385 million to the total revenues in second-quarter 2023.The cost of sales increased 3.3% on a reported basis and 9.2% on an organic basis to $7,019 million in the second quarter.The company’s normalized earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were $4,909 million, which fell 3.7% year over year on a reported basis and improved 5% on an organic basis. The normalized EBITDA margin contracted 190 basis points (bps) on a reported basis and 69 bps organically to 32.5%. The decline in organic EBITDA can be attributed to commodity cost headwinds and increased sales and marketing investments.SG&amp;A expenses declined 4.6% year over year to $4,707 million but increased 9.4% on an organic basis. Higher SG&amp;A expenses can be attributed to elevated supply-chain costs.OutlookFor 2023, AB InBev expects year-over-year EBITDA growth of 4-8%, in line with its medium-term outlook. It anticipates revenue growth to be higher than EBITDA growth, driven by strong volume and pricing.The company expects net pension interest expenses and accretion expenses of $200-$230 million, based on currency and interest rate fluctuations. It anticipates an average gross debt coupon of 4% for 2023.Management anticipates a normalized effective tax rate of 27-29% for 2023. Net capital expenditure is projected to be $4.5-$5 billion for 2023, driven by higher investments in innovation and other consumer-centric initiatives to fuel the ongoing momentum.Stocks to ConsiderWe highlighted some better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Molson Coors TAP, The Duckhorn Portfolio NAPA and The Boston Beer Company SAM.Molson Coors currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

While consumer boycotts of Bud Light over an ad featuring trans personality Dylan Mulvaney tanked revenue and sales in the U.S., operating profits ticked up and sales volumes in foreign markets grew.Yahoo Finance Live's Julie Hyman and Myles Udland compare AB InBev's earnings narrative with the consumer narrative seen in U.S. sales.Video Transcript- Shares of AB InBev are up slightly this morning, up about 2%. Thanks to better than expected earnings. The Bud Light owner beat forecasts with a 7.2% increase in total revenue for the quarter. It was boosted by strong overseas sales in the Asia-Pacific market. But US sales did take a hit thanks to that boycott drama, following Bud Light's partnership with trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney, revenue in North America was down by 10.5%. EBITDA was down by 28%.- So obviously, a big tumble there. But if you look at earnings and other regions here, overall adjusted earnings were up 5%. Brazil, China and Colombia saw earnings rise 20%. So this really was a US problem. And I won't say just a US problem, because US is a huge market for them. So it's not like it's a small problem, but it was a limited one.- It is a relatively smaller problem for the overall AB InBev portfolio than perhaps, it seems when there is almost-- well not almost, there is weekly data that comes out on how much volumes are down for the Bud Light portfolio or the Budweiser portfolio is really the way it's phrased, in the US. Because it's about 18% by volume. North America is about 18% of the overall AB InBev worldwide volume. So 9.5% volume growth in its Asian market.So that, I mean, overall volumes are down 1.4% in the quarter against last year. So you are still seeing an impact overall there. But there are pieces of the business that I think investors can get themselves excited about, certainly this morning. And ultimately, when you look at the way the stock has behaved this year, it has been a laggard in a market where everyone's getting excited about everything. And you are able to now maybe say, we can make sense of what is happening in this pocket of the business.Story continuesWe understand why the US business is going to be challenged in all these different ways. But you know, I mean, another part of this portfolio in this trade is in the US, what has been the riser against Bud Light's fall? It's been Modelo. Well AB InBev doesn't have the US distribution rights, but they do have the rights in Mexico. And so as the Modelo brand on a global basis perhaps picks up some slack from Budweiser and Bud Light and related kind of plays there, they have the international play on that.Constellation gets the US benefit. But internationally, and you know AB InBev called it out in their call, they are getting some of that lift elsewhere.- Well, and the other thing I thought was interesting is they said that the market share losses in the US in Bud Light pretty much stopped at the end of April. That April to June was steady.- Mm-hmm.- So will they ever get that market share back? Maybe not. But maybe it's also not going to get worse. And you just have this resetting of expectations that have been priced into the stock to your point.- Yeah. I mean, I think, there's probably-- maybe it's kind of a two-part story now where investors say, all right, I understand what happened here. I can make sense of it as an investor. I can get excited about those kinds of things. You buy back stock, pay a dividend, et cetera, et cetera. But there's an operational problem maybe where, OK, you had the number one beer in the US, and now you have the third or fourth whatever it is. I'm not sure if there's segment or we've seen some marketing exactly.There are going to be ramifications I think at the corporate level. But for an investor story, for a stock that's down 6% when the S&amp;P is up, 20% basically so far this year, that impact perhaps has maybe been felt to the most extreme event for investors and then the fallout will kind of come elsewhere in the business.- Right. My random thought of the morning from a marketing perspective, how do you decide if you're going with L-I-G-H-T or L-I-T-E, a La, Bud Light versus Miller Lite. I don't know the answer to that.- That's been baked for a long time. So I'll ask someone from the 60s or whatever when they made that decision.- OK. I'll do that.]"

This is compared to a 11,932 MW backlog as of the Company's first quarter 2023 earnings call on May 5, 2023.In year-to-date 2023, the Company completed 786 MW of wind, solar and energy storage and expects to complete a total of 3.4 GW by year-end 2023.AES Indiana filed its first rate case since 2018, and expects to receive regulatory approval by the middle of 2024. During the second quarter of 2023, AES Indiana filed for approval to build a 200 MW, or 800 MWh, energy storage facility at the site of the retiring Petersburg coal plant and expects to receive approval by the end of 2023. The facility is expected to come online by the end of 2024, at which point it will be the largest battery storage project in the Midwest.The Company expects to receive approval for AES Ohio's new Electric Security Plan (ESP4) by the end of August 2023, with new distribution rates effective immediately.During the second quarter of 2023, the Company continued to make progress toward exiting coal by year-end 20258:Guidance and Expectations9,10The Company is reaffirming its 2023 guidance for Adjusted EBITDA9 of $2,600 to $2,900 million, and its expectation for annualized growth in Adjusted EBITDA9 of 3% to 5% through 2027, from a base of its reaffirmed 2023 guidance.  Excluding the Company's Energy Infrastructure SBU, annualized growth in Adjusted EBITDA9 is expected to be 17% to 20% through 2027, from a base of 2023 guidance.The Company is reaffirming its 2023 guidance for Adjusted EPS10 of $1.65 to $1.75.  Growth in 2023 is expected to be primarily driven by new renewables expected to come online.  This growth is expected to be partially offset by lower margins from the Company's LNG business, due to normalization of LNG prices and the roll-off of a gas supply contract, lower contract margins in Chile, and higher interest expense in Colombia.The Company is reaffirming its annualized growth target for Adjusted EPS10 of 6% to 8% through 2027, from a base of its reaffirmed 2023 guidance of $1.65 to $1.75.  The Company is also reaffirming its annualized growth target for Adjusted EPS10 of 7% to 9% through 2025, from a base year of 2020.The Company's 2023 guidance is based on foreign currency and commodity forward curves as of June 30, 2023.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresSee Non-GAAP Measures for definitions of Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted Pre-Tax Contribution, and Adjusted EBITDA, as well as reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.AttachmentsCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Segment Information, Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Parent Financial Information.Conference Call InformationAES will host a conference call on Friday, August 4, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET).  Interested parties may listen to the teleconference by dialing 1-833-470-1428 at least ten minutes before the start of the call.

before interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding the impact of NCI and interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of our equity affiliates, adding back interest income recognized under service concession arrangements, and excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; and (f) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the Energy Infrastructure SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence. Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes is defined as Adjusted EBITDA, adding back the pre-tax effect of Production Tax Credits (""PTCs""), Investment Tax Credits (""ITCs""), and depreciation tax expense allocated to tax equity investors.The GAAP measure most comparable to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes is net income. We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes better reflect the underlying business performance of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA is the most relevant measure considered in the Company's internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segments. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions or equity securities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments, strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, the non-recurring nature of the impact of the early contract terminations at Angamos, and the variability of allocations of earnings to tax equity investors, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, each of these metrics represent the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes should not be construed as alternatives to net income, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.Three Months Ended June 30,Six Months Ended June 30,Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA (in millions)2023202220232022Net income (loss)$                 (19)$            (136)$                 170$                  35Income tax expense (benefit)(2)(19)7041Interest expense310279640537Interest income(131)(95)(254)(170)Depreciation and amortization277264550534EBITDA$                435$             293$              1,176$                977Less: Adjustment for noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries (1)(155)(156)(325)(312)Less: Income tax expense (benefit), interest expense (income) and depreciation andamortization from equity affiliates27236657Interest income recognized under service concession arrangements18203639Unrealized derivative and equity securities losses (gains)32(34)(7)8Unrealized foreign currency losses32386420Disposition/acquisition losses16231332Impairment losses164479173480Loss on extinguishment of debt——16Adjusted EBITDA$                569$             686$              1,197$             1,307Tax attributes allocated to tax equity investors38365149Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes (2)$                607$             722$              1,248$             1,356(1) The allocation of earnings to tax equity investors from both consolidated entities and equity affiliates is removed from Adjusted EBITDA.(2) Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes includes the impact of the share of the ITCs, PTCs, and depreciation expense allocated to tax equity investors under the HLBV accounting method and recognized as Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. All of the tax attributes are related to the Renewables SBU.THE AES CORPORATIONNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES(Unaudited)RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED PTC AND ADJUSTED EPSAdjusted PTC is defined as pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits, and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses, and costs due to the early retirement of debt; and (f) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the Energy Infrastructure SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence.  Adjusted PTC also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis adjusted for the same gains or losses excluded from consolidated entities.Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and the tax impact from the repatriation of sales proceeds, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; (f) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the Energy Infrastructure SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence; and (g) tax benefit or expense related to the enactment effects of 2017 U.S. tax law reform and related regulations and any subsequent period adjustments related to enactment effects, including the 2021 tax benefit on reversal of uncertain tax positions effectively settled upon the closure of the Company's U.S. tax return exam.The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted PTC is income from continuing operations attributable to AES. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. We believe that Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS better reflect the underlying business performance of the Company and are considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions or equity securities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments, strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, and the non-recurring nature of the impact of the early contract terminations at Angamos, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, for Adjusted PTC, earnings before tax represents the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS should not be construed as alternatives to income from continuing operations attributable to AES and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which are determined in accordance with GAAP.Three Months EndedJune 30, 2023Three Months EndedJune 30, 2022Six Months EndedJune 30, 2023Six Months EndedJune 30, 2022Net of NCI(1)Per Share(Diluted)Net of NCI(1)Net of NCI(1)Per Share(Diluted)Net of NCI(1)Net of NCI(1)Per Share(Diluted)Net of NCI(1)Net of NCI(1)Per Share(Diluted)Net of NCI(1)(in millions, except per share amounts)Income from continuing operations,net of tax, attributable to AES andDiluted EPS$      (39)$   (0.05)$    (179)$   (0.25)$     112$     0.16$       (64)$    (0.09)Add: Income tax expense fromcontinuing operations attributable to AES(16)(29)3521Pre-tax contribution$      (55)$    (208)$     147$       (43)AdjustmentsUnrealized derivative and equity securities losses (gains)$       33$    0.05(2)$      (35)$   (0.05)(3)$        (6)$    (0.01)(4)$          6$     0.01Unrealized foreign currency losses330.04(5)390.05(6)640.09(7)200.03Disposition/acquisition losses160.02230.03(8)130.02320.04(8)Impairment losses1640.23(9)4790.68(10)1730.24(9)4800.68(10)Loss on extinguishment of debt——60.0140.01160.02Less: Net income tax benefit(0.08)(11)(0.13)(12)(0.08)(11)(0.14)(12)Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS$     191$    0.21$     304$    0.34$     395$     0.43$      511$     0.55(1) NCI is defined as Noncontrolling Interests.(2) Amount primarily relates to recognition of unrealized losses due to the termination of a PPA of $72 million, or $0.10 per share, partially offset by unrealized derivative gains at the Energy Infrastructure SBU of $37 million, or $0.05 per share.(3) Amount primarily relates to the unrealized gain on remeasurement of our existing investment in 5B, accounted for using the measurement alternative, of $26 million, or $0.04 per share.(4) Amount primarily relates to unrealized derivative gains at the Energy Infrastructure SBU of $87 million, or $0.12 per share, partially offset by the recognition of unrealized losses due to the termination of a PPA of $72 million, or $0.10 per share.(5) Amount primarily relates to unrealized foreign currency losses mainly associated with the devaluation of long-term receivables denominated in Argentine pesos of $24 million, or $0.03 per share, and unrealized foreign currency losses at AES Andes due to the depreciating Colombian peso of $15 million, or $0.02 per share.(6) Amount primarily relates to unrealized foreign currency losses on debt in Brazil of $12 million, or $0.02 per share, and unrealized foreign currency losses of $9 million, or $0.01 per share, mainly associated with the devaluation of long-term receivables denominated in Argentine pesos.(7) Amount primarily relates to unrealized foreign currency losses mainly associated with the devaluation of long-term receivables denominated in Argentine pesos of $49 million, or $0.07 per share, and unrealized foreign currency losses at AES Andes due to the depreciating Colombian peso of $31 million, or $0.04 per share.(8) Amount primarily relates to the recognition of an allowance on the AES Gilbert sales-type lease receivable as a cost of disposition of a business interest of $20 million, or $0.03 per share, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022.(9) Amount primarily relates to asset impairments at the Norgener coal-fired plant in Chile of $136 million, or $0.19 per share, and the GAF Projects at AES Renewable Holdings of $18 million, or $0.03 per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.(10) Amount primarily relates to asset impairment at Maritza of $475 million, or $0.67 per share, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022.(11) Amount primarily relates to income tax benefits associated with the asset impairment at the Norgener coal fired plant in Chile of $33 million, or $0.05 per share, and income tax benefits associated with the recognition of unrealized losses due to the termination of a PPA of $18 million, or $0.02 per share, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.(12) Amount primarily relates to income tax benefits associated with the impairment at Maritza of $110 million, or $0.15 per share, partially offset by income tax expense associated with the unrealized gain on remeasurement of our existing investment in 5B of $6 million, or $0.01 per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022. The AES CorporationParent Financial InformationParent only data: last four quarters(in millions)4 Quarters EndedTotal subsidiary distributions &amp;

Subsidiary Distributions should not be construed as an alternative to Consolidated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, which is determined in accordance with US GAAP. Subsidiary Distributions are important to the Parent Company because the Parent Company is a holding company that does not derive any significant direct revenues from its own activities but instead relies on its subsidiaries' business activities and the resultant distributions to fund the debt service, investment and other cash needs of the holding company. The reconciliation of the difference between the Subsidiary Distributions and Consolidated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities consists of cash generated from operating activities that is retained at the subsidiaries for a variety of reasons which are both discretionary and non-discretionary in nature. These factors include, but are not limited to, retention of cash to fund capital expenditures at the subsidiary, cash retention associated with non-recourse debt covenant restrictions and related debt service requirements at the subsidiaries, retention of cash related to sufficiency of local GAAP statutory retained earnings at the subsidiaries, retention of cash for working capital needs at the subsidiaries, and other similar timing differences between when the cash is generated at the subsidiaries and when it reaches the Parent Company and related holding companies.(2) Parent Company Liquidity is defined as cash available to the Parent Company, including cash at qualified holding companies (QHCs), plus available borrowings under our existing credit facility. AES believes that unconsolidated Parent Company liquidity is important to the liquidity position of AES as a Parent Company because of the non-recourse nature of most of AES' indebtedness.(3) The cash held at QHCs represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the US. Such subsidiaries have no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to AES, the Parent Company. Cash at those subsidiaries was used for investment and related activities outside of the US. These investments included equity investments and loans to other foreign subsidiaries as well as development and general costs and expenses incurred outside the US.

Another cohort of major utility stocks, including Dominion Energy D, PNM Resources PNM, TransAlta TAC, Evergy EVRG and AES Corp. AES, is set to announce earnings on Aug 2.Factors to ConsiderDomestic-based utility companies are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. Favorable rate revision and customer additions have been creating fresh demand as well as assisting the utilities. Investment in infrastructure strengthening has been allowing utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings. Domestic-focused operations also insulate utilities against the adverse impact of currency fluctuation. These factors are likely to have contributed to this sector’s second-quarter results.Utilities have been aggressively adding more renewable and clean energy sources to their production portfolios, and cutting down the use of coal and other polluting sources in their generation portfolios.  Many utilities have already pledged to provide 100% electricity from clean sources in the next few decades. We expect the second-quarter results from utility companies to reflect such clean energy developments.The utility companies have also been focused on improving productivity and cost structures through investments in digital technologies, integrating key systems and analyzing data to make proper decisions to improve overall operations. They continue to invest smart capital that helps reduce operating and maintenance expenses and fuel costs. This, in turn, helps customers save money on their utility bills. This is likely to get reflected in the customer growth rate for these utility providers in their second-quarter results.However, the fact that utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations, has made their operations difficult in the current interest rate scenario. Thus, the capital-intensive utilities are likely to have experienced higher borrowing costs, thanks to the rise in interest rates from near-zero levels. This, in turn, might have hurt their bottom-line performance. Also, fluctuating weather conditions across major parts of the United States are expected to have unfavorably impacted the utilities’ performance in the April-June quarter.Story continuesQ2 ExpectationsTotal second-quarter earnings and revenues are expected to decline 4.7% and 4.1%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our latest Earnings Outlook.Utilities' Earnings in FocusLet's take a look at the following utility companies that are scheduled to post their quarterly report on Aug 4 and find out how things might have shaped up prior to the announcements.Dominion Energy delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 1.68%.

It wants to make all temporary workers at U.S. automakers permanent, a substantial increase in paid time off and restore retiree health care benefits and cost of living adjustments.UAW President Shawn Fain on Tuesday expressed support for a 32-hour work week, down from the traditional 40 hours.Sources said the union wants the companies to agree to the equivalent of a paid day off per week, at a time of growing trials globally of a four-day working week.GM said a fair agreement would reward employees but also allow the company to retain its momentum now and into the future.""We think it's important to protect U.S. manufacturing and jobs in an industry that is dominated by non-unionized competition,"" GM said.Story continuesThe UAW did not immediately comment on GM's statement.Fain on Tuesday said the union demands were its ""most audacious and ambitious"" proposals in decades.Fain also said the UAW was proposing to have the right to strike over plant closures and to eliminate a two-tier wage system under which veteran hires earn 25% or more than newer employees.

Earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while sales missed the same.Courtesy of solid first-half results and robust trends, management raised its 2023 sales and profit view. Management is on track with the separation of the North America cereal business.Quarter in DetailKellogg reported adjusted earnings of $1.25 per share, which came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11. The bottom line increased by 6% compared with the year-ago quarter’s figure. On a constant currency or cc basis, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased 5% to $1.24.The company recorded net sales of $4,041 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,047.2 million. The top line advanced 4.6% year over year. Net sales growth was backed by favorable price/mix and continued snack momentum.

The upside in sales can be attributed to favorable price/mix, which more than offset the impact of price elasticity and lapping of inventory replenishment from the year-ago quarter’s levels. Net sales increased 3.7% on an organic basis.Revenues in the European segment totaled $669 million, up 11.9% year over year on favorable price/mix and momentum in snacks.

The revised outlook reflects solid first-half results, price/mix growth and a gradual increase in price elasticities.The adjusted operating profit is now expected to rise 9-10% at cc, up from its earlier guidance of 8-10% growth. The outlook reflects efforts toward profit-margin recovery. Management expects the adjusted EPS to decline 1-2% at cc.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Manhattan Associates Inc. MANH, Uber Technologies Inc.'s UBER, Live Nation Entertainment Inc. LYV, United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL and The Trade Desk Inc. TTD.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Fitch Downgrades U.S. Rating: 5 Stocks to Buy on the DipOn Aug 1, Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA. The agency cited ""expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years."" In May, Fitch placed the AAA rating of the nation in the negative watchlist.Fitch expects the general government deficit to rise to 6.3% of U.S. GDP in 2023 from 3.7% in 2022. The agency remained concerned about a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years. Notably, in 2011, S&amp;P had downgraded the U.S. credit rating to AA+ from AAA.Consequently, U.S. stock futures are trading in negative territory. In early morning trading, several key markets of the Asia-Pacific region also traded in the red. However, we believe that any dip in U.S. stock prices following Fitch's sovereign rating downgrade will provide a good opportunity to accumulate stocks.U.S. Economy Remains StrongThe Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that U.S. GDP grew 2.4% in second-quarter 2023 after rising 2% in the first quarter. The U.S. GDP increased 2.6% in fourth-quarter 2022. The second-quarter GDP growth rate eliminates the concerns of a large section of economists and financial researchers that the economy may fall into a recession in the near future.The U.S. labor market remains resilient. Month over month, personal expenditure — the largest driver of GDP — rose 0.5% in June compared with 0.2% in May. The personal savings rate stayed healthy at 4.3%.Story continuesThe inflation rate is dwindling steadily since June 2022. Consequently, the Fed is approaching the end of its ongoing interest rate hike cycle. The central bank is now more confident about the soft landing of the economy.Our Top PicksAt this stage, we have narrowed our search to five large-cap (market capital &gt; $10 billion) growth stocks that have strong potential for the rest of 2023.

I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our second quarter 2023 earnings, recent developments and operating performance.

First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website along with our earnings release and related information. Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and actual results may differ materially from expectations. Our second quarter 2023 Form 10-Q was filed this morning.

I will now turn the call over to Jeff.Story continuesJeffrey B. GuldnerGreat. Thanks, Amanda. Thank you all for joining us today. Although our second quarter financials were negatively impacted by significantly mild weather in June, as well as higher operating expenses. We have updated our full year 2023 guidance to take into account the settlements that was reached between APS and the commission on the SCR matter. Before Andrew goes through the details of our second quarter results and updates to our 2023 full year guidance, I'll just provide a few updates on recent operational and regulatory developments. Starting with operations. As we progress through the summer season, I'm very proud to say that our team continues to excel in delivering reliable service to our customers. The Palo Verde generating stations successfully completed its planned refueling and maintenance outage for Unit 1 on May 13. Additionally, we commissioned the remaining 60 megawatts of energy storage at our AZ Sun sites. So that totals now 201 megawatts of APS-owned storage installed this year and 150 megawatts of APS-owned solar at the Agave solar facility. These are all valuable resources to help serve our customers through the summer season. In fact, while the second quarter was marked by extremely mild weather, as I think all of you probably know, July certainly heated up. Our robust planning, resource procurement efforts and our dedicated team have allowed us to provide exceptional service to our customers throughout this unprecedented heat wave. Phoenix experienced a record number of consecutive days of over 110 degrees, shattering prior records for daytime highs or evening lows for days over 110 degrees, and the APS team served its customers with top-tier reliability throughout it all. In fact, we broke our previous peak demand record multiple times this July, reaching a new all-time record on July 20 at nearly 8,200 megawatts. That's a 500-megawatt increase compared to our prior record that was set in 2020. I want to recognize our operators and our field teams for doing such an exceptional job in making sure that customers continue to have reliable service through this unrelenting heat. As you know, APS plans years in advance to continue serving customers with reliable and affordable energy, our resource planners secure a diverse energy mix to meet demand like solar and wind power, battery energy storage and our APS, Operated Palo Verde Generating Station, which is still the largest nuclear plant in the U.S. and the country's largest producer of clean energy. When temperatures caused demand to increase, APS' strength and resilience comes from using flexible resources like natural gas to keep homes and businesses cool over long stretches of extreme heat. Another important tool that I want to highlight and that we utilize is our Cool Rewards demand response program. It's in its fifth year of operation. That program essentially operates as a virtual power plant where our customers provide over 110 megawatts of flexible clean capacity. The program connects nearly 80,000 APS customers with smart thermostat technology that helps them save money while also playing an integral role in conserving energy when the demand on the electric grid is its highest. This partnership helps us to ensure reliable, uninterrupted service to our customers on the hottest Arizona days, while also assisting us on our journey to 100% clean in carbon-free electricity by 2050. So you see we've taken all of the above approach to provide the most affordable and reliable service when our customers need us the most. And as part of our vigorous planning, we recently issued an all-source RFP for another 1,000 megawatts to be online between 2026 and 2028. We're seeking the best combination of resources to serve our customers reliably while not sacrificing affordability and continuing to build towards our clean energy future. Additionally, we continue to remain focused on providing exceptional customer service. Our J.D. Power JDP residential rankings for overall customer satisfaction have steadily improved over the past 2 years. And I'm proud to share that the latest JDP residential 2023 2nd quarter results have placed us back in the first quartile compared to our peers. APS is the strongest performing drivers in the latest survey where customer care, both phone and digital power quality and reliability and corporate citizenship. We've made remarkable progress over the past few years moving from fourth quartile to first and that progress would not have happened without the dedication and commitment of our hard-working employees across the company. I look forward to continuing to provide exemplary service to our customers in the future. Turning to our regulatory updates. Last quarter, I spoke about the appeal of our last rate case and the favorable Court of Appeals decision. The commission directed its legal staff to enter into negotiations with the company. And in June, we reached an agreement with the commission legal staff on how to implement that decision. The joint resolution was then approved at the June open meeting, and it created a court resolution surcharge that started on July 1. We're pleased that we were able to reach an agreement with the commission in a reasonable and expeditious manner to resolve this issue. And as I've mentioned previously, the Four Corners Power Plant is a critically important reliability asset for the entire Southwest. And the investment in SCRs was required to keep that plant running under Federal Law. Andrew will address the financial impacts from this decision here in a few minutes. On our rate case, we are almost done with all rounds of written testimony. Our rejoinder testimony is due tomorrow. The hearing is scheduled to begin on August 10. And we look forward to working through that process and resolving this rate case in a timely and constructive manner. We made solid progress through the first half of this year, improving our customer experience, enhancing our stakeholder relationships and executing on our regulatory matters. There's certainly more work to do, but I think this is a good opportunity to acknowledge the team's dedication and early accomplishments here in 2023. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.Andrew D. CooperThank you, Jeff, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. This morning, we released our second quarter 2023 financial results. I will first review those results, which were negatively impacted by extremely mild weather and provide some additional details on the various drivers for the quarter. I will also provide an update to full year 2023 guidance. We earned $0.94 per share this quarter, down $0.51 compared to the second quarter last year. Weather specifically during the month of June was the primary driver for the lower year-over-year results. June of 2023 was the mildest since 2009 with an average daily temperature slightly below 90 degrees. This resulted in a $0.25 year-over-year drag from weather compared to Q2 last year, which was -- which notably included an above-average contribution from June 2022's hot weather. Higher O&amp;M, interest expense and depreciation and amortization and lower pension and OPEB nonservice credits were other negative drivers, partially offset by higher transmission revenues and LFCR revenues. O&amp;M was $0.21 higher year-over-year or $0.14, excluding RES and DSM. We have experienced year-over-year increases to most of our O&amp;M categories due to inflation and high customer growth. We have seen inflationary impacts in areas, including chemicals, materials, insurance and wage rates. Of the $0.14 Q2 headwind, O&amp;M associated with our generation fleet constitutes $0.10. And for the first half of the year, generation fleet O&amp;M has been a $0.21 drag. Prioritizing the needs of our generation fleet to ensure reliability for customers has been essential to our summer preparedness strategy. The importance of this prioritization was as clear as ever as our team successfully ran our fleet during the month of July. In addition, as Jeff mentioned, July weather was record-breaking. And similar to past years, the weather benefits have allowed us to flex up to derisk future spending. Based on the O&amp;M trends we are seeing, we are increasing our O&amp;M guidance range for 2023 to $915 million to $935 million. Importantly, even with this update, we anticipate our O&amp;M per megawatt hour to be flat to last year, and we maintain our goal of declining O&amp;M per megawatt hour into the future. We continue to look for opportunities to create efficiencies, reduce risk and keep our costs low to maintain affordable rates for our customers. Turning now to customer growth. We continue to be in line with expectations. Customer growth remains at 2% for the second quarter. The fundamentals for customer growth remains strong in our service territory, and Arizona continues to be a popular migration destination. Redfin.com noted in May that Phoenix [Lebination] in housing markets its users were most interested in moving into. The cost of living in Arizona and the Phoenix Metro area still compare favorably to many Western markets. So we continue to project steady population growth and corresponding APS customer growth largely driven by net migration. However, weather normalized sales growth for the quarter was 0.1% compared to last year. Although we continue to see steady C&amp;I sales growth, which came in at 2.2% for the second quarter this year versus last year. Overall sales growth has been slower than originally anticipated. We continue to monitor our extra high load factor customers as they ramp up. And in fact, Taiwan Semiconductor recently announced a delay in the opening of their first chip factory. With the flat year-over-year sales growth in the quarter and slower ramp-up of these larger customers, we are revising our sales growth guidance range to 2% to 4% for 2023. Because sales from these larger customers contribute a lower margin, the change to our sales growth guidance has a disproportionately smaller impact to earnings expectations. Over the longer term, we continue to forecast a strong contribution to sales growth from advanced manufacturing and other large customers though the variable remains the speed of their ramp-up. Turning to our 2023 guidance for EPS. With the approval by the commission of the joint resolution of the 2019 rate case appeal, on July 1, we began collecting a corresponding surcharge with an annualized impact of approximately $52.5 million. This surcharge includes both a prospective and historical portion and is collected through a per kilowatt hour charge. Taking all financial drivers into account, including this additional revenue, July temperatures but normalized weather thereafter, anticipated lower sales growth and the higher O&amp;M trends mentioned earlier, we now expect our new EPS guidance range to be $4.10 to $4.30 per share for the year. We look forward to continuing to execute on our strategy and on the next phases of our pending rate case process. This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions). Your first question is coming from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.Dariusz LoznyThis is Dariusz on for Julien. Just wanted to start off on the rate case, if I could. Staff obviously came out with a recent round of testimony and specifically, the generation rider that you've proposed and revised during the course of the rate case. Just wondering if you could comment on staff latest views there. And in the event that, that rider isn't ultimately supported by the commission in this rate case outcome, how that might affect your procurement/capital strategy going forward?Jeffrey B. GuldnerDariusz, this is Jeff. Let me start with kind of the context of the rider. It came up in the Tucson Electric rate case ultimately didn't make it into the administrative law judges, recommendation. That case is going to open meeting here pretty quickly. We have filed it and we're going to continue to advocate for it because we think it's an appropriate way of addressing regulatory lag. And you can see with just the growth that we're seeing, the need for that additional generation and need to have that balance between not just PPAs, but some that we can more directly control and really control the deployment of that capital. That as well as the ability to find a mechanism that we can flow through the production tax credits is going to be important. So we think there's good reasons to continue to advocate for it. I think what you're seeing that is still modestly encouraging is that there is an interest from staff in understanding the value and, and the concept. And so that's really what the hearing process, I think, is going to give us an opportunity to do is to advocate and explain why this makes sense in the context of where we are. And I'd be more concerned if it was pretty just a flat no, we're not interested. And I think you can see from the testimony and from the dialogue in the Tucson case that there is an interest in understanding it. We're not quite there yet, and I hope that we'll have an opportunity at hearing to really explain why we see significant value in moving forward with this and not just coming back in which is your other alternative is you come right back in another rate case pretty quickly if there's not a way to address this kind of -- the regulatory lag that comes from getting those plants into service, but not into rates efficiently. Andrew, you want to talk maybe on the capital?Andrew D. CooperSure, Dariusz, it's Andrew. To date, going back to the last rate case, we've been reluctant to bring forward our projects that have been cost competitive with the market because of the question around recovery. And the SRB, as Jeff talked about, really would be an important tool to help us think about taking what's been less than maybe 20% of the megawatts that we've been procuring over the last couple of years and increase that number. Ultimately, we're going to make the investments that we need to make for reliability. And the two projects that are in our post test year plant that relate to our generation fleet, Jeff talked about, those were commissioned this summer, our Agave solar project as well as the batteries at our AZ Sun sites. Those were projects that were commissioned for this summer, and those were really critical. And as some of the developers we work with have supply chain delays and some of those challenges, our ability to deliver, I think, has been highlighted through those post tester plants. So we'll continue to look at ways to reduce lag and ultimately make the decisions that we need to make around capital from our perspective to make sure that we're delivering each summer as we've seen these increasing peak demand numbers.Dariusz LoznyGreat. I appreciate that. One more, if I could. I just wanted to come back to the generation related O&amp;M spending that Andrew highlighted in the opening remarks. Specifically, how do you see that shaping up for the back half of the year, just given the amount that you have to run the generation resources, obviously, during this extremely hot weather. Do you anticipate that there's sort of some additional catch-up O&amp;M, if you will, in the latter part of the year? And then related, assuming the weather normalizes in '24 or thereafter, do you see that as an opportunity to flex down that O&amp;M in future periods.Andrew D. CooperYes, Dariusz. So taking the first part of that. So the guidance range that we updated today incorporate anticipated O&amp;M kind of across the year. And so we've seen in the first half of the year absolutely the generation fleet. And from this July, there'll certainly be continued needs. And so we've anticipated those. And frankly, have in part used the benefit of July weather to look at the rest of the year and think about what are the needs we have and where are the pressure points? And if weather were to continue to be a factor for the rest of the year, absolutely making sure that we could generate support the generation fleet, both Palo Verde as well as our traditional fleet. It's definitely part of the calculus. And so then when you think about weather for the rest of the year, post July, which we've incorporated at this point and has been part of strategically thinking about O&amp;M every year, at the end of the summer, we look at our O&amp;M opportunity set and risk set for the remainder of the year and into the next calendar year and think about where we could flex our muscle around pull forward derisking. And so we'll do that to the upside and downside as the year goes on. We're comfortable with the new O&amp;M range that we've set out based on where we are, the decisions we've made, effectively, conversations that we normally have in October once you've looked at the full summer, we're making those earlier. So we're comfortable with the range that we're in. And certainly, as we have weather, as we have continued wear and tear on our generation fleet, we've accommodated that within the current range.OperatorYour next question is coming from Alex Mortimer from Mizuho.Alexander MortimerWith the dual tailwind of new rates next year and the load increase that was expected this year materializing more in '24, how should we think about the linearity of earnings in '24 and '25 and beyond kind of within the long-term growth rate should we expect to be at the higher end of the 5% to 7%? Or should we think that there could potentially be more of a onetime step-up in '24 given coming out of the rate case?Andrew D. CooperYes, Alex, we are definitely focused on the tools that we have at our disposal to create more linear, predictable earnings stream within that 5% to 7% growth rate. And so we're comfortable with the 5% to 7% rate certainly, we'll be updating all of the key drivers of our financial performance after the rate case concludes. Inevitably, given the outcome of the 2019 rate case and the financial reset there, rate relief will be a meaningful driver of our growth over the medium term. It's hard to avoid that fact. However, the work we're doing around how do we manage O&amp;M within the context of weather from year to year. How do we push for more capital to be tracked so we can create more rate gradualism for customers, but also more linearity for shareholders. Those are the levers within our control that we're trying to deliver within that long-term EPS growth rate range a little bit more of a predictable track within it. Ultimately, doing the things that are within our control and managing costs as best we can.Alexander MortimerUnderstood. Has there been any discussion internally about how to potentially think of a new base year for the long-term growth rate, given the increased clarity and potential step up, we'll see following the resolution of the case later this year?Andrew D. CooperYes. Alex, that's all, I think, a conversation that we could have after the rate case. Ultimately, over the long term, we want to be able to, through a linear earnings stream, create a long-term earnings growth rate that isn't based on a base here. That is a continuous product of more predictable, less regulatory lag. And so those are the things that we're focused on to create that. So it becomes less about a specific base here. But as far as updating from our current 5% to 7% of 2022 weather normalized guidance, that's a conversation we can have after the rate case.OperatorYour next question is coming from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.Paul PattersonI apologize if I just -- I wanted to sort of just follow up again on the rate case. In the past, you guys were thinking that was potential that there'd be a settlement. And I'm just sort of wondering where things maybe stand with respect to that potential given that we've had so many filings now and what have you?Jeffrey B. GuldnerYes. We're -- as we mentioned, we're just here a day away from filing rejoiner testimony. So you got five rounds of testimony and the hearing scheduled to start in a week or so. So the likelihood that a settlement would sort of come up from there is low. We continue and we always look for opportunities to narrow issues or for opportunities to engage in a conversation around that. But I think right now, it certainly seems like we're moving towards hearing. I will say if you can follow on the testimony and the intervenors and the physicians on this case, but this is much more what I call a traditional rate case. It's a lot more fewer issues that's the more traditional things that are coming. So I think that, that is positive in terms of where the case has evolved to.Paul PattersonYes, it's a notable change from the last one. I agree with that. I wanted to also just sort of ask you, I've never been to Arizona in the summer, and there's a lot of national media coverage of the recent heat wave. And I don't know whether or not it's being over dramatized or not, but it sounds like kind of extreme. And I'm just wondering, A, sort of your take on it because you guys are native, so to speak, or at least close to it. And, B, I know you mentioned it doesn't seem to have impacted your outlook for growth. But just -- I mean, I don't need to sort of check off the list of sort of horrors that they're describing in terms of people getting burned by just sitting on the sidewalk or I'm talking about like the cactus is dying kind of thing. Could you sort of just give a little more perspective on that?Jeffrey B. GuldnerYes. I mean it's clearly a concern when you get into prolonged stretches of this. We've had -- we had a hotter day number of years ago. I think the still record high day was actually quite a while ago. But it's the persistence of this heat wave that I think has really sort of challenged the policy makers. But the important thing to remember is that the heat and the desert in the summer is not new to us. And so there have been certainly cases where you've had multiple days in the north of 115, where you get the same kind of issues about being safe outside, making sure that you don't make contact with the pavement. The most important thing, I think, that the policymakers here are doing a nice job of is trying to address the unsheltered population. We've got, for example, [Poland] air conditioner program where we can help support through the foundation for senior living. People getting air conditioner repairs because those are where it gets really dangerous. If you're just in a home with an air conditioner, people are kind of used to this, I think, but it's certainly something that you need to look at from a resilience standpoint in ensuring that as you continue to see longer periods of hot weather that we've got the resilience to be able to navigate that. But people are still moving here. It's still a very I think it's still the fastest-growing county in the U.S. So I don't think the heat deters them, and it's kind of similar to what you do with in the Northeast and the Upper Midwest where you've got the really cold winters, you just got to know how to adapt to it.OperatorYour next question is coming from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.Jamieson Alexander WardIt's Jamieson Ward on for Shahriar. Just a quick one on the pension front. Just leaving 2023 aside for the moment. If we were to assume that the final order reflects the pension-related adjustments from your rebuttal testimony. Just thinking about the roughly $20 million or so improvement there. What impact would you expect that to have going forward on pension-related EPS drag, just thinking about the amortization outside of the corridor rule from last year's impact really.Andrew D. CooperYes, Jamieson. So just to step back, we do have that drag now from the end of 2022 when we took into account the rapid increase in interest rates in '22, which affects both our fixed income portfolio as well as the interest costs associated with our pension. So we have that drag which year-over-year is in the 30-some-odd range, and you see it this quarter as you've seen in prior quarters. And so one of the things we did say to the investment community is we wanted to reduce the lag associated with the pension expense and more properly reflect the test year expense because we didn't know those numbers when we filed our direct case. And so on rebuttal, as you alluded to, we did file to take better account of what the testers should be based on averaging the mark-to-market into '21, mark-to-market end of '22. And as you said, that's about a $20 million benefit. When it comes to the impact there, that isn't going to be something that flows through pension accounting. That's something that's going to flow through the revenue requirements and through customer charges. So that will be -- if it is approved, and we're going to continue to advocate for it through the case, staff did not express support from it and there's a remodel testimony, but it's something we're going to continue to push for. That would just be reflected in the revenue requirement like everything else. However, at the same time, as we do every year, at the end of the year, we're going to have to reevaluate our pension expenses based on expected market returns where discount rates are at that point. And what may, as you said, pass through the corridor and be considered material from the perspective beginning to amortize. But the drag from '22 will remain, and the key is to reduce regulatory lag on the recovery of that through the adjustments and normalization requests that we made on rebuttal.OperatorYour next question is coming from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.Dariusz LoznyIt's Dariusz back on. Just one quick follow-up, if I could. I just wanted to ask about the change in your guidance relative to the effective tax rate. It looks like it ticked up a little bit. And now there's a band versus previously it was a point estimate. Just wondering what drove that.Andrew D. CooperYes. It did, Dariusz very perceptive. So what happened is in the first quarter, when we set guidance, it's slightly below 11% effective tax rate, now it is 12% to 12.5%. And when -- if you recall, when we set that lower effective tax rate, it was based on our anticipated in-service date of projects that generate production tax credits, namely the Agave project. And so the higher tax rate now reflects our better estimate of the in-service date of the project.OperatorThank you. That completes our Q&amp;A session. Everyone, this concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.]"

Other factors included higher operations and maintenance expenses (including increases in non-nuclear generation operating costs and higher transmission, distribution and customer service costs), higher interest charges and lower pension and other postretirement non-service credits.

Given how big an impact air conditioning has on energy use in the low desert, it’s no surprise that our financial results are lower this quarter,"" said Pinnacle West Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Guldner, citing National Weather Service Phoenix data showing that the average June 2023 temperature was almost five degrees cooler than June 2022.""While the heat was slow to get started, it certainly showed up in time for the Fourth of July, and the Phoenix area set a new record for consecutive days above 110 degrees in July. On July 20, the company hit a new all-time peak of 8,193 megawatts,"" said Guldner. ""Thanks to our employees’ impressive planning and operating performance, customers continued to receive the reliable service they count on. This performance – combined with robust customer growth and a resolution to the 2019 rate case appeal in June – puts us in a strong position entering the second half of the year.""Story continuesSummer Is Our SeasonJune 21 may have been the first official day of summer, but employees at Arizona Public Service Co. (APS), the company’s regulated utility and principal subsidiary, work hard year-round to prepare for the season’s heat, wildfire risks and potential storms.As temperatures rise, the company helps customers get ready too. Practical tips and energy-saving strategies can aid in managing monthly electricity bills, from installing a smart thermostat through the Cool Rewards demand response program to using the rate plan comparison tool to ensure customers are on the right plan for their energy use. APS also works with communities at higher fire risk to raise awareness about defensible space and having an emergency plan in place.The company joins forces with local nonprofits to provide heat relief to vulnerable individuals throughout Arizona. In partnership with St. Vincent de Paul, APS helps shelter families through emergency community housing and eviction prevention assistance and supports The Salvation Army’s cooling and hydration stations in nine Arizona counties, among other initiatives.Ensuring adequate energy supply is another important part of our summer readiness, and several projects came online recently, including 141 megawatts (MW) of battery energy storage at AZ Sun solar sites, 150 MW at the Agave Solar Plant and 238 MW of wind energy through a power purchase agreement.Seeking Flexible, Innovative Energy Resources for the FutureAPS not only is focused on serving customers this summer; the company is taking steps to secure energy supply for years to come. In June, APS issued an all-source request for proposal (RFP) seeking project proposals for flexible and innovative resources to serve growing energy needs as more people and businesses continue to move to Arizona.The 2023 all-source RFP seeks approximately 1,000 MW to serve customers with even more around-the-clock energy – enough to power about 150,000 Arizona homes. This solicitation is designed to procure a balanced and diverse portfolio that advances clean energy while maintaining reliability and affordability for customers.""We are seeking the best combination of technologies to serve our customers and deliver value,"" said Guldner. ""Our resource planning team welcomes a variety of proposals and technologies to support a diverse and affordable energy mix for Arizona. That could include new solar plants and battery energy storage, natural gas resources that can transition to clean hydrogen fuel in the future, and other resources that can ramp up quickly to serve customers during triple-digit summer afternoons.""This RFP is focused on projects to serve customers beginning between 2026-2028. To learn more about the 2023 all-source RFP, deadlines and instructions to apply, visit aps.com/rfp.Financial OutlookGiven the positive impact of the 2019 rate case appeal resolution in June and extremely hot weather to start the third quarter – partially offset by higher than previously forecasted operations and maintenance expenses and more moderate weather-normalized sales growth – the company increased its 2023 consolidated earnings range to $4.10 to $4.30 per diluted share on a weather-normalized basis from a previously disclosed range of $3.95 to $4.15 per diluted share.

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quartaro, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Robert QuartaroGood morning, and thank you for joining our third fiscal quarter 2023 earnings call. We issued our press release this morning and posted the accompanying presentation to the Investor Relations section of our website. They can be accessed at ir.westrock.com or via a link on the application you're using to view this webcast. With me on today's call are WestRock's Chief Executive Officer, David Sewell; and our Chief Financial Officer, Alex Pease. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call for a question-and-answer session.During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, projections, targets, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements involve a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we discussed during the call. We describe these assumptions, risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, and our 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2023. We will also be referencing non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. As mentioned previously, the slide presentation is available on our website. With that, I'll turn it over to you, David.Story continuesDavid B. SewellThank you, Rob, and thank you all for joining our earnings call today. I'll begin our call with a review of our fiscal third quarter results and the progress we're making on our self-help initiatives. Following that, Alex will review our results in more detail and provide our outlook for the fourth quarter. Turning to our third quarter results on Slide 3. We exceeded our guidance due to strong execution, productivity gains and moderating impact costs. Net sales were $5.1 billion, and consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $802 million. Adjusted EPS was $0.89. Our strong results this quarter against a dynamic backdrop reflect the resiliency of our business and the tremendous efforts of our talented team members. As a reminder, we faced difficult comparisons with record results in the prior year quarter. While demand for Corrugated Packaging declined year-over-year, our North American shipments per day were sequentially stable. We've seen improvement in July with per day shipments up mid-single digits from the third quarter and the strongest backlogs we've seen all calendar year. Consumer Packaging market volumes were down during the quarter as customers and retailers reduced excess inventory elevated inflation impacted consumer demand, and we lapped strong prior year health care results. Looking forward, we expect improvement in the first half of fiscal 2024, driven by inventory rebalancing, moderating inflation and new business wins. Long-term fundamentals in our Consumer Packaging business remain healthy, and we are well positioned with strong customer relationships and end market are growing. Over time, we expect continued organic growth due to our innovative solutions, growing demand for sustainable packaging and our expanding machinery business. We've seen a moderation in our global paper business after a record year in fiscal 2022. To navigate the current environment, we are leveraging our scale, broad portfolio of substrates and strategic customer relationships. Longer term, we expect our portfolio optimization strategy will enable us to prioritize our strategic customers while reducing our overall exposure to external paper sales. I'm extremely pleased at how our teams are executing and winning new business. Our commercial teams are focused on building growth pipelines and demonstrating the value of our differentiated offerings, all of which are delivering new business wins. Our cost savings progress to date has exceeded expectations, and I'm excited to report that we are on track to exit this fiscal year with more than $450 million in run-rate savings. During the quarter, we achieved $66 million of cost savings and $150 million year-to-date, excluding downtime and inflation. We are making great progress and we see tremendous opportunities ahead, and we continue to optimize our portfolio. Earlier this week, we made the difficult decision with the announcement of the closure of our Tacoma Washington mill. We are working closely with our employees on the transition and expect to cease operations in September. Additionally, we sold our minority interest in a nonstrategic joint venture and also announced the consolidation of 3 additional packaging converting locations bringing our total to 7 through July. I'll provide more details on our portfolio actions in just a moment. Turning to Slide 4. We are laser-focused on unlocking value from our broad portfolio of assets, and we've made tremendous progress already. We continue to target more than $1 billion in cost savings by the end of fiscal 2025, and we are well on our way. Our SG&amp;A reductions, productivity efforts and supply chain efficiencies are delivering significant results. As previously mentioned, we are on track to exit fiscal 2023 with more than $450 million in run-rate savings. We are pleased with the progress we've made, and we remain committed to unlocking further efficiencies in our business. We've been proactively optimizing our footprint by closing less efficient facilities and consolidating production in larger plants. Our goal is to improve our cost structure, drive efficiencies and improve our return on invested capital. Our recent announcement to close our Tacoma mill is another example of this strategy. Similar to our previous mill closures, the Tacoma mill required significant investment to remain competitive and we did not see a path to achieving our return targets. By closing the mill, we can shift capital toward other projects with greater returns. Additionally, with Tacoma and our previous mill closures, we are lowering our costs and improving our overall margin structure. Tacoma's annual production capacity is approximately 510,000 tons including linerboard, white top, kraft paper and pulp. With the closure, we plan to ship the majority of the mills production, excluding pulp to other facilities in our network. We expect to incur $345 million of restructuring charges with the substantial majority recognized in our fourth quarter. Approximately 2/3 of these charges are expected to be noncash. With the announcement of the Tacoma closure, our mill portfolio is substantially different than it was 15 months ago. As we evaluated our assets, we considered mill profitability, technical age of assets, ongoing capital needs, product mix, strategic fit and our network flexibility. With our announced closures of higher cost mills and production capacity, we are reducing 1.9 million tons of capacity. These closures enable us to repurpose anticipated annual capital spending averaging approximately $120 million and exit noncore end markets. In addition, with these actions, we are decreasing our exposure to the open market and reducing our North American corrugated average mill cost by $12 per ton. Our smaller yet more efficient mill system enables us to serve our strategic end markets and customers. Through our current footprint, we are well positioned to serve these customers in 2024 and beyond. We've also been disciplined in our capital allocation and remain focused on investing in our assets to improve our return on invested capital, return leverage within our target range of 1.75x to 2.25x and returning capital to shareholders through a sustainable and growing dividend. As we work to recapitalize our assets, we are targeting a greater than 15% IRR on future return-generating projects. We expect our mill investments to drive efficiencies and enable us to further reduce our mill costs. Through our portfolio optimization and asset recapitalization strategies, we expect to improve margins and drive return on invested capital. Lastly, we continue to invest in growth. We're close to completing construction of our world-class Longview box plant, which is expected to start operations in November. This state-of-the-art facility will enable us to further consolidate converting operations in the Pacific Northwest and is expected to deliver $25 million in annual benefit once fully mature. Another example of our investments in growth is our Mexico acquisition. This transaction increased our exposure to the fast-growing Latin America market and brought us closer to many of our multinational customers. Our Mexican operations are exceeding our expectations, and we are excited about future growth prospects due to economic expansion and shortening supply chains. Through these ongoing initiatives, we expect to drive significant improvement in margins and return on invested capital, increase integration, reduce volatility and drive profitable growth. Turning to Slide 5. Before passing it to Alex, I'd like to highlight a recent example of how our broad portfolio, and innovative solutions are helping our customers win and meet their sustainability needs. Costco recently approached us with a request to replace single-use plastic multipack handles with a fiber-based, sustainable solution. In response, our designers develop EnduraGrip and Cluster-Clip. These new solutions provide bundling for multipacks of bottles and jars in a range of shapes, sizes and weights. They are engineered for durability and comfort, while providing a fully printable surface for crisp vibrant graphics and eliminate the use of plastic in these handles. Our strategic machinery business is also helping drive adoption. As part of our partnership, we are working with Costco manufacturers to automate their production lines, increase packing speeds and drive efficiencies. We're proud to partner with Costco and their manufacturers to introduce sustainable packaging solutions that help reduce single-use plastic packaging. This is just one example of many of how WestRock's unique capabilities position us for growth. Costco is one of our enterprise sales customers, and we serve them through both our corrugated and consumer segments. Enterprise relationships like this demonstrate the value that WestRock's broad portfolio and differentiated solutions provide. Through our diversified portfolio, commercial excellence and strong customer relationships, we've achieved over $9 billion in enterprise sales. Our plastics replacement innovations continue to gain traction, and we are on pace to deliver over $400 million in revenue this year. We are targeting more than $700 million by fiscal 2025. With a global total addressable market of $50 billion for plastics replacements, we see significant opportunities ahead. I'll now turn it over to Alex to discuss our segment results in more detail.Alexander W. PeaseThanks, David. Moving to our consolidated quarterly results on Slide 6. Third quarter net sales were $5.1 billion, down 7.2%, and consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $802 million, down 20.2%. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.7%, a decline of 250 basis points year-over-year. This decline was primarily within our global Paper segment, which I will discuss in a moment. Price and mix positively contributed $85 million year-over-year. Lower operating costs contributed $66 million year-over-year and input cost deflation contributed $37 million.Input cost deflation was largely driven by lower OCC and energy prices in the quarter. These benefits were more than offset by lower volumes of $243 million, an economic downtime of $89 million. We incurred 359,000 tons of economic downtime in the quarter with 258,000 tons in our corrugated system and 101,000 tons in consumer. Noncash pension costs also negatively impacted consolidated adjusted EBITDA year-over-year by $39 million. As a reminder, our U.S. pension plans remain overfunded. During the quarter, we generated $479 million of adjusted free cash flow. We used this strong cash flow to repay $479 million of debt, and we ended the quarter with net leverage of 2.51x. We continue to prioritize debt reduction and returning our leverage to our target range of 1.75x to 2.25x. We are now targeting $800 million to $1 billion of adjusted free cash flow for fiscal year 2023. Turning to Slide 7. Corrugated Packaging segment sales, excluding trade sales were $2.5 billion, an increase of $176 million or 7.7% year-over-year. This growth was primarily due to our Mexico acquisition and strong price and mix. Adjusted EBITDA increased $45 million or 11.6%. Adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding trade sales, increased 60 basis points year-over-year to 17.4%. Year-over-year adjusted EBITDA benefited $55 million from input cost deflation, $28 million from lower operating costs and $25 million due to favorable price and mix. These benefits were partially offset by lower volumes of $45 million and economic downtime of $37 million. Note that our Corrugated Packaging results include revenue of $37 million and adjusted EBITDA of $4 million related to the realignment of certain Latin American consumer converting operations in connection with our Mexico acquisition. As David indicated, Corrugated Packaging shipments were stable from last quarter. As we move forward, we expect gradually improving volumes and easier year-over-year comparisons. We remain focused on driving commercial excellence and productivity to mitigate the impact of previously published price declines. Turning to the Consumer Packaging business on Slide 8. Segment sales were $1.3 billion, a decline of $20 million or 1.5% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA declined $5 million or 2.1% and adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.4%, a decrease of 10 basis points year-over-year. Strong price and mix contributed $98 million and lower operating costs contributed $19 million. These benefits were more than offset by lower volumes of $51 million, inflation of $39 million, economic downtime of $13 million as well as other items. Adjusted for the previously mentioned realignment of certain consumer converting operations, revenue increased 1.4%, and adjusted EBITDA increased 1.5% year-over-year. Net organic sales volumes declined 6.6% year-over-year, driven by softer market demand, inventory reductions through the supply chain and difficult comparisons from last year's strong health care business. However, we are managing well and continue to gain new business. As a reminder, last year's adjusted EBITDA was up over 28% year-over-year. As David indicated, we expect improving conditions in the first half of fiscal year 2024 due to inventory rebalancing, moderating inflation and new business wins. Longer term, we are well positioned to drive profitability due to our growing end markets, increasing demand for sustainable packaging and expanding machinery business. Turning to Slide 9. Global Paper segment sales decreased $545 million or 33.8% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA declined 55.6% to $177 million, with adjusted EBITDA margin declining to 16.6%. Note that since the third quarter of 2020, our adjusted EBITDA is up 6% and margins are up 230 basis points. Input cost deflation contributed $27 million and lower operating costs contributed $15 million. These were more than offset by lower volume of $142 million, price and mix of $37 million and economic downtime of $39 million. During fiscal year 2023, our external containerboard volume has experienced year-over-year declines driven by elevated inflation shifting consumer spending and excess inventories throughout the supply chain. Additionally, published price changes have negatively impacted our revenue and margins. We continue to believe U.S. containerboard demand has stabilized, and we expect improving volumes as the calendar year progresses. Similar to our Consumer Packaging segment, we've recently experienced softer demand in our external paperboard business, driven by elevated inventories and softer demand, principally in commercial print and food packaging. These conditions have continued into the fourth quarter. However, we expect improvement in fiscal 2024, given the relative stability of our end market exposure. Next, our distribution results are on Slide 10. Our sales and adjusted EBITDA were down year-over-year due to a decline in our moving and storage business and difficult comparisons from last year's large health care order. We are focused on improving operations and driving cost savings to navigate the current environment. Over time, we see opportunity to grow our distribution business by leveraging our unique capabilities and driving operational excellence. Turning to guidance on Slide 11. While market conditions remain challenging with continuing realization of published price declines, we expect the impact of those conditions to be partially offset by gradually improving volumes. Our forecast for fourth quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA is $675 million to $725 million and adjusted EPS between $0.66 and $0.83 a share. Some assumptions behind our sequential outlook include stable costs driven by slightly higher energy costs, higher costs for recycled fiber and moderately lower cost in virgin fiber and chemicals. An adjusted effective tax rate of between 8% and 10%. Note, this lower rate is favorably impacted by approximately $30 million related to the release of uncertain tax positions, state tax credits and other discrete items. And lastly, approximately 257 million diluted shares outstanding. Additionally, we're planning 32,000 tons of scheduled maintenance downtime across our system in the fourth quarter. I'll now turn it back to David to conclude before we move to Q&amp;A.David B. SewellThanks, Alex. As you can see, we are delivering on our commitments, and I am incredibly proud of the progress we've made. As we continue our journey, I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities in front of us. In addition to our large self-help opportunity, WestRock remains uniquely positioned to deliver a full range of sustainable packaging solutions to our customers. With over $9 billion in enterprise sales, customers value our scale, diverse portfolio and the sustainable solutions we provide. Our innovation platform, growing machinery business and plastic replacement solutions continue to position WestRock extremely well for long-term growth. I'm excited about the path ahead, and I'm confident in our ability to drive growth, margins and long-term shareholder value. Thank you. And with that, Rob, let's move to Q&amp;A.Robert QuartaroThanks, David. Operator, we're ready for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Mike Roxland with Truist.Michael Andrew RoxlandCongrats on a very good quarter. Just starting off with corrugated. Can you just talk about the cadence of shipments during the quarter? And did any end markets begin to improve more notably than others?David B. SewellYes, Mike. The -- our corrugated business was really pretty stable in the quarter from Q2 to Q3. But what's just really encouraging to us as we went into Q4 and in July, our order rate was up mid-single digits. And as I alluded to earlier, we are experiencing the strongest backlogs we've had this calendar year. So we really like the momentum of corrugated as we move forward. As we talk about some of the segments, I think the one that really jumps out to me is we like what's going on in produce and agriculture and beverage has been really strong for us as well. And what's exciting about beverage is with our Mexico acquisition, our multinational beverage customers are really gravitating to our ability to serve the entire Americas. So we just see that as a positive trend as we move forward.Michael Andrew RoxlandGot it. And then just in terms of boxboard or Consumer Packaging, obviously, things start to weaken like a quarter or so ago, in response, you've taken -- started to take some economic downtime. You mentioned, though, that you expect an improvement in your fiscal first half. I guess what gives you the confidence that things are going to improve? Is there getting any indications from customers that they're going to have to restock? I mean how could you say -- what gives you that level of certainty that things are going to get better from here, soon rather later, let's say?David B. SewellMike, that's a good question because we work really closely with our customers on that. And what we saw in the last 60 days is a lot of our large customers in the consumer space took about a week off in manufacturing, just to rebalance their inventories. And as we went through that process, we were working very closely with them. And the commentary we received was this gets us reshifted to the right inventory levels. We'll work through that this quarter. And then and it's really consistent across all of our customers in this space is as we go into 2024, we're going to be ripe for growth. And they've said that to us internally as we build out our forecast for them as well as they've expressed it externally to the open market. So there's just a consistency in everything we hear. I think it will be stable in Q4 from Q3. And then everything they're telling us everything we're seeing is growth in 2024.OperatorOur next question will come from George Staphos with Bank of America.George Leon StaphosDavid, Alex. I wanted to talk a little bit about the mill closures that you've announced over the last year and change. And you talked a lot about how you expect that will help your return on capital in total. When you think about -- when we think about the 1.9 million tons of capacity of closed, what do you think that has taken off the top lowered your EBITDA on an annualized basis from what it otherwise would have been? And what do you think it's added to your incremental return on capital. Can you talk to that? Just specific to that -- those closures that you've announced?Alexander W. PeaseSure. So the easy answer is all of these mills were in the current conditions, not generating positive EBITDA. So the combination of basically avoiding the high fixed cost nature and then reallocating production to the other mills winds up accretive both to EBITDA dollars and EBITDA margin. So it was the right decision from an overall profitability standpoint. And I think it really speaks to the flexibility of our network and a lot of great work we're doing operationally to just reduce the unplanned downtime and unlock a lot of the hidden factories that we can move production of the strategic substrates from the mills that we're closing and into the other mills. We did exit certain product lines that were not strategic to us. So DuraSorb would be one example. Fluff Pulp would be another example. So we did exit those markets. But again, those weren't strategic substrates or products for us, and we weren't really making any money there anyway. In terms of capital, it's more than $100 million of capital combined that we were able to divert from essentially keeping these mills life support for lack of a better term and redirecting that toward growth-oriented capital. So we were basically reducing our sustaining capital needs and increasing our growth capital availability. And as David mentioned in his prepared remarks, typically, those growth capital investments are anywhere between 15% and 20% IRR. In terms of the aggregate ROIC, that part of your question, quite candidly, it would be de minimis because the denominator is such a large number. Just by way of sort of a heuristic $1 billion of invested capital generates about 40 basis points incremental ROIC. So in total, all of these mills combined was probably in the order of $1 billion, I think about $900 million of invested capital. So that would be, call it, 40 basis points improvement of ROIC. But really where we get the lift is in the improved -- in the improved EBITDA because that generates a much greater return for us than reducing the denominator. But David, what would you add?David B. SewellNo, I think Alex captured it well. And I think the important thing is when you look at our productivity efforts and when you look at, as Alex mentioned, the capital we could redeploy to other facilities, not only is it just getting the cost benefit of reducing those higher-cost mills. But we're actually getting more profitable at the mills we're running. So it's really going to be a return-generating entity for us.George Leon StaphosThat was really helpful. I guess next question I had for you, again, in terms of WestRock's strategy MO. I mean we talk a lot -- you talk a lot about the enterprise sales and also machinery installations. Enterprise sales, you said, were at $9 billion or more, which I think was the figure from last quarter recognizing $9 billion is a lot of money, a lot of revenue. Can you talk maybe more precisely about the progress you're seeing there the progress you're seeing in machinery installations and what that's adding in terms of profit? And then last, and I'll turn it over, just a ticky-tack question. I think in terms of the overall economic downtime, you said you took this last quarter, 359,000 tons. And if I didn't mishear you, I think you said 258,000 for corrugate and 101,000 for consumer. Did I miss something there? What was the figure for paper?David B. SewellSure. I'll start by answering the first part of your question, and I'll have Alex just give you kind of a rundown on our economic downtime. George, when I think about our enterprise capability, it's -- I think we're at the point where we just have the most momentum we've had in a long time. And I alluded to it in an earlier comment about Mexico. So for example, we had a large consumer customer that we were doing business with in the United States. They expanded a product line in Mexico, that was in corrugated, they came to us asking for a solution and that handoff was just seamless, and we were able to help them coordinate all of that and come up with a very effective solution. And then, what was also exciting is that same consumer customer, it was a beverage customer was looking for further plastics replacements and wanted to be very efficient in their process in doing that, and then we received a large machinery order at their sites. So we can help them be more efficient as they eliminate single-use plastics and move into a fiber-based solution and plastics replacement. So it's that connectivity, that's really driving our excitement about enterprise sales because there's just so many customers now that are looking for solutions that crossover between corrugated and consumer. We're just -- and we're just able to do that. And I think just when you look at our corrugated results alone, you could just see the benefits are working into our bottom line. So we feel great about enterprise. We now have over 5,300 machines in place worldwide. Our backlog is incredibly strong. That is a key component is our ability to customize our machinery to our customers' production lines. So with the plastics replacement, this is enormously important. And finally, you've heard a lot of e-commerce customers talk about wanting to exit plastic mailers. And so that is a great opportunity for kraft paper and our pack in demand machinery business, which we're just seeing a lot of excitement and energy around that as well. So combining all that, that's why we're just really excited about the future and what our portfolio is able to provide our customers and just the Costco example alone, enterprise customers came to us asking for a solution, there was machinery. And again, we have a consumer and corrugated relationship with them as well. I'll turn it over to Alex to talk about your economic downtime question.Alexander W. PeaseYes. So George, just a couple of facts to put out there. So our integration rates and corrugated are between 80% and 90%. So if you apply that to the 258,000 tons of downtime in the corrugated business, you get roughly 40,000 tons related to the corrugated business. And then if you do the same math on consumer, our integration rates in consumer are around 50%, give or take. So that would give you about 50,000 tons for the merchant business in the consumer segment. Another way to think about it is we had $124 million was the cost associated with the economic downtime in total on a consolidated basis, about $58 million of that was in Global Paper, about $49 million of that was in Corrugated and about $17 million of that was in the Consumer segment. So that should sort of give you the breakdown of how that falls out.OperatorOur next question will come from Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo.Gabrial Shane HajdeI wanted to ask about some of the strategic investments that you guys are making. So you have the box plant that you're doing up in the Pacific Northwest. And I think at the Investor Day, you called out, I think, $300 million to $500 million annually kind of over the 3-year period in return-oriented projects. Can you kind of talk about where you're at with that? I mean, obviously, like I said, I know the box plant. And then maybe, is there an acceleration in that, and that's part of the reason why cash flow is coming down a little bit, just given the EBITDA beat beat kind of here in the third quarter and same (inaudible) in line fourth quarter outlook?Alexander W. PeaseYes. So I'll start, Gabe, and then I'll turn it over to David. So in terms of the overall CapEx guidance, I believe the number we gave at Investor Day was between $200 million and $500 million on top of $1 billion of baseload capital. And that's still the number that we're sticking to. When we start talking about 2024, we'll have a finer view on what our 2024 CapEx outlook looks like in our longer-range view. But more strategically, yes, we are, as David mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are really focused on driving a higher level of strategic investment recapitalization in the in the mill network and that converting network, which will drive higher ROICs and higher margins. And the Longview box plant is a perfect example of that, that's going exceedingly well. It's going to allow some other footprint actions that we're planning, and it allows us to operate much more efficiently. We're planning on order of five more of those types of investments really around the country to really optimize our converting network. We're looking at some opportunities within our mill footprint to increase the flexibility of our mill assets. And all that work is going on kind of as we speak. So we're not prepared to talk about any of it today, but we will, as we start talking about 2024 and beyond. But I think it's a really exciting time for the company as we think about investing in our business and really driving higher returns. In terms of the cash flow, guide of $800 million to $1 billion. There's a couple of things that are behind that. Obviously, our EBITDA is slightly below our expectations when we started the year. But look, I mean, I think we're delivering exceptionally good results in a really challenging environment. We've been able to around $1 billion in our business, which is more than we invested last year. We're catching up from some of the bottlenecks in capital deployment during COVID. So all of this is, frankly, really positive. And candidly, even at the low end of that range to deliver $800 million in this operating environment, as I think a pretty exceptional testament to the strength of our business and the amount of cash flow we generate.David B. SewellYes. The only other thing I would add, Gabe, just as you -- to your question on the strategy overall, I would blanket it kind of this way, as Alex alluded to, redeploying the capital at our mills that we had to make the difficult decision to shut down because of the higher cost we are going to make those mills exceptionally more efficient and profitable with the additional CapEx we're able to redeploy. So our mill network is going to be more efficient. And then as Alex talked about on our converting assets, as we do these consolidations, there's CapEx potentially involved as we make these converting assets, much more efficient, larger, more output per site. And so that's going to also drive more profitability and combined will give us a higher ROIC. So that's how we kind of think about it overall. And then tying that into our commercial strategy, what are the segments that we're really focused on, that are higher growth, higher margin, where we have a great solution and right to win that consolidates everything together as we look at our overall strategy.Gabrial Shane HajdeAnd then one, hopefully, a quick one point of clarification, more near-term focused. David, I think you said in your prepared remarks, up mid-single digit maybe year-over-year in the corrugated business. And then I think in response to a question, it was up mid-singles on a sequential basis. So just maybe a point of clarification. Are you -- again, I think you talked about stable and corrugated. So just what you were informing there?David B. SewellYes. So for clarification, it was up mid-single digits from Q3. So sequentially, we were up mid-single digits. And our backlog was the strongest it's been in the calendar year. So we're seeing that improvement as we move forward in Q4, and we just expect that to continue as we get into 2024. So we really feel like we have come out of the bottom of the down cycle, and we are now on the upswing. And that's how we look at our Q4 and 2024 as we move forward.OperatorOur next question will come from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners.Mark Adam WeintraubSo you mentioned redeploying some of the capital that otherwise would have been going to some of the facilities you're closing to increase efficiency at the remaining mills, et cetera. Is this likely going to be incremental projects? Or is it going to make the most sense to be doing Florence type projects at some point?David B. SewellMarks, it's a really good question. It's going to be a combination of both. We look at all of our assets. We look at where we want to the company to be and what drives the highest returns. So if there is another type Florence investment that we need for our footprint. That's the direction we're going to go in addition to some of these incremental projects. So I think, as Alex talked about, that $200 million to $500 million when you get into that strategic investment, you're going to see a combination of both. And as we get closer to 2024 fiscal year, we'll give you much more detail and color around it.Mark Adam WeintraubOkay. Great. Then second, just kind of focusing still on the self-help. I believe the $1 billion profit improvement program was going to target about $250 million in fiscal '23. So if you can just sort of let us know. I know you talked about exit rates, but order of magnitude, what you think you will have accomplished in fiscal '23. And then how much would be likely on the docket for fiscal '24? I think there probably would be a step-up, but I just wanted to clarify.Alexander W. PeaseYes. I think the way we've bridged it is $250 million in '23, around $350 million in '24 and then the remainder in '25. Actually, though, Mark, we're well ahead of that. So as we mentioned, we're exiting the year at around $450 million run-rate, our end-year savings, we're anticipating being north of the $250 million that we committed to because the team is just making great progress. And the balance of what we're talking about at this stage of the game is really around SG&amp;A savings, and supply chain-related savings, roughly 50-50 each. But as we've talked about with some of these asset closures and plant consolidations we're really starting to get the flywheel moving on a lot of the operational improvements, which will really drive a reduction in unplanned downtime and unlock of hidden factory, lower waste rates. And so you should see those numbers begin to accelerate. So we feel really good about what we're doing on the productivity and cost savings side.Mark Adam WeintraubOkay. And recognizing it's a very dynamic process. Are we still thinking there's $350 million order of magnitude incremental in fiscal '24 and keeping it separate, if possible, from the actions you did on the facility closures, where I have another follow-up question just to, if possible.Alexander W. PeaseYes. So just to make the math easy, let's say, we're going to do between $250 and $300 million in '23, just take the top end of that, so say it's $300 million, and we're $450 million exit rate, that would put you at $150 million just going into as a rollover into '24. And then to get our $350 million number, you would say there's going to be $200 million incremental in '24. We're still building the operating plans for '24, but I think that's -- frankly, I think that number is conservative.Mark Adam WeintraubOkay. Super. And then just if we just focus on the 2 mills that are in the process of being closed and related converting plant actions, you talked about this being EBITDA incremental. And could you sort of give us a sense as to magnitude, again, recognizing there are a bunch of moving parts? And then also kind of what's the net cash closure costs, which obviously are onetime, but what's the net closure cash closure cost related to the actions?Alexander W. PeaseSo it's a little hard to answer your incremental EBITDA question because a lot of it depends on volumes. And in this volume environment, where things are so dynamic. It's just a tricky question to answer. But to give you a sense, the Tacoma mill that we just closed, the cash cost per ton is around $900 a ton based on the number that I'm looking at. The mills that we would reallocate capacity to, and I'm just going to use generalities around $200 to $400 a ton cheaper than the mill we closed. So that would give you a sense of sort of the incremental contribution that we would get from reallocating some of the capacity to those other mills. In terms of the cash cost for the one we just recently closed, the total was around $345 million, about 2/3 of that was noncash. So about 1/3 of that was cash related. And the bulk of the cash comes in year 1 and 2, and then it's offset by an assumption around the land sale coming in the latter part of year 2.David B. SewellAnd the only other thing I would add is -- I'm sorry, just to answer your question. If you look at the converting sites, they are not as dependent on volumes as the mills. So you would see EBITDA of about $35 million to date. And then as we continue to optimize that footprint, that will just continue to escalate. And then to Alex's point on the mills, it is volume dependent. So you would just see a range depending on volumes. So to Alex's point, you could just kind of do the math of where we are currently and what we would do, I mean you could see a range of -- from everything we've done from low double digits to even higher on improvement.Mark Adam WeintraubOkay. And just to clarify, that $900 per tonne, that was the total cost, I assume? Or did you say cash costs for...Alexander W. PeaseCash costs, that was cash cost.OperatorOur next question will come from our next question will come from Cleve Rueckert with UBS.Cleveland Dodge RueckertI had a couple of quick follow-ups. I was just looking at the positive price mix in the -- particularly in the Corrugated Packaging segment. And I'm wondering if there are any index price lags, that you expect to flow through that business over the next sort of couple of quarters? Or whether that price mix is just remaining positive because of the strategic actions that you've made and the mix improvements that's resulted from them.David B. SewellSo Cleve, as we look at our corrugated business, with all of the RISI pricing that's been announced as we go into this quarter, $70 of the $90 will hit our contractual customers. So you'll see continued price pressure through this quarter. And then coming out of this quarter, from the May increase, that $20 will come into play towards the end of the year and then be offset by the increasing volumes. About 75% of our customers are tied to that RISI contract pricing. So that's kind of how we look at the pricing. And then from a consumer side, just the recent announcements, we won't probably see those hit our consumer business until the end of the year. And then conversely, we see both on the containerboard side and paperboard side we see those within 30 days on our Global Paper business, which is why you've seen a lot of the pressure throughout the year, but then we'll cycle around that as we get into 2024.Cleveland Dodge RueckertRight. Yes. So there's just a lot more lag in those Integrated.David B. SewellYes.Cleveland Dodge RueckertYes. Okay. That's clear. And then just sort of following up on integration. And I appreciate the color on the integration rates between corrugated and consumer. I'd just be curious, given the actions that you're taking throughout the footprint, do you have an integration target for those businesses. Looking ahead, I think probably running a little higher than maybe we thought in corrugated. I'd just be curious if you sort of strategically thought about where you want to get to at this point or if that's still part of the planning you're doing?David B. SewellSo as we think about our integration rates with the 1.9 million tons that we've taken and if you go back to, say, a 2021 volume environment, our containerboard integration rates are really tracking in the high 80s. And as we get into that 90% range. We feel really pretty good about that because it allows flexibility through the cycles. We have really good strategic partners on the global paper side that are not on the commodity side of that buying multiple grades, long-term relationships. There's a lot of innovations that we're working on with them. So as we look at the mill footprint actions that we've taken, and we look forward to 2024, I mean, we're really in a great position in our supply-demand balance because as we've talked about, we want to match our supply to our customers' demand. So the excitement that you hear about 2024 with the actions we've taken and the productivity, we feel really good about how we're entering the year.OperatorOur next question will come from Phil Ng with Jefferies.Unidentified AnalystThis is actually John on for Phil. I hope you guys are doing well, and congrats on the good quarter. I just wanted to go back to the footprint. You guys have taken a lot of actions, particularly on the containerboard side over the past, say, 15 to 18 months, I guess, could you give us some perspective on how you're thinking about your footprint now? And do you see the actions taking already announced being enough? Or do you think there may be more to come where that be WestRock or generally the broader industry more importantly? And then just to follow on that, how should we think about Tacoma, which is expected to shut by the end of the fiscal year? How should we think about the earnings leakage, whether it be in this fiscal fourth quarter or going into 2024? I think you touched on it being positive, but just want to maybe get a little bit more clarity on the flow-through.David B. SewellSure, John. I'll answer the first part of the question, and then I'll let Alex go through Tacoma with a little more depth. So as we look at our footprint, what we've always focused on is our customers' demand with our supply footprint. So we know it's -- there's all kinds of puts and takes going on in the industry. But our relationships with our customers are very strategic, very connected. A lot of our contracts are long-term contracts. So as I've kind of alluded to a little bit, with Cleve, where we see 2024 -- I mean, right now, we're this has been an unprecedented year as far as the down cycle. We've made all the footprint actions. And as we see 2024 and 2025 with the connectivity we have with our customers and how they're projecting volumes we really see a nice balance right now. And we've got -- again, it's virgin fiber, it's recycled, it's paperboard. So having all of those straights is really important. So as we think about our footprint, we always evaluate it. We continue to evaluate it. But as far as a major short-term action, I don't anticipate that with everything that we're seeing as we head into 2024 with the demand environment we see with the current supply environment that we have. I'll turn it over to Alex to talk about Tacoma.Alexander W. PeaseYes. Let me -- I'll try to just -- the headline that everybody should hear on the call is that the mills that we've closed we're going to reallocate the strategic substrates to other mills in the network. So there won't be any EBITDA leakage associated with that. It will actually be EBITDA and ROIC accretive. On Tacoma specifically, just the breakdown, it's 510,000 tons of total capacity, about 105,000 tons that's linerboard, about 275,000 tons of that is white top, 60,000 tons is kraft paper and about 70,000 tons is pulp. So with the exception of the pulp, all of that other capacity will be reallocated around the network again. So it will be net margin and EBITDA dollar accretive. In terms of just -- it's not earnings leakage, but cash flow leakage, you will see about 2/3 -- or about 1/3 of the $345,000 of closure costs. That -- the cash cost associated with that is about 1/3 of that number and that will happen in years 1 and year 2 offset in the back half of year 2 with a land sale.Unidentified AnalystGot it. Okay. I appreciate that. And then just going back quickly, David, on the capacity. Do you think the industry as a whole needs to take out more? It still seems like operating rates are relatively below where they should be. I mean, I know your Tacoma still has yet to come out, but just thinking about 2024, the industry as a whole, do you see more actions needed to kind of stabilize price? Or do you see the demand inflection at least from the customer conversations that you're having, being enough to stabilize prices going into next year?David B. SewellYes. The way I would think about it, John, is we are laser focused with our segments and our customer base. And so we're just matching our supply to their demand. As I think about the industry, and obviously, there's capacity coming online, the customers that we're focused on, we just think are going to be different than where this new capacity is. So we'll let that sort itself out, but we're focused on do we have the right supply and the right footprint with the demand where we want to grow from value selling, solution selling. And with the 1.9 million tons that we have, with the demand forecast we see as we go into '24 and into '25, I mean, we feel pretty good about where we're at. We like -- and we like the improvements we're making in our cost structure productivity. So we'll continue to evaluate it. But right now, how we see supply and demand as we go into 2024 is balanced.Unidentified AnalystOkay. I appreciate that. And then if I could just squeeze one more small one in here. The -- if we could get an update on the RTS and Chattanooga URB mills if they've already closed for those sales? And if you could just remind us where the -- those are reported in which particular segment. I appreciate it.David B. SewellSo that the RTS sale is not complete. We hope to have that complete in September as we move forward in the business. And as again, just a reminder, it was a $375 million sale.Unidentified AnalystOkay. And what segment was that in?Alexander W. PeaseRTS would have been within the consumer...David B. SewellIn the consumer segment...Alexander W. PeaseIt's the partitions business, basically.OperatorThat concludes your question-and-answer session. This concludes our question-and-answer session.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.52 billion.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for WestRock: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock.

This was reconfirmed in Royal Caribbean’s second quarter results last Thursday with the company impressively surpassing top and bottom-line expectations and raising its full-year EPS guidance.  Q2 Review Driven by stronger pricing in correlation with higher demand, Royal Caribbean beat Q2 earnings expectations by 15% last week. Earnings came in at $1.82 per share compared to EPS estimates of $1.58.More importantly, the company’s post-pandemic rebound now looks in full swing after posting an adjusted loss of -$2.08 a share in the prior-year quarter. On the top line, Q2 sales of $3.52 billion surpassed estimates by 4% and soared 61% from a year ago.It’s also noteworthy that Royal Caribbean has now surpassed earnings expectations for six consecutive quarters. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHigher Guidance Strong Q2 results led to Royal Caribbean raising its full-year fiscal 2023 EPS guidance by 33% to between $6.00-6.20 a share. This makes Royal Caribbean shares very attractive as earnings estimate revisions should keep going up and are widely considered the most significant catalyst in the upward price movement of a stock.The Zacks Consensus for Royal Caribbean’s FY23 earnings has already soared 19% over the last week to estimates of $5.63 per share compared to $4.73 a share seven days ago. Fiscal 2024 EPS estimates have climbed 7% over the last week and are now expected at $7.70 a share compared to $6.93 per share a week ago.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStellar Performance Correlating with the reassuring trend of rising earnings estimates throughout the year, Royal Caribbean stock has now soared +112% in 2023.This has largely outperformed the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq, and Norwegian Cruise Line’s (NCLH) +41% while being roughly on par with Carnival Cooperation’s (CCL) +117%. Story continuesRoyal Caribbean stock has wiped away any losses from the pandemic and is now up +113% over the last three years. This also tops the broader indexes, Norwegian's +35%, and Carnival’s +28%. Despite this year’s impressive rally, Royal Caribbean’s stock still trades very reasonably at 18.6X forward earnings which is attractively below its industry average of 29.5X and the S&amp;P 500’s 21.2X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayFollowing strong Q2 results last week, the rally in Royal Caribbean stock may accelerate this year. Earnings estimates have continued to soar and the company’s P/E valuation is also supportive of the rally gaining more steam even with RCL shares up over +100% in 2023.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That gap has widened to 50%, he added.""(We are) working hard to close the outrageous and unwarranted 25% to 50% value gap to land-based offerings over time,"" Carnival Corp CEO Josh Weinstein said on a post-earnings call in June.Cruise operators lowered prices to lure passengers onboard following the pandemic, banking on onboard spending that has now reached record levels.Onboard spending in the second quarter rose 49.9% for Norwegian Cruise Lines, compared with the same period in 2019, before the pandemic. Onboard spending rose about 36.8% for Royal Caribbean Cruises and 17.2% for Carnival in the same period.""There's a lot more nickel-and-diming than there used to be,"" said Bob Levinstein, CEO of Cruise Compete, a marketplace for cruise quotes, noting charges for room service and other amenities used to be free.Still, companies like Norwegian and Carnival say labor costs, marketing, and port and freight expenses are on the rise, offsetting gains from robust demand and higher ticket prices.""We're looking at growth with respect to price increases as we get to 2024, 2025 and 2026,"" Carnival's Weinstein said.Royal Caribbean's CEO Jason Liberty echoed Weinstein's view on the value gap to land-based vacation and said on a post-earnings call late in July that it would help the company raise ticket prices further.Story continuesCHEAPER THAN DISNEY WORLDA seven-night all-inclusive Carnival cruise vacation that sails to the Caribbean costs $3,988.80 for a family of four, while a seven-night theme park vacation at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida costs $5,810.79, according to data provided by travel agency Premier Custom Travel.People are responding to the savings proposition, with about 73% of those who have never cruised saying that they would consider such a vacation, according to data from Cruise Lines International Association.Carnival and Royal Caribbean said the percentage of guests who were new to cruising surpassed 2019 levels.""There doesn't appear to be any problems with the price raises taken so far,"" said Barclays analyst Brandt Montour. They've raised prices 10% to 15% for 2023, compared with 2019 levels, and it doesn't seem like the consumer is pushing back on that latest price hike, he said.(Reporting by Granth Vanaik in Bengaluru and Doyinsola Oladipo in New York; Editing by Anil D'Silva)]"

This is compared to the gain of 10.6% for the S&amp;P 500 Index. Even the earnings reports from two powerhouse – Verizon Communications and AT&amp;T failed to boost the sector. Both companies came up with mixed earnings results, beating on top line and missing on revenues.This has put telecom ETFs like – iShares U.S. Telecommunications ETF IYZ, Vanguard Communication Services ETF VOX, Fidelity MSCI Communication Services Index ETF FCOM and Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund XLC – in focus.Below, we highlight Q2 earnings results from these companies.Earnings in DetailVerizon CommunicationsOn Jul 25, Verizon Communications VZ reported second-quarter 2023 earnings of $4,766 million or $1.10 per share, on a GAAP basis. Net income for the quarter decreased from $5,315 million or $1.24 per share in the prior-year quarter, due to a decline in overall revenues. Excluding non-recurring items, quarterly adjusted earnings per share were $1.21 compared with $1.31 in the prior-year quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents.Quarterly total operating revenues decreased to $32,596 million from $33,789 million in the prior year, and missed the consensus estimate of $33,390 million. Lower wireless equipment revenues driven by a challenging macroeconomic environment and lower postpaid phone upgrades resulted in a decrease in top line.The telecom giant has reiterated its guidance for 2023 and expects wireless service revenue growth of 2.5-4.5%. Verizon Communications is seeing strong growth in 5G adoption and fixed wireless broadband services. The demand for Fios and fixed wireless products has led to a healthy increase of 418,000 new broadband connections. Additionally, they gained 8,000 postpaid phone subscribers and 612,000 retail postpaid subscribers, which has boosted their shares in pre-market trading.Story continuesAT&amp;TOn Jul 26, AT&amp;T T reported second-quarter 2023 net income of $4,437 million or 61 cents per share compared with $4,105 million or 57 cents per share in the year-ago quarter, mainly because of higher revenue and reduced operating costs. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings were 63 cents per share compared with 65 cents in the year-earlier quarter and ahead of, the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents.Quarterly GAAP operating revenues increased 0.9% year over year to $29,917 million. However, the top line missed the consensus mark of $30,087 million. The increase year over year was largely due to higher Mobility, Mexico and Consumer Wireline revenues, partially offset by lower revenues from Business Wireline services.While optimizing operations, AT&amp;T is aiming to increase efficiencies to lower operating costs, while focusing on 5G and fiber-based connectivity along with expanded reach of software-based entertainment platforms.ETFs in FocusiShares U.S. Telecommunications ETF (IYZ)iShares U.S. Telecommunications ETF seeks to track the Russell 1000 Telecommunications RIC 22.5/45 Capped Index with a basket of 23 securities.

296,ce689172-324e-3aed-a6e0-bf16341687b8,VZ,2023-08-04,Verizon continues to upgrade Scranton's best network,GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-continues-upgrade-scrantons-best-130000888.html,1691067600,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Sourcing LLCRecent upgrades lead to testing results that show customers in Scranton have the best experience on Verizon’s networkSCRANTON, Pa., Aug. 03, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verizon has recently made major upgrades to the network serving customers in Scranton, PA. These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Scranton include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:Engineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity as well as C-band spectrum designed for fast speeds, high capacity and wide coverage. With the recent deployments and upgrades, 87% of people in Scranton now have access to 5G service from Verizon. Verizon Engineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using its C-band spectrum designed for high capacity and wide coverage and its premium mmWave spectrum. Most notably, Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband service has recently been deployed in Forrest City and surrounding areas in northeast Lackawanna and south central Wayne Counties, the western side of Harveys Lake as well as the Wilkes-Barre, Stroudsburg, Hazelton, and Bloomsburg areas. 5G using C-band spectrum was also recently added to Mohegan Sun Arena in Wilkes-Barre.These deployments used Verizon’s  recently acquired C-band spectrum, designed to provide wide coverage for 5G service. Throughout Hampton Roads, Verizon engineers are using 60 MHz of C-band spectrum to deliver 5G service to customers. By the end of the year, customers in Hampton Roads will be able to take advantage of nearly three times that amount of spectrum as it becomes available for 5G Ultra Wideband.  That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust servicesEven as engineers provide wireless service in more places, they are also enhancing the service by deploying leading edge, modernized technology in the area. Engineers have upgraded the hardware in many of the cell sites providing service throughout Scranton adding capacity for more data to be used by customers, providing power efficiency, and providing virtualization. This technology milestone allows Verizon to rapidly respond to customers’ varied latency and computing needs, and provides greater flexibility and agility in the introduction of new products and services. The move to a cloud-based, virtualized architecture with standardized interfaces in every part of the network leads to greater flexibility, faster delivery of services, greater scalability, and improved cost efficiency in networks.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Scranton. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links.  Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network.  Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Scranton area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Story continues“Our network engineers work tirelessly to ensure we can provide the most reliable connections across Scranton. We will continue to unlock the power of 5G for our customers with better connectivity for their phones, homes and businesses, as part of our ongoing commitment to this community,” said Kevin Smith, Vice President of Network Engineering and Operations for Verizon.With these and other technology advancements on Verizon’s network, customers are able to use more data in more ways. This multi-service network powersInternet-of-Things (IoT) devices that do very little networking and stay in place,smartphones with infinite opportunities to use data in a highly mobile environment,home and business internet which provides connectivity via the wireless network for homes, offices and retail environments, andcomplex solutions like Augmented Reality or enterprise real-time video and data analysis that require massive computing capabilities.As 5G technology advances and is even more widely adopted by consumers the variety of solutions that will use Verizon’s network will continue to evolve as well.Scranton, PA customers have an outstanding experience on Verizon’s networkThe recent network upgrades have led to customers and visitors to Scranton, PA having an outstanding experience when using the Verizon network, according to the nation’s most rigorous scientific testing company RootMetrics®.   In the most recent test measuring performance of major wireless carriers throughout Scranton, Verizon is unbeaten for overall network performance, reliability, accessibility, speed and performance in data, texts and calls.  Today’s results show great speeds for Verizon customers in Scranton with Verizon’s median download speed increasing 27% in the market since last year*.Services from the network customers rely onFor customers in Scranton, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with no data caps.

Impressive efforts on stage, which included a reminder that all of their music was being sung and not powered by AI. Bearish for AI stocks? Unclear.I also was reminded that this is one expensive stock market that is priced for perfection. And if that perfection isn't achieved, investors will pay dearly. And they paid this week, to an extent.We continue to see global markets roiled a bit from Fitch's credit rating downgrade on US debt. Pricey tech stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA) are feeling a big brunt of the risk-off move.morning brief imageAll of this got me thinking maybe it's time for investors to find a few interesting turnaround situations to bet on. You know, well-known companies that have visible catalysts in place that investors have forgotten about amidst the summer hype for top-performing businesses.And companies whose stocks aren't as inflated as the broader market, so there is already a ton of bad news priced in.Take for instance chip giant Intel (INTC).The company has had a brutal 12 months as CEO Pat Gelsinger slashes costs, builds new chip-making plants, and tries to catch up to AMD and Nvidia on design. A post-pandemic downturn in PCs hasn't helped Intel's fundamentals either.But Intel looks to be turning the corner operationally, at least in the eyes of the energetic Gelsinger.""The worst is behind us,"" Gelsinger told Yahoo Finance Live.Story continuesThe symbol for Intel appears on a screen at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York on Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2019. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) (AP)Gelsinger thinks the PC market will gradually recover this year, and the company has secured $1 billion-plus in commitments for AI-related chips. The company also remains on track to attain $8 billion in cost cuts by 2025.This is a markedly different tone relative to when we talked a few months ago.Is Intel hitting its stride? Who knows. But the situation appears way better than two quarters ago — and it may not be priced into the stock price of this iconic American company.Another big business that may be beginning to see daylight after a tough stretch is toymaker Hasbro (HAS).Hasbro unloaded its anchor-like entertainment business eOne to Lionsgate for $500 million this week. The sale removes a non-core asset from Hasbro's books, freeing up resources to invest in core toys.This comes as Hasbro has seen stabilization in toy demand despite the juggernaut demand driver for rival Mattel (MAT) in the Barbie movie.Speaking of resources, Hasbro is on pace to remove $250 million to $300 million in costs by year-end 2025.Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks sounded pretty confident in our chat this week that his company's worst days were behind it too. Now onto some debt pay-down ($400 million) and marketing behind the red-hot-selling, Furby doll.I would even add a small-cap name like grill-maker Traeger (COOK) into this turnaround play callout. The company has gotten its inventory levels into far better shape after a rough year. Demand for grills is stabilizing, and the CEO has been refocused on driving stronger operations.""I truly believe we have turned around,"" Traeger CEO Jeremy Andrus told us.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The company’s recent boom has also helped boost the value of stakes held by Chairman Kim Sang-Beom and his family to more than $800 million as of August 3.Kim, who controls 100% of holding company Isu Corp., is just the latest example of how soaring demand for AI investments is creating massive wealth. Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of leading AI company Nvidia, has seen his fortune surge almost three-fold this year to $39.9 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.“Hardly any local companies directly supply Nvidia and Google, but Isu Petasys got the job,” said Baik Gil-hyun, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea Co. “If the AI boom continues, so will the interest in the company.”Isu Petasys, founded in 1972, began distributing printed circuit boards, mainly for hard disk drives, in 1989. Its parent company, Isu Group, has businesses in industries including chemicals, construction and biopharmaceuticals.Kim became the group’s chairman in 2000 after his father, Joon-sung, stepped down after four years. Before joining Isu, the younger Kim worked at the now-defunct industrial conglomerate, Daewoo Group, which was founded by his father-in-law Kim Woo-choong, according to local newspaper Korea Joongang Daily.Story continuesOn top of their 26% stake in Isu Petasys, Kim and his family also own stock in the group’s other publicly traded units, including Isu Specialty Chemical and Isu Chemical. Company filings show that shares pledged for loans account for just under half of the total value of their stakes.Diversifying BaseIsu Petasys didn’t make Kim available for an interview. The company didn’t respond to questions about their customers or the value of the family’s stakes.In recent years, Isu Petasys has leaned into the AI craze, diversifying its customer base from predominantly telecommunications manufacturers like Nokia Oyj, and adding technology giants such as Alphabet and Nvidia, according to Park Hyung-woo, an analyst at SK Securities Co. in Seoul.Orders for its boards used for AI accelerators jumped almost eight-fold to 47.3 billion won ($36.4 million) in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to a June presentation.Other prominent players in high-end printed circuit boards include Japan’s Ibiden Co., Taiwan’s Unimicron Technology Corp. and Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co.While the company’s revenue grew 3.9% to 172 billion won in the first three months of this year from the previous quarter, its operating profits fell 33% to 20.2 billion won, according to filings.‘Obvious Beneficiaries’SK Securities’ Park said he expects a drop in operating profits for the year, partly because Isu Petasys’s AI products are less lucrative than those sold for telecommunications devices. Despite that, he remains optimistic.“The company is one of the most obvious beneficiaries because it’s actually seeing a growing portion of its revenue from AI-related sales,” Park said.Increasing tensions between the US and China may have also contributed to Isu Petasys’s expansion, as US companies prefer non-Chinese suppliers, according to analyst Baik. Park said he expects AI-related business to make up 20% of the company’s revenue this year and at least 30% in 2024.“It doesn’t look like AI is a temporary trend that will fade soon,” he said. “It could change the direction of the industry, like how PCs and smartphones did in the past. Then things look bright for Isu Petasys.”--With assistance from Debby Wu.(updates Jensen Huang’s fortune in third paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA Digital Dollar Is for Banks and Governments, But Not YouTeen Gamers Swiped $24 Million in Crypto, Then Turned on Each OtherPrivate Credit Funds Move From Mergers to Timeshares and Car LoansHonoring the Enslaved Man Who Made Jack Daniel’s First WhiskeyAmazon Unveils Biggest Grocery Overhaul Since Buying Whole Foods©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The top line also increased 10.9% year over year, reflecting strong growth in the United States. This was partially offset by lower international sales due to divestitures of its European businesses.Q1 Segmental AnalysisRevenues at the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment totaled $67.16 billion, up 17.9% year over year. Per management, the upside was primarily driven by higher volume of specialty products, including an increase in volume from retail national account customers. However, branded-to-generic conversions partially offset the upside.The U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment reported an adjusted operating profit of $771 million, up 8.4% from the prior-year quarter’s level. This was due to growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems, and increased contributions from our generics program, partially mitigated by lower demand for COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The adjusted metric for the segment was up 14%, excluding the impact of the abovementioned vaccine’s distribution.At the International segment, revenues amounted to $3.47 billion, down 34.8% year over year. This was due to divestitures of McKesson’s European businesses.Adjusted operating profit at the segment totaled $90 million, down 45.6% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.Revenues at the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment totaled $2.61 billion, up 0.7% year over year.

Excluding the impact of COVID-related items, the adjusted metric was up 7%.Story continuesRevenues at the Prescription Technology Solutions segment totaled $1.24 billion, up 16.7% from that recorded a year ago. The improvement can be attributed to higher technology services revenues and an increase in prescriptions from third-party logistics.Adjusted operating profit amounted to $223 million at the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, up 35.2% from the prior-year quarter’s level.MarginsGross profit in the reported quarter was $3.07 billion, flat on a year-over-year basis.

See our latest analysis for Fox What Is Fox Worth?According to my valuation model, Fox seems to be fairly priced at around 9.25% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Fox today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $30.51, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. In addition to this, Fox has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.What does the future of Fox look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 31% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Fox. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? FOXA’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on FOXA, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

Robinson CEO’s 1st earnings call,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-weigh-c-h-robinson-191250412.html,1691089970,STORY,['CHRW'],"[The day after the first CHRW call with its new CEO, analysts weighed in. (Photo: Shutterstock)It isn’t often on earnings calls in 2023 that there is a reference to a fax machine.But there was on the first analyst call that new C.H. Robinson CEO Dave Bozeman conducted Wednesday after the 3PL’s second-quarter earnings report that was in line or slightly below most forecasts.Referring to C.H. Robinson reputation for lagging in technology infrastructure, Bozeman said that when he took the offer to head up the country’s largest 3PL, he heard ribbing that “Hey, that’s a fax machine company, right?”But the statement summed up the challenges that Bozeman faces to improve technology at C.H. Robinson, which he said he so far has found to be more advanced than conventional wisdom might have held.With the late afternoon earnings call Wednesday, the first responses from the market took a while to roll in on Thursday.Shares in C.H. Robinson moved up Thursday at a slightly higher rate than gains in the overall stock market. At approximately 1:45 p.m, C.H. Robinson (NASDAQ: CHRW) was up $1.06 to $98.50, a gain of 1.09%. Earlier in the day, the price had touched a high of just over $100.C.H. Robinson stock is down about 9.8% for the past 12 months. Its 52-week high was set almost a year ago at $121.23, on Aug. 25.There were no reports of downgrades or upgrades of C.H. Robinson stock following the call, though there were adjustments to target price projections. The company got its most important good rating news back in June, when S&amp;P Global affirmed its debt rating at the investment-grade level of BBB+, even as it lowered the company’s outlook to negative.Bozeman did not address the specifics of the quarterly financial performance but rather attempted, as a report from the transportation research team at Wells Fargo said, to “set the tone.”Bozeman, Wells Fargo said, discussed “speed of results, productivity focus and customer engagement. Although still in ‘diagnosis’ mode, he appears focused on leveraging technology to drive productivity as well as longer-term growth.”Story continuesThe argument for cutting costs can be seen in the comparison among three key financial measurements in the past year.Transportation revenues in the second quarter fell 36.8% to just over $4 billion from $6.7 billion in the second quarter of 2022. Meanwhile, the cost of purchased transportation fell by the same percentage to $3.5 million from $5.5 million.But C.H. Robinson’s selling, general and administrative costs rose 32.8%. While the dollars involved are far smaller — SG&amp;A is less than 4% of all expenses — it’s a cost center that a 3PL has more control over than something like the cost of purchasing capacity.As TD Cowen’s Jason Seidl noted in a post-meeting report on C.H. Robinson’s earnings, “cost measures were discussed at length on the call.” But so was technology.“Refinement of CHRW’s digital brokerage offering will remain the fulcrum of the company’s long term cost management initiatives,” Seidl wrote.Bozeman noted in his comments that he had come out of Amazon’s logistics operations, though his most recent position before joining C.H. Robinson was with Ford. He made several references to “Lean Principles,” the basis of Six Sigma process management.“Lean Principles are applicable at Robinson to further improve efficiency,” Bozeman said. “Robinson is a strong company. But all companies have waste that can be removed to make a company quicker, more flexible and more agile in solving problems for their customers.”Bozeman’s Amazon and Lean background, Seidl wrote, “could aid in this endeavor.” Seidl also noted Bozeman’s references to the potential within C.H. Robinson for generative AI, “something the company has not really elaborated on in the past to boost progress in the end to end automation of the order life cycle.” That could take the form of “auto-filled emails and language processing, thus allowing fewer manual touchpoints.”Seidl, however, was not impressed enough to increase the TD Cowen price target on C.H. Robinson. To the contrary, it had been $95; now it’s $93.The transportation research team at Deutsche Bank led by Amit Mehrotra reduced its 2023 earnings-per-share estimate to $3.64 from $3.69 but raised the target price for C.H. Robinson to $91 from $87.Meanwhile at Bank of America, the team led by Ken Hoexter raised the C.H. Robinson price target to $92 from $85, though it still has the stock rated as “underperform.”The BOA report said Bozeman is in a “diagnostic phase” with “all options on the table.”“[Bozeman] sees significant opportunity to accelerate growth, cut waste, drive better customer experience, and leverage CHRW’s scale with Generative AI and machine learning,” Hoexter wrote. “He noted that all portfolio options are on the table to drive shareholder value.”Concern remains about the company’s Global Forwarding sector, which operates internationally and provides ocean and airfreight services and customs brokerage.In a report issued after the call, the transportation research team at Morgan Stanley led by Ravi Shanker summed up the dismal performance of the Global Forwarding group, which has long been seen as a laggard at C.H. Robinson. Under the heading of “The Forwarding unwind persists,” Morgan Stanley cited the numbers at Global Forwarding: gross revenues down 63% year on year and 7% less than the Morgan Stanley estimate. Gross margins were up to 23% from 15.5%, Morgan Stanley noted, but that was overshadowed by net revenues down 45% year on year.Ocean and air volumes were higher sequentially, the Morgan Stanley report noted, but average ocean gross profit year on year was down 49.5% and average air gross profit was down 39.5%.Hoexter, in his report, said Bozeman “indicated potential strategic options for its Global Forwarding business,” though there was no direct reference to that sector by Bozeman in the call. Hoexter added that Bozeman indicated a “focus centered on opportunities in its core truckload business.”During the call, when asked about Global Forwarding, CFO Mike Zechmeister discussed some nonfinancial areas of progress. “They’ve done a nice job of bringing some talent and new geographies in and they’re looking at new verticals,” Zechmeister said. “They’ve had a fair amount of success in new trade lines and opening up to some places that they haven’t had a developed business in the past, and they’re getting excellent results.”That sort of progress was described by Zechmeister as a factor that could get the Global Forwarding business back to a 30% operating margin, which he said was the company’s goal. For the second quarter, the margin was 16.5%. A year ago, in the incredibly strong second quarter, it was 51.6%.More articles by John KingstonTeamsters celebrate NLRB decision on STG Logistics, see path to greater unionization Uber Freight’s EBITDA loss widens from ’22 but improves from Q1Yellow elephant in the room for Saia’s Q2 earnings callThe post Analysts weigh in on new C.H.

BozemanThank you, Chuck. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let me start by saying it is an absolute privilege to be leading C.H. Robinson, a market leader with enormous scale, a strong base of loyal customers and a resilient business model that generates profits and free cash flow through the entirety of the freight cycle.I know from my time in the transportation market that other freight providers and new entrants look to Robinson as an example of a commercial engine with the breadth, scale, expertise and financial strength that they aspire to achieve. However, there's always room for improvement, and I recognize the tremendous opportunity in front of us to accelerate growth in a very fragmented market.In my first month, I've been spending time meeting with and talking to customers, employees and shareholders as I analyze the business. A customer-centric focus is in my DNA, and I have successfully implemented customer-focused strategies over my 30-year career at leading brands such as Harley-Davidson, Caterpillar, Amazon and Ford Motor Company. I look forward to applying that experience towards our goal of providing such a compelling offering that customers feel like C.H. Robinson is essential to the success of their supply chain.As a Lean practitioner, I'm in a discovery and diagnosis phase, and I've been learning more and shaping my vision for the company each day. I'm digging in quickly with the leadership team. I'm looking at the portfolio of businesses with an open mind. And my intentions are to drive focus so that we position ourselves for growth in our core business.As I aim to reinvigorate the winning culture, my focus will be on people, products, processes, technology, collaboration and excellence. My style is to: one, be accountable for driving improvement and be passionate about making people better; two, look around corners and anticipate in order to minimize surprises. And three, wake up every day, like you're working for a startup by being gritty, scrappy, innovative and change-oriented with a focus on improving clock speed and acknowledging every day that you can be better.These practices have enabled success for the companies I've worked at and the people I've worked with. People are at the heart of Robinson, and I'm confident that together, we will win for our customers, carriers and shareholders.I'm passionate about continuously improving how organizations operate. Lean principles work and are applicable at Robinson to further improve efficiency. Robinson is a strong company, but all companies have waste that can be removed to make a company quicker, more flexible and more agile in solving problems for their customers, improving workflows and providing better customer service and experiences.I have helped build out and scale transportation businesses, most notably at Amazon, where technology is the starting point. I am certain, we can leverage technology as a force multiplier here at Robinson, and I've been discussing it with Arun and the team. As an example, when I look at C.H. Robinson, I'm excited about the potential benefits from Generative AI in conjunction with the machine learning and artificial intelligence that the company has already been utilizing.With more data and history to leverage than any other 3PL, we have opportunities to harness the power that these advanced technologies now offer to further capitalize on our information advantage, and we'll continue to look for and pursue those opportunities.Arun will touch more on this in his prepared comments. In summary, I look forward to leading this great company to new heights, and sharing our progress with all of you along our journey.With that, I'll turn it over to Mike for a review of our second quarter results.Michael Paul ZechmeisterThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Global freight markets in Q2 continued to be impacted by weak demand, high inventories and excess capacity, which resulted in a more competitive marketplace with suppressed transportation rates.North American freight volumes and load-to-truck ratios remain near the low levels of 2019. In the freight forwarding market, ocean vessel and air freight capacity continues to exceed demand, which has kept ocean and air freight rates low during the period of significant declines that extends back to the second half of 2022.Despite the weak demand, new vessel deliveries are expected to continue to add capacity to the ocean market. This suggests that the influence of excess capacity may persist for several periods despite the steamship lines efforts to manage capacity through blank sailings, slow steaming and redeploying capacity to other lanes.We are staying focused on what we can control, providing superior service to our customers and carriers and streamlining our processes by removing waste and manual touches. The result has been meaningful cost reduction and productivity gains across our business. With our record quarterly financial results in Q2 of last year as a comparable, and the macro forces that I outlined as the backdrop, our second quarter total revenues of $4.4 billion declined 35% compared to Q2 last year. Our second quarter adjusted gross profit or AGP, was also down 35% year-over-year or [$366 million,] driven by a 45% decline in our Global Forwarding and a 36% decline in NAST.On a sequential basis, total company AGP was down 3%, driven by a 6% decline in NAST that was partially offset by a 1% increase in Global Forwarding and a 6% increase in the total of our other segments.On a monthly basis compared to Q2 of last year, our total company AGP per business day was down 30% in April, down 39% in May and down 37% in June. In our NAST truckload business, our Q2 volume declined by approximately 6.5% on a year-over-year basis. Within Q2, average daily volume in April was stronger than March, but weakened in May and held in June, which resulted in a 0.5% sequential decline in Q2.During Q2, we had an approximate mix of 70% contractual volume and 30% transactional volume in our truckload business. Routing guide depth of tender in our managed services business, which is a proxy for the overall market, declined from 1.4 in Q2 of last year to 1.1 in the second quarter of this year, which is the lowest level we've seen for a full quarter since the recession of 2009. The sequential declines in our truckload linehaul cost per mile since Q2 of last year began to level off and increased sequentially in May and June, causing the June cost per mile to be only $0.02 below the March cost per mile. On a year-over-year basis, we saw a decline of approximately 19% in our average truckload linehaul cost per mile to carriers, excluding fuel surcharges.Due to the time lag for contract pricing to follow spot market costs, Q2 truckload linehaul pricing continued to decline on a sequential basis resulting in a 23% year-over-year decline in our average linehaul rate or price billed to our customers, excluding fuel surcharges. These changes resulted in a 41.5% year-over-year decrease in our Truckload AGP per mile and AGP per shipment with declines in both contractual and transactional AGP per shipment. This is the largest year-over-year decline in AGP per mile that we've experienced in the last 10 years and is in contrast to the 46.5% increase in Q2 last year. In our LTL business, shipments were flat on a year-over-year basis and up 5% sequentially. By leveraging our broad access to capacity in all modes of LTL and our high level of service, our LTL team continues to onboard a pipeline of new business that is offsetting the softness in the LTL market.AGP per order, however, declined 19% compared to Q2 last year, driven primarily by the market conditions and lower fuel prices. As I mentioned, market conditions in our Global Forwarding business were also soft behind weak demand and plenty of capacity.Despite that, our ocean and air volume each grew sequentially, exhibiting the progress our Global Forwarding team has made through adding new customers, diversifying trade lanes and verticals and leveraging investments in technology and talent over the past several years. In Q2, Global Forwarding generated revenue of $780 million and AGP of approximately $179 million, which declined 45% year-over-year compared to the record high from Q2 last year.Within these results, our ocean forwarding AGP declined by 53% year-over-year compared to 51% growth in Q2 of 2022. The Q2 results were driven by a 49.5% decrease in AGP per shipment and a 7% decrease in shipments. Turning to expenses. We delivered on our expense reduction and productivity expectations for the quarter. Q2 personnel expenses were $377.3 million, including $13.1 million of restructuring charges, down 15.2% compared to Q2 of last year. Excluding the restructuring charges, our Q2 personnel expenses were down 18.1% year-over-year primarily due to the cost optimization efforts and lower variable compensation.Our headcount was also down significantly in Q2 with ending headcount at 15,763, down 13.1% year-over-year. In Q2, we elevated our cost optimization efforts, which began in Q4 of last year as we streamlined our workflows and removed waste to help ensure a more competitive and sustainable long-term cost structure. As a result, our shipments per person per day in NAST has increased by 12% year-to-date through Q2, and we remain on track to deliver on our target of 15% year-over-year improvement by Q4 of this year.I'd also note that we were able to achieve the productivity gains in a soft volume market, which sets us up well for when the market demand returns. Going forward, we expect continued improvements in shipments per person per day and the associated cost benefits through the remainder of 2023 as we streamline processes and improve customer outcomes with technology that supports our people and processes. As a result of the progress on our cost optimization efforts, we now expect 2023 personnel expenses to be toward the lower end of the $1.45 billion to $1.55 billion range that we previously provided. As a reminder, our expense guidance excludes restructuring expenses.Moving to SG&amp;A. Q2 expenses were $155.6 million and included $1 million of restructuring charges. Excluding the Q2 restructuring charges and last year's $25.3 million gain on the sale leaseback of our Kansas City Regional Center in Q2, SG&amp;A expenses were up approximately 8.5% compared to Q2 of last year, primarily due to increases in claims and warehouse expenses.We continue to expect our 2023 SG&amp;A expenses to be $575 million to $625 million, including $90 million to $100 million of depreciation and amortization expense. As you may recall from our Q1 earnings call, we raised our cost savings commitment to $300 million of net annualized cost savings by Q4 of this year compared to the annualized run rate of the Q3 expenses from last year. We continue to be on track to deliver those expense reductions and the majority are expected to be longer-term structural changes to our cost base that will help us improve operating margins once demand returns. Q2 interest and other expense totaled $18.3 million, down $9.1 million versus Q2 last year. Q2 included $23.2 million of interest expense, up $6.3 million versus Q2 of last year due to higher variable interest rates against a reduced debt load. Q2 also included a $3.5 million gain on foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses compared to a $10.3 million loss in Q2 last year, with both driven by various foreign currency impacts on intercompany assets and liabilities. As a reminder, our FX impacts are predominantly noncash gains and losses.Our Q2 tax rate came in at 14.9% compared to 21.3% in Q2 of '22. The lower tax rate was driven by lower pretax income and incremental benefits from tax credits and incentives. We now expect our 2023 full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 18%, assuming no meaningful changes to federal, state or international tax policy.Adjusted or non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding the $14.1 million of restructuring charges, was $0.90. Excluding the $25.3 million gain from Q2 last year, non-GAAP earnings per share was down 64% compared to the 75% increase in Q2 last year.Turning to cash flow. Q2 cash flow generated by operations was approximately $225 million compared to the $265 million in Q2 of 2022 demonstrating our ability to generate cash and make investments in the business through the freight cycle. The year-over-year decline in our cash flow was driven by a $251 million decrease in net income partially offset by $144 million sequential decrease in net operating working capital in Q2, resulting from the declining cost and price of ocean and truckload transportation. Over the last 4 quarters, as the cost and price of purchased transportation have come down, we have realized a benefit to working capital and operating cash flow of more than $1.4 billion. In Q2, our capital expenditures were $24.4 million compared to $43.2 million in Q2 of last year, and we continue to expect our 2023 capital expenditures to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million.We returned $106 million of cash to shareholders in Q2 through $73 million of cash dividends and $33 million of share repurchases. The cash returned to shareholders exceeded net income but was down 74% versus Q2 last year, driven by the $137 million of cash used to reduce debt.Now on to the balance sheet highlights. We ended Q2 with approximately $1.1 billion of liquidity comprised of $859 million of committed funding under our credit facilities and a cash balance of $210 million. Our debt balance at the end of Q2 was $1.74 billion, which includes debt paydown of $532 million versus Q2 last year.Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q2 was 1.81x, up from 1.39x at the end of Q1. Our capital allocation strategy is grounded in maintaining an investment-grade credit rating, which allows us to optimize our weighted average cost of capital. With the year-over-year earnings reduction and the $0.5 billion of debt pay down, we'll continue to manage our capital structure to maintain our investment-grade credit rating. As you would expect, the cash that we used to reduce debt generally reduces the amount of cash available for share repurchases.Over the long term, we remain committed to growing our quarterly cash dividend in alignment with long-term EBITDA growth. Our dividends and share repurchase program are important levers to enhance shareholder value as we are delivering quality, customer service more efficiently than anyone in the marketplace. As we have demonstrated through the ups and downs of our highly cyclical freight market, the strength of our business model makes us a reliable partner for our customers and allows us to invest through the cycle. Our customers value the stability and reliability that we provide as we work to optimize their transportation needs.I'd like to close by adding that I am incredibly excited about the direction we are headed and our ability to build on the productivity and cost control progress that we've made. By leveraging Lean principles to reduce waste and the emerging benefits of our combination of machine learning and Generative AI across our scaled model, we are positioned well to deliver greater efficiency and improved competitiveness in the marketplace to generate greater value for Robinson shareholders.With that, I'll turn the call over to Arun to provide more details on our efforts to strengthen our customer and carrier experience and improve our efficiency and operating leverage.Arun D. RajanThanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In the second quarter, our single threaded cross-functional teams made great progress on improving customer outcomes with technology that supports our people and processes. Our enhanced carrier advantage program has significantly improved our automated tracking and advanced visibility capabilities and those efforts are being recognized by our customers and multiple third parties.In our LTL business, our team is leading the way as an early adopter of electronic builder rating, which has enhanced our digital connectivity with our LTL carriers and enabled us to eliminate unnecessary work and achieve gains in efficiency and accuracy.All the initiatives and work streams of our teams are targeted at improving productivity and accelerating growth with disciplined product and change management. Over the last 6 months, we've increased our focus on opportunities to streamline processes that are core to improving the customer and carrier experience and enabling us to decouple volume and headcount growth and drive increased productivity. Shipments per person per day is a key metric that we use to measure our productivity improvements and as Mike mentioned earlier, we've achieved a 12% year-to-date improvement through Q2 as we progress towards our goal of 15% year-over-year improvement by Q4 of this year.In order to reach our 2023 goal, we have accelerated the digital execution of critical touch points in the life cycle of a load, thereby reducing the number of manual tasks per shipment and the time per task. A few areas where we have seen this progress include increasing the automation of in-transit tracking, case management tasks and appointment-related tasks. As Dave mentioned earlier, we've also been using machine learning, artificial intelligence and our large data estate to improve outcomes for our customers and carriers.But machine learning alone has limitations due to a need for standardization. Generative AI and large language models have the ability to work with unstructured and incomplete data and unstructured task flows to create an automation unlock. One example of where this can be used is in order management. Over the years, manual processes or workarounds have been put in place to serve our customers and carriers in customized and therefore, unstructured ways such as receiving orders and providing quotes through e-mail.As you can imagine, these have highly variable levels of information completeness and a fragmented mix of formats. Generative AI can be used to fill in the blanks, whether it's incomplete and unstructured information in a highly automated and efficient process. Our early testing and results from Generative AI are promising, and we're excited about the potential for this technology to be an accelerant to automation and productivity improvements and to magnify our information advantage.With that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his final comments.David P. BozemanThanks, Arun. C.H. Robinson is a great company with the largest market share, the most developed freight brokers network, long-standing relationships with global blue-chip customers, deep carrier relations, strong technology and a larger data set than any other market participant. While the near-term freight environment presents some challenges, the strength of our people, scale network, financial model and investments in improving efficiency position us well for the eventual rebound.I see an opportunity for the company to reach its full potential and create more shareholder value by improving our value proposition, increasing our market share, accelerating growth, improving our efficiency and operating margins and increasing overall profitability. Robinson has great people with a passion for winning and the grit, grind and hustle needed to innovate and solve challenges for our customers and carriers.To enable greater agility and flexibility and to accelerate our clock speed, I'm empowering our people to uncover new ways to challenge the status quo, move faster and act boldly to better anticipate our customers' needs, exceed their expectations and make us indispensable. Shippers are looking for stable and innovative logistics partners. Robinson has shown the strength of its model through cycles. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, and we plan to invest in initiatives that we expect to amplify the expertise of our people and generate high returns on investment. I'm excited about our opportunities and our future. This concludes our prepared remarks.I'll turn it back to Donna now for the Q&amp;A portion of the call.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Today's first question is coming from Jack Atkins of Stephens.Jack Lawrence AtkinsDave, congratulations on your new role at C.H. Robinson. So I guess I'd love to start going back to something that you mentioned in both your prepared remarks and also in the press release, it's making C.H. Robinson essential. I guess my first question is just broadly like what is -- what about C.H. Robinson right now isn't essential? Because I look at a company with unparalleled scale in the marketplace, a leading technology platform. What do you think you need to do differently as a company to really make yourself essential in what is ultimately a highly commoditized part of the transportation supply chain, which is brokerage.David P. BozemanYes. Thanks, Jack, and pleasure to virtually meet you. I look forward to meeting you in person here over the coming weeks. When I think about that question, Jack, it's a couple of things. You're right, and I agree with you. C.H. Robinson is essential, and it's going to continue. As I look at it's going to continue to have a situation where we can pick up customers organically. So everyone sees the value and the advantage of doing business with Robinson. And some of the ways of doing that is, I consider myself a lean practitioner, as I said in my comments, driving the company to think faster, act faster, reduce waste, these are things that are going to take a strong company and make it stronger, right? And we're going to be laser-focused on that.Speed is imperative, but speed is powerful, Jack, as you know. And in this market with this scale, as this company continues to increase its clock speed as it continues to use technology as an enabler with its people. I think that is going to just enhance us to allow us to drive profitable growth and continue to, along with our strong balance sheet, it just makes me excited and validates why I chose to come here. So that's what I'd say to that.OperatorThe next question is coming from Scott Group of Wolfe Research.Scott H. GroupCongrats, Dave. Look forward to meeting you next week. I guess the near-term question and a longer-term question. Just help us think about the puts and takes on net revenue -- sequential net revenue and earnings trends from second quarter to third quarter, do you think we should be higher or lower? And then just, Dave, maybe too early to ask, but just as I think about the margin opportunity longer term that you talked about, this used to be a 40% net operating margin business this year, probably closer to 20%. What do you think is the right margin range to think about for C.H. over time? Can we get back to where we were?David P. BozemanYes. Thanks. I look forward to meeting you as well. Mike, why don't you jump in? It's a good question, and I'll let you jump in on that.Michael Paul ZechmeisterYes, Scott. First of all, on the first part of your question, just thinking about the outlook on, as you said, net revenue margin or AGP, Q2 to Q3, I'd point to a few things. So first of all, obviously, we're in a market that has been weak. And no matter how you look at it, we've come a long way since Q2 of last year when we were sitting on record highs across the board and particularly in our biggest service lines truckload and ocean.And so as we sit here today, you've got the demand factor and you got the capacity factor. And on the demand side, that's a macroeconomic trend thing. As we look at our shippers and what the way they've been seeing the market and acting. They've been working on inventories here for, geez, it seems like almost a year now. They've been trying to work them down and optimize them. And so have they got there? Are they there yet? Can we expect demand to come back there? We'll see where that heads.On the capacity side, we've been bouncing on the bottom in terms of the cost per mile for carriers in terms of where their breakeven is at. And so qualitatively, I think capacity is probably coming out of the market. I think it's tough for some of the carriers. They're probably more likely now to be parking to truck and finding employment elsewhere given the good economy. And so I think on the capacity side, we probably are close to the bottom. And so as you go forward, one of the things that we provide for you in terms of forecasting is on our website, chrobinson.com, under resources, we've got a section called North American Freight Market Insights, and we provide a forecast of DAT linehaul cost per mile for Van for not only the remainder of 2023, but also we've added another year to it now and we're giving you in 2024.And if you look at that, I think it's really important. And the reason we give you cost is because, as you know, in this market in truckload, price follows cost, and that gets right to the root of the issue for us here in Q2 and probably in Q3, which is because we have a significant portion of our business that is contract where the prices are established and set for most frequently one year, when the cost side of the equation has been coming down like it has and it takes a while, there's a lag there between when we're renegotiating those contracts with shippers. And so there's a lag on pricing, and that's been coming down.And so one of the key things from a margin standpoint for us in the quarter was the fact that price came down 23% but costs came down 19%, and that's that price catching up with cost. That's margin compression for us. So it's not what we would expect going forward. It's -- you see that through the cycle. That's the point in the cycle that we're at right now. And so there's a little bit of extra margin compression there that will work itself out over time as cost leads price.And so when you're back on that website looking at our forecast, you'll see that we've got costs going up for the remainder of this year. We're kind of at the bottom in terms of our forecast now. And then as you get to the holidays, you see a little spike up and then it comes down a little bit and then we see it really getting back to normal as you get through 2024. And so a pretty dramatic increase in cost there. And of course, price will follow as we get into new contracts with our shippers.Scott H. Group40% operating margin?Michael Paul ZechmeisterYes. So on the 40% operating margin, that's the target that we've got out there for NAST. That's been out there for quite a while. There are different dynamics going on there that impact that. But I'll tell you what. We feel really good about the progress that we've made on productivity. We reported the shipments per person per day on NAST. We put a target out there to improve that by 15% on the year. We're 6 months into the year, and we're at 12% already.And that's on the back of some really quality work from the teams looking at where we're spending our dollars, where we're spending our time and taking that waste out of our system and translating that into productivity. So you saw that on those numbers. Those efforts will continue. We're -- we've got plenty to do there on that front. We're really excited about Dave's leadership as a lean practitioner. I believe in those principles and have worked in that environment in the past. It's a really methodical way to find waste and eliminate waste in analytical, data-driven kind of way. And so we'll continue to be able to take costs out there. We talked about machine learning and Generative AI. And I really believe that Robinson is in a unique position in that regard and unique because we have a scaled business with an enormous amount of data. And because of our history, it's, to some extent, unstructured. And so from a machine learning standpoint, the key for us has been to standardize and automate, but one of the great complements from Generative AI is the ability to go in and find inconsistencies, missing data and actually take it through to getting that data and reinserting it and plugging it back into our machine learning. And so there's really some great complementary things there that can help us with our productivity and allow our folks really to focus on quality and more strategic work with our customers. So I think that inside of that, you get growth inside of that, you get efficiency and the growth and efficiency continue to keep us on our 40% operating income margin for NAST. I don't know if Arun, if you've -- covered it, yes.OperatorThe next question is coming from David Vernon of Bernstein.David Scott VernonSo Dave, first question for you is really kind of your background in some of the other maybe more disruptive parts of the brokerage industry that have shown an ability to take quite a bit of share in very short periods of time. What's different about them versus what Robinson has been doing recently? And then how do you think about the moat of C.H. Robinson having been kind of on the other side of the barricades throwing barrels of burning oil at the company. How do you think about the moat of C.H. Robinson?David P. BozemanYes. Good question, and pleasure to virtually meet you as well. The -- you're right, I have been on a couple of sides of this. And number one, I'd say what the players coming in, I feel good about that because the work we did at Amazon when I was there and building some of this new entrant work here. So I understand it. I understand the importance of technology and the power that it can play in the digital transformation here. The key here from a Robinson perspective is I think you have both. And I know the importance of that scale.And I know having scale plus technology will drive that competitive advantage. And as we continue to -- someone asks me said, ""Hey, Dave, what was something that surprised you, right, as you came to Robinson. I'll tell you one of the things that surprised me as you come in and people will say, ""Hey, it's a fax machine company, right, they're older when actually coming in some of the technology and state of the art things that Arun has put in and continues to grow was surprising because this is a company that is really on the leading edge with technology, and then adding scale to it. It just says, and I know this on being on both sides that this is a competitive advantage and really allows the company to set the tone in the marketplace. So that's how I'm answering that from both sides of it. And when you talk about the moat, it's about just making sure we stay focused driving waste out. I just spent a lot of time over the last several weeks doing what I call a gemba, that's a go see, and you actually go see the work. And it taught me a couple of things. One, the strength of our employees that are out there. But two, it allowed me to see the waste and the potential air states in the work so that you can fix them and fix them fast. And as we take this waste out, you'll clearly see the speed of improvement on an already scaled strong business. That's why I feel so happy about where we are and eventually, when this upturn comes, where we will be from a positioning perspective.David Scott VernonAnd maybe just as a quick follow-up. We're talking a lot about lean, we're talking a lot about process improvement. From a -- can you talk to the mandate you have from the Board? Are we really just kind of focused on improving what Robinson does, the how of what it does? Or are we still also looking at the what of it in terms of maybe some structural change to the business. I think there was some discussion with one of the activist shareholders a while back about a strategic committee. Can you give us a sense for kind of what the marching orders are from the Board from your perspective?David P. BozemanYes, I will tell you from the Board, I am locked in with the Board. I have a clear connection with the Board, and that is driving profitable growth for our shareholders and for this company. And it's pretty clear on where we're going to do that. I'm taking my time to diagnose, analyze. I will speak to the Board on when I get through my diagnosis phase, but the true north is, it's continuing to improve this company with profitable growth, and I'm locked in on that. And the principles that I have found successful in this company. I'm just going to bring those forward in Robinson, and I know those are successful to do that.OperatorThe next question is coming from Christopher Kuhn of The Benchmark Company.Christopher Glen KuhnGood to meet you virtually, Dave. I wanted to just go back to your comments when you first started your conversation about taking a look at the portfolio on your thoughts there? And what you're going to be looking for going forward?David P. BozemanYes. Nice to meet you as well. The -- from a portfolio perspective, same thing. It's early days, right, on this. And I'm driving in, but my point is clear is, I'm looking at the entire business and as I said, with an open mind on the portfolio, make no doubt about it, right? There's a clear focus on driving focus within the organization on some of these -- the core business, and we all know truckload and making sure we drive truckload, LTL, ocean air really driving that kind of focus on those portfolios. But -- and then with all the other businesses continuing to evaluate, how we best unlock that additional value for our shareholders. So it's an open-mind approach. It's early days. I'm diagnosing. I'm diagnosing hard. And certainly, we'll come back to that, but I just wanted to give a little bit of color to that.OperatorThe next question is coming from Jason Seidl of TD Cowen.Jason H. SeidlDave, good to meet you and welcome aboard. It sounds like everything is still on the table as you're in your diagnosis mode. So I'm going to sort of laser in on a few things. You talked a lot about some exciting opportunities in Generative AI. And when I look at the electronic opportunities in brokerage, I think sort of the one sticking point has always been sort of getting the drivers over to sort of embrace technology. What are some things that you think C.H. can do better to sort of grow that presence on the driver side?David P. BozemanYes. Pleasure to meet you and great question because there's a lot of ways to go into this. I mean, Arun, why don't you start off? I'll finish on a couple of things here.Arun D. RajanYes. And I think for those of you who've been listening in for a while, is when I came on board, we made sustained investment in our carrier-facing app and website, and we've seen a huge uptake in usage in terms of digital bookings. And from a carrier-facing technology perspective, there's 2 things that carriers care about, right? They care about sort of access to volume and loads, which we have. And they care about a better experience.So things like load recommendations, getting paid fast if they choose to. So it's a better experience. And we've invested a lot in those areas. And like I said, digital bookings are up significantly. And more recently, you probably saw us release or go live with our refreshed Carrier Advantage Program, which is our loyalty program. And with that program, we had certain new requirements of our carriers in terms of providing track and trace -- automated track and trace through the app and through ELD. And what I can say is, carriers ask us when we ask them for things, they say, ""Well, okay, well tell us what you need and when we make that easy to use on the app, they do it. And likewise, we listen to them about what they want and we invest in the carrier experience. So I would say compared to some of our competition, I'd say, we have all the features that our carriers have asked for, and we have the volume of loads that no one can bring to the table.David P. BozemanYes. I would just plus one on that. I agree with a room there in previous experience and seeing the teams build these things that it's about ease of use. It's really about allowing those carriers to get the things that they want, such as pay and access to Lowe's. So I think he hit on all the key points that when you do that, you really net spreads, right, when you hear about the ease of use. So it's a good question. I'm glad you said it because it highlights kind of where we are in this space and where we're going to continue to go. So thanks for asking that.Jason H. SeidlSure. I appreciate the color. And as a quick follow-up, when I look at forwarding on the EBIT margins, if I sort of throw away the inflated numbers on the pandemic side. It looks like you guys have been in the sort of 15% to 20% range. We're sort of probably going to be at the lower end this year at that. What's it going to take to sort of get us towards the higher end and out of the way from the lower end? Is it just going to be an improvement in the overall macro? Or are there other things that you think are going to be low-hanging fruit that can get you there?Michael Paul ZechmeisterYes. Thanks for the question, Jason. You're right. You have to look through the markets that we've experienced here over the past couple of years. Obviously, the comp this quarter is against all-time record highs on record highs from Q2 last year. But our long-term operating income margin goal for Global Forwarding is 30%. We feel like that's achievable. The playbook there is, in a lot of respects, similar to the playbook that we've got on the NAV side. In other words, the team has done a really nice job developing their capability from a technology standpoint.There is plenty of excitement out there around Navisphere 2.0, and that was launched and the customers are having a better experience there. We're seeing monthly average users go up, track and trace better, data quality better, future usage by customers better. So on the tech side, that's great. Operational uniformity is an important element for them there, the standardization in a very complex business to create efficiency. Generative AI can help as well there.Scale is something that the team has been working on. They've done a really nice job here through the ups and downs of the market, to gain market share and increase the scale in that business, which will be important to getting the returns where we need them to be going forward. The -- probably the biggest highlight over the past year has been their expense management. So they've taken headcount down by about 12% year-over-year. And at the same time, they've been able to handle the loads and handle the volume that they've been working on. So that's been a really nice enhancement that should really serve them well once we get back to some more normalization there.And then the last thing I'd say is the development of their business. They've done a nice job of bringing some talent in, in some new geographies. They're looking at new verticals. And they've had a fair amount of success in new trade lines and opening up to some places that they haven't had a developed business in the past. And they're getting excellent results. They're #3 in the transpacific to U.S., #2 into the U.S. and #1 in U.S. Oceana. So a lot of great progress from the team there. And I think all those factors are important in coming together to get back to a more normalized 30% operating income margin.OperatorThe next question is coming from Matthew Spahn of TCW.Matthew J. SpahnCongratulations, Dave, and welcome to C.H. Robinson. I have a question about engagement. When a company is highly engaged employees, quality and delivery improve, and drawing on your prior experiences leading lean transformations, can you share 1 or 2 learnings that you can apply to foster a culture of deeper employee engagement at C.H. Robinson?David P. BozemanYes, great question, Matthew, and pleasure to meet you. This is the coal phase for me, right? I'm meeting everyone for the first time here in some cases. The -- good question. Let me break that down for me and I'll be pretty pointed here. The one engagement that I see is, number one, you really do need to be vocally self-critical about where you are on the things you do well and the things you don't. And having the ability to see employees actually see waste in their processes and be able to understand that, understand what their process flow should be versus what it is, they actually get engaged on that improvement, trying to improve when you're blind is one thing, but improving when it's clear to you, makes for engagement. And so that's one thing as I've gone through various companies. It's the enlightenment and the education around where you are and then the humbleness to show how you can be better. And once that's laid out, employees latch on to that and I've seen it over 4 different companies.Matthew J. SpahnI really appreciate that. I mean it's -- I appreciate that. I mean the culture matters most right now, I mean, you're being I feel like the champion of lean, it's a powerful cultural enabler. So welcome and good luck.David P. BozemanThank you, sir.OperatorThe next question is coming from Stephanie Moore of Jefferies.Stephanie Lynn Benjamin MooreDave, congrats on your first earnings call.David P. BozemanThanks, Stephanie. Appreciate it.Stephanie Lynn Benjamin MooreSo I think a lot was called out in your prepared remarks, I think a number of exciting opportunities going forward. But what do you think is probably the single one most important area you'll place your focus on over the next 12 months? And what is your early read on how to achieve it?David P. BozemanYes. That's a good question, Stephanie. It's one that can take us well past the call, so I won't do that. But I will give you some color on it. The focus is around driving waste out with the endgame of profitable growth. And really getting the organization to latch on to faster speed of decisions, speed of innovation and ultimately, looking around corners to set itself up for what is going to be an eventual turnaround.And that will put us in a very strong position with our scale and our balance sheet. And so just focusing on that and then also technology. We talked a bit about it. Arun talked a bit about it. These large language models, again, don't underestimate just the scale of Robinson and then attaching that level of technology on top of that. I think can be a strong competitive advantage for us. So me focusing on driving that adoption of that type of technology, driving waste out of the system. This all adds up to a profitable growth setup for this company and really puts it in a strong position. I feel really, really strong around where we are, and that's why I decided to take this move.OperatorThe next question is coming from Bruce Chan of Stifel.Jizong ChanDave, congrats. It's good to have you with us. I know it's still pretty early in your tenure here, but I know you've hit the ground running. So maybe I could just coagulate some of the responses and get your perspective on where you see the biggest incremental cost buckets over the intermediate term. We talked a lot about lean and waste, but where specifically do you see the biggest addressable opportunities there?David P. BozemanYes, Bruce, I'm going to double team you here a bit because I'm 4.5, 5 weeks here on my diagnosis there. So I am going to call a comma not a period on this question because I do want to continue to diagnose. But I will tell you this. And as I'm talking with Arun and team, it's breaking down this kind of life of an order and really going through the origination of this order all the way through the end and then understanding those air states and pinch points along the way, that's going to generate kind of where the cost opportunities are along that line, along that side. And I'm in the middle of doing that. I have some points that I see, but it's not complete. And I think Arun sees some of that as well. So I will come back to you on that because it's a fair question, but I'm in the middle of it. Arun, would you add any other color to it?Arun D. RajanYes. I think the color I would add is similar to things that we've been saying over the past, call it, 12 to 18 months. When asked about sort of our path to operating leverage and our focus on digital. Our focus has been looking at the end-to-end order life cycle from quoting to order tender to order entry, to booking, then to appointments, track and trace, invoicing the whole life cycle, right? And the focus of our digital efforts has been looking at those points in the life cycle that are disproportionately and manually intensive.And going after either automation or making self-serve to our customers or our carriers or, in some cases, the processes don't even make sense, their legacy processes and we eliminate them. So that's been the focus. And so now you come in a kind of layer. So in a way, it's about taking out waste. I think it's just that we've come at it more from a technology perspective. I think Dave is going to come in here, and I think he's going to inject Lean principles and as we get the tailwind of Gen AI, I believe the things we've been talking about for the past 12 or 18 months just will accelerate.Jizong ChanOkay. That's super helpful. And then, Dave, a fair point about the brevity of your tenure. So maybe just to follow up a little bit on that and direct the question more again at you, Arun. We've had some nice reductions here in personnel cost. Is the tech and the platform at a place now where we can grow in the next cycle without adding additional resources? Or do we have a little bit more work to do?Arun D. RajanYes. So that's a great question. We obviously have more work to do, but we've talked about 15% productivity improvements this year. The work that we've done to enable that productivity is structural, we can actually measure fewer touches in our system as a result of that work because they've got more automated track and trace information from our carriers, right, which means we don't have to call carriers for status. Similarly, we've reduced the number of automation -- reduce the number of appointment tasks by automating the greater proportion of them. So we actually see touches go down, touches per load go down in a way that we know it's structural as we go into the cycle a positive cycle here.OperatorWe're showing time for one final question today. Our final question will be coming from Chris Wetherbee of Citi.Christian F. WetherbeeCongrats, Dave, I guess, one of the things I guess I've been sitting listening to the call, and there's been discussions sort of big picture and the Generative AI opportunity, those kinds of things. Maybe a 2-parter here. Short term, what do we think headcount looks like through the rest of the year? Are there further opportunities as we move through the rest of the year on the cost? It sounds like you guys are making maybe better progress towards those full year goals. So that would be interesting.And then the second one kind of comes, we've talked about the segment level operating margin targets, relatively similar to what they've been historically and big picture opportunities that maybe would generate greater productivity, potentially cost savings down the road. So just trying to square those to the NAST and the Global Forwarding margin targets relative to the opportunity you guys are talking about with some of these productivity tools. Should there be upside? Or is it the same? I just want to make sure I understand that.Michael Paul ZechmeisterYes, let me take that. So first of all, you're right, we've had great progress on our headcount, down 13% year-over-year. And because of the efforts and initiatives that we have ongoing in place that will continue and really, I think we've got a great pipeline of things to work on. We'll continue to draw that headcount down as we go forward and get to some of these things. Although I would say the back half of '23 won't be nearly as dramatic reductions as we saw in the first half.Now when you talk about those operating targets and the macro things, we're trying to help you understand that we feel like we've got some accelerants here in terms of our ability to improve our performance, our efficiency and get us to growth. And the headlines on those are lean principles, the diagnosing of our issues, finding waste, getting -- eliminating the waste, whether that's with technology, with process, with adoption, with giving self-serve to customers or carriers, these kinds of things.And so that's one accelerant. The other accelerant as we talked about is really the combination of the machine learning work that we've been doing, but then enabled by Generative AI, where it can go in and it can find the exceptions and the work that really our people have been handling here historically, where you build a model that handles things if everything has been input properly. And then in many cases, our staff was going after the exceptions. And so now with Generative AI, we've got the ability to do that in a more automated way and really enable our folks in place them. So those are the key headlines.Christian F. WetherbeeOkay. But they don't necessarily change the curve of those targets. They're just sort of additive to the improvement off of the sort of where we are in the macro is the right way to think about them?Michael Paul ZechmeisterYes, the progress we've made so far, yes.OperatorThank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Ives for closing comments.Charles S. IvesThat concludes today's earnings call. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you again. Have a great evening.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation and interest in C.H. Robinson. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day.]"

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Walt Disney's current trading price of US$85.49 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Walt Disney’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Walt Disney What Is Walt Disney Worth?Walt Disney appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 37.91x is currently well-above the industry average of 27.71x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Walt Disney’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Walt Disney generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Walt Disney's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in DIS’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe DIS should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on DIS for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for DIS, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

With possible alliances ranging from the NFL to the NBA, Disney is navigating to capture market share by capitalizing on sports enthusiasts worldwide.The discussion explores these bullish developments in favor of Disney's value growth.Core growth engineWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with DIS. Click here to check it out. DIS 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DISAccording to Disney, its domestic parks and experiences will continue to deliver exceptional performances. The 50th anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World yielded positive guest responses. While moderation in demand is expected post-celebration, the Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California continues to thrive. Further, the Disney Cruise Line has rebounded strongly following the Covid-19 panemic with a new ship and high occupancy rates.Its international parks, despite challenges, are also ramping up impressively. The Shanghai Disney Resort reported increased volumes and guest spending. With rising volumes and spending, Hong Kong Disneyland's local audience focus has been successful, while mainland China's park volume is increasing. Disneyland Paris is also experiencing higher guest spending and volumes. New attractions, such as Zootopia at Shanghai Disney Resort and Frozen-themed areas at Hong Kong Disneyland, may continue to boost its international performance.Notably, post-pandemic, Disney implemented sophisticated yield management strategies and invested in technology to predict park attendance, manage labor and optimize promotions and pricing. The precision enables more effective targeting of consumers and navigating economic uncertainties. The data-driven ticketing strategy allows flexibility in pricing, enhancing adaptability to market fluctuations.Story continuesDisney's Winning PlaybookSource: Earnings presentationDisney's accumulation of guest data may lead to enhanced experiences and align with its long-term goals. Integrating data across business sectors, such as media streaming (Disney+), movies and theme parks, is a priority. The data-driven approach targets providing personalized experiences and meeting individual preferences while boosting commercial gains.The company may continue to leverage the substantial data it collects from its theme parks to enhance customer experiences and drive growth across its various businesses. With about 30,000 rooms in its Florida parks alone and vast visitor foot traffic, Disney capitalizes on data insights for personalized offerings. Investments in technology have refined the understanding of guests, enhancing their experiences while maximizing asset utilization.In detail, Disney is investing in technology to simplify navigation within the vast parks, enhancing guest satisfaction. Additionally, pricing strategies are being adapted with variable and flexible pricing to accommodate different guest segments, making the experience more accessible. Changes like relaxing certain guidelines and reworking pricing aim to reduce complexity and make the park experience more enjoyable.While Disney has lowered its capital investment guidance, its growth strategies remain unchanged. Capital is strategically deployed to enhance capacity and invest in technology to improve and simplify guest experiences. For instance, the company remains committed to significant investments in Florida, planning to spend $17 billion over the next decade. Recent projects like the Tron attraction at Walt Disney World highlight this approach.Moreover, the growth prospects extend beyond optimizing existing footprints. Initiatives like Disneyland Forward are exploring opportunities to expand theme park capacities and attractions. The influx of new intellectual property from successful franchises like Marvel and Star Wars enriches the content offered in the parks. Such IP-driven experiences continue to attract a diverse range of visitors.Strategically, operational costs have been prioritized, with cost-cutting measures implemented during the pandemic. These efforts aimed to maintain guest experiences while rationalizing expenses. The company remains committed to efficient operations, utilizing technology to streamline processes and enhance margins while preserving the frontline workforce.On the downside, the closure of the Star Wars Galactic Star Cruiser was explained as a decision driven by performance. While it was a unique and well-received experience, it needed to meet expectations. The accelerated depreciation of the Star Cruiser will lead to about $100 million to $150 million in the third and fourth quarters.Regarding consumer products, Disney's robust intellectual property is an interconnected nexus for growth. The company's leading position as a licenser, top children's publisher and leader in the gaming business may contribute to the Disney Parks, Experiences and Products segment's potential for expansion.The ESPN factorDisney looks to also benefit from possible strategic partnerships with major sports leagues like the NFL, NBA and MLB, which could secure premium content for its sports network ESPN and navigate the challenges of the evolving media landscape. By exploring such partnerships, the company aims to position itself advantageously in the long term.Fundamentally, these collaborations provide several advantages to Disney. First, gaining access to top-tier sports content would enhance ESPN's programming lineup. This high-demand content can attract a dedicated viewer base and drive subscriptions. As linear TV businesses and traditional cable bundles decline, leveraging strong sports content on a streaming platform like ESPN+ could foster customer loyalty and attract new subscribers.Further, aligning with major sports leagues could create revenue-sharing models, potentially involving minority ownership stakes in ESPN. While the risk of conflicts of interest and competition concerns exists, the overall benefit could outweigh these challenges.Disney's move to transition ESPN fully over the top as a direct-to-consumer platform is a high-stakes gamble as some challenges, such as consumer willingness to pay for standalone sports streaming services and the oversaturation of the streaming market, could be bearish catalysts,Disney's Winning PlaybookSource: Yahoo FinanceIn practical terms, leveraging its vast content library and expertise in entertainment, Disney can explore and enter strategic partnerships that offer complementary value. For instance, possible collaborations with tech players like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has its own virtual reality headset and a strong foothold in the sports streaming arena. Partnerships like this could facilitate global distribution, which is crucial for the profitability of the streaming business.Credit ratingDisney may gain significant benefits over the long term from the affirmation of an A- credit rating and a positive outlook from S&amp;P Global.As mentioned previously, Disney can optimize its business mix and enhance its profitability by exploring strategic options for ESPN and linear television. This proactive approach aligns with the company's goal to improve cash flow and reduce leverage. The potential sale of non-core networks and alternate paths for ESPN, such as standalone operations or strategic partnerships, demonstrate the company's efforts to find innovative solutions to bolster its credit quality (which may be an A).Further, Disney's focus on content quality and the evaluation of its portfolio can lead to improved profitability. Addressing overproduction issues and considering price hikes and market shifts for Disney+ signifies the company's motives to evolve its offerings in response to market dynamics. Licensing its content to rival streamers may create additional revenue streams and expand its reach.S&amp;P's expectation of Disney's lower leverage, driven by enhanced cash flow from reduced DTC losses, improved parks and cost-saving measures, bodes well for its financial stability. The anticipation of realizing $5.5 billion in cost savings and the company's adaptability to the decline of U.S. linear TV further supports its long-term financial health.Nevertheless, Disney can hit an A credit rating based on the effective resolution of the Hulu put-call, profitable streaming transition and effective management of acquisitions.TakeawayIn conclusion, the strategic evolution of Disney across its theme parks, sports partnerships and credit management paints a bullish trajectory for the company's future. Disney's theme parks have shown resilience as its domestic and international parks are thriving, backed by data-driven strategies. Investments in technology, pricing and expansion position the company for robust growth. By capitalizing on sports alliances, its ESPN+ aims to capture a loyal subscriber base while leveraging partnerships.Amid dynamic market shifts, Disney's multi-faceted strategies may support bullish value momentum over the long term.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Now, its revenue is declining, and Bob Iger is looking to sell a stake",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/espn-used-disney-cash-cow-190702041.html,1691089622,STORY,['DIS'],"[The Mouse House isn’t sure what to do with its languishing cash cow, ESPN.The sports network, once a financial engine for Disney, is suffering a decline in revenue owing to the slow death of traditional cable TV. Though ESPN is still profitable, Disney is looking to sell off a stake and transform the business into a digital streaming company, though near-term plans for that are unclear.Disney CEO Bob Iger told CNBC in July that he wants “strategic partners that could either help us with distribution or content.”ESPN has long been the reliable moneymaker of the media and entertainment giant. In the first half of 2023, Disney’s cable networks division, led by ESPN and its sister channels, generated $14 billion in revenue and $3 billion in profit. But revenue for those six months is down 6% from what it was a year earlier, and profit dropped 29%, according to the New York Times. Disney does not break out ESPN’s finances separately.Since Disney acquired it in 1996, ESPN’s revenue—which largely comes from cable fees and advertisements—has played a major role in Disney’s growth, helping pay for the acquisitions of Marvel, Lucasfilm, Pixar, and 21st Century Fox, along with building its streaming service, Disney+.Iger recently enlisted the help of former high-ranking Disney execs Tom Staggs and Kevin Mayer. Both Staggs and Mayer were considered candidates for the chief executive position in 2020, until Bob Chapek was hired and then quickly fired, with Iger returning as a “boomerang CEO” in November 2022.Mayer and Staggs’ return was originally reported by Puck, saying they will consult with Iger and ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro on the future of the sports network, and, to a lesser degree, Disney’s other TV networks like ABC.Pitaro said the company had seen “a healthy level of interest” from sports leagues as well as technology, marketing, and distribution companies for buying a stake in the business.Disney did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.Story continuesDeath of a (cable) salesmanCable subscribers are an endangered species.Since streaming platforms started their rise in the mid-2000s, cable television has been on the decline. In the first quarter of 2023, cable and live TV providers lost 2.31 million subscribers, Cord Cutters News reported.Streaming platforms offer cheaper subscription options and let viewers watch what they want, when they want from their massive libraries of shows and movies. The average cable bill is over $200 a month, according to U.S. News &amp; World Report. In comparison, the standard Netflix subscription plan is $15.49 a month.ESPN’s two main revenue streams rely on cable: affiliate fees from cable providers and ads. Affiliate fees are monthly fees paid by cable providers for the right to offer ESPN channels to households. ESPN collected around $626 million in affiliate fees in 2022, according to the New York Times, citing S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.In terms of advertising, ESPN has earned over $2 billion annually in recent years, the New York Times reported.Iger told CNBC that ESPN will transition to a streaming service model, but declined to share the time frame. However, in later reporting, sources told CNBC that a new direct-to-consumer product won’t be ready to launch before 2025.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

The company also reported a $3 million loss in its streaming segment after seeing a $50 million profit in the first quarter. Rich Greenfield, LightShed Partners partner is joining us now. Rich, it's good to see you here. So what-- give us sort of your big-picture take first of all on these numbers?RICH GREENFIELD: Look, they are delivering on what they said in terms of free cash flow. There's no doubt David Zaslav and team are getting the cash out of this business. They've dramatically restructured, radically reduced cost. They are generating far more cash flow than investors expected when this transaction closed last year. I think the challenge and what you're seeing in terms of the weighing on the stock today is the fact that the advertising environment is just not picking up.You know, you had a lot of media companies, legacy media companies early in the year talking about sort of a second half recovery, and that you'd see a ramp in advertising or improvement. And it's improving, but off of a much lower base and you're still looking at pretty sizable declines in advertising. Whether we're talking NBC Universal, whether we're talking Warner Brothers Discovery, all of these companies are seeing the TV ad market just be terrible, recession or not.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Well, and it doesn't help if you're losing subscribers, right? I mean, like how is Max? Is Max competitive, like--RICH GREENFIELD: Yeah. I wouldn't read too much into that.JULIE HYMAN: OK.RICH GREENFIELD: No, but I wouldn't read too much into that. Part of that is, you know, remember, there's Discovery Plus subscribers in that number, and they folded Discovery Plus into Max. So when HBO Max became Max, it now includes Discovery Plus, and there were subscribers who took both services. So I think some attrition is not unexpected, there's still in terms of the size of Max relative to its peer group, Max is doing just fine.So I don't-- the stock is not down because Max lost a little subscribers. I think if anything, the Max rebrand has gone pretty well. I think the service works better. I mean, if you've tried downloading a show on Max versus the old HBO, the new interface is far better. I think this is more about they guided to the bottom end of their-- you know, they had a range of 11 and 11 and 1/2 billion of EBITDA. They got it to the bottom end of that range.They took down sort of their advertising guidance for the rest of the calendar year. I think that's sort of what's weighing on WBD, as well as the sector at large because the headwinds facing Warner Brothers are no different than the headwinds facing Disney, I mean, you saw Iger on CNBC the other day. This whole sector is facing very significant headwinds.- You know, Rich, it got a little bit of a mention in the release from Warner Brothers today, of course, the strike that we're seeing in Hollywood right now impacts may be mixed in the second quarter for a lot of these companies. How are you thinking about that longer term for the space?RICH GREENFIELD: Look, I'm just worried the strike is going to last until October, November. I mean, I don't sense any real progress. Yes, talks are going to theoretically restart tomorrow with the writers. But I think you've got a long road ahead. And from everyone I talk to in Hollywood, I think people are sort of prepared that we may not be fully back in action until sometime in November, even towards Thanksgiving. And that's going to be very disruptive to the business of Hollywood in Q4.And look, it also just drives consumers to watch more catalog, to watch more overseas content, to watch more YouTube. Like this is not the right-- you know, there's probably never a good time for a strike to be honest, but I think given the alternatives the consumer has today versus what they might have had 10 and 20 years ago, this is far more devastating to this industry than I think both sides realize.JULIE HYMAN: And I wonder how you think these different companies are navigating it. I guess what I want to ask about is leadership of the big media companies and studios, whether it's Iger, whether it's Zaslav, whether it's Bakish, like have these-- you know, and whether it's the strike or the slowing ad market. How are these guys doing? Are they doing a good job navigating this?RICH GREENFIELD: Look, all of these companies were too late to embrace streaming, right? There's no doubt they waited too long to go to streaming. They saw what Netflix was doing. And they jumped on the bandwagon. You know, Disney was the one who really started it with Disney Plus, but then everyone else jumped on it. Now, they're all realizing that their core business, which is cable network, broadcast and cable networks, they're all realizing those businesses are in secular revenue decline.Advertising is going down. Affiliates, which is the fees paid by cable and satellite operators to cable networks. Those fees are now going down. So the whole top line of this industry is in secular decline, and sports rights and costs keep going up. And I think that's what's spooking investors. It's why Iger is talking about spinning off linear TV, needing partners for ESPN. Like, this is the sort of the sickness that's sort of plaguing this entire legacy media industry.And so you say who's leading? I think all of these executives have been caught a little flat footed. I think, you know, Zaslav has probably been one of the most upfront of the challenges and recognizing, hey, we got to cut this aggressively. And you see that in the free cash flow. I mean, there's no doubt they are deleveraging faster than investors expected because he realized there is no growth story left in the linear business.- Yeah. And Rich I wanted to ask a little bit about the sports rights picture, you know, maybe a little bit smaller for Warner than some of their other peers. But just where that fits in because as an outsider, you know, I see the salary cap going up for all the leagues, I see the rights projections going way higher, and yet you see the stocks and what's going on the dynamic you're talking about doesn't really add up to me.RICH GREENFIELD: Look, you're seeing it in local, right? The local sports side is imploding. If you look at Diamond sports which went bankrupt, it was owned by Sinclair Broadcasting. There's no doubt that local sports has imploded, and you're seeing all of the after effects of that right now. The question is going to be, is the local sports problem going to play out in national over the next few years? And look, it's possible it doesn't because you have digital players like Apple and Amazon and even Google that have come in.You know, Google Sunday Ticket, Amazon's bought Thursday Tonight Football, you're seeing Apple do MLS and probably do Pac-12 now. But look, all signs point to if the way you pay for sports is advertising and affiliate fees, meaning the cable and satellite fees, if those are the way you pay for sports rights and those fees are going down, it is hard, very hard to comprehend how sports rights keep going up. And that's going to be the challenge. And why the leagues so desperately need the digital players to step in because I don't think these legacy media companies are going to be able to keep paying more for rights as their revenues go down.JULIE HYMAN: So Rich, circling back around to Warner Brothers specifically. Zaslav on the call was asked about sports. He was asked about other things like the international push and licensing content. There's-- whatever of these media companies you're talking about, there's a lot of different facets, right? What does he need to be prioritizing for Warner Brothers right now?RICH GREENFIELD: Look, I think the question is, how much sports does he really need? Can he get out of-- you know, he pays a billion to a year for the NBA. Is there a way to create a smaller package where he, you know, reduces cost or at least holds costs? I mean, I think that's what investors are trying to understand. You heard a couple of the questions about sports.Like, I think everyone's trying to understand, you know, it's great that they're cutting costs right now, how much control of the cost structure do they have looking out over the next few years as the sports rights come up for bid, and can they resist-- you know, I think they're really going to look to Zaslav and hold him to it, can he resist overspending on sports rights given what's happening on the top line?JULIE HYMAN: It's a good question. We'll see. A little suspense here. Rich Greenfield, thank you so much. Always great to catch up with you, LightShed Partners partner.RICH GREENFIELD: Thanks for having me.JULIE HYMAN: Thank you.]"

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, August 3, 2023. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Aaron Milford, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.Aaron L. MilfordHello, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Magellan's second quarter financial results. Before getting started, we must remind you that management will be making forward-looking statements as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such statements are based on our current judgments regarding the factors that could impact the future performance of Magellan and our pending merger with ONEOK, but actual outcomes could be materially different. You should review the risk factors and other information discussed in our filings with the SEC and form your own opinions about Magellan's future performance as well as our pending merger. As disclosed in our press release this morning, Magellan delivered another solid quarter. Our second quarter results beat our expectations due to higher contributions from commodity-related activities as well as a higher proportion of longer-haul shipments and associated higher average tariffs on our refined product system. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Jeff Holman, to review the highlights from our second quarter earnings, then I'll be back to discuss our expectations for the year and our pending merger with ONEOK before answering your questions.Story continuesJeffrey L. HolmanThanks, Aaron. First, let me note that I'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial metrics, including distributable cash flow or DCF and free cash flow. And we've included exhibits to our earnings release that reconcile these metrics to their nearest GAAP measures. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter net income of $239 million compared to $354 million in second quarter 2022, which included a $162 million gain from the sale of our independent terminals network. Excluding that prior period gain, the year-over-year increase was driven by higher profits from our commodity-related activities as well as a larger contribution from our core fee-based transportation and terminal services. Adjusted earnings per unit for the quarter, which excludes the impact of commodity-related mark-to-market adjustments, was $1.23, which, as Aaron just mentioned, exceeded our guidance of $1.10. DCF for the quarter increased to $312 million, up nearly $84 million from last year, while free cash flow for the quarter was $271 million, resulting in free cash flow after distributions of $59 million. A detailed description of quarter-over-quarter variances is available in our earnings release. So as usual, I'll just speak to a few highlights. Starting with refined products. We reported second quarter operating profit of $234 million, which were $67 million higher than second quarter 2022 primarily due to higher average transportation rates as well as higher product margin. The higher average transportation rates were driven largely by the midyear 2022 increase in our tariffs of about 6% on average. In addition, the current period continued to benefit from more long-haul shipments, which moved at higher rates, in part as a result of ongoing refinery disruptions. Product margin increased between periods primarily due to both higher gas liquids blending margins and sales volumes as well as lower unrealized losses in the current period related to our hedging activities. Our realized blending margins doubled year-over-year to more than $0.80 per gallon versus closer to $0.40 per gallon in the prior year period. Turning to our crude oil business. Second quarter operating profit was $61 million, down $12 million from the '22 period primarily due to lower revenues from our condensate splitter, in part due to lower rates provided for in the splitter extension contract executed last year as well as lower storage revenues in the current period. Otherwise, transportation revenue increased slightly due to additional volume moves. Longhorn volumes averaged a little over 245,000 barrels per day, up from just over 200,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of '22 due to higher third-party volumes resulting from additional volume commitments. Volumes on our Houston distribution system increased versus the prior year period, in part due to higher shipments from the new pipeline connection that was ramping up in 2022. Since these shipments move at a lower rate than long-haul volumes, this increased HDS activity resulted in a lower average rate for the segment overall. Crude oil product margin increased versus the prior year period due to higher contributions from our crude oil marketing activities as well as favorable mark-to-market adjustments on futures contracts in the current quarter. Moving on to our crude oil joint ventures. BridgeTex volumes were about 90,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of '23, down from approximately 215,000 barrels per day in 2022 due to lower volumes from committed shippers. This volume decrease reflects the low prevailing Midland differential and the highly competitive nature of the crude business in general and of the Permian Basin in particular, which we have noted for some time, while again emphasizing the importance of having take-or-pay commitments from high-quality counterparties. Saddlehorn volumes reached a new record of about 265,000 barrels per day compared to approximately 220,000 barrels per day the year before as a result of higher shipments for both committed and uncommitted shippers. Just briefly touching on expenses, G&amp;A increased by approximately $18 million between periods for our refined and crude segments combined due to higher incentive compensation costs and to approximately $10 million of merger-related costs incurred in the second quarter. In terms of liquidity, we continue to have a $1 billion credit facility available and at quarter end had no borrowings outstanding on our commercial paper program. As of June 30, the face value of our long-term debt remained unchanged at $5 billion with a weighted average interest rate on net debt of about 4.4%. Lastly, our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.1x for compliance purposes. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Aaron.Aaron L. MilfordThank you, Jeff. We continue to anticipate the transaction with ONEOK will close during the third quarter of this year and remain confident that the value created by this transaction for unitholders is superior to the value of our standalone alternative, including on an after-tax basis. That said, based on our second quarter performance, we believe it's appropriate to update 2023 financial expectations ignoring future potential merger-related costs for Magellan on a standalone basis. Our revised full year outlook highlights the quality of our assets and the ability of our businesses to continue to drive value through a stronger combined company once the pending merger with ONEOK is complete. We now expect to generate $1.26 billion of DCF for 2023 on a standalone basis, again, excluding merger-related costs. This increase reflects better-than-expected performance during the second quarter and continued strong commodity margins expected for the remainder of the year. On the commodity front, we have hedged more than 3/4 of our forecasted fall 2023 gas liquids blending activity at this point for an average margin of $0.60 per gallon. All in, our full year 2023 expectations currently include an average blending margin of $0.70 per gallon, which compares favorably to the $0.50 we generated last year and our 5-year average margin of $0.45 per gallon. We have also made excellent progress hedging next spring with more than 70% of spring 2024 hedged at a $0.65 margin per gallon. We have also increased our refined products tariff rates midyear -- excuse me, we also increased our refined product tariff rates consistent with our most recent guidance. The increase -- we increased the 30% of our markets that are subject to the FERC index by 13% and the remaining 70% of our markets by an average of 11%, which equates to an all-in average refined products tariff increase of approximately 11.5% effective July 1. Turning back to our pending merger with ONEOK. We continue to be confident in the strength and durability of Magellan's business. And we further believe just as confidently that the value unitholders will receive through our combination with ONEOK is full and fair and that it'll be difficult to capture this value on our own. Prior to the announcement of the merger, we consistently and frequently shared our views that Magellan was undervalued and in response, have repurchased 12% of our outstanding equity since 2020. The same analysis we used to conclude that repurchasing MMP equity created value for our unitholders also formed the basis for our conclusion that a merger with ONEOK delivers more present value than we could likely realize standalone. Magellan has always been focused on delivering superior value to unitholders. Tax considerations are very important to our unitholders. It's something we've spent a great deal of time considering, especially recently in connection with the pending transaction. What is clear to us is that the ONEOK transaction delivers more value to our unitholders than Magellan standalone, even on an after-tax basis. Robert Willens, a respected tax expert, reached a similar conclusion. I would highly encourage you, if you haven't done so already, to visit MaximizingValueforMMPunitholders.com to read Mr. Willens' work along with other information about the pending merger and why we are confident the transaction is in the best interest of unitholders. We've had the opportunity to speak with many investors, analysts, employees and customers. And overall, the feedback has been positive. We are pleased to see that a lot of investors are coming to understand the rationale of the transaction as we have tried to clarify some of the initial confusion in the market around the tax impact. And as we and ONEOK progress our integration planning and communicate more detail on anticipated synergies, we are confident investors will become even more excited about the combination. It's clear that the market is starting to reflect some of the potential value of the combined company. While trading prices of our units and ONEOK shares will continue to move around, as recently as July 26, ONEOK shares closed at $67.60 per share. At that price, Magellan unitholders would have received a value of $70.08 per unit based on the terms of the transaction, nearly a 27% premium to the market price of our units prior to announcing the merger. Operator, we are now ready to answer questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Theresa Chen with Barclays.Theresa ChenAaron, on the deal itself, so since the announcement came out and the materials have been released since then, you faced some public opposition from your holders. Can you speak to your view on this? And also just which inning are you in related to the education process for both your institutional and retail owners?Aaron L. MilfordWell, as we continue to talk to investors, as I said in my prepared remarks, overall, the reception has been positive. We're spending a lot of time communicating and clarifying, frankly, a lot of misunderstandings around the tax impact of this transaction. And then as we go forward from here, we expect to be talking in more detail about the synergies from the transaction. And as we communicate that, people are beginning to understand our rationale. So the inning that we're in, to answer the second part of your question, the inning that we're in is -- I would say that we're in the first inning. We've got a full game ahead of us, and we're prepared to see it through to the ninth inning. And we think we're going to be successful because the merits of the deal when accurately communicated, we think, are very compelling.Theresa ChenGot it. And since you have the full game ahead of you, if it's not enough time from now until September 21, what are the next steps? Would you just choose to adjourn and hold it on another date? And if you can give us some color about what you expect, that would be helpful.Aaron L. MilfordWell, first of all, we have the shareholder meeting scheduled for September 21. We think that's plenty of time, and that's where we're focused.OperatorOur next question is from Spiro Dounis with Citi.Spiro Michael DounisFirst question, maybe just to hit on the commodity activities, pretty strong this quarter but kind of seasonal. So just curious if you guys can maybe walk through that a little bit further. Just seems like maybe you're doing something differently there to sort of squeeze out those extra margins. And I guess as you look forward, it sounds like you feel pretty good about the ratability of that. So once again, just more detail on how that's working.Aaron L. MilfordYes. So let's break it apart into its 2 pieces and talk first about the margin. We've just had a very favorable setup when you look at our gas liquids blending margin in the sense that we've had relatively strong gasoline prices, and we've had an NGL market that has been a little weaker than what you might think. And that drives a wider margin available for us. So the margins have just been better. The basis differential, you may recall in the past, we talked about basis being a bit of a headwind for us. And so far this year, it's been less of a headwind than we had anticipated coming in. So we're looking at just wider margins, gross margins in the first place. And we're also not feeling quite the headwinds on the basis differential that we otherwise expected. That's the margin picture. We see that remaining fairly consistent for the rest of the year based on what we see at the moment. The other part of the overall performance is just volume. We're just doing, as a company, a better job of capturing all the opportunities that are available to us and part of that process in terms of, again, just being better at it. So it's a volume story as well. Volumes are higher, margins wider and the outperformance as a result of both.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.Jeremy Bryan TonetJust want to talk about the business a little bit if I could. Just curious with regards to fundamental trends as far as product demand trends have been materializing. In your markets, across your footprint, how has that materialized versus expectations so far? And I guess on a go-forward look, how do you see things kind of normalizing there?Aaron L. MilfordSo we're going to have a very stable and healthy business. When you look at the second quarter of this year, gasoline was down. Distillate was up. It's not unusual for us to see some swings, and the commodities were actually moving. But we expect demand to stay relatively stable and in some areas, be growing, especially as we are able to extend our system. We have our pipeline system expansion in West Texas coming online fully in the beginning of 2024. So as we think about those opportunities to extend our market, that will provide some growth to us. But the fundamentals, we think, are fairly stable, which means we'll have a slowly growing volume trend, we think, over the immediate period. So we think that sets up very well and just highlights the consistency of our business going forward. We also outperformed in the quarter, as Jeff and I mentioned, due to longer-haul movements on our pipeline. So that's been a real bright spot for us. The longer hauls are primarily driven when there are refinery disruptions. And as refinery disruptions happen since we're connected to almost 50% of the refining capacity in the U.S., just because the refinery may be suffering some short-term headwinds, the demand is still there, and it has to be served. And we tend to move barrels into those markets to fill those holes when refineries are down. So that allows us to see longer-haul volumes. Now it's a little unpredictable of when those longer-haul volumes may show up, but they do. And so when you look at a very stable business, slight growth through the extension combined with just the optionality of our system, we're going to have a really stable, high-performing business. And when you look at the combined company, you fast forward to the pro forma company and you think about the strength of our business inside that combined company and the strength of ONEOK's business and you put those together, we think it's going to be a really compelling pro forma company.Jeremy Bryan TonetGot it. That's very helpful there. And just want to touch on exports if I could, particularly, I guess, Permian crude oil exports between Corpus and Houston, how you see that dynamic playing out over time? And any thoughts, I guess, on LPG exports as well to the extent you're able to comment on that?Aaron L. MilfordYes. I don't have any comments on the LPG side. But on petroleum products generally, we expect exports to continue to grow from the United States, whether that's refined products or components or crude oil. We just see world demand pulling those resources into that market. It needs them. On crude specifically, Corpus is still the predominant export port out of the United States due to its proximity to the Permian and lower cost logistics generally to get into that market as well as the terminal infrastructure that's there. We talked in the past about through time, Corpus, we expect to fill up from the pipeline capacity into that market. We don't know yet to the extent that capacity will expand. It will expand some, we expect. But as Corpus fills and as Houston's capabilities continue to evolve, we'll start seeing more barrels start heading towards Houston through time in order to meet that, again, growing export demand worldwide.Jeremy Bryan TonetGot it. That's helpful. And just one last one on the deal if I could ask. I think in response to earlier questions, you said it, I think, in the early innings here, maybe the first inning. Just wondering from the outside as far as this process is concerned, how can we see, I guess, things are progressing as far as getting the boat out there, getting people to show up and how things are progressing towards a successful deal? What can we see from the outside? When do we know we're at the seventh inning stretch?Aaron L. MilfordWell, I think that's a good question. And so if we're in the first inning, we have a game plan to reach our investors, make sure we're communicating the merits of this transaction. And we're going to execute that game plan. And my expectation is that game plan is going to take us from the first inning all the way to the ninth inning. And we're not going to let up on that game plan. We've got the website set up, where investors who have questions can go get answers. We have outreach plan. We're talking to investors that call us. So we're talking to everyone all the time between now and we get to our special meeting day. So when I say we're in the first inning, that's the -- in this metaphor, the game that we're in. We're in the first inning. We're getting started. We're going to execute our game plan. We're going to execute all the way till the end of the game. And then we're confident if we do that, the merits of this transaction will be well understood, and we'll be successful in getting our vote. But when will we know we get to the seventh inning stretch? I'm not sure I'm worried about the seventh inning stretch. I'm worried about getting to the end of the metaphorical game here.OperatorAnd our next question is from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.Keith T. StanleyJust one question for me. I wanted to follow-up on the longer-haul movements and some of the refinery disruption impacts. So the average refined products pipeline tariff was very high for the quarter even putting the normal increase aside. It just seemed meaningful, the impact of some of those longer-haul movements. But any other comment you can make on that and expectations for the balance of the year?Aaron L. MilfordYes. So if you think of the second quarter and you isolate it, we estimate that long-haul movements positively impacted that quarter -- or the second quarter by about $20 million, to your point. It was significant. Now you also have to consider the refinery disruption environment in the second quarter. You had several refineries down in Texas, in particular, that you wouldn't normally expect to have sort of those refineries down at the same time in the manner that they were for as long as they were down. So I think it's a bit of a unique event in the second quarter that we have to be careful not to extrapolate to virtually every quarter from here on out. But for the second quarter, it was significant, like as I said, $20 million. And they're difficult to predict. I mean, that's the nature of them. What we know is to the extent they occur, we generally benefit from them.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question is a follow-up from Spiro Dounis.Spiro Michael DounisSorry. Back again. Just had one more follow-up related to the deal, a 2-part question on it though. One, I guess, curious on the customer side of things. We've got a sense now where your investors' heads are at or going. But curious what the customer receptivity has been in the last few months. And then number two, this is maybe tougher to answer. But as you think about the sort of units held on swap, I'm curious if you've been able to garner any sort of consensus on what the broker voting policy is there.Aaron L. MilfordYes. So let's take the -- your first question first, which is the reaction from our customers. And what I have been hearing is a positive reaction. But it's also important to keep in mind that we value customer service, and that hasn't changed. So all throughout this pending merger, our customers, we've been working really hard to make sure they don't feel any difference in how we treat them and what they expect from us. So from that perspective, our customers, they're still getting the same service they've always gotten, and we expect them to continue to get it. So the fact that there hasn't -- there's been a positive reaction to the deal overall and that our customers are happy, that's because we're continuing to make sure we do what we need to do to make sure they stay happy. So on that front, there's not really a lot of news there, quite frankly. To your question on the swap, so those that hold units via swap, there are some brokers that essentially can facilitate those units being voted based on the wishes of the holder. There are others that don't. Where people are, I don't have -- I don't know exactly how to break that down for you in terms of what percentage can or can't. But we do know there are swap counterparties that will allow those that hold our units on swap to make their interest known and vote accordingly. So it's a bit of a mixed bag. But we think total swap ownership, just to put it in perspective, is probably under 10%, give or take. Does that answer your question?Spiro Michael DounisYes. No, no, it does. I appreciate you taking a stab at it. I know it was a tough one, Aaron. So I always appreciate the color, guys. I'll leave it there.Aaron L. MilfordYes. And just to follow up on that, Spiro, there have been folks we know on swap that have been moving their positions to make sure they can vote. And we think that's positive. So I'd be remiss not mentioning that as well.OperatorMr. Milford, there are no further questions at this time. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.Aaron L. MilfordThank you for your time today. We remain confident in the strength of Magellan's business and look forward to becoming a valuable contributor to a larger, more diversified company following investor approval of our pending merger with ONEOK. And we look forward to continuing our discussions with investors in the coming weeks. We appreciate your continued support and encourage all investors to vote for Magellan's pending merger with ONEOK ahead of our special meeting on September 21, and have a good day.OperatorAnd that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation and kindly ask that you please disconnect your lines.]"

This compares to earnings of $1.09 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 16.67%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of Wrangler and Lee apparel would post earnings of $1.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.16, delivering a surprise of 1.75%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Kontoor , which belongs to the Zacks Textile - Apparel industry, posted revenues of $616.01 million for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.52%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $613.57 million.

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Kontoor: mixed.

The extension of output cuts means production could remain around 9MMbbls/d in the immediate term,” said analysts at ING, in a note.OPEC meeting overshadowedThese announcements came before the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, commonly known as OPEC+, got together to review the market.The cartel decided not to announce any further changes to its overall output, with the move by the major producers designed to offset a potential downturn in demand this year, amid weak global economic conditions.Evidence of this weakening came with the monthly U.S. jobs report, which saw 187,000 jobs added in July, fewer than expected, while the number of positions added in the previous two months was also revised lower.This was a sign that a long-standing string of aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve was weighing on the U.S. labor market.Weekly streak of gains to continueThat said, the benchmarks are still on course for its longest streak of positive weeks this year, aided by U.S. inventories logging a substantially bigger-than-expected draw for the past week, of over 17 million barrels. The reading was the biggest draw seen in data dating back to 1982 and showed that oil supplies in the world’s largest consumer were tightening.Story continues(Ambar Warrick contributed to this article.)Related ArticlesOil prices rise on extended supply cuts; payrolls disappointOil set for sixth weekly gain on extended supply cutsAustralia calls for China to end trade curbs as barley tariffs lifted]"

Welcome to the Dentsply Sirona Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Andrea Daley, Vice President of Investor Relations.Andrea DaleyThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Dentsply Sirona's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call.Joining me for today's call is Simon Campion, Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Coleman, Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that an earnings press release and slide presentation related to the call are available in the Investors section of our website at www.dentsplysirona.com. Additionally, historical financial data for our new segment is also available on our website. Yesterday, we announced that the company identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, which did not result in a material misstatement of the company's previously issued financial statements. For more information, refer to Item 801 of the company's current report on Form 8-K filed on August 2, 2023.Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements in our earnings press release. During today's call, we may make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about the future performance and financial results. We base these statements and certain assumptions and expectations on future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recently filed Form 10-K and any updating information in subsequent SEC filings lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Additionally, on today's call, our remarks will be based on non-GAAP financial results. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about financial performance of our business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independently of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. Please refer to our press release for the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results. Comparisons provided are to the prior year quarter unless otherwise noted. A webcast replay of today's call will be available on the Investors section of the company's website following the call. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Simon.Story continuesSimon D. CampionThank you, Andrea. And thank you all for joining us this morning for our Q2 2023 earnings call.Today, I'll start by providing an overview of our recent performance, Glenn will cover Q2 results and the updated 2023 outlook. And then I will finish by providing a strategic operating update. Starting on Slide 4. We were pleased with the second quarter results, delivering more than 2% organic sales growth. These results rounded out a strong first half of the year in which we exceeded our commitments and delivered over 3% organic growth, well above our expectations. Fulfilling our commitments, financial and otherwise, both internally and externally, remains a top priority for this leadership team. Q2 performance was highlighted by organic growth in all 4 new segments. Based on the momentum in the first half of the year and our increasing confidence in the back half of the year, we are raising the full year 2023 outlook for net sales, organic sales and adjusted EPS, which Glenn will cover in a moment.We continue to execute on our transformational and strategic initiatives. The progress we are making is beginning to take shape in our results. We believe we are on the right path, driving improvement and transforming the business to deliver sustainable performance over the long term. As previously shared, we had received several inquiries about our Wellspect HealthCare business from interested parties. After a thorough review of these and other alternatives, we have decided to keep the Wellspect business in the Dentsply Sirona portfolio as the options explored did not adequately reflect the value of the business. We have now commenced the incorporation of Wellspect into the operating model and will share performance data as part of our investor updates. We have initiated quarterly business reviews with our second one recently held in Europe to discuss performance and strategy for each country and business group. While there, we review the Connected Technology Solutions R&amp;D pipeline, which we feel is robust. Spending time with our local teams also plays a critical role in building an accountable high-performance culture. These meetings give us the opportunity to dive deeper into the business and engage with employees and customers. Additionally, in Europe, we continue to engage in productive and positive conversations with the workers' councils regarding the restructuring plan. We are also continuing to deliver on our sustainability commitments. We have developed and launched the first sustainability educational curriculum for dentistry through the Dentsply Sirona Academy. The curriculum was developed in response to an international study Dentsply Sirona conducted in 2022 on sustainability. To complement, of course, the team developed a sustainability in dentistry resource case to assist dentists in their efforts.And now I'll turn it over to Glenn to discuss our second quarter results in greater detail. Glenn?Glenn G. ColemanThanks, Simon. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Today, I'll provide more detail on our second quarter results and an update on our 2023 outlook. As Simon mentioned, we delivered top and bottom-line results above expectations. The second quarter performance was highlighted by organic growth in all 4 segments, which coupled with favorable margins and a lower tax rate drove better-than-expected adjusted EPS. Notably, the second quarter represents another quarter of delivering on our commitments.Let's begin on Slide 5. Our second quarter revenue was $1.028 billion, representing reported sales growth of 0.5%. Foreign currency negatively impacted sales by $18 million and was larger than expected due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Japanese yen and Russian ruble. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 2.3%, led by continued double-digit growth in our aligners business and broad-based strength in Asia Pacific, led by China, which grew 25%. EBITDA margins were 17.7% and were better than expected, driven by leverage from higher sales and effective cost management. Year-over-year, EBITDA margins were lower due to continued inflationary headwinds impacting our cost of goods sold and higher commercial and infrastructure investments, partially offset by price increases and cost reductions from our restructuring program. Adjusted EPS in the second quarter was $0.51 and was well above expectations despite a $0.02 FX headwind. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted EPS declined by $0.18, largely due to lower operating margins. Operating cash flow was $104 million as compared to $173 million in the prior year quarter. The decline was primarily due to changes in working capital, which was impacted by the timing of AR and AP compared to the prior year and higher operating expenses associated with commercial and infrastructure investments. In the second quarter, we returned $30 million to shareholders through dividends with a total of $207 million returned year-to-date through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Let me now turn to our second quarter segment performance on Slide 6. Starting with the Connected Technology Solutions segment or CTS. Organic sales grew 2.8%, primarily due to improvements in the supply chain and shorter lead times for a certain high-tech equipment, partially offset by softer demand in Europe. Within CTS, our CAD/CAM business declined by mid-single digits, driven by lower demand in Europe, particularly in Germany, along with broader macroeconomic challenges across the region. That said, underlying retail demand in the U.S. improved sequentially. The Equipment &amp; Instruments business grew high single digits, driven by improvements in treatment centers and imaging in Europe as well as solid demand across all product categories in Asia Pacific. Organic sales in the Essential Dental Solutions segment, which includes Endo, Resto and Preventive products grew 0.7%, driven by stable patient traffic in the U.S., partially offset by softer demand in Europe. We attribute a portion of the softness in Europe to pre-buying activity in the first quarter.Moving to the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment, organic sales grew 3.7%. Aligners grew double digits for the fourth consecutive quarter, driven by growth in both SureSmile and Byte. SureSmile grew over 20% and continues to benefit from market share gains, regional expansion, new product offerings and differentiated outcomes. Our direct-to-consumer aligner brand, Byte, grew high single digits, driven by improved customer conversion rates and lower customer acquisition costs, which not only drove higher revenues but also better profitability. On a full year basis, we continue to expect our aligners business to grow double digits. Implants returned to growth in the quarter, highlighted by demand for value implants as well as growth in China due to VBP volumes and a recovery from COVID-related shutdowns. Our U.S. implants declined in the quarter, but we expect to see gradual improvement for the remainder of the year. And wrapping up with the Wellspect HealthCare segment, organic sales grew 3.1%, with growth across all 3 regions. For Wellspect, we expect to see faster growth in the second half of the year which will include recent and planned new product launches.Now let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss second quarter financial performance by region. U.S. organic sales grew 1.1%, driven by stable demand in essential Dental Solutions and double-digit growth in aligners, partially offset by lower sales of imaging equipment and implants. U.S. CAD/CAM distributor inventory levels declined approximately $20 million sequentially in the quarter, driven by solid underlying retail demand. Distributor inventory levels for CAD/CAM products remained low at the end of the second quarter relative to historical averages. Because of this, for Q3, we expect to see a sequential increase in U.S. distributor inventory levels in advance of DS World in September. Turning to Europe. Organic sales declined 2% due to lower implants and CAD/CAM sales which we attribute to macroeconomic headwinds in the market and unfavorable timing of orders for essential dental solutions. These declines were partially offset by continued SureSmile growth in the region. We also saw a more pronounced demand softness in Germany, which is a key market for our business due to recessionary pressures in the country. Rest of World organic sales grew 11% in the quarter, driven by growth in all 4 segments. China and Australia posted solid growth, and we also saw strong equipment demand across the region.With that, let's move to Slide 8 to discuss our updated outlook for 2023. We've updated our full year outlook to reflect our performance in the first half of the year as well as our increased confidence for the remainder of 2023. While we recognize macro uncertainties cloud the economic outlook in the second half, we are seeing stable to improving patient traffic in most key markets and our execution is improving. We are increasing our outlook for the full year net sales to a new range of $3.98 billion to $4.02 billion. This represents a $75 million increase at the midpoint of the range, which is now at $4 billion. We expect organic sales to grow approximately 3%, which is an increase compared to our prior range of flat to 2% growth, and we expect to show growth in all 4 of our segments. We estimate full year EBITDA margin to be greater than 18%, unchanged from prior outlook. While we continue to face cost headwinds impacting gross margin, we're seeing these headwinds stabilize and expect gross margins in the second half of the year to be consistent with the first half. Given the better-than-expected top-line performance, we're also raising our full year adjusted EPS outlook by $0.05 at the midpoint to a new range of $1.92 to $2.02. Keep in mind that the improved outlook also includes a $0.03 FX translation headwind. Overall, we're pleased to be raising our adjusted EPS outlook for the second consecutive quarter. Our first half performance gives us even more confidence that we're on the right path towards achieving our target of $3 adjusted EPS in 2026. For the second half of the year, we expect organic sales growth to be approximately 3%, with Q3 growth below 3% and Q4 growth above 3%. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted EPS to grow mid-teens year-over-year, but be lower sequentially due to seasonality. A return to earnings growth in the third quarter would mark an important milestone in our turnaround story.And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Simon.Simon D. CampionThank you, Glenn. Moving on to the strategic update, starting on Slide 9. Let me start by reaffirming our strategy to transform dentistry by digitalizing dental workflows, driving product and service innovation, and delivering an exceptional customer and patient experience through an engaged and diverse workforce. In order to fulfill our strategy, we must focus on a simple, more secure and connected workflow experience that our clinic and lab customers trust to deliver better treatment journeys and patient outcomes. We are making meaningful progress executing on the strategy as we remain intently focused on our objectives.Slide 10 shows the 2023 and beyond strategic objectives, which I first shared with you at the start of this year. Our 5 core tactical and strategic objectives are to: one, deliver on our annual growth and margin commitments; two, enhance and sustained profitability; three, accelerate enterprise digitalization; four, win in aligners and implants; and five, create a high-performance culture. We continue to leverage and expand our operating model to regularly monitor and measure performance and drive progress against these objectives, which we believe has already begun to translate into better business performance. Turning to Slide 11 for an update on our objectives. Starting with the goal to achieve our annual growth and margin commitments, we now have consecutive quarters where we have exceeded our commitments and delivered a better-than-expected first half of the year. While there is still much work to do, we are increasingly confident in our ability to deliver consistently on our commitments. In February, we announced the new operating model and restructuring plan. We have acted with urgency and have made meaningful progress on the transformation work with workforce reductions largely complete in regions outside of Europe. Our SKU rationalization plan continues to advance with pilots well underway in Europe and the U.S. and the project team in place to oversee execution. Additionally, there are other opportunities to enhance and sustain profitability through network and operational simplification initiatives with 4 locations in the U.S. already in the midst of transferring to other locations in our network. Enterprise digitalization is critical to our success, and we remain focused on accelerating it both internally and externally. We are advancing our multiyear ERP implementation project with the internal team assembled and the blueprinting or design phase already underway. We also continue to add capability to DS Core. Over the past 2 quarters, new functionality has been added to enable more efficient communication between dentists, labs and patients, improve efficiency of CAD/CAM practice workflows and broaden the range of services to include SureSmile and Lab. Winning in aligners and implants is another important strategic objective. In the new structure, these businesses are now combined into one segment. In Q2, the aligner business delivered another quarter of double-digit growth, highlighting the momentum and traction we have gained in this category. Byte continues to deliver top-line growth and enhanced operational performance with higher customer conversion rates, effective patient engagement and lower customer acquisition costs. SureSmile continues to drive market recognition and growth through our differentiated offering, particularly in the GP channel. Our offering is now available in 55 countries, representing most of our key markets across the globe, and we continue to demonstrate the benefits of SureSmile and evaluate investment opportunities to enhance our footprint in certain geographies. In Implants, we have reactivated our investment in clinical education after a prolonged period of underinvestment in this area. In Q2, we hosted the implant summit in Athens, Greece, which brought together more than 400 clinicians for 3 days of hands-on peer-to-peer learning and engagement. Customer feedback from the event was very positive. Additionally, we continue to focus on performance in the Implants business and recognize there is more work to do. In the U.S., we are seeing some green shoots with a number of new accounts coming online in the last quarter. Globally, our value implants offering, MIS, has shown consistent growth. In China, the implants business gained strong traction during the VBP program rollout. The incremental volume since implementation has exceeded our expectations, and we now expect that volume will more than offset the pricing headwinds for the full year. Lastly, and importantly, I would like to touch on the work we are doing to create a high-performance culture here at Dentsply Sirona. This is critical to enable achievement of our other strategic objectives and foundational to driving long-term value creation for all stakeholders. Our new operating model continues to evolve and take shape, providing clarity, efficiency and putting the customer back at the center of everything we do with compliance at the forefront. It gives meaning to the KPIs implemented to diligently run the business and hold ourselves and each other accountable. You can expect to keep hearing these themes from us because they stand out as core to our operating model and principles. We've also continued to build out the leadership team. Last quarter, I announced that a new SVP of Quality and Regulatory Affairs, join the team, a newly created role elevating quality within the leadership team. Most recently, in mid-July, we brought in a new HR leader, who, along with the rest of the leadership team, will play an instrumental role in driving high-performance culture throughout Dentsply Sirona. We also hosted the top 100 DS leaders in [Charlotte] during the quarter. This meeting, the first since 2019, helped us further align on our operational objectives and transformation, drive our winning culture and reinforce our commitment to ethics and compliance.Now let me close with a few remarks on Slide 12. As a reminder, 2023 is a transition year. However, Q2 represented another quarter of improved execution, which provides increased confidence in our outlook. As an organization, we believe we are making significant progress on our transformational and strategic initiatives and will pivot as warranted to pursue our goals. Achievement of the goals, coupled with more normalized market conditions will position Dentsply Sirona to grow revenue in line with the market while also increasing profitability. The combination of these positive factors can position Dentsply Sirona to deliver meaningful earnings improvement with an adjusted EPS of $3 targeted in 2026. While we have talked a lot about cutting costs, we recognize the criticality of leveraging some of these released funds to invest smartly in our business with a focus on ROI to drive long-term growth. As I said earlier, it's not just about bringing great products to the market, we must also actively invest in customer engagement, clinical education and sustainability. As previously announced, our Investor Day will be on November 9 in Charlotte. We look forward to sharing more details about our strategy and road map at this event.And with that, I will open it up for questions.Question and Answer SessionAndrea DaleyThank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer session.(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.Elizabeth Hammell AndersonCongrats on the quarter. I was wondering If you could talk about the -- how you sort of see the progression of the gross margin over the back -- rest of the year. You obviously had a little bit of a step-up in the quarter. I think you previously talked about maybe 100 basis points for the third quarter. So just sort of if you could talk about maybe -- or if you can talk about it quantitatively if you could sort of talk about the puts and takes on that line.Glenn G. ColemanYes, Elizabeth, thanks for the question. If you look at the first half of the year's gross margins, we did something around 56.7%, a little bit higher sequentially from Q1 to Q2. We expect it to be pretty consistent in the back half of the year. So I would just say second half of the year, very consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. And we're still dealing with inflationary pressures. I think the good news is they are starting to subside, but I think we'll see a better improvement in gross margins moving into next year. On EBITDA margins, we do expect to see a meaningful improvement in our EBITDA margins really in the fourth quarter. So sequentially, I'd expect EBITDA margins to go up slightly from Q2 and then a much more meaningful increase in -- from Q2 to Q3 and then a more meaningful increase in Q4. So -- even margins, we are expecting a much larger dump, and that's because of the restructuring savings kicking in, in the back half of the year.Elizabeth Hammell AndersonGot it. That was very helpful. And as a follow-up, can you talk about -- I know the macro has been excitingly ever-changing this year. And I appreciate your comments about China, et cetera, in the quarter. Can you talk about sort of how July progressed and sort of what you're seeing currently in the U.S. and Europe and China? I know China obviously had the lockdown comp, but your comments on the rest of it would also be helpful.Glenn G. ColemanYes. In terms of July trends, I would just say no significant changes from what we saw in the second quarter. We did have some growth in the month of July. But keep in mind, July sequentially coming off of June is a big drop off, especially in Europe. So when you look at our Q3 guidance, while it's up year-over-year in terms of organic growth, we said a little bit less than 3%. Sequentially, we expect Q3 to be down, largely driven by the seasonality factor in Europe. So make sure you consider that in your numbers. But July trended exactly in line with our expectations, down sequentially, but up slightly year-over-year, continue to see stable patient volumes even in spite of a challenging external environment. I would just say that our ortho business performed really well in July, so that was good to see. But again, it's still just one month in the quarter, and our guidance for Q3 reflects what we saw in the month of July. And again, guidance for Q3 would suggest less than 3% organic growth, down on a sequential basis. And if you do the math on that, I would say somewhere around $975 million would be the revenue number for Q3. And then EPS, we do expect to see mid-teens growth year-over-year, which is good to see. We're finally talking about positive numbers year-over-year. And based upon that color, I would just say the EPS number is probably around $0.47 to $0.48. So that gives you a little bit of color on Q3.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Cherny with Bank of America.Michael Aaron ChernyMaybe if I can just start on the segments. I'm not sure if this is too early or something we should wait until the Analyst Day for. But is there any color you can give on how we should think about growth across the segments that's embedded in guidance in the remainder of the year? And how we should think about the run rate in I guess, the medium term, long term, whatever time frame you want to use outlook for the 4 new segments.Glenn G. ColemanYes, Mike, this is Glenn. I would just say we haven't given specific guidance on the segment other than we did make comments that we do expect to see organic growth in each of the 4 segments. So I would just say from a color perspective, that's what we're willing to say at this point. When you look at the faster-growing segments, obviously, implants and ortho obviously are one of the fastest-growing segments. So that would be one where you'd expect to see faster growth but at this point, we're seeing positive trends across all 4 segments. We expect growth and look for ortho and implants to probably grow a bit faster than the other 3 segments.Michael Aaron ChernyGot it. That's a helpful start. And then I guess maybe on the ortho side, there's been a lot of variability over the last few quarters now, but especially this quarter in terms of the reported growth rates obviously of very different bases. How do you see -- I'm thinking more on the professional side, but happy to touch on Byte as well, but where the current competitive dynamics lies and I guess, the areas where you're winning the most opportunity versus the areas where you still think you have the most room for further penetration improvement.Simon D. CampionYes. So Ortho again performed extremely well, SureSmile in particular. I would say globally, it performed very well. We're now in over 55 countries. Europe had a tremendous performance in excess of 50% growth in Europe on SureSmile. And we're winning in the GP arena. That's where we've been focused on. We are also in the process of equipping our ortho reps with scanners as we focus on scanner penetration, too. So SureSmile is a critical component of our business has been and will continue to be. We expect to launch some additional simulation tools in the back half of the year. We also expect on the Byte side, which is another solid quarter of growth to launch Byte Plus as we roll towards the end of the year, which we feel will help drive more patients into the GP channel. So they can actually become patients not just for the Byte aligners, but also for other preventative and restorative care in the GP space. So an area of intense focus, a lot of investment. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we continue to evaluate opportunities to invest in commercial channels for our aligner business on a global basis.OperatorOur next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird.Jeffrey D. JohnsonCongratulations on the continued progress. Glenn, you touched on it in one of your answers here just recently a little bit on the cost-saving sides. But out of the $200 million that you're planning over the next several years, can you just remind us what so far is run rating into the P&amp;L. And I think more importantly, as you've reactivated some of that implant training doubling down here on some of the clinical education, the ERP progress is starting to happen. Just remind us, the phasing may be of that $200 million in savings over the next 1, 2, 3 years, does the bulk of it come in year 1 versus year 2 and 3? And how much initially of those savings should we expect to be offset by some of these added investments here at least in the short to intermediate term?Glenn G. ColemanJeff, thanks for your comments. First, I would say we're on track to our restructuring plans with annualized savings of $200 million to $225 million. That will be realized by mid-2024. So most of the savings would come next year. For 2023, what we said was we'd achieved about $0.30 of savings from the restructuring program. That's about $85 million. But to your point, we are investing a lot of that back into the business, commercial, infrastructure, whether it be North America implants, DSOs, a lot of investment in clinical education, the ERP system, compliance and quality, to name a few. We basically said that those investments would consume about $0.25 of the $0.30, in terms of the restructuring programs, only $0.05 would flow through this year in terms of the restructuring program. In terms of where we are, the head count actions have essentially been taken across all countries outside of a few in Europe and those are obviously complex in terms of the multiple workers' council approvals that we have to get through. And we've also got to get some additional non-headcount savings in the back half of the year. But on the whole, everything is progressing as we would expect. If you look at the first half of the year versus second half of the year for 2023 and the meaningful improvement in the back half of the year, both in terms of EBITDA margins and EPS, so we did $0.90 of EPS in the first half, midpoint of our guidance would suggest $1.07 in the back half. Over 2/3 of that improvement in EPS is expected to come from the restructuring savings kicking in, in the back half of the year. So hopefully, that gives you a lot of color on what we're expecting this year. And then obviously, as we move forward to next year, we should see another meaningful increase in the restructuring savings. We haven't yet laid out how much of that is going to be offset by investments next year. But clearly, it will be a nice pull-through when we look at 2024.Jeffrey D. JohnsonAll right. And hopefully, this doesn't come with my follow-up, but would you expect those investments to be less as a percentage of the cost savings next year, so more of the cost savings can flow through. But then the follow-up question I do want to ask is just on Europe, what's your just maybe sign in your update on state of the economy there? I think your comments this quarter were maybe a little more guarded obviously, leading economic indicators have not looked great. Obviously, you have the pretty sizable exposure to Germany with the Sirona legacy business, so maybe it's all equipment. But what is patient demand looking like there? How concerned are you about maybe the next 6 to 12 months? Is that something that you think Europe could really see a consumption issue from a dental standpoint? Is this just an equipment sluggishness right now because of Germany macro? Just how to think about the lay of the land in Europe right now?Simon D. CampionSure. So Jeff, just like we did for the last 2 quarters we ran our survey, and we got about 450 responses from Europe, about half of those came from Germany. And I would say sentiment in Germany with customers is muted and has deteriorated versus the prior survey, especially around capital equipment and indeed around patient volumes. Let's say, the other geography that is a watch out for us and others, I'm sure, is Australia and New Zealand. They've also -- their sentiment has also declined. But in the other countries in Europe, U.K. is stable, France is stable, Italy is stable. So it's really centered around the negative sentiment that we found in our survey is primarily centered around Germany and Australia and New Zealand with everywhere else stable to modest improvement, very modest improvement.OperatorOur next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS.Kevin CaliendoYou talked earlier about winning some new accounts in implants. I know you had made some investments in implant sales force. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what kind of clients you're winning on the implant side and the implant dynamics that you're seeing in the U.S. and in Europe and in China, the differences between the markets right now?Simon D. CampionYes. So let me start with the shining light, Kevin, which is China. We had a tremendous quarter in China on implants. We now strongly believe that we will offset the price degradation with volume as we head into the back part of the year. Clearly, we're winning in MIS there and the mix. The mix is also favorable for us in China. So all very positive in China. I would say in the U.S., we've made those investments as we went into the early part of this year in the sales team. And now in Q2, not only have we got the sales team together for training, we also invested in that 400-person session in Greece and other sessions like it. We have -- we had stepped away -- the company had stepped away from investments in the implants business and clinical education, in particular, over the past number of years. And I think as I shared on the last call, the implantologists view themselves as a family, and we had moved away from that family, but we're now re-engaging. And sentiment is positive from these customers as a result of this. I would say with the type of customers that we are winning, it's -- I would say it's too early to get any trends from that. Obviously, we monitor this on a religious basis each and every month. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks that there are green shoots in terms of the engagement of our reps, the number of customer visits they are making the -- some of the positivity from customers and also from their referral dentists because that's part of the challenge that we have here. It's not just calling on the implantologist. We also need to get to their referring dentists as well, which is the heavy climb that we have faced. But as Glenn said in his remarks, we do expect progress in Q3 and Q4 and expect to see growth for the year in implants. So we're heading in the right direction, we feel, but it's -- we're a long way from thinking we have the job done.Kevin CaliendoIf I can ask you a quick follow-up. DS World is coming up, we're all anxious to see your -- you guys running your first DS world. And I know that when you took over, you looked at some of the R&amp;D projects that were in the pipeline and I think maybe got rid of some of them or changed up sort of the R&amp;D model. How much of this DS World, would you say is stuff that you're -- that you put in place and how do you think, from an R&amp;D perspective, where does investment need to come going forward? Like where would you want to be focused going forward?Simon D. CampionSo I would say a year into our tenure here. You don't make changes in terms of products sitting in the street within a year. The life cycle is longer than that. But what we have done is install the processes around R&amp;D so that we can accurately assess the potential return on it. and accurately assess the timing of commercial launches. And so that -- they are the processes that we have built around it. We have consolidated our R&amp;D efforts around fewer programs that we focus on ROI. We have a robust process now for valuation. We will be, as I mentioned in an early response, we will be launching new products over the next number of months. You'll get sight on some of them at DS World and then further into Q4 and Q1. So -- it's very much a work in progress on the R&amp;D side. And it's -- I would say, no projects that we have kicked off will have -- we'll see the light of day here for the next several months, but the process is more robust.OperatorOur next question comes from Jonathan Block with Stifel.Jonathan David BlockThe outperformance for the first half of '23 and Glenn, I think as you mentioned, you're obviously taking up the implied 2H as well by really a decent clip. What are the areas of the overall business that deviated the most to the upside, call it, versus your expectations when you guided whatever that was 6, 7 months ago? I'm guessing aligners might be one of them, but maybe you can elaborate and give a little bit more detail. And then I'll pause to ask my follow-up.Glenn G. ColemanYes. I would say, regionally, it's been in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. So in the U.S., consumables have done better than our initial expectations. I think the retail demand has also been stronger for certain CAD/CAM equipment, which we haven't yet seen in our numbers. So that's encouraging as well. In Asia Pacific, obviously, we mentioned China. China has now been outperforming even some pretty robust expectations for the back half of the year. So I think China will continue to do well and actually outperform our initial budget if you will. We're seeing better recovery in imaging and treatment centers as well. And a lot of that is improvements in the supply chain. We've significantly reduced lead times. And so really good work by our global ops team on doing that, and that's helping us to overperform there. And so those would be the areas coupled with what you mentioned earlier, which is aligners. Aligners continue to do really well, really strong double-digit growth for us, both SureSmile and Byte and so those are the areas of outperformance. On the EPS front, the volume benefit from these higher sales is obviously helping us overachieve. We got slightly higher restructuring savings in the first half of the year as well. The ortho profitability doing better than we had expected because of the outperformance there and then a lower tax rate. So I think on the whole, that's how we look at the first half of the year. And we're very pleased with how we started the year and looking forward to continuing it in the back half.Jonathan David BlockOkay. Great color. And maybe I'll try to ask sort of 2 quick ones. Simon, strategically on the scanner, you talked about some good results there and maybe you're bundling with the aligners. Are you -- where you want to be strategically? In other words, do you think you need, call it, a lower-end scanner when you've seen what's going on with some of the prices out there? And then if I can try to jam in another question. You started the year organic sort of flattish. You're now at 3%, but the EBITDA margins remain, call it, greater than 18%. So where are those additional dollars, where are they being earmarked and going in terms of investments? And maybe just talk to us about the return timeline on those dollars.Simon D. CampionYes. So on the scanner side, with Primescan, we're obviously a premium scanner with great technology available. And we did launch Primescan Connect in the September time frame last year. We had a really strong quarter in Q2 on Primescan Connect. In fact, scanners, I think we had the second biggest quarter in 6 on unit sales in scanners and on mills. So we adapted some price on the Primescan Connect. So that's not, I would say, an upper mid-value scanner that has resonated. We had traction in Europe, traction in Japan. So scanners, we are pleased with the quarter, but we're not pleased with where we are in the market. And we are intently focused on bringing next-gen scanners to the marketplace. And as I mentioned, DS Core continues to be a really important aspect of our business moving forward. We brought new incremental capability to that in Q2 that will continue throughout this year and next year and any new technology that we bring out will obviously be integrated into DS Core and leverage the cloud. So that's where we're having scanners and equipment, and (inaudible).Glenn G. ColemanJonathan, on the EBITDA margins, we have not updated our guidance since the beginning of the year. We're on track to be greater than 18% EBITDA margins. And if you look at where we are investing, I would say, on the commercial side, North America implants, the return on that will come, I believe, probably later this year, Q4, most likely. but that return should start to be felt here in 2023. The investments in DSOs we're already seeing as the top-line improvements there. We do expect DSOs to have faster growth in the overall corporate average for the full year 2023. So that's looking promising. The clinical education investments that we're making on the implant side, on the endo side, again, you don't see an immediate payback for that, but we would expect to see that probably in 2024. The ERP investments take longer. The returns on those will take us multiple years to get to. But an investment we have to make now if we're going to have a sustainable, profitable long-term business. And I would just say, given the strong start to the year, we've made some additional investments in certain R&amp;D programs and certain commercial areas outside the U.S. So for example, because we're overachieving, I've just given the green light to go forward and add some additional reps and commercial footprint in Japan for our Ortho team, where we see a nice opportunity. And the returns on that will be in 2024. I'll actually have a hit in 2023, but we'll definitely see returns in 2024. And so I'm going to do some things in the back half of the year here. while still hitting our commitments but really setting us up better for next year. We want 2024 to really be an inflection year for us both in terms of top-line performance and in terms of EBITDA margins and EPS. And so given the good start we've had to this year and what we're seeing for this full year, I think we could do more while still hitting our commitments and setting ourselves up for better performance next year. Thanks for your question.OperatorOur next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.Unidentified AnalystThis Is Sara on for Nate. I just wanted to dig into the 25% growth we saw in China. So how much of that was VBP volume uplift versus underlying traffic improvement and the compares? And then how was traffic trending throughout the quarter? I'd just be curious to get a sense of your expectations for China over the back half of the year.Glenn G. ColemanYes. So in terms of our performance in China, let me just try to summarize the overall situation. I'm not sure we're going to have the level of detail that you're asking for. But I think, first and foremost, our China business represents about 3% of our consolidated sales to put that into perspective. We did have year-over-year growth of 25%. Sequentially, we actually even grew faster from Q1 to Q2. And a lot of that was driven by these VBP volume increases in implants. Implants had really strong growth above the 25%. And Simon made some comments earlier. We expect that the volumes now will actually offset the price erosion on a full year basis, which is very positive for us overall. As we move forward, I would expect to see really healthy growth in Q3 and Q4 coming out of China, at least double-digit growth in both of those quarters. And just to give you some perspective on the second quarter here, well, implants had a really strong quarter. We saw growth across all product categories, except for imaging. So the one area that we're still being cautious on is the equipment side in China, both imaging and CAD/CAM. But on the whole, between the COVID recoveries, between what we're seeing in terms of our share gains in VBP. And it's both on the public and private side, we feel really good about the momentum we have there.Simon D. CampionI would just add on the -- on our server data from China, where we had over 250 respondents. They are reasonably bullish about the next 3 to 6 months. Though their patient levels are -- their offices are not yet full, but they are improving quarter-over-quarter or survey over quarter -- survey over survey.Unidentified AnalystReally helpful. And then just on imaging, we saw strength from the supply recovery in the quarter. But if we exclude this impact, can you discuss like the underlying business performance? And then how are you thinking about imaging throughout the back half of the year?Glenn G. ColemanYes. We were pleased with the imaging performance as well as treatment centers. Both Europe and Rest of the World had really strong, robust double-digit growth in both of those categories. A lot of it was the improvements I mentioned earlier on supply chain and shortening lead times. If we look at the rest of the year, we're still cautious on imaging. So I would say right now, I'm still expecting to see some pressure on imaging in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter, and that's what's built into our guidance. So we're not expecting to see a rebound. The high cost of financing, we think will likely impact some of this in the back half of the year in certain markets, including Germany. So we're going to be cautious on the equipment forecast going forward. It's one of the reasons why our second half of the year guidance relative to first half of the year is flat to down when you look at half-to-half performance. And so if that turns out to be better, that's going to be upside for us. But right now, we're being very cautious on the equipment environment until we see better signs overall. Thanks for your question.OperatorOur next question comes from Justin Lin with William Blair.Justin LinI want to touch on guidance a little bit. The EPS guidance raise factoring the 3 points of FX headwind, I think, essentially just passes through the beat in the quarter. That obviously, you've raised yourselves much greater than the beat. Can you maybe just talk about kind of your thought process behind the guidance here?Glenn G. ColemanYes. Listen, I think this is our second guidance raise. We're only halfway through the year. We did pass through the outperformance here in the second quarter. To your point, we are seeing higher FX headwinds right now. So we're absorbing those in this increased guidance range that we're providing. And again, if you look at the back half of the year, there are certain areas where we need to be careful about relative to getting ahead of ourselves. So if you look at the Germany market, Australia, we're being cautious there. I want to see the momentum we have coming out of DS World. We're expecting to have a great event, and I'm hoping that we actually get some upside from the U.S. team coming out of the September event. So -- still some things to see before we get too bullish on the year. But in terms of EPS, we still have a lot of investments to make in this business. We still got to get the infrastructure to where it needs to be having a solid foundation across the company.And like I mentioned earlier, I'm going to take some of this overperformance and try to do some things that I think will position us even better for next year. And so I'm looking at areas and opportunities. Simon mentioned these reviews that we're doing regionally. Coming out of the last region review, we gave some additional dollars to certain sales leaders to go and get better top-line performance for next year. And we have more planned coming up here later this month in Asia Pacific, as an example, and I'm planning on probably having a similar conversation. So one of the benefits of us actually overperforming on the top line is we can probably do some more investments to position us better for next year. But on the whole, we're very happy with the first half of the year's performance, both top line, EPS, EBITDA margins, and we're moving forward.Justin LinGot it. That's very helpful. I guess we haven't really talked about Primeprint for a while, I feel like. Can you talk about how the product is gaining traction relative to your expectation whether you've seen any sort of short-term hit to Primemill, some doctors may see 3D printing as a replacement for mills in your practices.Simon D. CampionYes. So I'll start with this -- with the second part of your question, Justin. We see printing and milling as extremely complementary. Printing does not, in our opinion, have the capability for permanent crowns, but more facilitates implants, temporary crowns, et cetera, et cetera. That's our opinion. And we've been sharing it with customers and potential customers. And we think it does resonate, and we have a strong printer offering, a strong resin offering and a great mill offering. Now with respect to our performance, I would say we are doing okay in the marketplace today. Our devices is very efficient. We believe it's got a great safety profile in the sense that it doesn't expose the clinicians or technicians or the office to resins or fumes and the fact that it's linked up to DS Core and other technologies as well. We think it's a competitive advantage for. We continue to invest in new materials -- new material capability. And we expect as we roll through the next 6 to 9 months that our ability to compete with other vendors in this space that we will begin to level out the playing field as we bring some of the new materials to bear in that marketplace. So we are bullish about the future of printing. We think it's complementary to milling and that our complete technology offering coupled with DS Core will continue to be meaningful for customers, and we will certainly be driving it in that manner.OperatorOur final question comes from Michael Petusky with Barrington Research.Michael John PetuskyAnd I'm going to sort of throw a bigger, I think philosophical question. So Simon, you've almost been in the chair for a year at this point. Obviously, a number of people have been in that chair over the past decade have not been able to create sort of sustainable momentum and sustainable value -- a sustainable value-creating business.Just curious, what are 2 or 3 things that -- now that you've been in the chair almost a year that you've sort of looked at and you said, you know what, okay, I see where my predecessors maybe ran into some problems or these are some things that, obviously, we've as a business, historically, have not been able to get done. I mean are there things that you've learned at this point where you can sort of see, hey, this is why predecessors have not quite executed and here's why I think we can.Simon D. CampionWell, I don't know if I want to comment on what they -- what predecessors did and did not do. I'd rather focus on what we are doing. So I'll pick some of the themes that we've spoken about at this meeting or at this call this morning. So one, investment in commercial infrastructure and clinical education. We have reinvested, I think, significantly in that space. Number two, building capability around R&amp;D, particularly around uncovering innovation, monetizing it and discipline around the R&amp;D process. The big gap for us, and we're prepared to grab that thorny bush is ERP. We have 13 or 14 ERP systems in this company that drives massive inefficiency. So we -- as we noted in the prepared remarks, we have kicked off that project. We have selected the vendor. And we've selected the integration partner. We've built a team around it, and we're in the blueprinting phase. We are reducing our network -- our manufacturing and distribution network. So there are a lot of levers that we are pulling why others data did not pull the same levers, I don't know, but we have -- we have a full plate and we're making progress in all regards. In addition to the cultural transformation, we're building out the team, we've elevated quality. We brought in a new CHRO leader. We've changed out the leadership in Australia and New Zealand. We've put the customer at the center of everything we do. In addition to driving a culture of ethical and compliant behavior, which we think is -- which we know is extremely important. And we drive that at every single meeting. In fact, at the top 100 leader meeting that we had in Charlotte, the first presentation on the agenda was ethics and compliance. So we are not screwing around. It's really important.OperatorThank you. At this time, I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Simon Campion, CEO, for closing remarks.Simon D. CampionThank you, and thank you all for your attendance on today's call.I would just like to take a moment to reiterate some key points before we close. Firstly, delivering on our commitments is of the utmost importance to this team. We feel that operational execution is improving at Dentsply Sirona. We continue to make advances on the transformational and strategic objectives that we've laid out. We are, as we've spoken about, investing back into our business, which has been funded in part by our cost savings initiatives. And then finally, on behalf of the management team, I want to thank all Dentsply Sirona employees for their dedication to the business and the necessary transformation that is underway and in particular, we want to express our thanks to employees who have the part of the organization in the last quarter and wish them all well in the next phase of their careers. Thank you.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

The top line also increased 0.5% year over year and improved 2.3% on an organic basis. All four segments were up year over year organically with aligners leading the pack, growing in double digits. Business in China also returned to growth (up more than 25%) with healthy patient traffic in most key markets.Business DetailsAs a part of its restructuring plan, the company changed its reporting structure from Apr 1, 2023. The company reported second-quarter results under four new segments — Connected Technology Solutions, Essential Dental Solutions, Orthodontic and Implant Solutions, and Wellspect Healthcare.While the Connected Technology Solutions segment consists of equipment, instruments and CAD/CAM business, the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment includes the implant systems and aligner solutions.

The Wellspect Healthcare segment includes urology catheters business, earlier part of Technologies &amp; Equipment, and other healthcare-related consumable businesses, previously under the Consumable segment.Connected Technology SolutionsRevenues in this segment totaled $309 million, up 0.6% year over year and 2.8% on an organic basis. CAD/CAM demand improved sequentially in the U.S. market while recessionary concerns led to softer demand in Europe. Supply recovery and higher demand in ROW market drove the Equipment &amp; Instruments business.Story continuesOrthodontic and Implant SolutionsSales in this segment amounted to $270 million, up 1.9% year over year. On an organic basis, net sales improved 3.7%. The growth was driven by SureSmile and Byte sales, coupled with growth in market share for Implants in China and global demand for products, partially offset by lower lab sales.Essential Dental SolutionsSales in this segment amounted to $377 million, down 0.8% year over year. On an organic basis, net sales improved 0.7%. The organic growth was driven by improved pricing and continued growth in restorative and preventive consumables in the United States, which was partially offset by lower sales in Europe.Wellspect HealthcareSales in this segment amounted to $72 million, up 1.1% year over year. On an organic basis, net sales improved 3.1%. Sales were driven by growth across all regions.Revenues by GeographyIn the United States, revenues increased 1.1% year over year to $362 million.

Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseDENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. QuoteOur TakeAlthough adjusted earnings declined year over year, it beat market expectation. Better-than-expected revenues also buoy optimism. The company has also provided an improved outlook for both top and bottom line, reflecting rising demand, favorable forex movement and positive impact of better pricing and restructuring initiatives.Recovery of demand in China will be a key driver of top line going forward. Sales improved more than 25% during the second quarter after a prolonged period of weak demand. Moreover, continued healthy patient traffic in most key markets is expected to drive revenues. While these are promising developments, investors should keep a watch on any change of course.Although the volume-based pricing (VBP) policy in China impacted pricing, market share gains and higher VBP volume completely offset the impact leading to strong growth in the country.However, soft demand in Europe may act as a headwind for the rest of 2023.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, DENTSPLY SIRONA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Abbott Laboratories ABT, Elevance Health, Inc.

The company also reported a $3 million loss in its streaming segment after seeing a $50 million profit in the first quarter. Rich Greenfield, LightShed Partners partner is joining us now. Rich, it's good to see you here. So what-- give us sort of your big-picture take first of all on these numbers?RICH GREENFIELD: Look, they are delivering on what they said in terms of free cash flow. There's no doubt David Zaslav and team are getting the cash out of this business. They've dramatically restructured, radically reduced cost. They are generating far more cash flow than investors expected when this transaction closed last year. I think the challenge and what you're seeing in terms of the weighing on the stock today is the fact that the advertising environment is just not picking up.You know, you had a lot of media companies, legacy media companies early in the year talking about sort of a second half recovery, and that you'd see a ramp in advertising or improvement. And it's improving, but off of a much lower base and you're still looking at pretty sizable declines in advertising. Whether we're talking NBC Universal, whether we're talking Warner Brothers Discovery, all of these companies are seeing the TV ad market just be terrible, recession or not.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Well, and it doesn't help if you're losing subscribers, right? I mean, like how is Max? Is Max competitive, like--RICH GREENFIELD: Yeah. I wouldn't read too much into that.JULIE HYMAN: OK.RICH GREENFIELD: No, but I wouldn't read too much into that. Part of that is, you know, remember, there's Discovery Plus subscribers in that number, and they folded Discovery Plus into Max. So when HBO Max became Max, it now includes Discovery Plus, and there were subscribers who took both services. So I think some attrition is not unexpected, there's still in terms of the size of Max relative to its peer group, Max is doing just fine.So I don't-- the stock is not down because Max lost a little subscribers. I think if anything, the Max rebrand has gone pretty well. I think the service works better. I mean, if you've tried downloading a show on Max versus the old HBO, the new interface is far better. I think this is more about they guided to the bottom end of their-- you know, they had a range of 11 and 11 and 1/2 billion of EBITDA. They got it to the bottom end of that range.They took down sort of their advertising guidance for the rest of the calendar year. I think that's sort of what's weighing on WBD, as well as the sector at large because the headwinds facing Warner Brothers are no different than the headwinds facing Disney, I mean, you saw Iger on CNBC the other day. This whole sector is facing very significant headwinds.- You know, Rich, it got a little bit of a mention in the release from Warner Brothers today, of course, the strike that we're seeing in Hollywood right now impacts may be mixed in the second quarter for a lot of these companies. How are you thinking about that longer term for the space?RICH GREENFIELD: Look, I'm just worried the strike is going to last until October, November. I mean, I don't sense any real progress. Yes, talks are going to theoretically restart tomorrow with the writers. But I think you've got a long road ahead. And from everyone I talk to in Hollywood, I think people are sort of prepared that we may not be fully back in action until sometime in November, even towards Thanksgiving. And that's going to be very disruptive to the business of Hollywood in Q4.And look, it also just drives consumers to watch more catalog, to watch more overseas content, to watch more YouTube. Like this is not the right-- you know, there's probably never a good time for a strike to be honest, but I think given the alternatives the consumer has today versus what they might have had 10 and 20 years ago, this is far more devastating to this industry than I think both sides realize.JULIE HYMAN: And I wonder how you think these different companies are navigating it. I guess what I want to ask about is leadership of the big media companies and studios, whether it's Iger, whether it's Zaslav, whether it's Bakish, like have these-- you know, and whether it's the strike or the slowing ad market. How are these guys doing? Are they doing a good job navigating this?RICH GREENFIELD: Look, all of these companies were too late to embrace streaming, right? There's no doubt they waited too long to go to streaming. They saw what Netflix was doing. And they jumped on the bandwagon. You know, Disney was the one who really started it with Disney Plus, but then everyone else jumped on it. Now, they're all realizing that their core business, which is cable network, broadcast and cable networks, they're all realizing those businesses are in secular revenue decline.Advertising is going down. Affiliates, which is the fees paid by cable and satellite operators to cable networks. Those fees are now going down. So the whole top line of this industry is in secular decline, and sports rights and costs keep going up. And I think that's what's spooking investors. It's why Iger is talking about spinning off linear TV, needing partners for ESPN. Like, this is the sort of the sickness that's sort of plaguing this entire legacy media industry.And so you say who's leading? I think all of these executives have been caught a little flat footed. I think, you know, Zaslav has probably been one of the most upfront of the challenges and recognizing, hey, we got to cut this aggressively. And you see that in the free cash flow. I mean, there's no doubt they are deleveraging faster than investors expected because he realized there is no growth story left in the linear business.- Yeah. And Rich I wanted to ask a little bit about the sports rights picture, you know, maybe a little bit smaller for Warner than some of their other peers. But just where that fits in because as an outsider, you know, I see the salary cap going up for all the leagues, I see the rights projections going way higher, and yet you see the stocks and what's going on the dynamic you're talking about doesn't really add up to me.RICH GREENFIELD: Look, you're seeing it in local, right? The local sports side is imploding. If you look at Diamond sports which went bankrupt, it was owned by Sinclair Broadcasting. There's no doubt that local sports has imploded, and you're seeing all of the after effects of that right now. The question is going to be, is the local sports problem going to play out in national over the next few years? And look, it's possible it doesn't because you have digital players like Apple and Amazon and even Google that have come in.You know, Google Sunday Ticket, Amazon's bought Thursday Tonight Football, you're seeing Apple do MLS and probably do Pac-12 now. But look, all signs point to if the way you pay for sports is advertising and affiliate fees, meaning the cable and satellite fees, if those are the way you pay for sports rights and those fees are going down, it is hard, very hard to comprehend how sports rights keep going up. And that's going to be the challenge. And why the leagues so desperately need the digital players to step in because I don't think these legacy media companies are going to be able to keep paying more for rights as their revenues go down.JULIE HYMAN: So Rich, circling back around to Warner Brothers specifically. Zaslav on the call was asked about sports. He was asked about other things like the international push and licensing content. There's-- whatever of these media companies you're talking about, there's a lot of different facets, right? What does he need to be prioritizing for Warner Brothers right now?RICH GREENFIELD: Look, I think the question is, how much sports does he really need? Can he get out of-- you know, he pays a billion to a year for the NBA. Is there a way to create a smaller package where he, you know, reduces cost or at least holds costs? I mean, I think that's what investors are trying to understand. You heard a couple of the questions about sports.Like, I think everyone's trying to understand, you know, it's great that they're cutting costs right now, how much control of the cost structure do they have looking out over the next few years as the sports rights come up for bid, and can they resist-- you know, I think they're really going to look to Zaslav and hold him to it, can he resist overspending on sports rights given what's happening on the top line?JULIE HYMAN: It's a good question. We'll see. A little suspense here. Rich Greenfield, thank you so much. Always great to catch up with you, LightShed Partners partner.RICH GREENFIELD: Thanks for having me.JULIE HYMAN: Thank you.]"

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Devon Energy Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.05bUS$3.04bUS$2.96bUS$2.08bUS$1.94bUS$1.86bUS$1.82bUS$1.80bUS$1.80bUS$1.81bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x7Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ -6.88%Est @ -4.18%Est @ -2.29%Est @ -0.97%Est @ -0.05%Est @ 0.60% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.7% US$2.8kUS$2.5kUS$2.2kUS$1.4kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$951US$859US$782US$718(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$15bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.8b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.7%– 2.1%) = US$24bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$24b÷ ( 1 + 9.7%)10= US$9.7bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$24b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$49.7, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Devon Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.274. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Devon EnergyStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value? For Devon Energy, there are three relevant factors you should further research:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 4 warning signs  with Devon Energy (at least 2 which are a bit unpleasant)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Future Earnings: How does DVN's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

This compares to earnings of $0.23 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 200%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $0.07 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.04, delivering a surprise of -157.14%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Guild Holdings Company , which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, posted revenues of $236.81 million for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 37%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $287.54 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Guild Holdings Company shares have added about 27.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 17.6%.What's Next for Guild Holdings Company?While Guild Holdings Company has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Guild Holdings Company: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.13 on $190.95 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.39 on $656.66 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Financial - Miscellaneous Services is currently in the bottom 27% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, P10, Inc. (PX), has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023. The results are expected to be released on August 10.This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.19 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.P10, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $57.31 million, up 22.6% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Of course, if you want to ask additional questions, please feel free to jump back in queue.With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.Story continuesJoseph D. RussellThank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining us today. As demonstrated by our second quarter performance and raised outlook for the year, Public Storage continues to maximize its competitive advantages across our platform with several key factors driving positive results, including a better-than-expected macro environment with higher odds of a soft landing, increased rental activity from our needs-oriented customer base, and execution across all aspects of our industry-leading platform. We are built to operate in all macro environments and we are proving just that. Let me highlight 3 specific areas. First, we are driving record year-over-year growth in customer move-in volumes. Move-in volume growth has accelerated throughout the year, up nearly 14% in the second quarter. We have closed the year-over-year occupancy gap from down 220 basis points at the end of March to down 160 basis points at the end of June. We have the right team, technologies and analytics to determine the appropriate mix of marketing, promotions and rental rates to meet customer expectations in the current environment. Drawn by our leading brand and enhanced digital customer experience, self-storage users are clearly choosing Public Storage. These trends support our raised outlook along with the easing of difficult year-over-year comps as we move through the second half of the year. Second, we are growing our portfolio amidst broader market dislocation. Last Monday, we announced and fully funded the $2.2 billion Simply Self Storage acquisition in a matter of a few hours. This is something that very few companies could do today and separates Public Storage as the acquirer of choice within our industry. We have the strongest balance sheet and the lowest cost of capital, both of which were highlighted by our rapid execution on the Simply Self Storage transaction. With the Simply Self Storage acquisition, we are excited to combine our respective strengths as we integrate their portfolio to ours and achieve significant operational enhancements immediately and into the future. As an example, under our platform, the $1.8 billion ezStorage portfolio acquired in 2021 has seen significant operating margin improvement of 1,100 basis points from 72% to 83%. As we do with all of our acquisitions, the entire Simply Self Storage portfolio will be rebranded to Public Storage in order to maximize the benefits and value of our iconic brand and platform. We expect to stabilize the portfolio at a mid-6% nominal yield by year 3. Third, we are well positioned for continued strong execution and growth across the company. From an operating perspective, our digital and operating model transformations are proving to be significant win-win-wins with result to exceeding expectations. Customers benefit from having robust digital options at their fingertips across the entire journey, finding a unit, renting a unit, moving in, managing their account and navigating the property when on site. Our proprietary digital ecosystem will continue to be a primary reason that customers choose us with more than 2 million PS app downloads and over 60% of customers renting through our online leasing platform today.Additionally, Public Storage team members benefit from being able to place even more focus on our customers and for those that excel, the transformation has enabled us to create new pathways for career advancement and our financial profile benefits as well. We are putting these digital tools in the hands of our customers and employees for convenience, combined with in-person on-site customer service when and where it's needed. The result is a better customer and employee experience and a higher operating margin. From an external growth perspective, our industry-leading NOI margins, multifactor in-house platform, access and cost of capital and growth-oriented balance sheet put us in a unique position. So far this year, we have secured $2.5 billion worth of properties. We will have also delivered $375 million in development by year-end and have a pipeline of more than $1 billion of development to be delivered over the next 2 years. Our advantages enable us to acquire and develop when others can't. We have a strong appetite for more with a matching ability to execute. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.H. Thomas BoyleThanks, Joe. As Joe highlighted, we sit here more than halfway through the year with both our year-to-date performance and updated outlook better than we expected. Core FFO per share was $4.28 for the second quarter, representing 11.5% growth year-over-year, excluding the contribution from PS Business Parks. Looking at the key components for the quarter. Same-store revenues increased 6.3% as we drove record move-in growth. Our existing tenant base continues to perform well, and these trends continued into July with the year-over-year occupancy gap narrowing to 130 basis points at month-end. Same-store cost of operations were up 5.2%, leading to 6.6% stabilized same-store net operating income growth at a direct operating margin exceeding 80%. In addition to the same-store, the lease-up and performance of recently acquired and developed facilities continues to be a standout, with net operating income increasing 20% year-over-year. These 544 properties and more than 50 million square feet comprise 25% of our total portfolio and are an engine of growth. And this pool will grow further with the addition of the Simply Self Storage acquisition. Shifting to guidance. We once again lifted our outlook for the year, primarily driven by a 50 basis point increase to the low end of our same-store revenue growth guidance, reflecting outperformance to date and an improved outlook for the remainder of the year. We also lifted our non-same-store NOI expectation by $40 million at the midpoint to primarily reflect outperformance and improved outlook and also to incorporate the impact of the Simply acquisition. Interest expense expectations increased accordingly. Our outlook for the non-same-store pool beyond 2023 improved as well. We lifted our expectations for incremental NOI, the stabilization from $80 million to $190 million to reflect outperformance to date, stronger future expectations and the Simply acquisition. And last but not least, our capital and liquidity position remain rock-solid. We refinanced our untapped line of credit in June, tripling its size to $1.5 billion, and as Joe mentioned, fully funded the $2.2 billion Simply acquisition in the unsecured bond market immediately following the announcement. We're well positioned with a strong appetite for growth, coupled with the ability to execute upon the opportunity. Now I'll turn the call back to Shelby to open it up for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.Michael GoldsmithThe guidance for the full year implies a pretty material slowdown in the back half of the year with potential for same-store revenue growth and same-store NOI growth to turn negative in the fourth quarter. So what would you have to see from the input of revenue growth, like occupancy, move-in volume, street rates and ECRIs in order to hit the middle and bottom range of the guidance and if you see these as realistic or conservative scenarios?H. Thomas BoyleSure. Thanks, Michael. It's a good question with lots of components. So maybe taking a step back, we've been consistent throughout the year providing investors and analysts with a range of (technical difficulty).In terms of the different components of the outlook, I've been consistent that the upper end of that outlook encapsulates an environment where we experienced a soft landing. And as we move through the year, the probability of that soft landing has increased. As we think about the assumptions that are baked into the lower end, that is more of a tougher macroeconomic environment. And in particular, we're assuming (technical difficulty) think about the midpoint. The same-store growth moderates but starts to stabilize. In that midpoint outcome, it does encapsulate a negative outcome in the fourth quarter for same-store revenue growth. But again, easier comps help and start to stabilize. And from an overall FFO standpoint, the midpoint is certainly aided by continued standout growth from the non-same-store pool of properties there as well. So again, a range of outcomes embedded within our outlook.OperatorThank you for your patience in holding. Your program will continue momentarily. (technical difficulty) Your conference will begin in a few moments.Ryan C. BurkeShelby, this is Ryan Burke from Public Storage. Trying to get through to you to resume the call. Are you hearing us?OperatorAbsolutely. Yes, sir. You're coming in loud and clear, and your conference may continue.Ryan C. BurkeThank you, Shelby, and apologies to everybody if you're hearing us. We've had some technical difficulties. We're hoping that we're through those at this point. Shelby, if we could go back to Q&amp;A, we would appreciate it.Operator(Operator Instructions) And we'll take our next question from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. And I'm hearing no response, we will move to the next question. We'll take our next question from Spenser Allaway with Green Street. Hearing no response, moving on to the next question. We'll take our next question from Samir Khanal with Evercore. (Operator Instructions)Samir Upadhyay KhanalCan you talk about what you're seeing in July, maybe move-in rates and demand trends, and if anything, on the customer side, given some of the price increases?H. Thomas BoyleYes. Great question, Samir. So in July, we've seen largely continuing trends from the second quarter. So as we think about the different components of customer activity, we saw a good move-in volume growth, call it, 7% or 8% above prior year. Move-in rent's down a similar kind of down 14% as we sit here in July. Move-outs have begun to moderate, again, as we talked about easing comps as we move into the second part of the year. Move-outs are up about 4% in July, ultimately leading to that occupancy gap closing, again, as I mentioned earlier, down to -- down 130 basis points at the end of July. There's a couple of points I'd highlight about July. One is we've talked about how comps in the first half of the year are more challenging. And I think from a move-in rate standpoint, we do believe July is really the point in time where those comps are the most challenging and should ease up from here. And so as you think about the different pathways for growth going forward, we're anticipating that move-in rate declines year-over-year start to moderate. In terms of existing tenant performance, continues to be quite strong. And the length of stays within the customer base, we're at records through the second quarter. Some of the activity we're seeing to date mathematically is likely to bring that average length of stay down a little bit, given the significant amounts of new customers that we're adding to the pool year-to-date. But the core longer-term customer base, be it greater than 1 year or greater than 2 years, continues to perform quite well throughout the summer here.Samir Upadhyay KhanalAnd then just talking about maybe given the L.A. market is a big market for you, it was still solid. I mean, don't get me wrong but sort of like maybe decelerate a little bit from the first quarter. I know the restrictions have been lifted there. So maybe just talk around kind of the trends you're seeing in that market as we kind of think through maybe the next sort of 6 to 12 months.Joseph D. RussellYes, Samir. The L.A. market continues to serve us well. We clearly have a very strong position here with north of 200 properties, excellent locations. We've completely rebranded the portfolio through a POT effort. And with that, we've continued even outside of lifting the restrictions that we were burdened by for over 3 years, we still got good opportunity to drive revenue and strong occupancy, still very good top-of-funnel demand. It's well documented. There's very little supply that has or will come into that market by virtue of lack of land sites, cost of new development, et cetera. So we're well positioned and feel very confident that, that market is going to continue to perform well. Tom can give you a little bit more color on how we're looking at the horizon based on the fact that we've certainly gone through a wave of recovering, to some degree, the amount of pricing power that we did not have for that 3-year period. But we still feel confident that the market itself is going to perform quite well.H. Thomas BoyleYes. And specifically, if you remember, Samir, last year, we talked about 150 to 200 basis points of same-store revenue benefit because of the expiration of those restrictions. This year, it's more like 50 to 100 basis points. And the deceleration that you're seeing through 2023 is really attributable to the fact that this year, we're facing comps where we were playing catch-up on customers last year. And so that market is expected to continue to moderate its growth because of those comps. But overall, as Joe mentioned, fundamentals in the marketplace remain quite strong. And frankly, it's not just an L.A. phenomenon either, if you look at San Diego, that's one of our top markets as well. Southern California performing well through 2023 for Public Storage today.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.Todd Michael ThomasCan you hear me okay?Joseph D. RussellWe can. Thank you for checking. Hopefully, you can hear us.Todd Michael ThomasYes, loud and clear. I wanted to ask about the occupancy build in 2Q and -- which was a little bit more muted than it has been in prior spring and summer seasons, and it sounds like the year-over-year occupancy gaps narrowed a bit further in July, which is positive. And Tom, you mentioned July is a tough comp. But as we think about the seasonality of the business, do you think that the peak rental season, particularly this year has a little bit less weight than it has in prior years and prior cycles in your view? And does the lower seasonality in the spring and summer mean that you might expect to have less seasonality around Labor Day and sort of through fall and winter in the back half of the year?H. Thomas BoyleYes, that's a great question, Todd. I think stepping back, we haven't had a typical demand year since 2019, and we could debate whether 2019 was one as well. Every year has had its unique attributes given what we've all lived through over the last several years. And certainly, 2023 is no different than that. This year, some of the factors at play, certainly the housing market is one that I would highlight. And we've been highlighting for some time the existing home sales volumes declining, having an impact on some of the seasonal demand that we would oftentimes see in a May, June and July time period, we're not seeing as much of this year. And I do think that, that's one of the primary reasons for the difference in occupancy build as we move through the year. That said, we've continued to see very good move-in volumes, as we've highlighted already on the call. And that's being made up by renter activity by folks that continue to run out of space at home, which is also somewhat tied to people not selling their existing homes. And so we feel good about the level of new customers that we're acquiring today but it is a different year. And then maybe to your second part of your question around how does that impact our thoughts on the second half, I think because of how the first year has played out and that demand dynamic, we would anticipate that we'd probably see a little bit less of a seasonal decline in occupancy as we move through the year, which is likely to lead to continued modest closing of the occupancy gap year-over-year as we move through the year.Joseph D. RussellAnd just to highlight a couple of other things, Todd, the seasonality predictable components are shifting. And what you have to be in an environment like this is quite nimble and to interpret what effects or counter-effects you may have or be able to deploy as the traditional seasonality theories or events are shifting. And to Tom's point, since 2019, we've learned all kinds of different range of impacts, whether it's tied directly to housing, hybrid, work-from-home environments. I can tell you maybe the 1 consistent predictable driver is just college, and that too got upended during the pandemic. That seems to be back so there's a little bit of movement that we think we can predict there. But the good news is with our platform and our ability to interpret changing demand factors, we're actually able to maneuver through what would be, as Tom pointed out, less predictability around seasonality, but at the same time, we're seeing very good customer demand driven by even new and additional factors, many of which seem to be deep-seated and are likely to be with us for some period of time.Todd Michael ThomasOkay. And so Tom, I guess just in terms of the revised guidance, I mean, does that account for lower seasonality in the second half of the year, less move-out activity than you would ordinarily see in terms of occupancy loss through Labor Day in the back half of the year? And then the last piece here, I guess with less rental activity driven by moving activity related to the housing market, do you feel that you have sort of a healthier, longer-staying customer in the portfolio today?H. Thomas BoyleSo first component of your question there, we're adding them up here, is yes. So the outlook is -- does incorporate what I highlighted earlier. The second component of your question is also a good one to highlight, and that is that customers that have moved in year-to-date are exhibiting longer length of stay attributes because of what you're highlighting and what Joe highlighted around the use cases for storage. So consistently, kind of each month's cohort of move-ins are performing better than prior year, which is encouraging as you think about the tenant base and the durability of revenue heading through '23 and into '24.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.Jeffrey Alan SpectorI just wanted to, I guess, go through your -- the comments on record move-ins, better-than-expected first half, and tie this into some of the concerns, let's say, going back to at least last year and the follow-on weaker street rate. Like how do you explain the dynamic and how you're thinking about it? You're mentioning you're bringing in the right customers, it sounds like, through June, but private continue to compete on lower street rates. So how should we think about that dynamic? And again, there's this concern that it will eventually impact your ability to push on existing but that existing customer continues to exhibit great behavior. So it is a bit confusing.H. Thomas BoyleAll right. Jeff, there's a good number of parts to that question, too. Let's take them one by one. So to your point around good move-in volume, as Joe highlighted earlier, we think the tools that we have are working quite well. We were on a very granular and dynamic pricing and advertising process, and our ops team is built to drive move-in volumes, paired with our digital ecosystem that Joe spoke to. We think the customers are reacting quite well to. So all of that, combined with our brand, I think it's certainly helping drive good move-in volumes. I think your point specifically on move-in rate, there's a couple of components there. One is, no question that the industry overall, as there's been more vacancy through last year and into this year, has lowered rental rates, and it's a very competitive environment for new customers today. We feel like, as I noted, we're getting good customers and a good volume of them, but the rents are lower than what they were in the prior year, down about 14% in the second quarter. To give you context, in the second quarter, our rents were about a couple percent above our competitors within the trade areas. So we're largely charging what our competitors are charging in the marketplace but seeing very good volume and traction associated with that. It is certainly one of the components that drives the deceleration of revenue growth as we moved through last fall and through the beginning part of this year. And I noted earlier that as we sit here today, the comps do start to ease, and we think the July print could be the trough as we move through the year, and that's embedded in our outlook as we look through the second half of the year. But overall, that's certainly been a drag to revenue growth but should be a stabilizing factor as we move forward. The third component to your question related to its impact on existing tenant rate increases. And that's something we've been very consistent in speaking about. We like to talk about it in 2 components. One is how is the customer base performing. And as I've noted in prior calls, the existing customer base continues to perform quite well. So the length of stays of the longer-term tenants, 1-year, 2-year-plus continue to be strong. Delinquencies are below pre-pandemic levels and they are accepting of our rental rate increases. The thing that has changed over the past 2 years is what it is to replace those tenants when they move out. And so that's the second component, the replacement cost of those tenants if they move. And that has certainly flipped from -- in certain markets, there was actually a benefit to replace those tenants in certain prior years. And this year, it's certainly a cost to replace, again going back to what you highlighted, which is move-in rental rates lower year-over-year. That's led to lower magnitude and lower frequency of increases through the start of 2023, but no real change there as we sit here in July versus what we would have told you in February on that point.Jeffrey Alan SpectorOkay, very helpful. And if I could ask, given I'm getting a few incoming to repeat your first answer to the first question kind of on the back half guidance. I think we missed a lot of that answer. And maybe I would just try to clarify that the bottom end of guidance, does that still reflect -- it sounds like it still reflects that recessionary scenario?H. Thomas BoyleYes. Thanks, Jeff. And bummer that you couldn't hear my first response, but I'll go at it for attempt #2. Hopefully, this works. So the outlook as we move through the year, we've now raised it 2x. And we highlighted earlier, that's because of better-than-expected performance year-to-date as well as improved outlook for the second half of the year. We've been consistent since February and speaking about the outlook as a relatively wide range of potential outcomes. And that's driven by a combination of an uncertain macro environment, which we're all still living in day-to-day as well as a consumer backdrop that is -- that continues to shift, obviously, impacted by that macro line. At the lower end of our guidance does encapsulate the potential that the Fed doesn't quite stick the landing here in the second half of the year. It doesn't have as much of an impact on 2023 as what it may have on 2024, which is certainly leading to improved outlook at the lower end. But there's certainly that possibility that the consumer weakens, longer-term length of stay customers start to vacate at a higher frequency. Again, something we're not seeing today but could play out as we move through the year and would be typical in a tougher macro environment. And a still competitive move-in environment, which to -- the point earlier, is something that we've seen year-to-date, a very competitive move-in environment. The flip side, though, is also fair, which is we continue to think that there's a good potential for a soft landing and a continued strong performance from the existing tenant base, the easing of comps in the second half, which would lead to the higher end of that range as well. So again, a good performance year-to-date. The outlook's improving as we move through the second half, but we do still encapsulate that broad range of potential outcomes here.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Spenser Allaway with Green Street.Spenser Bowes AllawayCan you guys hear me?Joseph D. RussellWe can. Thanks, Spenser, for being patient.Spenser Bowes AllawayNo problem. So apologies if this was covered, but marketing spend up this quarter and that's understandable, given you weren't spending much in '22. But just curious if you can talk about the absolute customer acquisition costs and how does that trend -- or how is that trending, sorry, versus historic norms?H. Thomas BoyleYes. Thanks, Spenser. So you noted clearly high year-over-year growth in marketing spend because we didn't really spend last year. I think one way to look at it that we track through time periods is the percentage of marketing spend as a percentage of revenue. And in the second quarter, I believe that was about 1.7% of revenue. And that's a good bit below pre-pandemic averages that were in the 2% to 3% range. If you think about overall customer acquisition costs are frankly attractive, which is one of the reasons why we continue to use that tool, along with the other tools in our toolkit to drive good move-in volume, and we're seeing very good response from that. So we'll continue to use marketing spend as a component of the customer acquisition toolkit and have an ability to continue to spend there if we get good return.Spenser Bowes AllawayOkay, great. And then there you commented that you were receiving a high volume of inbound calls as it relates to potential deal activity. Can you just comment on the 22 assets that were acquired in 2Q and 3Q? Were these inbounds? And then how much activity are you guys kind of seeing in 3Q outside of the Simply deal?Joseph D. RussellYes. Sure, Spenser. Year-to-date, from a sector standpoint, the amount of transaction volume is pretty similar to what we saw in 2022. So I would tell you, to your point, there are a number of more inbound calls coming to us. Many of the owners coming into the market are looking for a different level of commitment and a surety that a close can take place. Clearly, with the lending environment not only from availability capital, the cost of capital, a number of traditional or otherwise active buyers in past years are not as active or capable as they would be today. So that gives us a leg up. As I mentioned, we are hearing, time and again, we're an acquirer of choice. We've got a very unique opportunity to continue to execute very effectively, just as we did, obviously, on a very large scale with the Simply deal. We typically know an asset quite well in the market position. It's at -- again, have very efficient discussions with the existing owner, whether it's a one-off transaction or a portfolio. So we're using that opportunity and we're being contacted more directly by virtue of the fact that there's much more surety of close, and we can be very effective and efficient and it's been a good window for us. So many of the deals, to your question, that came through were along those lines. We're still doing traditional marketed opportunities where the economics and the quality of the asset makes sense. One of the things that's fresh, 10 days now post announcement of the Simply deal, we are getting some additional inbounds knowing, again, the effectiveness that played through on a $2.2 billion acquisition. And that plays through, again, whether it's a one-off deal or a much smaller portfolio, that continues to be good bread-and-butter growth and acquisition opportunity for us, and the team continues to be busy. As typical this time of year, next quarter or so is typically the more active time of year for transaction opportunities, so we're going to continue to stay focused on that, and we feel we're in a very good spot.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Smedes Rose with Citi.Smedes RoseI just wanted to ask, it sounds like from your remarks that you were able to come to a decision very quickly on the decision to acquire the Simply portfolio. And I was just wondering how you would compare maybe some of the opportunities you saw with that acquisition versus your original proposed acquisition of the Life Storage portfolio.Joseph D. RussellWell, Smedes, very different processes and M&amp;A opportunities got a whole different level of complexity and moving parts than maybe a traditional private opportunity. Speaking more directly to the Simply transaction, that was a process where it was a market or a deal that was brought to the market through their own advisory. And so there was a process that Blackstone went through to bring the portfolio to the market. Because of its size and -- the portfolio has been in place for nearly 20 years, we knew it quite well. We had understood and studied the evolution of the portfolio, so we had very good and crisp knowledge of the portfolio going into that process that was set up by Blackstone. So again, very good opportunity for us to look at a portfolio of that size, integrate it very effectively. As I mentioned, we're about 10 days into the process right now, and we expect to close in the middle of September. By all accounts, the integration opportunity looks every bit, if not more, compelling than it was when we announced the deal. So very confident about our ability to integrate the 127 assets and the 25 properties that are in the third-party management platform. So feel good about the ability to allocate capital of that size. In a private transaction market, this is the largest deal that's been done since roughly the end of 2021 or the beginning of 2022 if you think about the timing of Manhattan Mini. But we're very confident that it's a very strong ability on our part to allocate capital, get very strong returns and integrate those assets very quickly.Smedes RoseAnd then I just wanted to make sure, the $190 million of the non-same-store contribution you called out, that includes the Simply execution?Joseph D. RussellYes, it does.H. Thomas BoyleYes, it does.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.Juan Carlos SanabriaJust curious on the investment side and the balance sheet, kind of marrying those 2 areas together. You used a lot of the dry powder here on Simply, and the accretion was modest kind of initially. So just curious how we should think about what the remaining capacity is and kind of cap rates or yield expectations going in to deploy that kind of precious capital.H. Thomas BoyleYes. Well, happy to take that. As we looked at underwriting the Simply portfolio, we viewed it as an attractive real estate transaction really across any way that you underwrite it or you think about cost of capital. As we've spoken about in the past, we view things on an unlevered basis despite the fact, certainly in prior years, we've used leverage in order to acquire assets very quickly. We look at things on an unlevered basis and real estate level returns as well as basis. We view the Simply transaction as an attractive one. Your comment around accretion, we grew the asset base by about 4%, and we're anticipating growing FFO by 1%. That's a pretty good ratio. And our leverage at the time was 3.3x. We increased it to 3.8x, which is a good bit below our long-term target of 4 to 5x, which gives us still significant capacity to grow for the right sorts of transactions. As Joe highlighted, we're poised to do that. To give you context, I think post transaction, we have over $5 billion of capacity to continue to grow towards the higher end of that long-term target of ours. So still a very good bit of capacity and are actively seeking good real estate opportunities to grow the platform.Juan Carlos SanabriaJust as my follow-up, you made comments earlier that given the more modest peak leasing season experienced to date, that you would expect a softer kind of get back or decel in the back half. But just curious if there's any thought to maybe the opposite actually holding true, that because you didn't see a steeper climb during the peak leasing season that, that portends something weaker and whether it's the consumer or the housing that it's laying under the surface that may see an actually a bigger get-back than normal. Just curious on that -- those thoughts there.H. Thomas BoyleSure, Juan. I mean, we've walked through now the range of potential outcomes, and so we do think we have a wide range encapsulated in our outlook. My comments around our belief that we don't see as big of an occupancy decline is really driven by the fact that we didn't see the seasonal demand that typically can be shorter length of stay. And I highlighted earlier that our customers that have moved in to date have been longer length of stay, which supports less move-out activity through the second half of the year.Ultimately, we'll have to see how the year plays out. And we've given you some guideposts as to what that looks like throughout our outlook range and feel like we're very well positioned to navigate through the environment in the second half.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. And hearing no response, moving to the next question. We'll take our next question from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Hearing no response, moving to the next question. (Operator Instructions) We'll take our next question from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.Michael GoldsmithAs my second question, kind of on the occupancy and kind of the churn of the portfolio through the quarter. Occupancy at the end of March was 92.8%, end of May was 93.1%, end of June was 93.2%. But the average occupancy in the second quarter was 93.7%, which is higher than all of that. So does that mean that there's elevated churn within the portfolio? And how do you think about the potential loss of some of these high-quality, high-rate customers that have been driving the growth of your portfolio in an environment where maybe there's a little bit more elevated churn?H. Thomas BoyleYes. Thanks, Michael. A couple of components there. One, churn is actually improving on a year-over-year basis as we move through the year. And you can see that in year-over-year move-out volume growth in the first quarter compared to the second quarter. And then I highlighted in July, move-out volume's only up 4% year-over-year. So continue to see good behavior from the tenant base. Highlighted earlier that length of stays from new customers that have moved in have been attractive.And so we feel good about the customer base overall and easier comps as we move through the year on a normalization of churn from that tenant base playing out. As you think about the occupancy lift and the difference between the average and the period end, that's going to be consistently the case because of how we operate the portfolio month in and month out, our average occupancy or occupancy peaks in the middle of the month, and then we typically see more move-out activity towards the back half of the month, which lowers occupancy. That's the case month in and month out. And so nothing concerning there. You can interpret the lift in average and the lift in period end as occupancy was higher through those periods, i.e., higher in June than it was in May.Michael GoldsmithGot it. And just from the first quarter to the second quarter, same-store revenue growth stepped down by 350 basis points to 6.3%. As we move through the rest of the year, does the step-downs get smaller? And does that reflect just like the comparisons getting easier? I'm just trying to better understand the cadence of the step-down as you guys see it.H. Thomas BoyleThat's a good question, Michael. The cadence of the step downs will begin to ease. And I think we've highlighted that the comps really start to ease in September, October. And so as we move through, I highlighted earlier, comps are actually quite challenging as we sit here in July, and we would anticipate the comps do ease as we move through the back half of the year. And so embedded in that range of outlook is obviously a differing range of moderation of that deceleration rate but would anticipate that comps help but particularly in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.Operator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our next question from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. (Operator Instructions) Hearing no response, moving on to the next question. We'll take our next question from Ki Bin Kim with Truist.Ki Bin KimCan you hear me?Joseph D. RussellYes.H. Thomas BoyleYes.Ki Bin KimSo your move-in rates increased about 5.5% sequentially going into 2Q. I'm just curious like when you look at say, whatever you want to call it, a normal year, how does that 5.5% increase compare?H. Thomas BoyleYes, Ki Bin, that is a little bit lower of an increase than what you typically see. Typically, in a seasonal year, you'd see more occupancy lift and associated with that more occupancy lift, you see more pricing power. And in a typical year, you'd see more like low-teens difference between the end of the year and the midpoint of the year.And so if you think about first to second quarter comparison, it's probably upper single digits full first quarter versus full second quarter increase. So a little bit softer but along the same themes that we've been speaking about with a little bit less seasonal demand, in particular, in the second quarter.Ki Bin KimOkay. And in terms of your $450 million CapEx guidance for the year, obviously when you look back historically, it was under $300 million in 2021 and under $100 million pretty much every year before that. So I'm just curious like how many more years of this newer and more elevated CapEx should we think about versus returning back to something that's more approaching from a historical level?Joseph D. RussellYes, Ki Bin. A couple of moving parts there. So we're 3/4 of the way through our $600 million Property of Tomorrow initiative. We're targeting end of 2024. It may taper in the part of 2025 to get the full portfolio completed so that spend will continue through that time period.The other additional but very effective component of that program that we're going to continue to invest on top of the easing down of just that spend tied to the Property of Tomorrow program is solar. So we're putting more additional dollars into our solar initiatives. In many, many markets, our goal is to get north of 1,000 properties to some level of solar orientation, which would include just the property needs itself. And you may have seen yesterday, we made an announcement relative to what we're doing with community solar in certain markets. That's a program that's continued to grow as well.So with that, Tom, you can give a little color on what we're seeing relative to outlook relative to spend on a year-over-year basis. But for those factors, we've still got a couple more years of elevated capital spend.H. Thomas BoyleYes. And I think to Joe's point, the Property of Tomorrow spend, when we wrap up that program will go away. The spend on solar, we think, is a very good opportunity. To Joe's point, we're getting mid-teens IRRs on the capital we're investing in that program, and we've got a lot of opportunity there. And at the end of the year, we're targeting having solar on about 500 properties, with the expectation of getting over 1,000 properties over the next several years. So a lot of opportunity there that will be capital spent but also with a good return associated with it.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research.Keegan Grant CarlCan you guys hear me?Joseph D. RussellWe can.Keegan Grant CarlAll right, cool. So annual contract rent per square foot in the same-store pool is up 7.1% year-over-year. Just looking for some more color on the ECRI program. What rate increase are you sending out? And what are your plans on it for the back half of the year?H. Thomas BoyleYes. Keegan, as I highlighted earlier on a question, when we think about the existing tenant rate increase program as the 2 components of existing tenant performance and behavior as well as the replacement cost, the existing tenants continue to perform well. So we're sending healthy increases to that tenant base, but the magnitude of those increases are less than prior year and the frequencies are less as well. But still sending increases and they're being accepted by that tenant base, which is helping to drive that rental rate performance that you saw through the first half.Keegan Grant CarlIs that a fair assumption then for the back half of the year that, that continues to moderate?H. Thomas BoyleI'd say that because of everything I highlighted earlier around rental rate comps as well as occupancy through the year and the churn rates, that we'd anticipate it's pretty similar as what we saw through the first half.Keegan Grant CarlOkay. And then shifting gears to your third-party management platform. You guys added 16 net stores in the quarter. Just curious, one, what you're seeing out there in the market today. And two, on the back of extra space acquiring Life Storage, are you seeing any new customers from that portfolio come to you?Joseph D. RussellYes, Keegan. We added, actually, 23 properties in the quarter. And then one was taken out of the platform by virtue of being sold to another party. So the program now is at 215 assets. We're still seeing a dominant factor play through relative to properties typically coming into the platform through development processes. We've got, I think, a whole host of encouraging conversations and relationships that we're developing on that side of the business.We'll certainly welcome and entertain any existing assets and any other platform as we always do. If they're flagged in another third-party management platform, public or private, from time to time, there's some pretty unique opportunities, whether it is, as you're asking, relative to a portfolio changing hands that might have a third-party management component to it or not, but we've got very good traction in the program. We've got a very good offering, and we're seeing the opportunity to continue to grow it.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.Michael William MuellerCan you hear me this time?Joseph D. RussellWe can, Mike. Thanks for trying again.Michael William MuellerYes, I had no clue if you talked about this already. I basically dropped at 12:40 and dialed back in because I had silence. But could you talk about the percentage of customers in place for over a year and 2 years and if you're seeing any notable changes to those pool sizes?Joseph D. RussellNo, that's not been asked. (inaudible) give you some color.H. Thomas BoyleSo we continue to see very good performance from our longer length of stay customers, that customers have been with us for longer than 2 years, for instance, as a percentage of the tenant base is in the low 40s, which is up still 5%, 6% compared to what it was pre pandemic. So continue to see very strong composition as well as performance from that group.The newer tenants continue to cycle in. I highlighted earlier that we're actually likely to start talking about a potential that the overall average length of stay starts to moderate because we're getting so many new good customers that are coming into the platform, which are going to bring that average down. But overall, the longer-term tenants continue to be solid and a good bit above pre-pandemic norms. And the new customers that we're acquiring are also experiencing better length of stay trends on a year-over-year basis.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.Juan Carlos SanabriaA quick follow-up. On the ECRI question, I just wanted to confirm, has the pace or cadence of increases declined at all year-to-date from your initial expectations to start the year or is that holding steady?H. Thomas BoyleJuan, it's holding steady. There's some seasonal factors which I won't quite get into, but generally speaking, on plan and consistent with expectations.Juan Carlos SanabriaOkay, great. And then just one more, if you could humor me. So what does the guidance range imply for the kind of fourth quarter or exit run rate? Just trying to think about the decel layering into easier comps in the fall.H. Thomas BoyleYes. So again, the outlook encapsulates the range. The low end of the range is a tougher macro environment. No question, that would likely lead to same-store revenue growth dipping into negative territory at the lower end there. At the higher end, we would anticipate that same-store revenue growth remains positive. Again, those easier comps lead to a stabilization through the second half of the year and exiting in that manner.Obviously, the midpoint is in between there. I think the midpoint does touch negative in the fourth quarter and certainly positive in the third quarter. But again, we'll update you on performance through that range as we move through the year. We've been encouraged year-to-date on performance, and we'll continue to update you on where we end up through the year.OperatorAnd it appears that we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to Ryan Burke for any additional or closing remarks.Ryan C. BurkeThank you, Shelby, and thanks once again to all of you for your patience today on the technical difficulties. We appreciate it. We hope you have a good rest of the week and into the weekend.OperatorThat concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

The centre will focus on developing technology for chipmaking tools.Srinivas Satya, president of Applied Materials India, in an interview said the firm attracted as many as 25 of its suppliers from Japan, South Korea, the U.S. and Europe to a flagship semiconductor event in Gujarat last week to assess the market, with multiple states pitching to those firms to set up base.Applied Materials does not manufacture in India - and has no plans to - but having suppliers based locally will help its new engineering centre speed up technology development and testing.""Having the suppliers closer to us is so important just to accelerate our product learning cycle.

(Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Kristen Levy , Senior Manager, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Kristen LevyThank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me today are Chris Cocks, Hasbro's Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Goetter, Hasbro's Chief Financial Officer. Today, we will begin with Chris and Gina providing commentary on the company's performance, then we will take your questions. Our earnings release and presentation slides for today's call are posted on our investor website. The press release and presentation include information regarding non-GAAP adjustments and non-GAAP financial measures. Our call today will discuss certain adjusted measures, which exclude these non-GAAP adjustments. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the press release and presentation. Please note that whenever we discuss earnings per share or EPS, we are referring to earnings per diluted share. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call and the question-and-answer session that follows, members of Hasbro management may make forward-looking statements concerning management's expectations, goals, objectives and similar matters. There are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. These factors include those set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K, our most recent 10-Q in today's press release and in our other public disclosures. Today's guidance assumes we retain the non-core entertainment film and TV business, notwithstanding the agreement we just entered into with Lionsgate to sell this business. That transaction is subject to customary closing condition and regulatory approvals. Following closing of that transaction, we plan to update our guidance. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call. I would now like to introduce Chris Cocks. Chris?Story continuesChristian CocksThanks, Kristen, and good morning. Today, I'm pleased to announce that Hasbro has entered into a definitive agreement to sell our eOne film and TV business to Lionsgate for approximately $500 million, consisting of cash of $375 million and the assumption of production financing loans. This purchase will include a team of talented employees, a content library of nearly 6,500 titles, active productions for non-Hasbro owned IP like the Rookie, Yellowjackets and Naked and Afraid franchises, eOne's Canadian film and TV operations and the eOne unscripted business, which will include rights for producing Hasbro based shows like Play-Doh Squished. We expect the transaction to complete by the end of 2023. Hasbro will use proceeds to retire a minimum of $400 million of floating rate debt by the end of the year, and for other general corporate purposes. Hasbro Entertainment will be the new marquee for our ongoing entertainment efforts after the sale closes. Under the leadership of Olivier Dumont, the current head of eOne family brands, Hasbro Entertainment's mission is to develop, finance and produce entertainment based on the rich vault of Hasbro owned brands. We'll bring to life new original ideas designed to fuel all areas of Hasbro's Blueprint, including toys, publishing, gaming, licensed consumer products and location-based entertainment. We'll retain its focused team of creative development and business affairs experts to shepherd the 30-plus Hasbro based projects in development, working with the best studios and distribution platforms in Hollywood, including ongoing development of the TRANSFORMERS and G.I. Joe franchises, PLAY-DOH, D&amp;D, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, and our board game portfolio. As part of the sale, we expect to move to an asset-light model for future live action entertainment, relying on licensing and partnerships with select co-productions like our previously announced TRANSFORMERS 1 animated film and the D&amp;D live-action television series, both with our partners at Paramount. The sale of eOne is another important milestone in our transformation at Hasbro. Last year, we articulated a plan to turn around Hasbro, driving growth in fewer, bigger, more profitable brands, improving our consumer focus, execution and innovation and building our operational excellence to fuel our bottom line and create sustainable performance. At the highest level, it's a plan about recentering Hasbro on what has helped us create one of the most valuable portfolios of brands in toys and games, the timeless power of play. I'm pleased to report in Q2, we've made substantial progress against these goals. Hasbro delivered better-than-planned operating results for the second quarter, including revenue of $1.2 billion and adjusted operating profit of $137 million, which includes a $25 million charge we took for the D&amp;D: Honor Among Thieves feature film. The movie is among the best reviewed films of 2023, and has performed well in streaming, but the box office didn't meet expectations. POS in the quarter was at or ahead of market. And when factoring exited businesses was ahead of market. Through the first half, PEPPA PIG, TRANSFORMERS, PLAY-DOH, D&amp;D, MAGIC: THE GATHERING and Hasbro Games have all grown point of sale. According to Circana, the G9 global toy and game market declined 7% through year-to-date June. We gained share among the G9 in 3 of our 5 focus categories. Action figures behind growth in TRANSFORMERS, arts and craft with PLAY-DOH, and in games behind MONOPOLY. Our direct fan-focused business, Hasbro Pulse, increased point-of-sale by 54% in the quarter. TRANSFORMERS: RISE OF THE BEASTS is one of the top box office performers of the year, and has driven an 83% improvement in TRANSFORMERS: POS since its release. MAGIC: THE GATHERING launched what we believe will be the biggest release in our history with Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle Earth. D&amp;D generated nearly 2 million new registered users on D&amp;D: BEYOND through the first half of the year. Our licensing business continues to grow, including the release of one of the biggest mobile games in the last 5 years, MONOPOLY GO! from our partners at Scopely, which since its debut has been #1 in downloads in 87 countries on the Apple App Store and 49 countries on Google Play. Our operational excellence efforts have driven over $84 million of cost savings year-to-date, money we are using to both fund inventory reduction and clearance efforts and key growth initiatives like direct data analytics and digital. And speaking of inventory, our sales teams have been busy reducing our owned and operated inventory in our Toys and Games segment by 24% year-over-year and our retail inventory by 16%. While headwinds and uncertainty continue to exist in the toy and game category as a whole, a better-than-planned start to the year so far for Hasbro sets us up for success in the back half. Gina will share more in her remarks, but at a high level, we're maintaining our guidance for our Consumer Products segment and raising guidance for our Wizards of the Coast and digital games segment. Due to the writers and actors strikes and underperformance of D&amp;D: Honor Among Thieves, we are lowering our guidance for entertainment. MAGIC is on track for a record Q3 with favorable set release timing blowing results. D&amp;D should have a strong second half powered by excitement for the upcoming PC and console releases of Baldur's Gate 3 from our partners at Larian. Furby is already a hot seller with initial allocation selling out in under 72 hours. Most of our toy and game innovations have only just begun to hit shelves including the new preschool line for Lucasfilm, Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures, our new AR game, Twister Air, new blaster innovation with NERF: Double Punch and hot new game crossovers like Barbie Monopoly. And with much improved inventory levels and the bulk of our inventory management efforts phasing down in Q3, we see an opportunity for meaningful margin improvement as the year progresses, particularly as we go into the fourth quarter. Net, we exited our first half with a solid quarter and positive operating indicators for our second half in our core segments. Our inventories are greatly improved. We are growing share in key brands, and we are making the improvements necessary to our supply chain and cost structure to see sustained operating margin growth over the mid and long term. We also are making the necessary choices to right size our entertainment footprint. Strong brands with quality innovation and execution will be more important than ever in a more unpredictable environment. That's one of the reasons I'm excited by the potential of our new leadership team who are already bringing a more disciplined approach to our operations and a palpable step-up in product innovation. We continue to move up and to the right on our change curve, evolving our cost savings initiatives to a continuous and relentless improvement model. Our supply chain is becoming a competitive advantage with costs back down to near pre-pandemic levels and positioned favorably versus competition. We are seeing momentum with key retailers. Our digital portfolio is tighter and making rapid strides, and we are reinventing our approach to data analytics, product development and long-term innovation, paired with our approach of focused entertainment through partners that both inspires and connects to a tight business plan and economic engine. We are positioned well for the medium to long term. I'd now like to turn over the call to Gina Goetter, our Chief Financial Officer. Gina?Gina GoetterThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris laid out, we delivered a solid quarter with revenue coming in ahead of expectations and proof points emerging across several of our transformation initiatives. We also announced the sale of the eOne film and TV business, a step that simplifies our strategy and our focus on toys and games. As we look to the quarter, total Hasbro revenue of $1.2 billion was down 10% versus last year, as we continue to see normalization of inventory, lap the exit of certain licensees and markets within the Consumer Product segment, and we had fewer planned releases for Wizards of the Coast. The Entertainment segment revenue was down 3%, primarily due to the exit of non-core businesses in 2022. Excluding these divestitures, the film and TV and Family Brands businesses were up 5% versus prior year. Adjusted operating profit of $137 million was down 43% versus last year. In addition to the revenue decline, we incurred higher inventory closeout costs as we continue to rightsize inventory back to healthier levels. Profit was also negatively impacted by an impairment taken on Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves as a result of box office results coming in below expectations. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.49 was 57% below last year due to the factors noted and includes unfavorable impacts related to taxes and interest expense. The adjusted results exclude the impact of a $296 million film and TV impairment. Through the second quarter, the ongoing writer and actor strikes had minimal impact on our results. However, as the strikes continue, our 2023 outlook for entertainment has come down. The adjusted results also exclude incremental costs attributed to the Operational Excellence program, and amortization associated with the eOne acquisition. Looking at year-to-date results. Revenue of $2.2 billion was down at 12% below last year, driven by declines in the Consumer Products segment and planned timing shifts across entertainment. Wizards segment revenue is down slightly versus prior year. as a result of launch timing and having one fewer release in the front half of this year compared to 2022. Adjusted operating profit of $184 million was down 52% versus last year, as we continue to incur higher costs associated with clearing inventory as well as absorb the impact from the D&amp;D film impairment. Year-to-date adjusted EPS is $0.49, driven by the factors noted above. Looking at our brand performance. Our Franchise Brands were down 5% in the quarter and year to date. These brands represent our biggest and most profitable brands and are just over 60% of our revenue. Within Franchise Brands, we delivered significant Q2 revenue growth in TRANSFORMERS and Dungeons &amp; Dragons, driven by the uplift from the movie releases. Additionally, PEPPA PIG grew as a result of growth in entertainment and digital gaming. Our partner brand revenue is down 21% for the quarter. More than 60% of the loss as a result of the licenses we exited at the end of last year. Sales of Hasbro products for Spider Man by Marvel are up with an over 100% increase in POS since the release of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, and further supported by the preschool series and new product releases. Partner Brands continue to play a vital role in our portfolio for kids, fans and retailers around the world. Across our portfolio brands, the declines are driven by the reprioritization of investment to support the franchise brands, as well as discontinuances across the retail footprint. However, one of our relaunched portfolio brands, Furby, is off to a promising start. Looking at operating margin. Second quarter adjusted operating margin of 11.3% was 670 basis points below last year. The single biggest impact in the quarter is the volume decline in mix of business. Through the first half of the year, we prioritize cleaning up the portfolio and reducing inventory levels across the CP business, resulting in higher-than-normal closeout costs. Also, as planned, we had one less MAGIC release within the Wizards segment, which created an unfavorable mix and fixed cost absorption impact. Additionally, as we shifted to leverage licensed IP within Wizards, we incurred higher royalty expense, resulting in a 1.7% margin point loss. Momentum is accelerating in our cost savings program. And year-to-date, we have accumulated $32 million of gross cost savings within supply chain, and an additional $52 million of gross cost savings within operating expense. The combined $84 million of gross savings are more than offsetting cost inflation and have allowed us to reinvest back into the business to support higher levels of marketing spend, fund our inventory reduction efforts and fuel key strategic initiatives required to deliver our long-term targets. Cumulatively, since we began the savings program in 2022, we have reduced our cost base and delivered gross savings of $104 million. And we remain on track to deliver our in-year savings goal of $150 million. And finally, to round out the margin drivers, we had a negative 280 basis point impact in other items, which includes the $25 million impairment on the D&amp;D film. As Chris mentioned, we made significant progress in lowering inventory levels. We reduced total owned inventory 16% versus prior year, primarily driven by a 24% reduction in the Consumer Products segment inventory. We expect to see inventory reduction through the first part of Q3 and stabilizing to more normalized levels by the end of the year. From a retail inventory perspective, their inventory was also down 16%, and the lion's share of the directions are behind us. Looking more closely at segment performance within the quarter, Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment revenue was down 11%. Overall tabletop gaming revenue, which includes both MAGIC and D&amp;D, declined 17% given the release timing. The decline in tabletop was partially offset by 33% growth in digital gaming, including the addition of D&amp;D Beyond, which we acquired last May, and growth in Arena. Segment margins declined in line with expectations driven by higher royalty expense and a step-up in investment to support future brand growth and product development. Moving to the Consumer Products segment. Total CP revenue was down 11% in the quarter, driven by declines in POS trends and the focus on clearing inventory. Looking at the key drivers for the quarter. Five points of the decline was driven by planned license exits. Another 3-point decline was driven by toy and game volume given the broad category trends and retailers taking a more focused approach with their inventories. Four points of decline came from pricing and mix, driven by additional closeout costs as we work through higher inventory levels. And finally, we achieved 1 point of growth from licensed consumer products as we reenergized focus on leveraging our IP across categories. In the quarter, the Entertainment segment declined 3%, primarily due to business exits late last year. This was partially offset by 3% growth in film and TV behind scripted TV growth as well as film revenue from Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves. In addition, Family Brands revenue increased 14% and driven by content sales, including for PEPPA PIG. The adjusted operating loss for the second quarter includes the $25 million Dungeon &amp; Dragon: Honor Among Thieves production asset impairment charge. Today, we announced the sale of our eOne Film and TV business to Lionsgate. Overall, the business that we're selling represented approximately 85% of the revenue and just over 60% of the adjusted operating profit of the total Entertainment segment last year. Wrapping up with Hasbro, Inc., we delivered $119 million of operating cash year-to-date, which is $29 million behind last year, driven by lower receivables coming out of 2022. Through June, we repaid $91 million of long-term debt and spent $112 million on capital expenditures, led by investments in Wizards of the Coast for future digital gaming releases. And we've returned $194 million of capital to our shareholders via dividends. In the quarter, we booked a 26.3% underlying tax rate, which compares to 21.6% in Q2 of last year. The higher rate is driven by our entertainment business losses and higher withholding taxes plus a shift in the geographical mix of income. Additionally, we had $4.8 million of additional interest expense due to higher interest rates. Turning to our 2023 guidance. The outlook across the Consumer Products segment remains on track and Wizards of the co-segment is better than original expectations. For the Entertainment segment, we are updating guidance to reflect the reality of the writers and actors strikes on our eOne film and TV business. This updated guidance assumes film and TV is included for the entire fiscal year, and we will update once the close is complete. Based on this, we now expect total Hasbro Inc. revenue down 3% to 6%. As we look at the 3 primary segments, this guidance continues to assume that the CP business will be down mid-single digits, which is consistent with our initial outlook. We are planning for POS trends to continue stabilizing in the back half of the year, and this coupled with stronger execution will result in modest back half revenue growth. We now expect that Wizards of the Coast will deliver high single-digit revenue growth compared to our original guidance of mid-single digits. We are confident in the back half releases slated for MAGIC. And digital licensing should also be supported by the continued success of MONOPOLY GO! and the upcoming release of the AAA role-playing game, Baldur's Gate 3. And finally, for entertainment, we are now expecting revenue declines of 25% to 30%, which incorporates the impact of the writers and actors strikes on production deliveries in the back half of the year. Adjusted operating margin is now expected to be up 20 to 50 basis points versus last year's adjusted operating margin. The margin outlook for CP and Wizards of the Coast are the same or better than our previous guidance. The guidance reflects unfavorable changes in entertainment given the strikes as well as the D&amp;D impairments. This margin guidance continues to expect $150 million of in-year cost savings driven by our operational excellence program as well as assumes that the cost to clear inventory reduces in the back half of the year. Despite the headwind from the entertainment segment, we continue to expect 2023 adjusted EBITDA to be relatively flat to prior year. And based on our current forecast, we continue to expect to generate $600 million to $700 million of operating cash flow. From a capital allocation standpoint, our priorities are to invest behind the business, pay down debt and return excess cash to shareholders via dividends. We expect to use the cash generated from the sale of the eOne film and TV to pay down debt, which will accelerate the reduction of our overall debt by a minimum of $400 million and advance our progress towards achieving our 2.5x long-term leverage target. In terms of earnings per share, despite adjusted EBITDA guidance remaining unchanged, the film and TV business has created additional volatility impacting below-the-line items, including interest expense and tax rate. Through the second quarter, film and TV has created an approximate $0.50 negative impact on earnings per share, and based on our updated outlook, we anticipate an additional $0.10 to $0.20 negative impact on the full year. Given this, as well as the divestiture, we are withdrawing total Hasbro, Inc. earnings per share guidance for the year, and we'll revisit reintroducing the metric once we have closed the transaction. Our remaining segments are continuing to grow their EPS contribution versus original expectations and versus last year behind strong Wizards growth and cost savings momentum. I'm 3 months in at Hasbro. And every day, I am more excited about the opportunities ahead for this amazing company. We have a lot of work ahead of us to deliver the year, but we are making progress in gaining momentum with today's announcement of the sale of the eOne film and TV business being the latest milestone. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Chris to wrap up.Christian CocksThanks, Gina. While our overall guidance is down for the year, the puts and takes are contained in the segment that we have found a better home for and a company adept a driving value. Our core business is making tangible progress. And while the next 6 months will present entertainment-related headwinds, we will emerge a more focused, more profitable and more predictable business. This will enable us to continue to fund our category-leading dividend, improve our balance sheet health and drive value for our shareholders, partners and fans of all ages. We'll now pause to take questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question is from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies.Andrew Paul UerkwitzGreat. Good luck joining, Gina, it's great to have you onboard. The increase in guidance around [YAHTZEE], could you go through the puts and takes there? Is that driven largely by MAGIC, better expectations on Baldur's Gate, where it launches today, or MONOPOLY GO!. Can you just walk through some of the changes there?Christian CocksYes. Sure thing. And thanks, Andrew. At a high level, I'd say it's bullishness around MAGIC and good progress with our digital licensing portfolio. Baldur's Gate and MONOPOLY GO! included -- I'll turn it over to Gina to go through more details.Gina GoetterAndrew, I don't know that I have additional color to add. I do think that our performance in the first part of the year overall for [YAHTZEE] in the digital segment has been on our expectation. We're seeing some good progress with Lord of the Rings. We're really excited about that launch. That came out in June. So the bulk of the revenue gain will be a pickup here in Q3. And as Chris said, the launches that we've got scheduled for the back half of the year, we're feeling really good about.Christian CocksYes. I should note that Lord of the Rings is a -- it's not a standard set. We think it's more of an evergreen set that will have a longer tail. And our in year expectation is that within 7 months of it releasing, it will be the #1 set of all time for MAGIC. It should cross $200 million before the end of the calendar year. The last set that did that was Modern Horizons 2, and it took about 2 years for it to do that.Andrew Paul UerkwitzGot it. That's super helpful and great color. I appreciate it. Just kind of thinking about the digital strategy going forward that sits within Wizards of the Coast. Could you just give us an update on your thoughts there, eOne is gone now. We can kind of start focusing on the video games and segments. You have some internal studios. So could you just kind of give us an update on where everything stands and what the primary drivers going to be there 1 year out, 3 years out, maybe?Christian CocksYes. At a high level, I'd say it's a balanced strategy between working with licensed partners, which is very high profit for us, and we've been fortunate to have some fantastic partners like Scopely and Larian who we think are making knock it out of the park games and then patiently investing on a milestone basis with our own internal studio development and publishing capability development.When you look at a game like Baldur's Gate 3, I view that as a block -- the equivalent of a blockbuster movie release. Just to put it in perspective, we think Baldur's Gate 3 has the potential to be a game-of-the-year contender. It will engage millions of highly targeted fans and be highly accretive to the D&amp;D brand. And just to kind of put it in a financial perspective, we will likely make more money on Baldur's Gate 3 than we have made on all of our film licensing for the last 5 to 10 years, combined. So it's not only a great brand win, it's a great financial win for us. And I think it's a heavy focus of the company moving forward. We purposely stated in this release that we're a leading toy and game company. We are squarely focused on that. And I would say the emphasis is on the gaming part of that.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Arpine Kocharian with UBS.Arpine KocharianI was wondering if you could help us bridge margin guidance down about 25 basis points at midpoint. But then what you want to be up is actually up and what you want to be down is actually down. You have high-margin gaming revenue outlook up, but lower margin Entertainment segment revenue actually lower. And I know you mentioned margin for Wizard is actually unchanged or better. And then incremental headwind from impairment charges, I guess. Is there anything else that you would point out in bridging that?Gina GoetterThis is Gina. No, I think you've got it square on. Our margin guide down. We were a little bit more bullish starting the year at 30 to 60 bps and now we're saying 20 to 50. And that is really all about the impairment that we took within D&amp;D and what is happening within the film and TV segment itself or the broader entertainment itself. When we look at our core business, our toys business, our games business, that margin profile is healthy and actually a little bit better than what we expected it to be. We're seeing some nice momentum in our cost savings initiatives. And you can see that in the margin bridges that we provided, you can see that starting to pull through the P&amp;L, and that really starts to accelerate as we look to the back half of the year. So the call on the margin, all about entertainment, all about what happened with the D&amp;D impairment and our core businesses that we are keeping are doing quite well.Arpine KocharianThat's very helpful. And I know you aren't giving EPS guidance at this point, but you mentioned $0.50 of TV and film from EPS headwind and then additional $0.10 to $0.20 of headwind. Could you maybe go over a high level -- just basic math, I'm calculating close to no more than $0.25 in operating profit that you're giving up with this sale and then that's obviously partially offset by run rate interest expense cost savings down the road. Maybe if you could kind of point out whether that thinking is correct, high level? And then if you could break down that $0.50 a little bit more?Gina GoetterSure. I will try my best to answer that math question. So when you -- our guidance that we originally had given was [4.45] to [4.55] and what we communicated was at 2 dates. So through the first 6 months, we've had a $0.50 headwind by the entertainment segment. And what we anticipate in the back half of the year is that's going to be another $0.20. So all in our earnings per share guidance, if we're continuing to give guidance, would come down by $0.70, all in the film and TV, all in the Entertainment segment. Again, our core business, toy and game and the digital part of our business, that is actually performing ahead of expectation. There are some puts and takes within tax and interest expense, so that kind of nets against that, but the call down in earnings per share, all in entertainment.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar.Jaime M. KatzI know you guys are not really guiding on the sale of eOne, but I'm hoping that you can frame the size of what will be left after the assets are sold? Will it be 10% of the entertainment business. And then with that sale, is there any reason that cost of goods sold and program production costs wouldn't go back closer to 2019 levels just as we think through sort of the math of how that segment has impacted the overall P&amp;L?Gina GoetterSure, Jaime. In the slide deck that we provided, we put a chart in there to try to dimensionalize the total Entertainment segment and then the piece of the business that is being divested. So about 85% of the segment is going to sale in terms of its revenue and the balance of 15% is staying with us, and it will be embedded in the new kind of view of entertainment of we're approaching moving forward. In terms of how to think about production costs, I'd have to go back to where we were in 2019 to see it precisely, if we're up down or sideways from that. But -- yes, you can assume the eOne business was spending $500 million, $600 million in production dollars that, that will -- we will not be -- they will not be spending that or we will not be spending that amount of money moving forward.Christian CocksWill be up versus 2019, simply because we continue to invest in some coproductions with Paramount, like we're doing with TRANSFORMERS 1, which is a new animated film that will come out next year. And then we're also doing production for things like a D&amp;D TV series. Now that is a cost-plus model that Paramount is fully funding. So we get the production margin from that plus like a licensing fee for being an IP owner on something like that. And then also, we're retaining the eOne family brands portion of the purchase, which is a big value portion of the purchase with big brands like PEPPA PIG. So that's incremental to 2019 as well. But as Gina states, it's far lower than the run rate we've been on for the last several years.Jaime M. KatzRight. And then I think there was some prepared remarks that said there was momentum with key retailers. So any further color on that would be helpful.Christian CocksYes. We won't name them by name. But certainly, it's nice to have clean inventories and inventories reduced. If you look at like our top 3 or 4 retailers, I feel pretty good about where we're going with them. Some of them are taking still a pretty aggressive stance on inventory management. And so we're working with them. but others are really leaning in and seeing an opportunity to build share and have great kind of on-shelf availability. So -- and e-commerce continues to gallop forward and consume share in the category. We just had a great Amazon Prime Day, we have had really good discussions with our major retailers around top toys for the holiday. So I'm cautiously optimistic that you're going to see Hasbro gained share in terms of what our key retailers announced, and we're already starting to talk to them about 2024 and 2025. And with our new management team, I think we've tightened up the innovation muscle quite a bit, and we'll have some momentum going into that year, particularly as we see what folks like Tim Kilpin, who's our new leader of our toy team, has up the sleeve in terms of new product innovation.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Eric Handler with ROTH MKM.Eric Owen HandlerI believe you said that Hasbro Pulse POS was up 54%, and I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that business and size it and talk about some of the growth plans for that?Christian CocksYes, sure. Eric, nice to talk. So Hasbro Pulse, as we talked about back in October at our Investor Day, direct-to-consumer is important to us. It's a great way for us to learn from our consumers, see how they shop, see what they want. And our initial efforts are very focused on kind of like that dedicated sand segment, both what we do for secret layer with what we do at Wizards of the Coast, what we do with kind of the D&amp;D fan with D&amp;D Beyond in terms of digital goods. And then Hasbro Pulse is more about kind of like that fan economy segment. And that's performed super well. It's a great partnership with our Disney business. There's a lot of Star Wars that goes through there. There's a lot of Marvel. There's a lot of super high-end transformers and Hasbro-owned items, like the Robosen auto transforming Optimus Prime that we released last year and an auto transforming Grimlock that we just recently announced and a great opportunity for us to sell high-end items. I would scope the business right now in the kind of the $100 million to $200 million range. I think we see significant upside for that, call it, potentially a TAM or a TAM opportunity for double maybe 2.5x that over the next couple of years. And as we start to build critical mass and capabilities in that segment, I think you'll also see us evolve our perspective on what we could do there. We'll start with fan focus, and then we'll evolve that and hopefully start going out in concentric circles over time, respecting the fact that we have a lot of great third-party retail relationships, and making sure that we model kind of the mix of products appropriately.Eric Owen HandlerGreat. That's helpful. And also, wonder if you could just talk about retailer sentiment as you go, as orders start coming in for a holiday season and how do you think retailers are feeling right now as they think about the last 1.5 months of the year?Christian CocksWell, I think it depends on the retailer. We have a couple of retailers who are really leaning in and see a share building opportunity. We have a retailer or 2 who are taking a cautious view towards consumer discretionary as a whole and aggressively managing their inventory. And I think a little bit of an over-under on our guidance moving forward and why we're not raising our guidance in consumer products, is just making sure that we understand where those retailers are ultimately going to position. I definitely think Q4 is going to be a more traditional Q4 kind of a 2018, 2019, it's going to be very end of the quarter focused. I think Black Friday is going to be important. I think the lead-up and the drumbeat into Christmas is going to be important. And then also, I think array of bullishness that we have in the quarter is we have basically an extra couple of days of shopping prior to Christmas. And then for our fiscal year, we have an extra week because we ended our fiscal year last year, I think, on December 26. So we have a full extra week of potential shopping, which is probably about $60 million to $70 million of incremental POS.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Fred Wightman with Wolfe Research.Frederick Charles WightmanI just wanted to come back to Wizards. And if we think back to the Investor Day last fall, and I totally recognize a lot has changed, but it felt like D&amp;D was a big piece of the plan to double the Wizards business. And if we just think about the film impairment and the softer box office, does that put those targets at risk? Or is there enough traction and momentum in some other areas to offset that?Christian CocksNo. I mean -- Fred, I would say the underlying thesis of our D&amp;D business was all about digital. To me, entertainment is a kicker. It helps to enable broader audiences exposure to what's traditionally a mid-core to hardcore gaming brand. And what digital allows us to do is to kind of take that tabletop role-playing game TAM that we have in the world, which is probably about 80 million people who participate in those hobbies and frequent that kind of channel and take our brand like D&amp;D to 800 million people who play role playing games. And so I think Baldur's Gate 3 is just the first of several new digital initiatives you're going to see from us that spanned how we can try to transform tabletop role playing gaming to an even richer kind of theater-of-the-mind experience to more traditional video games from us and partners like Larian.Frederick Charles WightmanMakes sense. And then on the supply chain side, it feels like you guys have really emphasized that for the past few quarters. I'm wondering if you could just frame sort of where you see the supply chain today versus where you think it could be and then maybe what that ultimately means for the consumer product margin over the next few years?Gina GoetterI would say we are making really good progress within the supply chain. And I know that the company has talked about that in previous quarters. This quarter, especially, you can see the benefits starting to flow through within logistics. So a lot of the focus from the team has been around our logistic network, how we're planning for inventory, how we're -- kind of our order patterns working with our retailers all around inventory and in order management, and you can start to see that really play through the cost savings. We expect that to continue to accelerate as we move into the back half of the year. The overall logistics environment is continuing to moderate, so that will help us as well. So not only do we have a lot of efforts underway in that space, but the overall environment is much more calm than it has been compared to the previous few years. I think our focus moving forward will be there as well as working with all of our partners and getting a little bit closer to the operation with all of our manufacturers that will provide another opportunity for us, more so in 2024 than in 2023.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Jason Haas with Bank of America.Jason Daniel HaasI just want to follow up on some of the numbers that were given earlier in the year regarding some of the headwinds you are facing for the Consumer Products business. So I recall the expectation or I think at the beginning of the year, you had said that there was $135 million of excess retail inventory. So I was curious, apologies if I missed it, but how much of that have you worked through so far this year?Christian CocksYes. So I don't have a specific number to quantify the $135 million, but our retailer inventory is down 16% year-over-year. I think we feel like our retailer inventory is at a pretty productive level. I would say that through the balance of the year, our retail inventory will end the year down, but probably not 16% down. Our own inventory, we still are a little bit elevated versus what we would typically be, but we are down quite a bit versus 2021, about 24% or so. And I think we'll end the year at around that level, both for consumer products and for Wizards of the Coast. And that will get us to something that's more consistent to like what we ended in 2021 and within range of a more traditional level.Jason Daniel HaasGot it. That's helpful. Another figure, I think it was tied to that, but it was -- you had said that there's $300 million of headwinds. I think it was from exited licenses, FX and then also that inventory. And the expectation was about -- you'd see about 60% of that headwind in the first half. So I was curious if that, so far, has materialized as you had expected?Christian CocksYes. If you look at our POS for the first half of the year, we are down high single digits in POS. But when you take out those exited licenses, we're down low single digits. And as we get into the back half of the year, the impact of those licenses lessen because we were -- our sell-in was a little heavier as a percentage in the front half of the year. And as we were getting ready to kind of exit them, and our retailers were kind of taking their inventory positions down to prepare for other master toy licenses to enter, it just makes sense that way.Gina GoetterAnd Jason, just to add some color on the actual number, I would say of that $300 million, we're about halfway through that with the balance to come in the back half.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs.Stephen Neild LaszczykMaybe Gina, with this being your first earnings call since getting settled in, I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit more about your framework for thinking your leveraging capital allocation on the go forward, especially with eOne -- the sale of eOne now behind us? In particular, I'd be curious if you see any incremental opportunities on the investment or capital returns front over the next few years.Gina GoetterSure, Stephen. Yes, the sale of eOne absolutely helps us in terms of getting down to our leverage target. So we will use the majority of the proceeds from that sale to pay down our floating rate debt and start getting our balance sheet in a healthier position. As we move forward, as we think about capital allocation, first and foremost, our priority is to invest back into the business. Our second priority is then to keep cleaning up that balance sheet and getting that leverage ratio down. And then the third piece is to continue getting money back to our shareholders. Our primary vehicle has been dividends. We paid out dividends through the first part of the year. We expect to continue paying out dividends in the back half of the year. As we turn the corner in '24 and beyond, I think we will most likely add share repurchases back into the mix of capital allocation. But for now, in the near term here, our first 3 levers are invest, pay down debt, and then get back money via dividend.Stephen Neild LaszczykGot it. And then for Chris, I'm not sure if you've given this metric before, but since you mentioned it around Baldur's Gate, I was wondering if you could remind us how much money you've made in film licensing over the last 5 or 10 years? Any approximate sizing would be helpful.Christian CocksWe would have to get back to you, Steve, and I don't have that off the top of my head. It's not tremendous.OperatorAt this time, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I'll turn the call back over to Kristen Levy for closing remarks.Kristen LevyThank you for joining the call today. The replay will be available on our website in approximately 2 hours. Additionally, management's prepared remarks will be posted on our website following this call. Hasbro management will be participating in the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference on September 6. Hope to see you there.OperatorThis concludes today's conference.

(Getty Images)Lions Gate Entertainment has agreed to buy the EOne film and TV studio from toymaker Hasbro for $375 million in cash plus the assumption of loans.Hasbro will use proceeds from the deal, valued at $500 million including loans, to pay down debt, the company said in a statement on Thursday, confirming an earlier Bloomberg report. The largest U.S. toymaker separately reported second-quarter revenue of $1.21 billion, beating Wall Street’s expectations. Shares were up 4.1% at 10:05 a.m. in New York.With the purchase, Santa Monica-based Lions Gate stands to gain a library of about 6,500 titles, as well as the rights to develop a Monopoly film. Existing titles include the reality show ""Naked and Afraid"" and a distribution arm for popular series such as ""The Walking Dead.""Hasbro, which gained the popular ""Peppa Pig"" kids franchise when it acquired the studio in 2019 for $4 billion, has been selling EOne divisions it doesn’t consider central to its strategy. In 2021, the toymaker sold EOne’s music business to Blackstone Inc. for $385 million.Chris Cocks, Hasbro’s chief executive officer, said in the statement that the sale would allow the company to “focus on our core toy and game expertise.”Read more: Looking beyond 'Transformers,' Hasbro wants to create its own Marvel-sized movie universeThe deal has been approved by both companies’ boards and is expected to close by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approvals. The accord will delay Lions Gate’s planned spinoff of its Starz TV business beyond a September target until closer to year-end, to comply with regulatory processes, people familiar with the deal said previously.EOne generated $829 million in revenue last year, or about 14% of Hasbro’s total. The business was created from the merger of several music distributors and expanded into Hollywood in the 2000s. Recently produced titles include the film ""The Woman King"" and the TV series ""Yellowjackets,"" which airs on Showtime.Story continuesHasbro’s franchise segment, which is Hasbro’s largest sales driver and now includes ""Peppa Pig"" and other brands such as ""Dungeons &amp; Dragons,"" saw its net revenue fall in the second quarter by 5% from a year earlier to $788.4 million.The company expects revenue to decline 3% to 6% this year, in large part because of its entertainment segment, and adjusted earnings to be “approximately flat” with 2022.Last week, rival Mattel reported sales and profit that beat analysts’ expectations as the stockpile of unsold products at retailers shrinks.

We are seeing it push higher after the toy giant announced its eOne film and TV business will be sold to Lionsgate in a $500 million deal. The company also lowered its full year guidance, blaming the ongoing strike in Hollywood. Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks joins me now. Chris, always great to get some time with you here. So I think the big news out of the gate is in fact the sale of eOne. $500 million. Why did you make the deal now, and where will you spend that money?CHRIS COCKS: Well, we've been in-- Brian, first off, thanks for having me. We've been in a process with eOne for about nine months now. We announced it back in November. It was just the right thing to do for the company. You know, Hasbro has become great because of Play, and we're really refocusing on toys and games. We'll continue to have a great entertainment presence. But when we looked at eOne and we looked at the film and TV division in particular, there was just a lot of brands that we weren't going to make action figures or board games for and we figured there was a better home for it.BRIAN SOZZI: Does this deal, Chris, help you save money?CHRIS COCKS: Yeah. You know, from a high level perspective, we spend about $600 to $700 million a year in film and TV production of which, from an operating cash flow perspective, we fund about $50 to $100 million of that from Hasbro corporate. So there will be that upside for us.Story continuesAnd then the margins inside of the film and TV division, while it's profitable, it's nominal. So it'll be immediately margin accretive to us as well. And then last but not least, based on the proceeds of the sale, we're going to be able to pay down a minimum of $400 million of debt and accelerate our path to our long-term debt to EBITDA ratio of 2 to 2.5.BRIAN SOZZI: Got it. I want to make sure the investor base understands. Is Hasbro out of the content game? Are you still playing-- you know, you still have an eye toward bringing some of your biggest franchises to life on a big screen or streaming platform?CHRIS COCKS: Oh, for sure. Yeah, I mean, the film and TV division is probably about 85% of our entertainment revenue from last year. We still have huge brands like Peppa Pig, a lot of animation efforts. And we have over 30 projects in development across live action and animation, including future movies for Transformers, GI Joe, TV shows for D&amp;D, Magic, The Gathering, as well as a host of projects for our board games, including a movie that we're developing based on Monopoly with Lionsgate.I think the big pivot for us is is we're going to be returning to much more of an asset-light model where we work with the best and brightest in Hollywood and leverage their distribution platforms and their content creation know-how, and we'll focus on what we do-- what we do really well, which is play.BRIAN SOZZI: Yesterday, Chris, I had a-- I had a chance to catch up with Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and his company's also going through a transformation. But he said something to me pretty powerful, I think, you know, that green shoots in his business that started three months ago are now morphing into plants. I think he meant the turnaround is starting to take shape. Where does your turnaround stand?CHRIS COCKS: Oh, I think it's palpably taking shape. You know, we entered the year predicting our first half would be down 20%. After Q1, we said it would be down 16%. And after Q2, we're down 12%. Our POS has been picking up through the year. We're still not fully to green, but we're definitely seeing improvements in our toy segment.And our Wizards of the Coast segment continues to be, in my opinion, one of the best stories in all of games. You know, we see that segment up minimally high-- high single digits this year. And that's on a track record of-- I think we have a five-year CAGR of around 13%. So there's a lot to focus on in terms of our turnaround story and in terms of our momentum around it.BRIAN SOZZI: What's next in your turnaround story?CHRIS COCKS: Well, I think for us it's really for a couple of things. On entertainment, we're going towards an asset-light model. I think that's going to save us money. It's going to raise our margins, which is important for us. I think in toys, it continues to be driving the innovation funnel there, working with our retailers to be the best execution game in town.And then in games, you know, we're a toy and game company, but I really place the emphasis in games. That's an incredibly high margin business for us, a great growth business for us, and I think you're going to see us lean in more and more there. We've got a $2.1 billion game portfolio with a better than 30% operating profit margin. You know, over the next five to six years, I'd like to see us make some material progress and continuing to grow that and keep that bottom line super healthy.BRIAN SOZZI: Chris, a lot of your biggest customers-- Walmart, Target, you name it-- are thinking about what games, what toys they will put on the shelves this holiday season. What are you hearing for them right now? Because as we all know, before we know it, we'll be out shopping for gifts again.CHRIS COCKS: Yeah. Well, you're seeing a couple of our favorites right here and some of our retail partners' favorites. You know this little guy, Furby, he-- we sold out on initial allocations in the first 72 hours, so we think that's going to be a toy of the holidays. We've got some great new Monopoly collaborations. This one's based on Super Mario Brothers. But we did one with NBA Prizm, which basically vaporized in the first half of the year.And probably one of the games I'm most looking forward to in the back half of the year is our first collaboration with Mattel on Barbie Monopoly. So taking one of the biggest names in games with one of the biggest names in dolls and really having a nice giftable moment. And then, you know, across the portfolio, whether it's action figures with our hit movie for ""Transformers, Rise of the Beast,"" or just other new games that we're doing like Twister Air, I think there's a lot of reasons for optimism in the back half for us.BRIAN SOZZI: Chris, you mentioned the ""Barbie"" movie, and really it is-- it's sucked the air out of a lot of different things-- clothing at Gap, at fast fashion retailers. Do you think it has sucked the air out of just toys unrelated to the ""Barbie"" movie, and does that hurt a Hasbro this holiday season?CHRIS COCKS: No. I mean, what we're seeing is the toy category is starting to pick up a little bit. You know, RPOS has been positive, especially when you X out kind of exited licenses for the past four, five weeks. You know, ""Transformers, Rise of the Beast,"" we've had an 83% pickup in point of sale since the release of that movie. Spider-man, since ""Across The Spider-Verse,"" we've had a greater than 100% pickup in point of sales.And then again, you know, we're selling new items like Furby, which retails for around $60, and that's selling out instantaneously. So you know, I give my congratulations to Mattel. I think they really did a fantastic job with that movie and particularly the marketing campaign around it. And I think, if anything, that movie isn't sucking the oxygen out of the category. It's proving how vital the category is and how important the IP is.BRIAN SOZZI: What movies do you think will drive your business over the next 12 months? I've talked to a couple analysts, and I'm starting to hear a change in tone in their voice, Chris, regarding potential franchises that may start to drive your business again outside of ""Transformers.""CHRIS COCKS: Well, I think ""Transformers"" has done a good job and I think we'll have a nice pickup in holiday based on that. ""Spider-Man, Across the Spider-Verse"" will have another pickup in holiday as well. We're looking forward to a new ""Avengers"" movie next year. We have another ""Transformers"" animated movie coming out next year.And then, you know, I think video games is a big moment for us as well. We've got a new video game coming out today from our partners at Larian called Baldur's Gate 3. I mean, that's going to be one of the biggest video game releases of the year on PC and PlayStation. Should be a game of the year contender. And in terms of our D&amp;D business, I mean, that's a huge catalyst for that business and an important partner for us that we wish all the best for.BRIAN SOZZI: Chris, I figured, while I have you here, I might just admit to you, I used to collect a couple of Furbys, you know? I'm all about full disclosure.CHRIS COCKS: Oh, nice.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, I might have to get back into it. I see that one continuing to look at me on the screen. Chris-- Chris Cocks, Hasbro CEO, good to see you. I'll talk to you soon.]"

While the continued shift in investor preference toward passive investing may weigh on margins to some extent, higher rates will aid margin growth.Amid the pandemic-induced uncertainty, investment management companies benefited from higher volatility and client activity. Despite the current subdued market volatility, investment managers are expected to witness growth in their assets under management (AUM) balances because of asset inflows. Thus, firms like T. Rowe Price Group TROW, SEI Investments Company SEIC and Artisan Partners Asset Management APAM will benefit.About the IndustryThe Zacks Investment Management industry consists of companies that manage securities and funds for clients to meet specified investment goals. They earn by charging service fees or commissions. Investment managers are also called asset managers, as they manage hedge funds, mutual funds, private equity, venture capital and other financial investments for third parties. By appointing an investment manager for one’s assets, investors get more diversification options than they would have if they managed their assets by themselves. Investment managers invest their clients’ assets in different asset classes, depending on their needs and risk-taking abilities. Hence, the diversification, which investors get by appointing asset managers to manage their assets, helps reduce the impact of volatility and ensures steady returns over time.3 Investment Management Industry Trends to Keep an Eye onDespite Shift in Preferences, Higher Interest Rates Likely to Aid Margins: Interest rate hikes from the beginning of 2022 have resulted in an improvement in investment managers’ margins. Also, the rise in industry consolidation witnessed since 2020 is likely to continue supporting bottom-line growth. However, given the continued need for low-cost investment strategies, the demand for passive investing has been on the rise, which has hurt investment managers’ margin growth. Nevertheless, while the Federal Reserve paused rate hikes in June, it increased rates again in July, and is expected to keep interest rates high in the near term. Thus, rising rates are expected to support margin growth to an extent, while higher funding costs may slightly weigh on it.AUM Growth Likely to Continue Despite a Volatile Trend in Asset Flows: In 2020 and the first half of 2021, there was a significant rise in equity market volatility and solid client activity, owing to the coronavirus-induced uncertainty, which aided total AUM growth. In the second half of 2021, markets began to normalize, with client activity remaining decent. Year 2022 again witnessed an unexpected rise in volatility and relatively higher client activity, resulting in asset inflows for the majority of the industry players. While the overall market volatility has decreased so far in 2023, various asset managers are still experiencing asset inflows, as investors seek higher yields. Thus, despite the current challenging market conditions, AUM growth is expected to continue in the near term. Asset managers’ top lines are, therefore, expected to be positively impacted by higher performance fees and investment advisory fees, which constitute the majority of their revenues.Elevated Costs Are Concerning: The tightening of regulations to increase transparency has led to a rise in compliance costs for investment managers. Also, as wealth managers are constantly trying to upgrade technology to keep up with evolving customer needs, technology costs are expected to keep rising. These will likely lead to an increase in overall expenses, thus, hurting investment managers’ bottom lines.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Investment Management industry is a 41-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #112, which places it at the top 45% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a bright earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are slowly gaining confidence in this group’s bottom-line growth potential following the release of better-than-expected second-quarter 2023 results. The industry’s current-year earnings estimates have been revised marginally upward since the end of June 2023.Before we present a few stocks from the industry that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s check out the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Investment Management industry has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 and its sector in the past two years.Stocks in the industry have collectively lost 10.6%. The S&amp;P 500 composite has rallied 3.2%, while the Zacks Finance Sector has depreciated 2.2%.Two-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOne might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TB), which is commonly used for valuing finance companies because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TB of 3.75X. This compares with the highest level of 5.43X, the lowest level of 2.12X and the median of 3.69X over the past five years. Additionally, the industry is trading at a significant discount compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TB for the S&amp;P 500 composite is 10.92X, which the chart below shows.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)As finance stocks typically have a low P/TB ratio, comparing investment managers with the S&amp;P 500 may not make sense to many investors. But a comparison of the group’s P/TB ratio with that of its broader sector seems more meaningful. When we compare the group’s P/TB ratio with the broader Finance sector, it seems that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance sector’s trailing 12-month P/TB of 4.51X for the same period is above the Zacks Investment Management industry’s ratio, which the chart below shows.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)3 Investment Management Stocks to BuyT. Rowe Price: Headquartered in Baltimore, T. Rowe Price is a global investment management organization that provides a broad array of mutual funds, sub-advisory services and separate account management for individual and institutional investors, retirement plans, and financial intermediaries.The company, with a market capitalization of more than $25 billion, had total AUM worth $1.4 trillion as of Jun 30, 2023. Supported by a diverse business model, the company’s AUM witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% over the past five years (2017-2022), with the upward momentum continuing in the first half of 2023. Its strong brand, consistent investment record and decent business volumes are expected to keep supporting AUM growth.Also, the company’s net revenues saw a three-year (ended 2022) CAGR of 2.2%. TROW’s focus on fortifying its business by enhancing investment capabilities and broadening distribution reach will continue to support the top line.T. Rowe Price’s inorganic growth efforts are also impressive. In April 2023, it acquired Retiree, a fintech firm providing innovative retirement income planning software. In December 2021, T. Rowe Price completed the buyout of Oak Hill Advisors, L.P., while in May 2021, it transformed the responsibility of its full-service retirement recordkeeping business to Fidelity National, which came into effect in August 2021. As TROW is committed to diversifying its revenue streams and meeting customer needs, such endeavors will likely support its long-term prospects.In the past three months, shares of TROW have gained 12.2%. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 earnings has been revised 5.3% higher to $6.99 per share, whereas its 2024 earnings estimates have witnessed an upward revision of 6.8% to $7.40.

Its total AUM included $86.5 billion, managed by its affiliate, LSV Asset Management.The company’s diversified products and revenue mix, a strong global presence, the acquisition of Atlas Master Trust (November 2021), and a solid AUM balance reflect improving prospects. Also, its deal to acquire National Pensions Trust will enhance its position in the defined contribution market.Further, technology is the backbone of SEI Investments’ businesses. The company’s 2021 strategic acquisitions, including Oranj's cloud-native technology platform, Finomial and Novus, support its technological advancement efforts. In 2022, the company launched SEI Data Cloud through a strategic partnership with Snowflake to address the financial services industry’s demand for more advanced data integration. These initiatives and constant innovations in software will likely help SEIC win clients and, thus, support top-line growth.SEIC’s shares have gained 6.9% in the past three months.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $509.67 million.

Nonetheless, the coffee shop chain saw growth in year-over-year sales, including those in China and other international markets. Investors should ""buying the management team,"" Tengler says on the confidence of Starbucks' executive leadership. Chipmaker Broadcom has beaten earnings estimates in their past 12 quarters. In a short span of 3 months since May 2023, Broadcom shares price has exponentially risen by over $250.Courier company UPS faces headwinds in the form of rising costs as delivery drivers negotiate a new labor deal. “We’re exiting the name and we're putting the proceeds to short-cycle industrial names, and that's where I think you want to be focused in the next 9 months to a year,"" Tengler says. Lastly, pharmacy CVS has topped earnings estimates while undergoing layoffs as part of an ongoing cost-cutting strategy. ""The balance sheet is burdened with debt,"" Tengler notes, advising to invest in traditional health care and consumer staple sectors.Video Transcript- Being in the thick of earnings season, investors are constantly looking for investing opportunities but also warnings on stocks to avoid. Laffer Tengler investments CEO and CIO Nancy Tengler back with her picks. And Nancy, let's begin with those stocks that you like, kind of something you mentioned earlier. Starbucks. You kind of describe this as more of a legacy company that really is getting consumers to sort of stick with the brand, particularly through their digital strategy and loyalty. What do you like about that?NANCY TENGLER: Well, I think, and most importantly, Akiko, is I really like the new CEO. And that matters. Investors should be investing like private equity investors do. They should be buying the management team. And he has demonstrated pretty clearly that he understands the global market in a way that I don't think previous CEOs necessarily have. And he has hired a new head of supply chain who is really going in and looking at every aspect of the business, which allowed them to improve margins during the quarter.Story continuesI just finished the second edition of my book, the Women's Guide to Successful Investing. And I wrote about Starbucks in that book. I bought it in April of 2007 at 30. It promptly went to 5 and just left to its own devices since then. It's up tens of thousands of percent in total return simply because this is a great company with a great brand that figures it out over time. They stumble, and that's an opportunity to add to holdings. And so we did that last year. And we will continue to add to holdings because I think they're going to be able to deliver on their pretty aggressive earnings and revenue growth numbers.- Oh, Nancy, I will be reading your book, especially when you give that context for that call. I mean, that was a big move since then. To your point, left to its own devices, even including the pandemic when so many stocks sold off and then popped back, and Starbucks has held up. I did listen to their earnings call this week. And you've made this point about some skepticism, there was.Particularly when you think of US sales, they talked a lot about China. But the penetration isn't there yet in China, especially to offset any kind of softening in terms of sales growth here in the US. You still like it in the face of skepticism?NANCY TENGLER: I do, Diane, because I think-- well, first, Wall Street analysts are not very good at turning points. Most people aren't. That's why we use a discipline that forces us to pay attention at turning points. But I think also, this is a management team that will figure it out. And the digital engagement-- I mean, what Laxman said on the call was not just that he wanted to embrace the digital portion, but he wants to scale. And that is how you get productivity and improvements in a name like this.And they have a lot of room for improvement. McDonald's noted I think it was 4 to 5 times the downloads of their digital app last quarter than Starbucks did. So even with the improvements in Starbucks' digital app, there is plenty of room. For growth and we think he's the one that is going to get that accomplished. And so we're getting paid a 2% dividend, 12% growth in that dividend. So we can kind of afford to just hang out and wait for the management team to get it right. They will. They have in the past. And they will do it again.- Another pick you like, Nancy, is Broadcom. You've mentioned this before, and this is one where you're standing by your man. Now to be fair, it has performed well since you last called for this as a pick. Does it still have more room, especially when you see some struggles that its competitors have?NANCY TENGLER: Oh, the chip names have been really sort of confounding this quarter. Some really good reports and some not so good reports, like we saw from Qualcomm today. But yes, and here's why. I think a couple of things. One is this is a name that is-- well, first of all, they've beaten 12 out of the last 12 quarters. And they've not just beat on revenues and earnings, but they've raised guidance every single quarter for the last quarter.It's a management team that understands their business infinitely. We weren't counting on the AI tailwind, but we got it. And we think it will continue to contribute materially to earnings growth in the future. You have the VMware transaction will close. That's good news for the stock, which is really actually about 50% software after that transaction and 50% chips.And then in addition, you are getting paid 2.1% dividend yield with 23.5% I think five-year annualized growth in the dividend over the last five years. I'll take that all day long. The stock is trading close to $1,000 a share. I think you're probably going to get a split, which doesn't add any economic value but adds to sentiment. And so I think when technology sells off, and I expect that will happen between now and the end of the year, this is a name you want to go in and scoop up.- And Nancy, let's talk about some of the names that you say investors should steer clear from. UPS one of those. How much of this has to do with rising costs? On the one hand, UPS averted the worst case scenario with a strike. But when you look at the tentative agreement, that only points to higher costs ahead.NANCY TENGLER: And that's the reason, Akiko. I mean, I think there's just better places to be. You want to own industrials when the manufacturing PMIs are bottoming. They are. But you want to own the short cycle names. So even though I think Carol Tome is an excellent CEO, I think you are getting paid to wait. So if you own the stock, you're collecting a pretty nice dividend. I think the stock will outperform in the future.But in the near term, I just think there are better places to be. So if you don't own it, don't buy it here. I think it's tempting. But I wouldn't. We're exiting the name. And we're putting the proceeds into short cycle industrial names. And that's where I think you want to be focused in the next nine months to a year.- And Nancy, another one that you don't like, and you've mentioned this before actually, CVS. And once again, you've nailed this one. I mean, year to date the stock is down 20%. It did beat on its latest earnings. However, there's some caution there. Take us through the case for steering clear of this one.NANCY TENGLER: Well, Diane, thank you. I think it's, again, there are better places to be in health care and certainly in consumer staples/discretionary or retail, however you want to characterize the name. I would use this bounce to exit. And the reason for that is the balance sheet is burdened with debt. They were just paying it down, starting to grow the dividend, and then they made a number of acquisitions.I don't really get the model. I mean, I understand it, but I'm not convinced that it's going to be a high growth name in the future. So it's one of those names that could sit in the portfolio and contribute from a dividend growth perspective. But again, we're finding much more attractive places to be in the market. And I just don't think-- I think this is dead money. You are collecting dividend. I don't think it's going to grow very much because the company has a lot of debt to pay back.And there was a lot of concession around the fact that their earnings growth is going to is going to be slow. So I wouldn't invest the capital here. I'd look for better opportunities in health care, consumer staples, and consumer discretionary.- Nancy Tengler with Laffer Tengler Investments. Good takeaways there. Really appreciate the time today.NANCY TENGLER: Thanks so much.]"

The company’s oral care products are now available at more than 12,500 retail stores nationwide, including Walmart, CVS and Walgreens. SDC’s long-term target looks promising. Key transformative innovations hold the potential to drive growth.However, a tough competitive space and continued operating losses are concerning for SDC.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has lost 33.6% against 16.5% growth of the industry and a 10.3% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned oral care company has a market capitalization of $437.2 million. SDC projects a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 20.3%, ahead of the industry’s expected growth rate of 11.6%. SmileDirectClub delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 0.81% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s delve deeper.Factors at PlayStrategic Alliances Adding Value: SDC’s retail partnerships have been aimed at serving a highly efficient lead source and brand-building opportunity.In the first quarter, the company introduced sales specialists in targeted partner network practices to better educate customers about the differences between its two service offerings — CarePlus and traditional virtual care. Based on these insights, the firm developed a dual journey offering, which educates and allows customers with bookings at CarePlus partner network practices the option to choose between CarePlus and virtual care, regardless of the initial appointment type book. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Innovations Driving Growth: In May 2023, SmileDirectClub launched its innovative SmileMaker Platform in the United States, expanding its patented technology to its largest market. The technology is an industry first, upgrading current 2D remote scanning options and introducing real-time AI to capture a 3D view of teeth.In February, SDC availed its new premium aligner treatment, CarePlus, at select partner network dentist locations. The company also expanded its innovative suite of premium, affordable oral care products with the addition of a Sensitivity-Free Whitening Kit.Story continuesLong-Term Growth Targets Appear Encouraging: SmileDirectClub’s long-term strategy includes achieving the average revenue growth target of 20-30% per year and adjusted EBITDA margins of 25-30% for the next five years. This implies a long-term target on a sequential basis of 5-7% each quarter. Per the company, this long-term revenue target reflects the efforts to capture market share, while improving customer experience.For 2023, SmileDirectClub expects total core business revenues of $400-$450 million. SDC’s revenues in the first quarter of 2023 were well ahead of estimates.DownsidesOperating Losses Trend Continues: In the first quarter, the company posted a year-over-year decline in revenues due to persistent macroeconomic headwinds, driven by high inflation that impacted its customer base. Earnings for the quarter missed estimates. Meanwhile, the operating loss trend continued, with the company posting a narrower loss in the first quarter, than the year-ago adjusted figure.A Competitive Landscape Poses Challenge: SmileDirectClub competes with a handful of smaller companies that collectively have a limited market share in the clear aligner industry, including Candid Co., Byte (Dentsply) and SnapCorrect. Following the introduction of the company’s collaborative and wholesale partner network, it faces competition from more well-established competitors in the traditional orthodontic industry, which requires in-person visits, such as Align Technology, Inc.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for SmileDirectClub’s 2023 loss per share has been unchanged at 42 cents in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $433.9 million. This suggests a 7.8% drop from the year-ago reported number.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Penumbra PEN and Intuitive Surgical ISRG.Zimmer Biomet has an earnings yield of 5.64% against the industry’s -3.72%. Zimmer Biomet’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and was break-even in one, the average surprise being 4.47%.

Therefore, PPL is not able to provide an equivalent GAAP measure for earnings guidance.See the table at the end of this news release for a complete reconciliation of the earnings forecast.About PPLPPL Corporation (NYSE: PPL), headquartered in Allentown, Pennsylvania, is a leading U.S. energy company focused on providing electricity and natural gas safely, reliably and affordably to more than 3.5 million customers in the U.S. PPL's high-performing, award-winning utilities are addressing energy challenges head-on by building smarter, more resilient and more dynamic power grids and advancing sustainable energy solutions.

PPL believes that Earnings from Ongoing Operations is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management's view of PPL's earnings performance as another criterion in making investment decisions. In addition, PPL's management uses Earnings from Ongoing Operations in measuring achievement of certain corporate performance goals, including targets for certain executive incentive compensation. Other companies may use different measures to present financial performance.Earnings from Ongoing Operations is adjusted for the impact of special items. Special items are presented in the financial tables on an after-tax basis with the related income taxes on special items separately disclosed.

The company delivered an earnings surprise of 9.1% in the last reported quarter.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.Factors to ConsiderPPL’s second-quarter earnings are likely to have benefited from ongoing capital investments to further strengthen infrastructure. The bottom line is also expected to have gained from operation and maintenance savings through the company’s centralization efforts and asset optimization. Our model predicts other operation and maintenance expenses of $502.5 million for the quarter, down 10.3% year over year.The company’s quarterly results are likely to have been impacted by unfavorable weather conditions in some of its service territories that might have led to lower electricity demand. Higher interest expenses are expected to have offset some positives.Q2 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 32 cents per share, indicating a year-over-year increase of 6.7%. The consensus mark for revenues is pinned at $1.72 billion, implying a year-over-year improvement of 1.7%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total electricity delivered in Pennsylvania is pegged at 8,511 gigawatt-hour (GWh), down 0.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total electricity delivered in Kentucky is pegged at 6,096 GWh, down 14.7% year over year. Both the figures reflect the impact of unfavorable weather conditions in the aforementioned regions during the second quarter, reducing demand for electricity.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PPL this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

Our residential medicine software-as-a-service business continues to achieve high-single-digit growth organically expanding to solid double-digit growth including the contribution from MEDIFOX DAN. As we turn to fiscal year 2024, our focus remains on delivering world-leading therapy and digital health solutions so that even more people are able to sleep better, breathe better, and live higher-quality lives outside the hospital, preferably in their own home. We continue to significantly grow our impact each quarter, improving over 160 million lives in the last 12 months, well on our way to helping 250 million lives in 2025.”Story continuesFinancial Results and Operating MetricsUnaudited; $ in millions, except for per share amounts Three Months Ended June 30,2023 June 30,2022 % Change ConstantCurrency (A)Revenue$1,122.1  $914.7   23%  23%Gross margin 55.0%  57.1%  (4)  Non-GAAP gross margin (B) 55.8%  57.8%  (4)  Selling, general, and administrative expenses 240.7   193.0   25   26 Research and development expenses 78.1   64.3   21   23 Income from operations 275.3   255.4   8   Non-GAAP income from operations (B) 307.0   271.5   13   Net income 229.7   195.1   18   Non-GAAP net income (B) 235.5   219.2   7   Diluted earnings per share$1.56  $1.33   17   Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (B)$1.60  $1.49   7    Twelve Months Ended June 30,2023 June 30,2022 % Change ConstantCurrency (A)Revenue$4,223.0  $3,578.1   18%  21%Gross margin 55.8%  56.6%  (1)  Non-GAAP gross margin (B) 56.5%  57.7%  (2)  Selling, general, and administrative expenses 874.0   737.5   19   22 Research and development expenses 287.6   253.6   13   16 Income from operations 1,131.9   1,000.3   13   Non-GAAP income from operations (B) 1,224.4   1,072.9   14   Net income 897.6   779.4   15   Non-GAAP net income (B) 949.8   850.8   12   Diluted earnings per share$6.09  $5.30   15   Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (B)$6.44  $5.79   11                 (A) In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we provide certain financial information on a “constant currency” basis, which is in addition to the actual financial information presented. In order to calculate our constant currency information, we translate the current period financial information using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period. However, constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to U.S. dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.(B) See the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures in the table at the end of the press release.Discussion of Fourth Quarter ResultsAll comparisons are to the prior year period unless otherwise notedRevenue grew by 23 percent on a constant currency basis, driven by increased demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices as well as reduced competitive supply.Revenue in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America, excluding Software-as-a-Service, grew by 25 percent, primarily due to the factors discussed above.Revenue in Europe, Asia, and other markets, excluding Software-as-a-Service, grew by 14 percent on a constant currency basis.Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 34 percent, reflecting incremental revenue from our acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN and continued organic growth in our SaaS portfolio.Gross margin decreased by 210 basis points and non-GAAP gross margin decreased by 200 basis points, mainly due to unfavorable product mix and higher component and manufacturing costs, partially offset by an increase in average selling prices.Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by 26 percent on a constant currency basis. SG&amp;A expenses increased to 21.5 percent of revenue in the quarter, compared with 21.1 percent in the same period of the prior year. These changes in SG&amp;A expenses were mainly due to increases in employee-related expenses and incremental expense associated with our acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN.Income from operations increased by 8 percent and non-GAAP income from operations increased by 13 percent.Net income for the quarter was $229.7 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.56. Non-GAAP net income increased by 7% to $235.5 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased by 7% to $1.60, predominantly attributable to strong sales, partially offset by gross margin contraction.Operating cash flow for the quarter was $237.4 million, compared to net income in the current quarter of $229.7 million and non-GAAP net income of $235.5 million. During the quarter we paid $64.7 million in dividends.Other Business and Operational HighlightsAnnounced the acquisition of privately held Somnoware, a leader in digital sleep and respiratory care diagnostics software for sleep labs and physicians. Somnoware is upstream of and complementary to ResMed’s current post-testing AirView and Brightree offerings and will remain an open platform. The transaction’s financial terms are not material to ResMed’s consolidated financial results and were not disclosed.Supported or presented 34 clinical study abstracts at the annual American Thoracic Society (24) and SLEEP (10) conferences, demonstrating the breadth and depth of ResMed’s real-world evidence that showed treating OSA with PAP lowered all-cause mortality, adaptive-servo ventilation (ASV) improved quality of life in central sleep apnea (CSA), and PAP adherence lowered ER visits 24-36% at 1-year for OSA patients with heart failure, among others.Announced the promotion of Michael Rider to Global General Counsel and Secretary, effective July 1, 2023 and Dawn Haake to Chief Quality Officer, effective May 1, 2023. Mr. Rider was previously ResMed’s Senior Vice President, Deputy Global General Counsel and has been with ResMed for over 10 years.

ResMed uses non-GAAP information internally in planning, forecasting, and evaluating the results of operations in the current period and in comparing it to past periods.

To make snacking more sustainable, we strive to understand risks and their potential impact, focus on opportunities to lead where we matter most, and drive change where the world needs it most. We set goals in these areas - and add new ones over time - to enhance our ambition, impact and delivery at scale.-25% CO2e emissions reductions across our manufacturing39% In 2022, 39% of the electricity used in our manufacturing sites was renewable, compared to 32% in 2021.96% In 2022, 96% of our packaging was designed to be recyclable, on track for our goal of 100% by 2025.Resilient CommunitiesFor greater long-term positive impact on people and the planet, we focus on helping to create the resilient landscapes that are the bedrock of more sustainable snacking.We take a broad, interconnected view of resilience - one that includes and links our environmental goals to reduce carbon emissions, our leadership in sourcing ingredients more responsibly, and our commitment to social sustainability and human rights across our value chain. All the different elements can and must reinforce each other. Indeed, our ingredient sourcing programs are where most of the work of our carbon emissions reductions and social sustainability efforts live. So as part of our signature sourcing programs for our key ingredients such as cocoa and wheat, we work hard toward more resilient landscapes, communities, and robust human rights to provide lasting economic, environmental, and social benefits for the communities involved.Taking Climate ActionFor several years we have been on a path to reduce our carbon emissions, and in 2022, we continued to move forward in deepening our understanding of our carbon footprint and doing more to reduce it. We're taking an end-to-end approach - from field to shelf - to work towards our long-term net zero carbon emissions goal by focusing our efforts across key areas.Find out more on page 17.Reducing DeforestationWe are working to reduce deforestation in our supply chain. We know this is important in order to address global climate change and protect the local ecosystems that farmers need to grow sustainable raw materials.Our Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) helps to shape our priorities and goals. Insights indicated that deforestation within our supply chain represents the largest single contributor to our carbon footprint. Insights indicated that deforestation within our supply chain represents the single largest contributor to our carbon footprint. Data from our 2022 LCA show the contribution to Mondelēz International's total CO2e emissions from certain &amp;lsquo;forest-risk' commodities to be:Cocoa: 5,900,000 metric tonnesOils: 2,107,000 metric tonnesDairy: 6,427,000 metric tonnesBut we cannot win the fight against deforestation alone. Action by individual companies needs to be scaled up to cover whole sectors, landscapes and countries. So, we support and encourage the sector-wide approach the Consumer Goods Forum is pioneering for a #forestpositive future, one where suppliers adhere to consistent practices across their business models and land use is optimized across sectors with the support of producer governments. We are striving to make an impact at scale and transparency is at the core of our approach.Of the materials we source, cocoa and palm are the largest direct contributors to deforestation - we therefore advocate for systemic action that goes beyond our supply chain to drive change across the sector as a whole.With respect to cocoa, deforestation is just one of a complex set of interrelated environmental, economic and social problems faced in cocoa communities, and we understand that ending deforestation is complex. As we develop solutions to help tackle deforestation, we also remain vigilant to avoid potential unintended, harmful consequences such as lost livelihoods or abuses of human rights. We have our corporate program in place, Cocoa Life, which aims to holistically help address the root causes of the social, economic and environmental challenges that cocoa farming faces. As a result, we see near to no deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life farms in West Africa since 2018 (approximately 0.7% in Ghana &amp; 1.3% in Cote d'Ivoire).1Find out more on page 37.With respect to palm oil, 100% of palm oil sourced from our suppliers is aligned to the Palm Oil Action Plan (POAP) and 100% of our palm oil volume is Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certified. We publish our mill list on our corporate website.For our direct purchases of soy, where we have much less influence across the sector as a whole, we take a due diligence approach designed to achieve more sustainable sourcing in our supply, based on Consumer Goods Forum sourcing guidelines. For paper-based packaging we require the mills and printers that supply us to be Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified.In addition, we also track indirect land-use change emissions from dairy, including palm and soy, used in cattle feed. We buy the majority of our dairy ingredients from suppliers who buy from farmers who, in turn, make individual decisions about what to feed their cows. Despite these challenges, we are engaging our suppliers with the aim of supporting moves to help achieve deforestation-free supplies of cattle feed across the dairy sector.Find out more on page 30.Increasing Regenerative AgricultureTo improve agricultural resilience, we are helping to transform agricultural production into regenerative systems while reducing carbon. We are focusing on agroforestry landscapes, biodiversity and regenerative practices across our key ingredients including cocoa and wheat. This involves participation in sector-wide initiatives and multi-stakeholder coalitions.Find out more on page 30.Enhancing Social Sustainability and Respecting Human RightsWe strive to make sure that the rights of people in our value chain are respected and promoted and that the communities where we matter most are more resilient. To this end, we focus on key areas for greater impact, including addressing human rights risks in sourcing key commodities, and focusing on living wage and due diligence across own operations.Find out more on page 24.Read more in the Mondelēz 2022 Snacking Made Right Report View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Mondelēz International on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Mondelēz InternationalWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/mondelez-internationalEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Mondelēz InternationalStory continuesKey focus areas include, among others, helping to build resilient landscapes; taking action on climate change by reducing our carbon emissions; managing our water and waste as effectively as possible; making our packing light and right so it is better for both people and the planet; and sourcing our key ingredients more sustainably, so that we can keep making the snacks people love and help to promote social sustainability and prosperity in the communities our business touches.In short, more sustainable snacking is an immense and important task - one we are embracing holistically and wholeheartedly, to drive ever-greater long-term positive impact for people and the planet.Mondelēz International, Thursday, August 3, 2023, Press release pictureView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/772212/mondelz-2022-snacking-made-right-report-more-sustainable-snacking]"

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the biotech industry, head directly to 5 Best Biotech ETFs To Buy. According to Precedence Research, the worldwide biotechnology market was valued at approximately $1,224.31 billion in 2022. It is projected to reach a value of around $3,210.71 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.8% from 2023 to 2030. The biotechnology industry in countries like China, Japan, and India is witnessing growth propelled by positive government policies. These initiatives target the improvement of medical regulation, standardization of clinical studies, enhancement of reimbursement policies, and acceleration of product approval processes, all of which are expected to create profitable growth prospects for the biotechnology sectorDon't Miss: 12 Best Agriculture ETFs To BuyTo name a few hindrances plaguing the biotech industry, EY in a report observed that the 2022 revenue of public biotech companies declined by 1% compared to 2021 due to decreased demand for COVID-19 vaccines and antiviral treatments. 2023 is anticipated to see five patent expirations for well-established biologic products, resulting in a significant loss of revenue. Furthermore, over 20 products, accounting for nearly $200 billion in annual sales, are expected to lose patent protection by 2030. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) experienced a decline in approvals for new molecular entities and biologics license applications in 2022, which was attributed to staffing shortages. However, approvals returned to pre-pandemic levels in Q1 of 2023. Lastly, in 2022, all forms of biotech financing, including venture capital investment, debt financing, IPOs, and follow-on offerings, decreased substantially. According to Ashwin Singhania, Principal at EY-Parthenon: “Innovation is the engine that drives the biotech industry. While the approaching patent cliff is an unavoidable challenge, the pipeline continues to be very robust and the pace of innovation continues to accelerate. If executives can prioritize streamlining processes and the ongoing investment in organic innovation and inorganic growth, they will set themselves up for future success.”Story continuesAlso Read: 12 Best Energy ETFs: Top Oil, Gas and Renewable Energy FundsOn a positive note, RBC Capital Markets predicts that large-cap biotech companies with revenue resilience, less binary risk, and optimistic earnings guidance will maintain momentum in early 2023. While some larger companies have set themselves up for future growth and diversification, 2023 may be a flat earnings year for many large caps due to patent expirations and COVID-19 revenue declines. On the other hand, smaller-cap biotechs, though recovering from mid-year lows, have underperformed compared to larger and mid-cap biotechs and pharma. However, some high-quality, catalyst-driven smaller-cap companies are forecasted to perform well in 2023, driven by increasing regulatory permissiveness and potential M&amp;A activity. M&amp;A activity is also expected to rise as large biopharma companies sit on strong balance sheets, face patent cliffs, and experience better policy clarity. This potential uptick in M&amp;A could act as a catalyst for biotech stocks, driving growth and diversification among larger-cap companies facing challenges.Some of the best biotech stocks to invest in include Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Pfizer Inc.

It is computed considering historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line denotes the stock's ideal fair trading value.According to GuruFocus' valuation method, Vertex Pharmaceuticals' stock is fairly valued. The GF Value estimates the stock's fair value based on three key factors: historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance.

Bombardier said its backlog at the end of June was up just 0.7% from the end of March at $14.9 billion.On a per share basis, quarterly adjusted profit was 72 cents, compared with a loss of 48 cents a year earlier. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected a profit of 28 cents per share.

PWR reported mixed results for second-quarter 2023, wherein adjusted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues surpassed the same. Both metrics were up on a year-over-year basis.The company continues to experience high demand for its infrastructure solutions that support energy transition initiatives and increase reliability, safety and efficiency. Project activity associated with renewable generation has been going strong and is expected to continue throughout the year.Backed by solid first-half performance and a strengthening outlook, particularly for the Renewable Infrastructure Solutions segment, the company raised its full-year guidance for major metrics.However, shares of this leading national provider of specialty contracting services dipped 1.1% in the pre-market trading session on Aug 3.Detailed DiscussionQuanta’s adjusted earnings of $1.65 per share lagged the consensus estimate of $1.67 by 1.2% but increased 6.5% from the year-ago quarter’s $1.55. The upside was backed by strong demand for its services driven by the customers’ multi-year programs designed to modernize and harden utility infrastructure, increase renewable generation and transmission infrastructure and move toward a reduced-carbon economy.Quanta Services, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Quanta Services, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseQuanta Services, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Quanta Services, Inc. Quote Total revenues of $5.05 billion surpassed the consensus mark of $4.7 billion by 7.5% and increased 19.3% year over year.The operating margin for the quarter expanded 60 basis points (bps) to 5.5% from a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA of $472.1 million improved 11.8% from $422.1 million in the year-ago quarter. We projected operating margins to be 6.6% and adjusted EBITDA to be up 12.5%.The company reported a 12-month backlog of $15.64 billion and a total backlog of $27.2 billion at June 2023-end. This compares favorably with the December 2022-end’s 12-month backlog of $13.79 billion and the total backlog of $24.09 billion. The reported metrics were also up from the year-ago respective figures of $11.58 billion and $19.85 billion. Our model suggested a total backlog of $24.01 billion.Story continuesSegment DetailsIt reports results under three segments: Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions, Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions and Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions.Revenues from Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions totaled $2.42 billion, increasing 10% year over year. The upside was primarily backed by growth in spending by the utility customers on grid modernization and hardening as well as revenue growth from acquired businesses.The operating margin, however, contracted 50 bps to 10.1%. Lower equity in earnings from its integral unconsolidated affiliates and lower utilization of Canadian resources offset the improved margin growth associated with communications projects.Nonetheless, the segment’s 12-month backlog was $7.53 billion, up from $6.38 billion a year ago. The total backlog of $13.58 billion grew from $11.72 billion reported in the prior-year quarter.Revenues from Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions totaled $1.39 million, up 50% year over year. This was driven by increased renewable infrastructure project activity and its customers' ability to move forward with construction activities in the current favorable regulatory environment and through acquisitions.Operating margins contracted 85 bps to 8% from a year ago due to increased costs related to higher levels of resources required to support the expected increase in project activity in the second half of 2023 and into 2024.The segment’s 12-month backlog was $5.17 billion, up from $2.35 billion a year ago. The total backlog of $7.01 billion increased from $3 billion reported in the year-ago period.Within the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, revenues rose 12% from the prior-year quarter’s levels to $1.24 billion, backed by higher demand from gas utility and industrial customers as well as large pipeline projects in Canada.The operating margin of 8.6% was up 50 bps from 8.1% reported in the prior-year quarter. Segment’s 12-month backlog totaled $2.94 billion, up from $2.84 billion a year ago. The total backlog increased to $6.6 billion from $5.12 billion in the prior-year quarter.LiquidityAs of Jun 30, 2023, Quanta had cash and cash equivalents of $362 million, down from $428.5 million at 2022-end.

Earnings and net sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined year over year.That said, LP's strategy positions it well for long-term growth as the housing outlook continues to improve.Weyerhaeuser Company WY reported mixed second-quarter 2023 results, wherein its earnings handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but net sales missed the same marginally.

Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements.Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.Story continuesKevin A. LoboWelcome to Stryker's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments, followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter and some other updates. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&amp;A.In the second quarter, we delivered organic sales growth of 11.9% with double-digit growth in both MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Orthopaedics and Spine. This comprehensive performance demonstrates the diverse and attractive markets that we play in and our ability to drive growth through strong commercial execution.We are also pleased with the continued positive outcomes of our globalization efforts. Our International business demonstrated strong performance with double-digit growth, complementing our strong and fast-growing U.S. business. In addition, we continue to see traction with our pricing initiatives, again delivering positive pricing in the second quarter.During the quarter, we continued to realize improvements in component availability, although disruptions remain in parts of our business. Our teams have demonstrated good agility in addressing these situations, proactively mitigating much of their impact. We delivered quarterly adjusted EPS of $2.54 a share, reflecting 13% growth compared to the second quarter of 2022.This result was primarily driven from the strength of our sales but also marks the beginning of our margin recovery. We expect margins to continue to expand throughout the remainder of the year. Finally, with half the year behind us and our solid momentum, we have increased our expected full year organic sales growth to a range of 9.5% to 10.5% and increased our expected earnings per share to $10.25 to $10.45 per share.I will now turn the call over to Jason.Jason BeachThanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment as well as capital demand, including Mako, acquisitions and an update on product launches. Procedural volumes have largely recovered to pre-COVID levels in most countries. And while volumes are strong, patient backlog still remains, and we believe the elevated orthopedic procedural demand will continue well into 2024.While volumes have largely recovered, hospital staffing pressures and supply constraints continue in pockets around the globe. These challenges are resolving gradually as we expected and will continue to be a moderate tailwind as we move through the second half of 2023 and into 2024.Additionally, demand for our capital products remained healthy in the quarter as evidenced from the double-digit organic growth of our Medical, Instruments and Neuro Cranial divisions. Also, demand for Mako remains robust with strong U.S. and International performances, which is helping drive our continued growth in Hips and Knees.Next, capital order backlog remains elevated well above normal levels. Also, during the quarter, we executed a small tuck-in deal and also closed on the Cerus Endovascular acquisition. Furthermore, our product supercycle continues to drive positive momentum.In late Q2, we successfully completed a limited launch of our 1788 camera platform and are poised for full launch in Q3. We also received FDA clearance for Cranial Guidance, our newest application under our Q Guidance platform. This empowers surgeons to quickly plan a safe surgical approach using multiple imaging modalities and then navigate instruments with specific surgical procedures.Finally, we remain on track for the launch of our LIFEPAK 35 defibrillator outside of the U.S. in the fourth quarter of this year and in the U.S. in early 2024. These launches will continue to support growth over multiple years.With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn.Glenn S. BoehnleinThanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 11.9% a quarter. The second quarter's average selling days were in line with 2022. The impact from pricing in the quarter was favorable by 0.5%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our U.S. MedSurg and Neurotech businesses, all of which contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 0.7% unfavorable impact on sales. In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 12%. International organic sales growth was 11.4%, impacted by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets, particularly Australia, Canada, Europe and most of our emerging markets. Our adjusted EPS of $2.54 in the quarter was up 12.9% from 2022, driven by higher sales and operating margin expansion partially offset by a higher adjusted income tax rate and the impact of foreign currency exchange, which was unfavorable $0.03.Now I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had both constant currency and organic sales growth of 12.9%, which included 13.5% of U.S. organic growth and 10.9% of International organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 12.9%, led by strong double-digit growth in the Surgical Technology business. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by power tools, waste management, smoke evacuation and SurgiCount.Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 3.5% against a strong comparable. This included strong growth in its ProCare, sustainability and sports medicine businesses. The Endoscopy business completed its limited launch of the 1788 camera late in the second quarter. Consistent with prior camera launches and the related transition period between the legacy camera and the new camera, this also contributed to muted growth in Q2. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 27.2%, reflecting very strong performances in all 3 of its businesses, acute care, emergency care and Sage, and benefited from continued improvement in product supply during the quarter.Neurovascular had U.S. organic sales growth of 9%, reflecting a strong performance in our hemorrhagic business. Neuro Cranial had U.S. organic sales growth of 9.6%, which included double-digit growth in our bone mill, bipolar forceps and [Max-based] product lines. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 10.9%, reflecting double-digit growth in our Medical and Neuro Cranial businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Europe, Australia and Canada. Neurovascular's growth continues to be negatively impacted by VBP in China.Orthopaedics and Spine had both constant currency and organic sales growth of 10.6%, which included organic growth of 10% in the U.S. and 12.1% internationally. Our U.S. Knee business grew 10.6% organically, which reflects our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures. Our U.S. Hip business grew 8.8% organically, reflecting strong primary Hip growth fueled by our Insignia Hip Stem and continued procedural growth. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 14.3% organically, with strong performances across all businesses, led by very strong growth in upper extremities and foot and ankle.Our U.S. Spine business grew 5.2%, led by the performance of our enabling technology and Interventional Spine businesses, including the recently launched Q Guidance Navigation System. Our U.S. other ortho declined organically 1.6%, primarily driven by the impact of deal mix changes, specifically more rentals related to Mako installations in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 12.1% organically, including strong performances in Australia, Canada and most emerging markets.Now I will focus on operating highlights in the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 63.9% was favorable approximately 60 basis points from the second quarter of 2022 and 70 basis points sequentially compared to Q1 2023. This change was primarily driven by the slight easing of certain cost pressures, decreases in spot buy purchases, improved productivity and the benefit of price partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange.Adjusted R&amp;D spending was 6.4% of sales, which represents an 80 basis point decrease from the second quarter of 2022, due primarily to a higher compared to 2022 related to the ramping of costs for product launches. Our adjusted SG&amp;A was 33.1% of sales, which was 70 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2022 due to a disciplined ramp of spend and investment to support our growth. We expect our full year SG&amp;A as a percent of sales to be in line with 2019 levels as we continue to invest for growth.In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 24.3% of sales, which was approximately 60 basis points favorable to the second quarter of 2022. This performance is primarily driven by the aforementioned easing of certain cost pressures, primarily on gross margin.Adjusted other income and expense of $66 million for the quarter was slightly higher than 2022, driven by increased interest expense. The second quarter of 2023 had an adjusted effective tax rate of 15.2%, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For 2023, we reiterate our full year effective tax rate guidance to be in the range of 14% to 15%.Focusing on the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $1.5 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.9 billion. Approximately $100 million of the term loan debt was paid down in the quarter, reflecting year-to-date payments of $200 million and a remaining balance of $650 million.Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations is $1.1 billion. This performance reflects the results of net earnings and higher accounts receivable collections. Considering our year-to-date results, our strong backlog for capital equipment and continued positive procedural trends, we now expect full year 2023 organic sales growth to be in the range of 9.5% to 10.5%, with pricing to be slightly positive for the year. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales will be unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.3% and adjusted EPS will be unfavorably impacted from $0.05 to $0.10 per share for the full year, both of which are included in our guidance. Based on our performance in the first half of the year, together with our strong sales momentum, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $10.25 to $10.45 per share.And now I will open up the call for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.Robert Justin MarcusCongrats on a great quarter here. Two for me. First, great quarter. It looks like you're raising more than the beat on both the top and bottom line. Looks like you're taking a good amount of share still in Ortho across Hips, Knees and Extremities, Trauma.Just as we think about the balance of the year, you touched on some of them, but would love to get a sense of what gives you the confidence these elevated trends are going to continue. And any visibility on the margin side that gets you comfortable moving it up more than the beat?Kevin A. LoboRobbie, it's Kevin. I'll start off with sort of the confidence in the procedures. We've talked about this since the third quarter of last year, a good sense based on surgery backlogs, talking to physicians and seeing that there was pent-up demand through the pandemic. So we expected elevated procedures coming into the year. That has certainly played out. You've heard even similar comments from some of the providers in the space.And the surgery backlogs are long. They're longer -- probably a 2-month surgery backlog is more like 4 months. And so that gives us confidence that through the end of this year and into next year that we're going to continue to see elevated procedural growth. And we also see that in the demand for our small capital, which again, there's equipment that's used for ongoing procedures. And then I'll turn to Glenn for margins.Glenn S. BoehnleinRobbie, as we got through the quarter, as I mentioned, we really started to see some positive and easing of some of the cost pressures that we had felt in Q1 and certainly last year. I think we also are starting to feel some of the improvements in supply chain. That's not to say that everything's rosy. We are still feeling inflationary pressures in transportation, some of our commodities, labor, certain electronics.But I will say that spot buys in Q1, spot buys in Q2 have not been material, and we're getting near the amortization of the impact of spot buys from last year. So I feel like that gives me good confidence that I think we'll see continued improvement in our gross margin as we move into Q3 and Q4. And so we really will feel that gradual improvement, and we'll feel it all the way down through the op margin line.Robert Justin MarcusGreat. And maybe just a follow-up for me for both of you or however you want to take it. People are really happy so far with the year, but unfortunately, we're always focused on the future and looking out to next year already. You talked about, Kevin, these trends continuing. You have the supercycle in MedSurg. Just any kind of thoughts on how we should think about these elevated trends continuing? And thoughts -- I know you're laser-focused on getting back to your 2019 operating margin of 26.3%. How do we think about how far out that might be?Kevin A. LoboWell, I think Jason's comments in the opening says we do expect the procedural positive trends to continue well into next year. I don't have a crystal ball, exactly. Will that be 100 basis points or 200 basis points more elevated than it was back through the pandemic in last year? So -- but we expect that to be elevated.The supercycle of products is wildly exciting. Something like look at the Neptune S is off to a great start within Instruments. The 1788 is only going to start kind of the latter part of this quarter, so that's going to be a big impact next year. Got a new defibrillator coming, that's more next year. So there's -- these are launches -- ProCuity is multiple year. We have the stair chair, the Xpedition. Amazing product that Medical launched. Brand new, and it's a new category altogether that launched Q1 of this year. That will continue into next year.So a lot of continuation of really strong growth across our businesses. So you should expect we're going to continue to be a high-growth company going into next year. Sorry, let me finish. I forgot. It was a long question. So yes, we are absolutely committed to returning to pre-COVID margins and then growing our margins thereafter. This quarter marked a really important step, a very big first step in that evolution.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.Lawrence H. BiegelsenI'll echo Robbie's congratulations on a very impressive quarter here. So Kevin, I wanted to start on MedSurg, the new products. Just talk about how the new camera in Endoscopy might have impacted Q2 and what you expect the impact to be from that in '23 and '24. And Medical growing 27% organically after Vocera anniversaried. What drove that? And how did Vocera do in the second quarter? And what's the outlook? And I had one follow-up.Kevin A. LoboOkay. You got a few in there already, and you got a follow-up. But okay. That's fine. Listen, we're really excited about the performance of our MedSurg business. Continues to be really a great segment of our company. What I'd tell you on the endo side is the camera had really no impact. It was a limited launch, really just making sure that the product is performing as we thought. And the test cases have gone extremely well. And really, the full launch hasn't started. That will start in the back half of the Q3.So you start to see some impact in Q3, that will accelerate in Q4, and it will even accelerate more next year as you know. You've seen these launches in the past. So it really picks up year 1, sometimes even year 2 would be even higher than year 1. So we're going to see a lot of impact next year. There'll be some impact in Q3, but in Q4, really it will start to ramp. So it's really no impact in Q3 on Endoscopy.And that's why Endoscopy is a little bit softer, had a big comp from last year, too, but at the end of these camera launches, you do see it start to slow down and then it really picks up with the new product. Medical had an absolutely stellar quarter, another 25-plus percent growth, and we had that in the fourth quarter, if you recall, as well. And Medical has really, over the past 6 years, become a large, consistent high-growth division. It does move around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter, but overall, if you look at a rolling 4 quarters, rolling 8 quarters, this is a real high-growth business.Now I think it's probably one of the most misunderstood businesses, honestly, or, I would say, underestimated business in our portfolio. You've got the integration of Sage, Physio-Control, Vocera, which you referenced. But you've got new launches. Power-PRO 2 is a new ambulance cost at the beginning of last year. ProCuity bed frame is still gaining steam. Sage has PrimoFit. You have the Xpedition stair chair that I mentioned.And then there's also a lot more awareness on safety. So our AED portfolio, there's a lot more awareness. So I would say new demand for AEDs based on all the safety, the LUCAS automatic chest compression product, and really a fantastic management team in Medical. So will I expect 25% again next quarter? Probably not. But I do expect that Medical will continue to be a very high-growth business for a long time to come. And then specifically related to Vocera, both sales and orders ramped in the quarter as we expected. So you remember, we sort of talked to you about Q3, Q4 and Q1 of this year kind of being flat after we sort of went through the integration and we said it's going to pick up meaningfully. Both picked up meaningfully in Q2, both sales as well as orders. And so they are also a contributor. But really strength across the entire portfolio.Lawrence H. BiegelsenAnd just I'll keep my follow-up really brief. Glenn, the comps are very different in Q3 and Q4. Should we be thinking about stronger growth in Q3 relative to Q4? Just the cadence for the rest of the year.Glenn S. BoehnleinYes. I mean a couple of things. Q3 seasonally is usually not a super strong quarter, but I think if you focus on Q4 and you look at the comp that we're up against, that probably plays into how much we're going to grow against that comp. So big number last year. It was $5.2 billion in the quarter, which is a big number. So I think what you'll see is you'll see slightly higher growth in Q3, and then that will come down a little bit just because of the comp. But I think we'll end the year nicely. Well within our guidance.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.Philip ChickeringVery nice quarter. A follow-up on the Medical. Can you talk about the CapEx environment? How much has changed in the last sort of 90 days or so, and [possible are] increasing CapEx as the revenues and costs are looking pretty good for hospitals?And on the backlog, did you guys reduce the backlog in the quarter? And was that a bolus for 2Q and should that be sort of normalizing in the back half of the year? And then also on microchips, is that -- should we view that getting better as a gross margin improvement from lower costs or increasing revenues as you would reduce that backlog?Jason BeachIt's Jason. I'll start here and then maybe some pile on. But as we think about the capital environment, we continue to see great strength from a capital environment standpoint. And even as you think about the backlog in our business, I think your question was, was there a bolus. But if you look at our backlog, it continues to be at very high levels, higher than what we came into the year with. So still strength there on the capital side.Philip ChickeringOkay. And then one more on gross margin. It sounds like a lot of tailwinds in 2Q were pretty much permanent in nature, and you said that the gross margins improved in the back half of the year. Can you refresh us on how many months of inventory you guys have on the balance sheet? And when those -- these deflation pressures we're seeing should start transferring to the P&amp;L. Just wondering if that's sort of the key driver of the gross margin improvement in the third and fourth quarter simply by duration by waiting for that to transfer.Glenn S. BoehnleinYes. I think the big thing that really sits in inventory and worked its way through sort of in the first quarter and the second quarter was the impact of those spot buys. And generally, inventory turns, depending on the product, anywhere from 6 to 9 months. So yes, we will generally see the impact of spot buys reduced for the rest of this year.Keep in mind that we still have this sort of inflationary headwind that we will be working against in Q3 and Q4. But just the mere fact that I feel like we're getting to the end of the impact of spot buys gives me confidence that we should see gradual gross margin improvement in the rest of this year.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.Vijay Muniyappa KumarKevin, the guidance is pretty impressive, 10% organic. Are comps something that we should worry about from a fiscal '24 perspective? I know you mentioned certain product tailwinds. Just help us contextualize that 10%. And given that some of these procedure trends, it looks like it could sustain into '24.Kevin A. LoboYes. Thanks, Vijay. Remember, we grew 9.7% organically last year. So we had a pretty good year last year as well, and we're growing on top of that. Again, this innovation cycle we have is tremendous. The procedure demands are strong. We're -- as you see, we're growing very fast. Even though the market's elevated, we're growing above market in virtually every one of our businesses. So that gives us confidence that we're going to continue to be able to grow at the high end of med tech.And for this year, we've already -- half the year is already in the bag. And yes, the Q4 last year was abnormally fast, growing over 13%. So we -- in our guidance, we do reflect a little bit of a slowdown in the growth rate just related to those comps. But we do expect, based on backlog of surgery demand, aging population, more people playing pickleball, you name it, right, activity, causing injuries. So this will continue to be a tailwind.And we think through much of next year, that's our current visibility. I mean obviously, that could change, but that's how we see it. And we kind of called this, if you recall. Q3 of last year, we sort of called that this is what we were going to see. It's actually materializing, frankly, a little better than we expected in terms of the flow-through in procedures and hospital staffing. They're dealing with it much better than we expected. There are still flare-ups here and there, but it's certainly gotten better. Hospitals are better equipped and patients are anxious to get their procedures done.Vijay Muniyappa KumarThat's helpful, Kevin. Glenn, maybe one for you. It looks like we're on track -- actually we're well north of 50 basis points of margin expansion in fiscal '23. Is this something that's sustainable? When you look at the operating model, assuming there's nothing crazy on the inflation side for next year, I'm curious how we should be thinking about leverage.Glenn S. BoehnleinYes. We -- you're going to force me to divulge all the things we want to tell you in our investor meeting. But I would say our old mantra of expanding 30 to 50 basis points every year was absolutely doable, and it's absolutely something that we are planning on getting back to. We're working through some of these higher costs through the P&amp;L. There's this ongoing inflation that we will solve for. But I don't think that as we look forward over the longer term -- margin expansion is something that I think you'll continue to see out of us. I don't want to pinpoint a number just yet, but yes, it's something we'll continue to have.Kevin A. LoboYes. The one thing I would add. So Glenn wasn't necessarily referring to '24 when he said 30 to 50. We're on a ramp and on a major focus to get back to that 26.3%, and then thereafter kind of get into a normal rhythm. So we'll give you more clarity around that at the Analyst Day in November.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler.Matthew Oliver O'BrienI really don't want to make too much out of 1 quarter here, but when I look at the 2-year stacked growth rate for you guys versus your biggest competitor in Hips and Knees, you had been outperforming them massively in the last several quarters. This quarter, it really tightened up the delta between you 2, specifically in Knees.So I'm just wondering if there's anything you're seeing competitively, maybe in cementless or on the robotics side, that you should call out or that we should think about as you go forward, just in terms of being able to significantly outperform the market in Hips and Knees over the next year or so.Kevin A. LoboYes. Look, I'm actually pretty happy with double-digit growth in our Knee business. And look at OUS. We're really starting to ramp the growth, OUS. Mako's just getting going. It's really getting started. So that massive outperformance you saw before was on the backs of Mako and cementless. And we're probably going to see some of that outside the United States. And the U.S. performance is very strong. One quarter, I'm not going to get overly excited. We're still the fastest growing Hip and Knee company.And you remember from the past, you used to be -- you grew well in one, you didn't grow well in the other, and we covered both, Hips and Knees. It wasn't Hips or Knees. Hips and Knees in Q2. So no, we're not seeing anything that's really different. We focus on our own execution with our market-leading robotics and our strong portfolio, continue the rollout in Insignia, which has been an absolute home run. We're going to continue to perform very well.Matthew Oliver O'BrienAppreciate that, Kevin. And then on the pricing side, I know it's now flipped from kind of a headwind this year to a tailwind, but I'm assuming we're working through some of those benefits. So is pricing going to be another tailwind or positive for Stryker into '24 and even '25 as well as you've got these long-term contracts?Glenn S. BoehnleinYes. I think I'll make some couple of comments around that without maybe providing exact guidance on 2024. But -- if we look at the initiative that we executed this year, we had a very targeted program that looked kind of product by product. And in general, what we're seeing in MS&amp;T is generally gaining positive price, and I would say Ortho is less negative and has much larger, longer-term contract negotiations.Keep in mind too that our price comparison that we report on includes sort of same product sales compared to prior year. So if you think about increases that we gain on prices, say, on next-gen products that we're going to launch, that's not necessarily included in the number we say for price.But I would tell you that we generally see meaningful price increases on these next-gen products, especially when we bring newer technology to the market or a feature set that currently isn't provided. So I do think that we'll continue to see price as a tailwind. It's a muscle that we've certainly grown this year, and I think it's going to be part of our game plan for sure.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.Ryan Benjamin ZimmermanCongrats on a really nice quarter, guys. I wanted to ask, Kevin, a little bit about the Cerus deal and Neurovascular. It was slower before, but 9% organic growth in the U.S. is really nice to see, especially in hemorrhagic. When we look at what Cerus has done in the U.K., it's been pretty impressive. And so I'm curious kind of what your expectations are for the contribution in the U.S. and when we start to really see that in numbers, especially if you're doing 9% U.S. organic growth in Neurovascular.Kevin A. LoboYes. So the first thing I'd say is that Cerus has not yet approved in the United States. So that 9% growth had no benefit from Cerus, right? So I think you know that. I just want to make that clear to everybody that the trials are ongoing right now and we look forward to that approval in the United States. We've launched 2 new products. We had a Tetra small coil as well as a 46 catheter -- 46 size catheter, Vecta catheter. So 2 new products that helps in terms of driving the hemorrhagic growth.And the U.S. has been a little bit of a challenge for us more if you look back at the last few quarters, and really pleased to see that step up in this quarter, and we're very excited. When we closed the deal, obviously, it was during the quarter. It hasn't had -- it didn't have a big impact at all, but had a lot of excitement at the product we know performs extremely well based on what's happening OUS, and we can't wait for the approval. It's definitely going to be a shot in the arm when it does happen in the United States.Ryan Benjamin ZimmermanYes. No question. We saw that at SNIS this week. I wanted to ask a follow-up on robotics. We didn't hear you say much on your shoulder and spine programs. And just given that there is some other commentary out there from competitors about kind of shoulders and spine, what's your latest thinking about potential timing, launch cycles and so forth on Mako shoulder and/or spine.Kevin A. LoboYes. Great. Nothing new to report. We're kind of on schedule with what we had said before. Spine in the back half of next year and shoulder towards the end of next year. And frankly, we're not really concerned about competitive activity in this space. We already know Globus and Medtronic have robots in spine. We are really excited about our overall enabling technology starting with Q Guidance. We have an additional product that we'll be launching, and Mako Spine. So -- by the end of next year, we'll have a really compelling suite of enabling technology tools for spine, which we're really excited about.If someone else is first in shoulder, it doesn't concern me in the least. We have Blueprint already. We already have a very powerful enabling tech platform for shoulder, whether it's patient-matched ID, whether it's using HoloLens to do the procedure with virtual reality, whether it's the Blueprint technology, which is amazing. And we're going to use that amazing Blueprint technology to feed Mako, and that will just be icing on the cake on an upper extremity business that is cooking on gas right now with amazing growth quarter after quarter after quarter.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Shagun Singh with RBC.Shagun Singh ChadhaI was just wondering if you could refresh us on your capital allocation priorities and M&amp;A just in terms of deal size valuation and areas of interest? And then on the product side, if you could just touch on trauma and what's driving the strong growth there and the durability?Kevin A. LoboYes, sure. So as we've said in the past, we -- our first focus on capital allocation right now is paying down debt, given the debt that we built up on Wright Medical as well as Vocera. That has not stopped us from doing little deals. We did one small deal within Instruments, and then we closed on Cerus. So we're still looking at tuck-ins primarily this year. But the deal teams are all very active.They're having discussions. They're building their lists and they're all really having nice pipelines. And so as our cash position gets strong, again, we'll be back on offense. That will be the first use of our cash. I mean we've had a really terrific track record of M&amp;A, and we can't wait to be able to get back on offense with M&amp;A. But first priority is certainly paying down debt at the moment, and we're doing that. So what's the second part?Jason BeachTrauma.Kevin A. LoboYes. So trauma, I'll tell you this. Wright Medical acquisition has been spectacular. The upper extremities business is growing very strong double-digit growth every quarter. Foot and Ankle really starting to pick up. So we're really excited about the performance. This quarter was terrific, in Foot and Ankle with strong double-digit growth.And then core trauma has actually been a big beneficiary of Wright Medical. So in the past, our core trauma business was really diluted in its focus. It was focusing on Foot and Ankle, focusing more on extremities because they're faster growing, and we were sort of not paying as much attention to core trauma. We have a great leadership team on core trauma with now dedicated focused R&amp;D resources. And obviously, they launched Gamma4. We had the T2 Alpha product launch. We're going to have PeriPRO products launch soon. Excited about some other innovations we plan to show at OTA later in the fall.So really refreshing the portfolio, great focus on core trauma and they had a really excellent quarter as well. So all 3 business units performed very well in the quarter. And again, the Wright Medical deal, it's not just benefiting our extremities business, it's actually providing more focus on core trauma, which is fueling terrific growth in core trauma. So trauma, we expect to continue to be a very high-growth business for a long time to come.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen.Eric Evan AndersonThis is Eric on for Josh. I was curious to hear your thoughts around smart implants. One of your competitors is moving closer to a full launch of a smart implant technology, and I was just curious to hear your updated thoughts there. And if there are any updates to share from your work around OrthoSensor, that would be great to hear as well.Kevin A. LoboYes. Listen, I think smart implants is interesting. We obviously have motion sense, which is a wearable on the outside to measure basically similar dynamics that are going to be measured from the smart implant. So I think range of motion, all these factors, it's interesting. We're not quite sure yet what to do with that data, how compelling that will be, will that affect patient selection, will it affect approaches to procedure?So I would call it something that is more investigational and more of a learning that we're going to have. And -- but I do think it's something that could be important in the future. So not discounting it. I don't have anything more to share on OrthoSensor other than we are -- we have launched MotionSense, which is the wearable which attaches to both the femur as well as tibia to track mobility and a range of other metrics.And we're going to learn a lot. We will, and so others in the industry, about what is it that really matters, that you're measuring in the post-surgery period. And really how does that affect the patient care, patient -- maybe patient selection, maybe what implants they should be using, is there a feedback loop that's meaningful? We don't know. We don't have answers. We have a lot of questions, and it's going to give us new data that we can then learn from. So that's how I characterize it at the moment.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Matt Miksic with Barclays.Matthew Stephan MiksicI wanted to ask a question on Mako. One of the comments that you made, and I apologize if this came up already. I've been hopping back and forth here, like a lot of folks tonight, in different calls. But you mentioned an increase in deal mix -- I guess, an increase in rental deal mix affecting the dollar revenues that came in from Mako in other this quarter. And that's something we've heard from other folks as well as you're, I'm sure, aware, in terms of robots, more sort of hospitals taking a flexible option to leasing or pay-as-you-go arrangements for robots.First, I'm wondering how tightly correlated that's with sort of growth in the ASC. And the second, in the past, Kevin, I think you talked about like early on, well, some hospitals are capital-rich, some hospitals are operating [in commercial], have endowments or whatever. There's different -- hospitals have a different preference on how they want to pay for robots.That was sort of how we used to think about this. I'm curious whether you're seeing sort of hybridization of that. In other words, [regarding on] the Mako, you could pay for it, but let's scale into it with a lease arrangement or something. I'm wondering if you're seeing that kind of shift in the market? And I have one follow-up, if I could.Kevin A. LoboYes, sure. Thanks. So what I would tell you is the ASC's growth is obviously increasing in the ASCs with Mako, and virtually all of the ASC deals are financed because physician ownership is part of the ASC scenario. They don't have the capital budgets the hospitals do. So yes, as ASC penetration increases, more financing, rental-type deals are automatically going to happen because they're virtually all financed, the ASC.Your question around the hospital dynamic, I think it's just if you have competitive systems that are not sort of being charged for, then the hospital says, well, maybe I don't need to spend the capital even if I have the capital, and maybe I -- let me talk to you about what you do. And so we offer them the full suite. And yes, some are opting to go for the financing route that maybe in the past would have purchased.But we have a healthy order book, and we're not really agnostic to whether they want to buy cash or where they want to finance it. It really doesn't matter to us because we get the value from that. Whether we get the value on cash on day 1 or get the cash over time doesn't really concern us, and it certainly has been fuel for our strong implant growth.Matthew Stephan MiksicThat's great. And just quickly on -- you mentioned Endoscopy (inaudible) in the camera and not really having an effect yet, but quite differentiated and quite different this cycle with the sort of opportunity to test surgical margins around tumors and things that really represent kind of a new phase of sort of camera and imaging functionality.Any sense -- I know it's early, but of what that does to the shape of this product cycle versus what we've experienced in the past? I mean fluorescence imaging was pretty big for you in the last launch. This sort of takes that up a notch. Any color you can provide in terms of what your expectations are, the early interest, et cetera, on the camera side?Kevin A. LoboYes. Thanks. Look, it's a little early still for me to get too ahead of myself, but the fluorescent imaging was a big deal, right? In -- first in 1588 and then in 1688, when you had the overlay from fluorescence where you didn't have to toggle between black and white and fluorescence. That was pretty meaningful. So those are pretty big steps.But you're right, this -- with the tumor margin ability, the ability to use new dyes beyond ICG, wildly exciting to get into lung, to get into bladder. This is really, really exciting with new pharmacological agents. It's also a camera that is extremely good in neuro and sports, where historically, we weren't as strong. We had -- it was fabulous for general surgery, but not quite as good.This camera addresses those issues. So I'm really excited about it. But it's a little early, that the test cases have gone very well. I wouldn't expect this to be any less performing than our prior launches. Potentially could be even more. The feedback so far is pretty exciting in. Yes, is -- we have some really good features in this one.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank.Joanne Karen WuenschI apologize, there's a lot going on tonight. But your operating margins were really impressive, and I'm curious how we should think about those for the back half of the year. And if you can give a full year guide on it, or even how we should think about this into next year, if you're willing to wade that far.Glenn S. BoehnleinYes, Joanne, we really -- if you think about operating margins, especially our performance in Q2, we saw a really sort of good improvement, honestly, in gross margin just in terms of some easing of some of the cost pressures as I've mentioned before. Spot buys are not material. They weren't material in Q1, and they're not material in Q2. I think the other thing, too, that we're feeling is just that now that we have more evening of supply, we're also back to sort of better productivity gains.And so all of those things give us good confidence that we should see gross margins improve in the back half of this year. And they'll gradually improve because we're still feeling some of this inflation, but that kind of gives us the confidence. And obviously, some of that will roll into next year. as you think about our performance for next year. But we -- at this point, we're not going to guide on that other than to say that we do think we'll see some gradual improvement for the rest of this year.Joanne Karen WuenschMaybe this is an analyst question at the meeting or the next time you gather us all together for an update, but how do you think about, in a more normalized post-pandemic environment, sort of operating margin expansion on a regular go-forward, maybe even year-over-year basis?Kevin A. LoboYes, Joanne, earlier in the call, I think this question was asked, I'll just repeat that we are laser-focused on, I would say, trying to sprint back to the 26.3% that we had in 2019. And so we're going to try to move margins on a more ambitious way to get back to that. And then once we get back to that kind of level, I think you're going to see us wanting to expand margins in a kind of a more consistent way.I don't know the exact number. Something like 50 bps. We'll get more specific as time passes, but it would be more like an annual, more moderate, nice progression year after year after year, especially with this kind of high growth that we're experiencing organically. You're going to expect to see more normalized margin expansion, but in the meantime, we're looking to move at a faster clip given the falloff that we've had since '19, and try to restore those margins.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Rick Wise with Stifel.Frederick Allen WiseKevin, I was hoping you would just give us a little more color and perspective on really your very solid International performance. Double digits, obviously, almost as strong as the U.S. performance but a little slower than the first quarter's pace. You highlighted the strong emerging markets.How -- I'm just going to ask one question with a couple of parts. How sustainable is this? You talked about some of your key initiatives. And just maybe just your perspectives on sustainability. What's the drivers here? And maybe where we are in terms of procedure volume recovery back to normal in Europe just in a larger picture sense? Great to see the excellent quarter.Kevin A. LoboYes. Thank you. Look, International has -- it took us a while, but the last 5 years, International growth has exceeded the U.S. growth. Now obviously, the U.S. growth this quarter was pretty spectacular. But we're absolutely a believer and continue to have very good International growth in the years ahead, frankly, making up for lost time because our market shares are still below what we have in the U.S. in most of the International markets. And so we have significant upside in front of us.Procedure volumes are pretty much back to normal everywhere. They're back to normal in Europe. They're back to normal in Australia. They're back to normal pretty much in Japan. So the market that hurt us, frankly, in the quarter was China. So that China continues to be a drag because of VBP both in Neurovascular having an impact, also impacting our Spine business. So China continues to be a bit of a drag. But in spite of that, we had really terrific growth in International.And I'd say that Mako is really starting to pick up steam in Asia Pacific. So we already have a pretty good presence in Europe. But in Asia Pacific, Japan, India, China, it's really starting to pick up. And I think that's a great leading indicator that will produce really terrific growth both in Hips and Knees for many quarters to come as that momentum continues. And then as well, the camera launches of 1788, that's also really exciting for the International market.So we're going to continue the progress. Even Europe had another strong quarter. That's just kind of expected now. It's steady and strong growth every quarter, and we're still not where we'd like to be in Europe. So this is just one of those things that takes time. But if you think about something like cameras, where when we started the Transatlantic model, we were number 5 or 6, and we expect to take over number 1 sometime this year.Our power tools share was in the low 30s, and it's crossed 50%, but it's still not where it is in the United States. It's not where it is in Australia. So International should be something that continues in a very steady way just as it has the last 5 years, it's been kind of very consistent. And in emerging markets, that's the area we have the most opportunity, where we're still very, very small. Growing nicely, but off a small base.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Travis Steed with Bank of America.Travis Lee SteedI'll ask most of mine upfront. Some of the payers and providers have talked about a slower July. I'm just curious if you could kind of frame some of the summer seasonality, if you're seeing more normal seasonality or how it kind of compares given some of those payer comments. And then a margin question for you, Glenn. Just curious if we should view the second half operating margin this year as kind of a new jumping off point since this is the more normalized cost environment in the second half.Kevin A. LoboListen, sorry, your sound quality -- it was a little hard hearing you. I think you're asking about July, if we saw something strange seasonality in July. And look -- we don't normally comment on 1 month. And I would tell you -- you saw our raised guidance. Like we're expecting a pretty good second half of the year, and I don't really want to get into one month. And the -- sometimes you do have certain dynamics that happen, but there's nothing really important that I want to call out for the month of July. And then I think the second part was margin.Jason BeachYes. Travis, can you repeat that in terms of the operating margin question?Travis Lee SteedYes, sorry. I'm just curious if the second half of this year is kind of the new jumping off point for margins going forward just given that this is the more normalized cost environment in the second half.Glenn S. BoehnleinYes. No, I would say a couple of things. First of all, Q4 is always seasonally higher. It's our highest op margin performing quarter. So I wouldn't necessarily say that, that should be the jumping off. I think if you back up from where our guidance is, you could sort of figure out kind of where we're angling to end the year at, and that would be the good jumping off point.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Danielle Antalffy with UBS.Simon Gabriel NeginThis is Simon Negin on for Danielle. Congrats on the strong quarter. Can you talk about some of the puts and takes to the underlying ortho market growth when you look at factors such as pricing, innovation and potential trend towards treating both much younger and older -- much older patients? And I have one follow-up.Kevin A. LoboYes. Look, the trends aren't different than what we've seen in the past. It's surgery demand, backlogs of surgeons that people -- frankly, the older patients who've been -- now really want to get procedures done. There are more active people out there, as I kind of referenced earlier, who want to get their procedures done. So innovation wins the day, right? So the robotics continues to be a real -- terrific for us, and we continue to increase utilization.Percent of Mako procedures done continues to rise. Percent of cementless continues to rise. Percent of hips being done on Mako continues to rise. So that's not new. Those are a continuation of prior trends. And so there isn't some kind of new dynamic. It's just the pent-up demand of patients that we kept waiting for. They're coming and they're going to continue to come for some period of time. And the aging population is getting people every day, some 10,000 turning 65. And so there is demographics that are on our side. There is the hangover from COVID that's on our side.And for Stryker, we have a portfolio that we're really excited about. And addressing the direct anterior with our Insignia stem was critically important, and we've done that, and we're seeing fantastic uptake of that hip stem, which is driving terrific growth in Hips. So that's kind of new for us as to -- if you look in the last year, our Hip growth has really picked up, and that was really because of the product that we launched really addressing an important and growing segment of the procedures in hips.Simon Gabriel NeginAnd just one follow-up, really off of what you were just talking about. Looking at the competitive position in large joints in the United States, how do you expect to continue driving share gains? And where do you see yourself, given continued innovation?Kevin A. LoboLook, we really like our chances. The huge demand for Mako hasn't stopped. We know we have the best system on the market, which we're really excited about. We've filled our gap with Insignia on the hip side. We have an awesome 3D-printed hip cup with Trident II. We have the cementless offering, which, of course, we're way ahead. A huge head start on cementless. Terrific publications coming out with excellent 5-year data on cementless, which will give surgeons even more confidence in that in the future.And so -- and there's other things the team are looking at. We have some really exciting products, a hinge product that we're going to come out with later this year to shore up revision. And that's pretty exciting. We have plans to have revision on Mako as well in the not-too-distant future. So we're not going to sort of sit tight on just everything we've already done. There are incremental additions. We just not so long ago launched that 2.0 software for Mako to improve the user experience, improve the training of residents. And so we think we have a winning hand, and we're going to continue to play that hand.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Mike Matson with Needham &amp; Company.Michael Stephen MatsonI want to ask one about the Q Guidance System in spine. It sounds like it's doing well. I'm just wondering if you could maybe give us sort of an overview of it. I know you've had navigation systems in spine before. Is this something kind of different? Or is it more just the latest version? And then how does it kind of fit in when you do bring Mako into Spine?Kevin A. LoboYes. What I'd tell you is this has the fastest camera on the market. Homegrown. We didn't use a third party to do this camera. It is lightning quick. And that camera will eventually be ported to the Mako as well so that Mako will have that same terrific camera. It really -- the user experience is terrific in terms of being able to see and be able to do your procedure. So the feedback we've gotten is outstanding.So we've always been good at navigation, but this is sort of really putting our best foot forward. And this user experience that you're going to have with Q will transfer to the Mako spine, and that we're really excited about. So this is -- this, even before Mako, is already having an impact. And we think once Mako's launched, it will really fill this important need in the market for us to have a robotic application.We also have another product in enabling technology coming out of our Instruments division that's going to be used by the Spine group. A little early for me to give you details on what that is, but at the appropriate time, we'll tell you about that. So that, combined with Mako, is going to give us very compelling enabling technology platform for Spine.Michael Stephen MatsonOkay. Got it. And then just given the guidance, I assume this is an early kind of material issue, but I thought I'd ask about it anyway because we've heard about it from some other companies. But can you just comment on any Russian exposure you have and whether or not there's -- the latest sanctions are having any sort of impact on your business?Kevin A. LoboYes. Obviously, we're abiding by all the sanctions, as you would expect, and working in lockstep with the industry on an industry-wide response to what should be humanitarian products and should be -- should they go through the approval process. That's obviously very lengthy. It did have a negative impact, but honestly, our Russia business is so small that it's kind of meaningless in the overall picture of Stryker. But yes, we are abiding by the sanctions. Yes, it did have a negative impact, but it was really -- it's not a material business for Stryker.OperatorOur last question will come from Richard Newitter with Truist Securities.Richard Samuel NewitterCongrats on the quarter. Just -- Kevin, I think a few months back in the first quarter, you were asked a question at an investor conference about what areas could be of interest to you. There's so much going right across your existing businesses. So obviously, M&amp;A, though, is still top of mind. So I'm just curious kind of where are the holes and where do you think the investment could be most incremental for you?Kevin A. LoboLook, it's a good question. I think I've talked about the adjacencies that we're interested in. First and foremost, there's a lot of tuck-in demand. Each of our businesses are building their wish lists and sort of evaluating different targets, and I think that's job one, is looking at those near-term targets that tuck-in. Those create tremendous financial returns for Stryker. They don't always move the needle for the overall growth, but they're really terrific financial deals for us to do.And when you feed our existing sales force to Stryker, we know how to sell, and we're able to really do that very, very well. I would tell you, in the adjacency space, no change to the adjacencies that we're interested in. I think I've mentioned them before. What I would tell you is neuromodulation's one I've talked about in the past. And within neuromodulation, obviously, there's a lot of different parts to that. There's spinal cord stimulation, there's deep brain stimulation, there's peripheral nerve stimulation. There's even stimulation, as you know, in sleep apnea. And I do believe electrical treatment is going to be a big part of the future.We've -- over time, we've been a little hot/cold on spinal cord stimulation. I would tell you right now, we're probably a little bit more cold on it. It's just kind of a challenging market and so that's really the only thing maybe I haven't said in the past. But otherwise, every other adjacency that I talked about in Q1 are still very much on our radar screen. And as our cash frees up, probably more into next year, if the tuck-ins aren't of a significant size and we have cash starting to build up and our debt positioned better, hopefully, we'll be able to make a move in one of those adjacencies that I've talked about in the past.Richard Samuel NewitterAnd then maybe just a follow-up on Spine. It's one of the few businesses that is not back in the high single digits, or better yet, but you obviously have pretty good line of sight to seemingly transformative technologies and product rollouts with Mako, but that's 1 year, 1.5 years away. So I guess, do we just kind of think of Spine as a grind from here higher, or stabilization and then look out when '25 comes around?Kevin A. LoboYes. I think the word stabilization, I probably prefer that than grind, but yes. It's probably both, right? So spine is a tough market, no question about it. But already with Q Guidance, we're feeling good about that. We've bolstered our expandable portfolio a bit. We still have a couple of gaps that we're looking at obviously we would like to fill. But the enabling tech is really what gets us excited. And so I think the robotic platform will put us on a par at least with the competitors, and then this other secret launch I talked about from -- coming out of instruments, which we've shown some surgeons, kind of will put us ahead of the game on enabling technology.But yes, we have to wait. Unfortunately, it's not ready yet. It's coming. The instrument launch will probably come in before the Mako, and that will be able to be used with the Q Guidance. It will be compatible with Q. So that's where -- you'll hear about that probably earlier than you'll hear about Mako, but yes, I wouldn't assume -- we're going to try to kind of keep in line with market growth, which is kind of what we're doing right now, hold our own until we get to that period of time, and then we could start to grow more like a typical business of Stryker.OperatorThank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Kevin Lobo for closing remarks.Kevin A. LoboThank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our Q3 results with you in early November.OperatorThis does conclude today's Stryker second quarter earnings call. We thank you for your participation.

The six months 2023 had one more selling day than 2022. Beginning in the first quarter 2023 we consolidated Other MedSurg and Neurotechnology into Endoscopy as Other MedSurg and Neurotechnology (primarily Sustainability Solutions) has been fully integrated into our Endoscopy business. Endoscopy includes sales related to Other of $87 and $77 for the three months 2023 and 2022 and $168 and $146 for the six months 2023 and 2022. We have reflected these changes in all historical periods presented.SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESWe supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including: percentage sales growth in constant currency; percentage organic sales growth; adjusted gross profit; adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted research, development and engineering expenses; adjusted operating income; adjusted other income (expense), net; adjusted income taxes; adjusted effective income tax rate; adjusted net earnings; and adjusted net earnings per diluted share (Diluted EPS). We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures.To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate. To measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures, which affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. The income tax effect of each adjustment was determined based on the tax effect of the jurisdiction in which the related pre-tax adjustment was recorded.Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, research, development and engineering expenses, operating income, other income (expense), net, income taxes, effective income tax rate, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures below, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of non-GAAP net earnings per diluted share are the same as those used in the calculation of reported net earnings per diluted share for the respective period.STRYKER CORPORATIONFor the Three and Six Months June 30(Unaudited - Millions of Dollars, Except Per Share Amounts)Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Most Directly Comparable GAAP Financial MeasuresThree Months 2023Gross ProfitSelling, General &amp;

This compares to earnings of $2.30 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 25.30%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this kidney dialysis provider would post earnings of $1.08 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.58, delivering a surprise of 46.30%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.DaVita HealthCare , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry, posted revenues of $3 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.93%.

The quarter change was negatively impacted by a seasonal decrease in hospital inpatient revenues. The year to date change was primarily driven by a net increase in the Medicare rate due to base rate increase in 2023 partially offset by the phased in increase of sequestration of 1% in April 2022 and full 2% beginning July 1, 2022 and thereafter. The year to date increase was also impacted by the continued shift to Medicare Advantage plans and overall favorable mix improvements, increases in hospital inpatient dialysis revenues and other normal annual rate increases.Patient care costs: The quarter change was primarily due to seasonal decreases in payroll taxes, as well as decreased center closure costs, as described below, travel costs, contract wages and pharmaceutical costs. In addition, our fixed other direct operating expenses positively impacted patient care costs per treatment due to increased treatments in the second quarter of 2023. The quarter change was negatively impacted by increased medical supplies expense and professional fees. The year to date change was primarily due to increased compensation expenses including increased wage rates and headcount. Other drivers of the increase include increases in other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers, medical supplies expense, professional fees, travel costs, as well as center closure costs, as described below. These increases were partially offset by decreased pharmaceutical costs, contract wages and insurance costs.General and administrative: The quarter change was primarily due to increased compensation expenses, a refund received in the first quarter of 2023 related to 2022 advocacy costs, increased professional fees, long-term incentive compensation and center closure costs, as described below. These increases were partially offset by decreased severance costs, as described below. The year to date change was primarily due to increases in compensation expenses including increased wage rates and severance costs, as described below. Other drivers of this change include gains recognized on the sale of our self-developed properties in the second quarter of 2022, center closure costs, as described below, increased travel costs, contract wages related to the deployment of IT projects and other IT-related costs. These increases were partially offset by decreased advocacy costs, including a refund received in 2023 related to 2022 advocacy costs.Certain items impacting the quarter:Closure costs. During the third quarter of 2022, we began a strategic review of our outpatient clinic capacity requirements and utilization, which have been impacted both by declines in our patient census in some markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as by our initiatives toward, and advances in, increasing the proportion of our home dialysis patients. This review has resulted in higher than normal charges for center capacity closures. These capacity closure costs include net losses on assets retired, lease costs, asset impairments and accelerated depreciation and amortization.During the three month ended and the six months ended June 30, 2023, we incurred charges for U.S. dialysis center closures of approximately $21.1 million and $43.3 million, respectively. For a breakdown of how these closure costs have impacted our income statement for respective periods, see Note 3 in our Non-GAAP reconciliations that follow.Severance costs and other. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we committed to a plan to increase efficiencies and cost savings in certain general and administrative support functions. As a result of this plan, we recognized expenses related to termination and other benefit commitments in our U.S. dialysis business. This plan included additional charges of $5.3 million during the second quarter of 2023 and $23.3 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023.Debt transactions. In April 2023, we entered into the Second Amendment to our senior secured credit agreement. The Second Amendment transitions the interest pricing on Term B-1 to SOFR + 1.75% plus an additional credit spread adjustment (CSA). In addition, we entered into a Third Amendment to our senior secured credit agreement that refinanced Term Loan A and revolving line of credit with a secured Term Loan A-1 facility in aggregate principal amount of $1.25 billion and a secured revolving line of credit in the aggregate principal amount of up to $1.5 billion (the foregoing referred to as the new Term Loan A-1 and new revolving line of credit, respectively).The new Term Loan A-1 and new revolving line of credit initially bear interest at Term SOFR, plus a CSA of 0.10% and an interest margin of 2.0%, which is subject to adjustment depending upon the leverage ratio defined in the agreement and can range from 1.25%-2.25%. We used a portion of the proceeds from the new Term Loan A-1 and initial borrowing of $400 million on the new revolving line of credit to pay off the remaining principal balance outstanding and accrued interest and fees on its prior Term Loan A and prior revolving line of credit in the amount of $1,602 million. The remaining borrowings added cash to the balance sheet for general corporate purposes.Mozarc investment. On April 1 2023, the Company acquired a 50% voting equity interest in Mozarc Medical Holding LLC (Mozarc). At closing, the Company made a cash payment to Medtronic, Inc. (Medtronic) of $44.7 million, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments, and contributed certain other non-cash assets to Mozarc. In addition, the Company agreed to pay Medtronic additional consideration of up to $300 million if certain regulatory, commercial and financial milestones are achieved. At close, the Company and Medtronic also each contributed an additional $224.4 million in cash to Mozarc to fund its development initiatives. The Company's investment in Mozarc was recorded at an initial estimate of $371.0 million, subject to finalization of certain post-closing adjustments yet to be completed between the parties and finalization of related third-party valuations. As a result of this transaction the Company recognized a gain of $14.0 million on the non-cash assets contributed to Mozarc, which was recognized in ""Other income (loss), net"" in the financial statements along with equity method losses from Mozarc for the quarter.Financial and operating metrics: Three months endedJune 30,Twelve months endedJune 30,2023202220232022Cash flow:(dollars in millions)Operating cash flow$                   450$                   188$                1,967$                1,607Free cash flow(1)$                   260$                     95$                1,100$                   890______________________(1)For definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, see the note titled ""Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" and related reconciliations beginning on page 16. Three months ended June 30, 2023Six months endedJune 30, 2023Effective income tax rate on:Income16.5 %18.2 %Income attributable to DaVita Inc.(1)21.3 %23.9 %Adjusted income attributable to DaVita Inc.(1)21.6 %24.0 %_______________________(1)For definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, see the note titled ""Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" and related reconciliations beginning on page 16.Center activity: As of June 30, 2023, we provided dialysis services to a total of approximately 248,000 patients at 3,056 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,703 centers were located in the United States and 353 centers were located in 11 countries outside of the United States.

The Prior Credit Agreement also included the face amount of all letters of credit issued as debt. The leverage ratio determines the interest rate margin payable by the Company for its Term Loan A-1 and new revolving line of credit under the Amended Credit Agreement by establishing the margin over the base interest rate (SOFR plus credit spread adjustment) that is applicable. The following leverage ratios were calculated using the last 12 months of ""Consolidated EBITDA"" and ""Consolidated net debt"" at the end of each reported period, each as defined in the credit agreement that was in effect at the end of each such period (the Applicable Credit Agreement). The calculation of ""Consolidated EBITDA"" below sets forth, among other things, certain pro forma adjustments described in the Applicable Credit Agreement, including, as applicable, pro forma adjustments for acquisitions or divestitures that occurred during the period and certain projected net cost savings, expense reductions and cost synergies. These pro forma adjustments are determined according to specified criteria set forth in the Applicable Credit Agreement, and as a result, the total adjustments calculated pursuant to the Applicable Credit Agreement may not be comparable to the Company's estimates for other purposes, including as operating performance measures. The Company's management believes the presentation of ""Consolidated EBITDA"" as defined in the Applicable Credit Agreement is useful to investors to enhance their understanding of the Company's leverage ratio under the Applicable Credit Agreement and should not be evaluated for any other purpose. The leverage ratio calculated by the Company is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered a substitute for the ratio of total debt to operating income, determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company's calculation of its leverage ratio might not be calculated in the same manner as, and thus might not be comparable to, similarly titled measures of other companies.Twelve months endedJune 30, 2023March 31, 2023Net income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc.$                   454$                   500Income taxes170185Interest expense367350Depreciation and amortization750738Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests241233Stock-settled stock-based compensation9995Debt prepayment and refinancing charges8Expected cost savings and expense reductions73Severance and other related costs4944Other 7137""Consolidated EBITDA""$               2,281$               2,182June 30, 2023March 31, 2023Total debt, excluding debt discount and other deferred financing costs(1)$               8,760$               8,701Letters of credit issued—1518,7608,853Less: Cash and cash equivalents including short-term investments(2)(336)(364)Consolidated net debt$               8,424$               8,489Last twelve months ""Consolidated EBITDA""$               2,281$               2,182Leverage ratio3.69x3.89xMaximum leverage ratio permitted under the Credit Agreement5.00x5.00xCertain columns or rows may not sum or recalculate due to the presentation of rounded numbers._______________________(1)The debt amounts as of June 30, 2023 and March 31, 2023 presented exclude approximately $60.6 and $41.5, respectively, of debt discount, premium and other deferred financing costs related to our senior secured credit facilities and senior notes in effect or outstanding at that time.(2)This excludes amounts not readily convertible to cash related to the Company's non-qualified deferred compensation plans for all periods presented. The Credit Agreement limits the amount deducted for cash and cash equivalents, including short-term investments, to the lesser of all unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, including short-term investments of the Company or $750.DAVITA INC.INTEGRATED CARE METRICS(unaudited)Note 2:   Integrated Care MetricsOur integrated kidney care (IKC) business is party to a variety of risk-based integrated care and disease management arrangements, including value-based care (VBC) contracts under which we assume full or shared financial risk for the total medical cost of care for patients below or above a benchmark.The aggregate amount of medical spend associated with risk-based integrated care arrangements that we disclose includes both medical costs included in our reported expenses for certain risk-based arrangements (such as its special needs plans), as well as the aggregate estimated benchmark amount above or below which we will incur profit or loss on for VBC arrangements under which third-party medical costs are not included in our reported results. This metric is an annualization of our estimate of this amount for the most recent quarter.A number of our VBC contracts are subject to complex or novel patient attribution mechanics and benchmark adjustments, some of which are based on information not reported to us until periods after we report our quarterly results. As a result, our estimates of our patients under, and the dollar amount of, our value-based contracts remain subject to estimation uncertainty.DAVITA INC.RECONCILIATIONS FOR NON-GAAP MEASURES(unaudited)Note on Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresAs used in this press release, the term ""adjusted"" refers to non-GAAP measures as follows, each as reconciled to its most comparable GAAP measure as presented in the non-GAAP reconciliations in the notes to this press release: (i) for income and expense measures, the term ""adjusted"" refers to operating performance measures that exclude certain items such as impairment charges, (gain) loss on ownership changes, capacity closure charges, restructuring charges, accruals for legal matters and debt prepayment and refinancing charges; and (ii) the term ""effective income tax rate on adjusted income attributable to DaVita Inc."" represents the Company's effective tax rate excluding applicable non-GAAP items and the tax associated with them as well as noncontrolling owners' income, which primarily relates to non-tax paying entities. Note that the non-GAAP measures presented for prior periods below have been conformed to the non-GAAP measures presented for the current period.These non-GAAP or ""adjusted"" measures are presented because management believes these measures are useful adjuncts to GAAP results. However, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered alternatives to the corresponding measures determined under GAAP.Specifically, management uses adjusted measures of operating expenses for its U.S. dialysis business, adjusted U.S. dialysis patient care costs per treatment, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to DaVita Inc. and adjusted diluted net income per share attributable to DaVita Inc. to compare and evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to establish operational budgets and forecasts and for incentive compensation purposes. We believe these non-GAAP measures also are useful to investors and analysts in evaluating our performance over time and relative to competitors, as well as in analyzing the underlying trends in our business. Furthermore, we believe these presentations enhance a user's understanding of our normal consolidated results by excluding certain items which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results of operations. As a result, adjusting for these amounts allows for comparison to our normalized prior period results.The effective income tax rate on adjusted income attributable to DaVita Inc. excludes noncontrolling owners' income and certain non-deductible and other charges which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results. Accordingly, we believe these adjusted effective income tax rates are useful to management, investors and analysts in evaluating our performance and establishing expectations for income taxes incurred on our ordinary results attributable to DaVita Inc.Finally, free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less distributions to noncontrolling interests and all capital expenditures (including development capital expenditures, routine maintenance and information technology); plus contributions from noncontrolling interests and proceeds from the sale of self-developed properties. Management uses this measure to assess our ability to fund acquisitions and meet our debt service obligations and we believe this measure is equally useful to investors and analysts as an adjunct to cash flows from operating activities and other measures under GAAP.It is important to bear in mind that these non-GAAP ""adjusted"" measures are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, nor as substitutes for, their most comparable GAAP measures.The following Notes 3 through 7 provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release to their most comparable GAAP measures.DAVITA INC.RECONCILIATIONS FOR NON-GAAP MEASURES -

My name is Kayla Baker, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ingersoll Rand Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Matthew Fort. You may begin.Matthew FortThank you, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2023 Second Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO; and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday, and we will reference these during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details. In addition, today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will review our company and segment financial highlights and provide an update to our 2023 guidance. For today's Q&amp;A session, we ask that each caller keep to 1 question and 1 follow-up to allow time for other participants. At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente.Story continuesVicente ReynalThanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. I would like to begin by thanking and acknowledging all of our employees for their hard work in helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q2. Our employees continue to deliver on our commitments despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment, and consistently exemplify our purpose while thinking and acting like owners. I would also like to welcome our new employees from our recent acquisitions. Together, we have a great opportunity to build upon our strong complementary brands, products and capabilities, providing customers and the industry with a broader spectrum of solutions. Beginning on Slide 3, fueled by our competitive differentiator, IRX in the second quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We recently published our 2022 sustainability report, where we yet again delivered industry-leading results while remaining on track to meet our 2030 sustainability goals. Finally, based on our continued robust performance in Q2, we're once again raising our 2023 full year guidance. As we move to Slide 4, our economic growth engine is the key to how we deliver compounding annual results. During our last Investor Day in Q4 of 2021, we presented this model and highlighted our organic, inorganic and quality of earning growth enablers. We remain committed to our strategy and our long-term Investor Day targets outlined in this page. On the next slides, I will provide you with deeper insights into our organic initiatives, which are centered around product innovation and innovative value also known as i2V. In addition, we will provide an update on our progress towards our inorganic goals. Turning to Slide 5. We start with our organic growth initiatives. Here, we have some examples of how in China, we have leveraged products localization as well as i2V to drive organic growth. On the left-hand side of the page, we show how localization has created new product offerings and enabled channel expansion, all with a focus on high-growth sustainable end markets. Since the Gardner Denver and Ingersoll Rand merger, our blower and vacuum product lines have grown organically at a 17% CAGR. On the right-hand side of the page, we have an example of organic growth through the combination of recently acquired M&amp;A and i2V. As you can see in the pictures at the bottom right-hand side of the page, the Asia Pacific team conducted a turndown event with legacy products, recently acquired M&amp;A and competitive technologies. The outcome of that turndown event is the development of a new oil-free screw vacuum pump. This new product will expand our addressable market by over $350 million, and will go from development to launch in approximately 6 months. Next, on Slide 6, M&amp;A continues to be at the forefront of our capital allocation strategy. We are thrilled to highlight our recently signed M&amp;A deal Roots. This iconic Roots brand is a leading provider of low-pressure compression and vacuum technology. This brand is synonymous with blowers in the same way that clinics and [Band-Aid] are recognized in consumer markets. We're very excited to acquire this iconic brand, which has been in business for almost 200 years. The acquisition also expands our capabilities in both low-pressure technology and centrifugal technology. And this technology is a critical component in the process of green steel manufacturing. Our M&amp;A funnel remains strong. And as of today, it continues to be over 5x larger than it was at the time of the R&amp;D. We currently have 7 transactions at the LOI stage. And more importantly, we have several other transactions in process, which are close to the LOI stage. Based on acquisitions to date, the 7 transactions under LOI at our current M&amp;A funnel, we are reaffirming our commitment to an additional $200 million to $300 million in annualized inorganic revenue to be acquired in 2023. On Slide 7, we recently released our 2022 sustainability report, showcasing the commitment and results of our strategic imperative leads sustainably. We have made significant progress in establishing ourselves as a top quartile ESG company by leveraging our competitive differentiator, IRX to deliver results in a very short period of time. In fact, we have received several industry-leading sustainability acknowledgments of our efforts, including being named to both the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index and the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. Ingersoll Rand was ranked as the #1 performer in the IEQ machinery and electrical equipment industry in North America and #4 globally in 2022. As a very close 2023, Ingersoll-Rand received an ESG risk rating of low at 12.8% from Morningstar Sustainalytics. We also received an ESG rating improvement to AA in 2023 from MSCI and ranked as a leader among 47 companies in the industrial machinery category. More important, we're also leading the way in the social aspect of ESG with our employee ownership model. We believe employee ownership creates economic opportunity for our employees and their families while driving increased employee engagement as our long-term shareholder. To that end, we have awarded approximately $275 million since 2017 in equity to our employees, employees that are not already on the management equity program. This has increased to over $660 million in value as of June 30, 2023. We will continue to offer our ownership works program that grant equity to all new employees after the 1-year anniversary. Our employees are a critical element of our business and making life better for them begins with opportunity. Through their engagement and commitment, we are on track to meet our 2030 sustainability objectives. With this, I'll turn now the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q2 financial performance.Vikram U. KiniThanks, Vicente. On Slide 8, fueled by IRX, we again delivered solid results in Q2 through a balance of commercial and operational execution. Total company organic orders and revenue increased 5% and 12% year-over-year, respectively. Book-to-bill was 1.03x, and we remain encouraged with the strength of our backlog, which is up approximately 12% year-over-year and up approximately 5% sequentially. The backlog is approximately 45% higher than it was at the end of 2021, which gives us good visibility and momentum as we move into the back half of 2023 and start to look into 2024. The company delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $425 million, a 27% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margins of 25.2%, a 190 basis point year-over-year improvement. For the quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.68, up 25% versus the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $204 million, despite ongoing headwinds from inventory due to the need to support backlog as well as continued global supply chain challenges. Even with these headwinds, free cash flow was up 24% versus prior year. Total liquidity of $3.2 billion at quarter end was up approximately $1 billion sequentially. This increase was driven in large part due to the recently amended, extended and upsized revolving facility, which took place in early Q2 of this year. Our net leverage continues to remain near all-time lows. At 1.0 turns, we are 0.1 turns better than both the prior year and prior quarter. Finally, I'd like to highlight an example of the power of our ownership mindset and the effectiveness of our competitive differentiator, IRX. Due to the team's resiliency in overcoming the cybersecurity incident, the Q2 revenue and adjusted EBITDA risk associated with the incident was mitigated within the quarter. This is no small task, and I would like to thank all of our employees that were involved in helping to overcome this impediment, enabling us to deliver tremendous results in Q2. Turning to Slide 9. For the total company, Q2 orders grew 10% and revenue increased 18%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 27% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 200 basis points, while the PST segment margin improved 240 basis points. Notably, both segments remain price cost dollar and margin positive, which speaks to the nimble actions of our teams despite persistent inflationary headwinds. Corporate costs came in at approximately $43 million for the quarter, driven by continued investments to support growth in areas like demand generation and IIoT as well as the impact of incentive compensation adjustments. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was up 25% to $0.68 per share. This $0.14 year-over-year increase includes a $0.04 headwind from interest expense. And finally, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 24%. Moving on to the next slide. I want to highlight that the company was assigned an investment-grade first-time issuer default rating from Fitch. We have now received investment-grade ratings from 2 of the 3 major rating agencies, and we remain committed to becoming an investment-grade rated across all of our rating agencies. Free cash flow for the quarter was $204 million, including CapEx, which totaled $25 million. Total company liquidity was $3.2 billion based on approximately $1.2 billion of cash and $2 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Cash outflows for the quarter included $49 million deployed to M&amp;A and we returned $64 million to shareholders through $56 million in share repurchases and $8 million in dividends. M&amp;A remains our top priority for our capital allocation, and we continue to expect M&amp;A to be our primary usage of cash for the foreseeable future. We continue to have an active and healthy funnel of inorganic growth opportunities. This funnel consists primarily of bolt-on M&amp;A relatively similar in size, scope and nature to the assets we have acquired over the past 2 to 3 years. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segment results.Vicente ReynalThanks, Vik. On Slide 11, our Industrial Technologies and Service segment delivered strong year-over-year organic revenue growth of 14% with volume growth slightly outpacing pricing. Adjusted EBITDA increased 29% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.4%, up 200 basis points from the prior year, with an incremental margin of 38%. We continue to see solid demand for our products with organic orders up 8% and a book-to-bill of 1.05x. Note that on a 2-year stack, ITS organic orders have grown 19%. Moving to the individual product categories. Each of the figures exclude the negative impact of FX, which year-over-year was approximately a 1.5 percentage point headwind across the total segment on both orders and revenues. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the low double digits. We continue to see oil free product orders outpace oil lubricated products. Orders were up low double digits in the Americas, with North America also up low double digits demonstrating that we continue to see momentum from secular trends around ESG, on-shoring and near-shoring as well as continued investments on energy savings. EMEIA demand continued to be above market with orders up high single digits. The Asia Pacific team continues to deliver a great performance with order growth in the mid-teens, driven by continued solid execution from our team in China where they saw orders up in the low 20s. Today, we showed on Slide 5, an example of how the team in China continues to outperform the market conditions with our own self-help initiatives. Vacuum and blower orders were up mid-teens and every region saw positive orders with good strength from Europe. Orders in the power tools and lifting business was up low single digits. Moving now to the innovation and action portion of the slide, we're illustrating an oil free hydrogen compressor recently launched in EMEIA. This product is a perfect example of how we continue to focus our portfolio on high-growth, sustainable end markets with region-for-region manufacturing. The EMEIA team collaborated with a clean energy tech startup in the Netherlands to develop and build a system for our innovative hydrogen process, and the first unit was shipped in July. Turn to Slide 12. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technology segment grew 5% organically. Additionally, the PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $90 million, which was up 16% year-over-year with incremental margins of 66%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.2%, up 240 basis points year-over-year. The year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin is driven primarily by price cost improvements, synergy delivery on acquired businesses like [Seepex] and the impact of China lockdowns in the second quarter of 2022, which did not repeat. Organic orders were down 10% year-over-year with a book-to-bill of 0.95x. It is important to note that the book-to-bill was onetime for the first half of the year. The primary driver of the organic order decline related to larger frame orders not repeating in the life science businesses as well as the expected decline of longer cycle orders in the Agritech platform. Our book and ship business was solid, and we believe that the core business within PST remains very healthy. For PST innovation in action, we're highlighting our new peristaltic pump technology that is used for water treatment, industrial and life sciences market. This product innovative design provides a robust alternative for chemical dosing and transfer applications. The products are IoT-ready and complement our already strong portfolio of products for water treatment and chemical applications offering customers the opportunity to choose the best technology for each application. Leveraging this technology across both Albin Pump and LMI brands, we continue to execute our multi-brand, multichannel strategy while expanding our addressable market by over $250 million. Moving to Slide 13. Given the solid performance in the first half and continued momentum from backlog, we're again raising our 2023 guidance. As you may recall, during Q1 earnings, we guided an anticipated impact of approximately $20 million of adjusted EBITDA moving out of Q2 and into the back half of the year due to the cybersecurity incident that we experienced in late April. As Vik mentioned earlier, this risk was mitigated within the quarter and no significant revenue or adjusted EBITDA is now expected to have been pushed into the back half. We have included some additional commentary on the bottom right-hand side of the page, outlining the increase in full year guidance incorporating the impact from the Q2 outperformance and the improvement in organic growth expectations in the second half of the year. For the full year, total company revenue is expected to grow overall between 12% and 14%, which is a 200 basis point improvement versus our previous guidance. We anticipate organic growth of 8% to 10%, where price and volume is split approximately 60-40. FX is now expected to be a slight headwind, however, approximately flat on a full year basis. Our revenue from M&amp;A has increased $30 million to approximately $300 million. This increase reflects the impact from all completed and closed M&amp;A transactions as of August 1, 2023. Corporate costs are planned at $165 million and will be incurred relatively evenly per quarter throughout the year. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.69 billion and $1.74 billion, which is up 2% versus prior guidance and up 7% versus our initial guidance. At the bottom of the table, adjusted EPS is projected to be within the range of $2.70 and $2.80, which is up 17% year-over-year at the midpoint. No changes have been made to our guidance on the adjusted tax rate, total interest expense or CapEx spend as a percentage of revenue, all remain in line with both initial and prior guidance. Turning now to Slide 14. As we wrap today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand remains in a strong position. We continue to deliver record results and our updated guidance is reflective of our Q2 performance and ongoing backlog momentum. We remain nimble. We continue to monitor the dynamic market conditions, and we're prepared for the challenges that may come. To our employees, I want to thank you for an excellent first half of the year. These results show the impact that each of you have as owners of the company. However, we're still a long way to go, and we need to remain focused on our commitment to meeting our financial targets and executing our economic growth engine through the use of IRX. Thank you for your continued hard work, resiliency and focus action. As we continue our track record of market outperformance, our balance sheet is as strong as ever. And with our disciplined and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to invest with the highest return. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open the call for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Michael Halloran with Baird.Michael Patrick HalloranSo can we just talk about how the underlying trends you saw through the quarter, maybe any sequential commentary and a focus on where you saw any changes positively or negatively? Or is the demand environment essentially cadencing how you would have expected -- on an underlying level?Vicente ReynalYes, I'll say, Mike, we saw the sequential cadence in the quarter, very comparable to what we always see, which is typically lower on month 1 and kind of starts ramping up through the quarter, and we saw that happening pretty well. So nothing that we will call anything different out of color. So -- which obviously continues to show that there is good cadence and momentum. And that more important for us to as well is the leading indicators. And particularly as we always talk about the MQLs, those marketing qualified leads that we generate with our demand generation engine. And that continues to see good sustainable pace momentum across the product lines, which is encouraging to see.Michael Patrick HalloranAnd on the PST side, can you just put those orders in context a little bit. I certainly understand the Agritech side and some of the larger projects, orders not repeating. But it sounds like things are healthy when you exclude those 2 pieces. And maybe a little bit of help on how you expect the order trends to track from here and recovery curves in some of those markets?Vicente ReynalYes. Sure, Mike. I mean I think you said it very well. I mean I think what we continue to see that we get excited is that the book and turn business remains pretty strong in the business, which you could call it the short cycle side of the business. And then what we saw here in the quarter, it was just that lumpiness with Agritech with some of our businesses that last year, we're doing on some large projects and also some of the oxygen concentration business that kind of similar to what we spoke in the first quarter of kind of large frame orders that happened last year, not this year. So I guess -- so with that, I think we continue to stay very encouraged. We see that the trend in the PST segment continues to be to deliver that mid-single-digit plus. I mean there's definitely no over the cycle and over time. So there's no change in that long-term perspective of what we can achieve here in the PST team with the PST segment, and we anticipate continued momentum here. So, yes.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays Capital.Julian C.H. MitchellMaybe first question just around that split of sort of how you see the second half playing out between Q3 and 4. I think the guide embeds are sort of low 70s EPS figure each quarter, but just wondered about how much of that ends up being weighted into Q4 and if there's any big difference between the 2 segments from that standpoint?Vicente ReynalYes. Julian, for total Ingersoll Rand on revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin Q3 looks a lot like Q2. And I'll say for Q3 on a year-over-year basis, remember that comps get increasingly more difficult. And as we think about the segments, ITS, for example, ITS is expected to grow revenue still at low double digit, including the impact of M&amp;A, and as a reminder, I mean, think about that tough comp where Q3 of last year, we grew 19% organically. So that's kind of what we talk about those tough comps. But we still see a good line of sight to about 100 basis points of margin expansion in ITS. And PST is expected to grow mid-single digits. And as a reminder, that's on top of 20% growth in Q3 of 2022 and margins to be expected back again into that 30% level of EBITDA.Julian C.H. MitchellThat's very helpful. And then just secondly, when you're thinking about the sort of firm-wide orders and backlog trajectory from here across both businesses. Are we thinking sort of orders flattish organically year-on-year in the back half and then the sort of backlog maybe starts to drift down a bit sequentially, just as those lead times shorten. And so sort of customers can adjust their orders a little bit?Vicente ReynalYes. Julian, yes, I mean, clearly, we don't specifically guide on orders. But again, as a reminder, our Q3 prior year is probably 1 of the toughest comps for orders. As I recall, Q3 last year was roughly 14% organic order growth momentum, so very solid. In terms of the backlog, I'll say, we do anticipate backlog to drift down a little bit in the back half as we mentioned in the past, I mean, the normal cadence for orders is typically a book-to-bill greater than 1 in the first half due to larger longer projects and booking in the first half has been -- and booking in the second half being kind of less than 1 due to those larger orders kind of getting shipped most predominantly in the fourth quarter. Having said that, as a reminder, I think the past 9 quarters out of 10 quarters, we had a book-to-bill of greater than 1, so -- which obviously speaks again to the comps that we're seeing here.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.Jeffrey Todd SpragueVicente, can you elaborate a little bit more on your talking about demand in ITS and compressors in particular, you noted reshoring and ESG? I guess on the ESG side, you're pointing to kind of energy efficiency sort of investments and retrofit. But a, is that the case? And b, can you just elaborate a little bit on what you're seeing in those 2 buckets?Vicente ReynalYes, Jeff. So absolutely. I mean, again, we're very pleased with the momentum that we saw on the compressor product line, and particularly, you saw that oil-free compressor outpacing the growth and that was kind of high 20s momentum that we saw on the oil-free. So very, very exciting to see that 1 of the core strategies that we launched continues to actually see some fruit and growth. In terms of ESG, I mean we continue to see that the energy savings, again, based on the return on the investment that we have conversations with customers still is resonating quite well and -- so that momentum continues. Our few earnings ago, we spoke about the air audits that we're doing. We continue to do that at a faster clip than ever before, and that's really driving a lot of good leading data points for us as we see kind of moving forward. And from a reshoring, yes, it's kind of whether you think about reinsuring companies expanding capacity or reallocating their supply chains more locally. I talked about also near-shoring because clearly, in Mexico, we're seeing a lot of expansion too as well. And we have a very strong team as well in Mexico there that is really capturing some good momentum to as well. But this reshoring is happening here in the U.S. We see it, that's why we reopened Buffalo at that time, but we also see it in India, and we see it in China as well. So we see good momentum of companies really investing in the core technologies and in particularly here, the compressor systems.Jeffrey Todd SpragueAnd maybe you could give us a little color on service too, Vicente. I would imagine if customers are going through the air audit process that creates quite an opportunity for service and stickier service attachment on the back end. Where are you at now on service as a percent of revenues? And how is that growing?Vicente ReynalYes, absolutely. Jeff, particularly the statistic that we said before is that roughly these [air] audience, we see kind of a 70-30, 70% leading to new equipment, but 30% leading to actually incremental service revenue. And we've seen good momentum in terms of -- we spoke a lot about Care and the Packaged Care solutions, the team in North America continues to really accelerate that. And we're seeing now better momentum as well in our team in Europe and also in team in Asia. So yes, this continues to be very front and center in our strategy and particularly as we continue to connect more compressors with our remote monitoring devices and be able to capture more recurring revenue here. So yes, we continue to be actually a 1 that we see good momentum to come.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.Robert Cameron WertheimerVicente, I think you touched on China, APAC orders and compressors up mid-teens. I think that's comping mid-teens. And so -- I know you called out kind of the good job the team has done there. Is there any particular end market strength in China that's adding to that? I think we've seen China be a drag elsewhere in industrials. And then just in general, I don't know if you can expand on your market position there and the broader efforts you're doing?Vicente ReynalYes, Rob, I think there's definitely some in markets that strategically we're going after more pronouncedly than others because we're seeing the growth in those you could think about electric vehicles, battery production, lithium, mining and things like that. But a lot of that, as you very well said too, as well, it kind of continues to change end markets. And I think the ability for us to pivot from 1 end market that has seen some growth to the other end market that are starting to see the spurt of growth, that is what I think is very core to what the team very nimbly is doing. In addition to that, I think what's exciting is the combination of the Gardner Denver and Ingersoll Rand company, where the team in China is leveraging a lot of the kind of, call it, legacy Gardner Denver products of blowers and the vacuums to really accelerate growth.And that's, as you saw on Slide 5, how we see this organic revenue CAGR of 17% on this kind of core product line and technology. So I'll say, yes, the team is firing on all cylinders this morning as I was driving, I was actually chatting with our leader in China. He's actually -- was actually our -- he was with the team at our innovation center in China and doing a review of their new product technologies and he was living super inspire and excited. So again, it's just a good team, solid performance and very happy with how the team continues to navigate this tough environment in China.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.Andrew Alec KaplowitzVicente, could you give us a little more color into the dynamics of your compressor order strength in the sense that I think historically, you've had 20% cycle versus 80% short cycle. The long-cycle business is currently much stronger than short cycle in 1 end markets. If you could give us some detail or driving the most order growth right now?Vicente ReynalYes. I would say Andy, I would say maybe not a dramatic change. I mean, maybe instead of being 80-20, could it be 70-30, potentially yes, but not in such a dramatic kind of way. So we see good momentum on the long and the short, I think what we're very happy with is the performance of the oil-free. Oil-free, which tends to be a higher level of technology more difficult for others to kind of penetrate. So we still see this as a main market and a product line that we see continued momentum for growth as we continue to take more share in a good way.Andrew Alec KaplowitzThat's helpful. And then Vik, it looks like it's just a tweak, but I think you actually lowered your incremental margin forecast for the year to 35% versus 35% to 40% previously despite you beating margin in Q2, and I would imagine price versus cost of anything is getting better in the second half versus the first half. So could you give us more color into what you're seeing there?Vikram U. KiniSure. Yes, Andy. I think in terms of the last part of your question on the price cost, like we said before, we were very early in our pricing actions. I think right now, the expectation is the back half looks fairly comparable to how we were guiding before. I wouldn't call that a meaningful change. In terms of the margin tweak kind of as you put it, it's just that, just a minor tweak. A couple of things to note. We did call out that there's some slight increase on corporate cost. We did have -- you saw some of the capital that was deployed to M&amp;A. So we did actually have a technology acquisition that we completed in Q2 that right now, I'd say minimal revenue base to the cost base but 1 that we're very excited about for the future. So again, when you put those 2 in perspective, that's probably the meaningful portion there. And as we've always said, we're going to continue to invest in the business. I mean, as Vicente said, whether it be in Asia or anywhere else around the world. We're going to continue to invest in growth resources to drive outperformance from an organic growth perspective as we look forward. So I think that's the way we kind of look at it in totality. But again, nothing in terms of a meaningful change in our opinion, from kind of where we've been operating or prior guidance.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.Nigel Edward CoeJust wanted to maybe just take a different crack at the second half margin question. I think you talked about 3Q looking like 2Q, which makes sense. This feels like the guide doesn't embed much of a kickup in 4Q and normally 4Q margins are substantially higher on volumes. So just wondering what are you expecting for 4Q. Maybe my math is wrong, that's -- please correct me. But it does feel like we don't have much of a seasonal uplift in 4Q?Vikram U. KiniSure. Yes. So Nigel, I think the way you've described Q3 is correct. If you think about ITS as Vicente earlier said, I think ITS will look fairly comparable to Q2. Now that being said, that still would embed nice margin expansion on a year-over-year basis. And we would expect on the PFT side for margins to kind of get back to that 30% level, specifically in Q3. Now on the Q4 side of the equation, whether you're looking from a total company perspective or the individual components I think it's actually going to be fairly comparable to what you've seen historically. Seasonally, it is the strongest quarter in the year. That's no different. So you will see a slight seasonal uptick from Q3 to Q4. But there is incremental margin expansion included in the Q4 guide, I would say it's not dramatically different than our prior guide in that respect. And the 1 thing to probably note here as we look and we got some of the questions about it earlier in terms of the cadence. Kind of like what we said before, we're still, I think, continue to remain prudent on the back half expectations [particularly] Q4 on the volume side. And I think we would still acknowledge that's probably the single source of potential upside to the guide as we sit here, thinking specifically about organic volume in Q4.Nigel Edward CoeOkay, okay. That's fair. And then vacuum -- taking into (inaudible) here, but the vacuum trends remain really strong, (inaudible) compressor. But I think Copco called out a bit of weakness in industrial vacuum, not just semi, but also a little bit of weakness in industrial. And you're obviously not seeing that. So are you seeing any signs of weakness developing in any of your end markets? And is there a reason why vacuum and compressor would be couple? Just curious there.Vicente ReynalYes. Nigel, I would say that the industrial vacuum is kind of what we call rough vacuum when you look at the total market segmentation of that. And I will say that we have a more bigger spectrum of technologies, whether it's crew vacuum, rotary vein, liquid ring. So we will say that we have not only great technologies, but also good brands. In terms of what we're seeing in the market, I'd say stability from what we're seeing. You could argue that sometimes the industrial vacuum plays slightly different where the industrial compressors will pay.So industrial vacuum many times will play in chemical processes or petrochem and things like that, things of that nature. But in our view, we're very happy and very pleased with what the team again continues to do from my self-help initiative here on driving new technologies. I mean we spoke about some of the technologies, again, not only on that Slide 5 on what China team is doing. But now there's also new technologies that the team in Europe are launching to as well to start capturing even more share. So I'll say that very, very pleased with the performance of the team is driving.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.Joseph Alfred RitchieMaybe just following along Nigel's questions around just potential weakness. I know that you're seeing really good order trends across your businesses, but there's a real focus right now on companies that are seeing destocking across their channels. And so maybe just on your shorter cycle businesses, just maybe talk to us about whether you see any kind of risk to any piece of your business today on -- from a channel perspective?Vicente ReynalYes, Joe, I'll say maybe -- I'll start with the 2 big buckets, obviously, the ITS and PST. On the ITS side, a lot of the product -- I say the majority of the product that we have in the ITS is really customized to specific applications. So it's very difficult to kind of at least on our technology to really have stock of those compressors in the shelves. It's basically high working capital for the distribution channel network that we have. So we don't see much of that. At the same time, we have a very loyal channel and we have access and visibility to what levels of inventory they have. On the PST side, PST will be the 1 that maybe plays a little bit more on what we call the national distribution, national industrial distribution, at least particularly in the U.S. here. And on those, we track very on a monthly cadence, sell in and sell out. So we have a visibility on how much we're selling to the channel and how much of that channel is selling out. So at least we get visibility with the level of inventory that is somewhat available in the shelves and whether it is getting destocking or overstocking, we're always proactively trying to prevent the overstocking. It's a situation that we just don't like to be entangled with. So I think -- I'd say we've been fairly proactive from that perspective to making sure that we're watching those trends carefully, nothing of material of note that we're seeing in terms of major destocking. But again, it has to do because there was not a lot of overstocking as well. So -- I don't know that helps, but that's maybe a little bit of color there.Joseph Alfred RitchieNo, that's great. I figured as much, but I had to ask the question. So that's helpful color, Vicente. And I guess the follow-on question really kind of want to maybe dig into this opportunity, this oil-free hydrogen compressor opportunity. Maybe talk a little bit more about what the opportunity is there and then specifically what the applications are today?Vicente ReynalYes, Joe, I mean, I'll say this is a very, very exciting opportunity and 1 that this, we have now an engineering center inside in our facility in India. We're now considered to be 1 of the only India companies in India that has the capability of actually testing hydrogen compression systems. And [hydrogen] is going to be, we think, a good growth vector in the market in India. So we're happy to be the first, and we're happy to be the ones with the largest lab and technology center in India at this point in time, which is the reason why on the prior earnings call, we spoke about the expansion that we're doing. In terms of market sizing, I mean, I think I'd say it's still early stages from the perspective. We don't want to put numbers at -- I mean, obviously, if you kind of trust what market dynamics are saying, these are kind of huge markets, but we're not going to size it here on this call. I think on the Investor Day, we'll definitely give you a little bit more color on this one. But again, this is 1 super exciting opportunity that technology that the team in India was able to develop and actually work pretty closely with a company in Europe to develop something really unique. And in this case, we were kind of the only company that could achieve the performance requirement that it was required by this technology company. So again, it speaks volumes to the investments that we continue to make in R&amp;D and continued investments that we make in technologies that we think will play well for us in the future.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS.Christopher M. SnyderSo Q2 really showed strength across all 3 geographies. And I understand that comps are obviously getting a good deal tougher into the back half of the year and price contribution is easing. But when you look at these 3 geographies, is there any 1 or any place where you see demand softening on the leading edge?Vicente ReynalI mean, I think, Chris, note that our MQLs are demonstrating or showing. We're -- even as we look here into the month of early days in July, I'll say that there continues to be that sustained momentum that we were seeing in the second quarter from an MQL perspective. So noting that we will highlight of specifically end market or maybe, as you said, regional view that has seen a dramatic decline. Again, I think it's tough comps as we go into the third quarter. I think if I remember the ITS, America teams, I mean, had really hefty double-digit like close to 30% of growth in orders Q3 of last year. So I mean those are the difficult comps that we talk about. But -- having said that, I mean, I think when you think about it in perspective, we have been posting double-digit revenue organic growth for like 9 out of the 10 quarters. So that's kind of what we talk about tough comps. But again, the team continues to perform, execute and control what they can control.Christopher M. SnyderYes. No, I appreciate that. Obviously, with the tough comps, you're trying to sometimes separate like demand from growth. So I appreciate all that color. And then I guess kind of following up on that. In prior quarters, you guys talked about basically flat backlog year-on-year to exit the year, building the first half burn in the back half. I know that's still generally the trajectory. But is -- do you still expect not to add any backlog throughout the year even if we burn a little off in the back half, just does feel like demand may be running a little bit better than expected 6 months ago?Vikram U. KiniYes. Chris, I think right now, our expectation is fairly consistent with what we've kind of messaged before. And you're absolutely right. When we came into the year, we did expect backlog to be largely flat as we look towards the end of the year. But we did explicitly say that book-to-bill above 1x in the first half build backlog and then you'd see that kind of drift down, I think, as Vicente mentioned earlier in the second half of the year. And that's very consistent with, I'd say, our typical cadence, our typical seasonality, and based on what we're seeing now, given the level of backlog, but then also kind of the expectations for what we're seeing in the second half of the year, I don't think anything changed in that respect. To the point that was said before, I do think there continues to be an opportunity on the organic volume side, particularly probably more in the Q4 side of the equation, maybe as the upside to guide. But in terms of backlog being flat year in -- at the end of the year compared to where we started, I think that's still a fairly good expectation at this point in time.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo.Joseph John O'DeaSo first, just another 1 on back half, but the price and volume dynamic within organic, it seems like the way the back half is set up between the quarters, we're looking at pretty similar organic growth, 3Q and 4Q. Just curious in terms of kind of pricing comps and if what we're thinking about at this point is that it's really volume growth in the back half?Vikram U. KiniYes. Joe, the way I would probably think about it in terms of the back half. I do think if you look on a -- like we said, Q3 will look fairly similar to Q2, particularly on the ITS side, if you're thinking about revenue and bottom line. I think the way to think about it if you want to kind of think about the 2 quarters individual, I think the organic growth side will probably be a little bit healthier in Q3 than Q4. Remember, Q4 of last year, we had an exceedingly strong end of the year, particularly in ITS, I think ITS Q4 organic sales growth was in excess of 20%. So again, aside from the kind of timing between the quarters, to your point, we do expect to see pricing continue to, I'd say, normalized in the back half. A lot of that is just, frankly, due to the timing of when we took price increases in the prior year. So we are now lapping that, and we would expect to see price continue to kind of ramp down on a sequential basis, but very consistent with what we said in terms of our original guide. I don't think anything has really changed on that end. And then again, on the volume side, again, volume, we continue to slightly uptick our volume expectations for the back half. Each of our successive guide, this guidance note is no different. And with the backlog, hopefully there's some opportunity to outperform there as we think about Q4.Joseph John O'DeaGot it. And then Vicente, I think your response to kind of Rob's question was interesting on the ability to pivot to growth. And I'm curious just in terms of the internal approaches to identifying that growth and how you try to sort of position in advance of it. So it's not so much of chasing the puck, but just being well-positioned for anticipating that. And kind of how far out that goes? I mean what we can think about what you're doing today in terms of what you anticipate for growth? How far out it is?Vicente ReynalYes. No, I love that question. Because we have a team -- I mean, a team for us, the team is like a team of one. But we have 2 people actually here sitting in our corporate offices that we're currently analyzing like 100-plus micro trends. And these are kind of trends that we're seeing early indicators of potentially becoming good vectors of growth. So that's 1 avenue how so early. We're looking at these new potential trends. I mean, give you 1 example could be lithium battery recycling. Clearly, with a lot of the production on electric vehicle and lithium battery production, there's going to come a time that batteries will need to recycle. So we're already looking at the technologies that we can incorporate in those and finding the early-stage development processes where we can actually incorporate a lot of our technologies and products. So -- and to think about it, I mean, we have about 100 of those kind of micro trends that at any point in time, we're analyzing and then we're leveraging our demand generation team to get close and closer to those customers to better understand how can we help and participate on those early trends. That's just 1 example of kind of how early we can do it. And then obviously, as you go to a country like China, I mean, the team, every year, we reassess the end markets that we expect to see a higher growth and then with pivot resources and technologies. And again, demand generation to be able to start attacking those early indications that we're seeing.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.Nicole Sheree DeBlaseMost of mine have been answered today, but I guess 1 thing that I want to dig into is just I think there's concern among investors about potential slowing in Europe. So I mean it sounds like everything from your commentary is going pretty well there, but if we could just dig into that a little bit on what you're seeing?Vicente ReynalYes, Nicole, I'd say continues to see good momentum. But again, I think I always like to put it in perspective in terms of the self-help that we're driving ourselves. It doesn't mean that the total market is actually seeing the same momentum as we're seeing. I mean we're definitely outgrowing the market by a lot of the focus that we're doing on these kind of vectors of growth that we're finding and whether it is in France, going after -- how can our technologies help with nuclear facilities and revamping that or in Germany. How -- whether LNG or the hydrogen push is actually helping us to refocus some of the technologies in that. So we get kind of variance on that kind of micro level for us to be able to decipher the best way for achieving that growth. So that's why we think that the view that we put out in this economic growth engine on how we kind of follow secular trends and leverage things like demand generation obviously, IoT, which we're very excited in terms of accelerating. We've been feeding a lot of new machines in the field and now how we're going to harvest all that packaged care and recurring service work that we can do because we're connecting machines. So there's multiple of places where we can find good growth that as you kind of add all these little buckets of growth kind of create a meaningful good growth momentum for us.OperatorAnd there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Reynal, I'll turn the call back over to you.Vicente ReynalYes. Thank you. I just would like to end by thanking and acknowledging again all of our employees for their hard work, being helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q2. We're counting on our team to continue to execute, we're counting that we know that IRX continues to be our differentiator. And IRX, as we said, is rooted in our unique ownership model. So again, thanks for listening to our call and appreciate it. Thank you.OperatorAnd this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.]"

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Sempra (NYSE:SRE). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Sempra with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for Sempra Sempra's Improving ProfitsEven when EPS earnings per share (EPS) growth is unexceptional, company value can be created if this rate is sustained each year. So EPS growth can certainly encourage an investor to take note of a stock. In impressive fashion, Sempra's EPS grew from US$3.55 to US$7.93, over the previous 12 months. Year on year growth of 123% is certainly a sight to behold.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Sempra maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 19% to US$17b. That's progress.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Sempra.Are Sempra Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Sempra has a market capitalisation of US$45b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. As a matter of fact, their holding is valued at US$14m. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. While their ownership only accounts for 0.03%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders.Story continuesIs Sempra Worth Keeping An Eye On?Sempra's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering Sempra for a spot on your watchlist. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Sempra   (of which 1 is a bit concerning!) you should know about.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, August 3, 2023, and it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff.Story continuesJeffrey Walker MartinThank you all for joining us today. Earlier this summer, Sempra celebrated its 25th anniversary. While the company was founded in 1998, our operational routes at San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and SoCalGas date back to the late 1800s. Over that time, we've embraced a strong commitment to serving others, delivering energy with purpose and bettering our communities. Today, we have 3 premium growth platforms located in what we believe are the most attractive markets in North America. And looking forward to the next 25 years, we're really excited about the opportunities in front of us to modernize and expand our energy network so that we can deliver increasingly clean, affordable and reliable energy to our customers. This year, we also published our 15th corporate sustainability report, emphasizing how our sustainable business practices help mitigate risk and unlock new opportunities as we continue executing on our record $40 billion 5-year capital plan, which, you'll recall, only includes Sempra's proportionate share of the capital. Today, Sempra has multiple tailwinds supporting our growth and income equity story, and we're confident in our ability to continue delivering high-quality earnings and dividend growth to our shareholders. That brings me back to the quarter. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $1.88 and year-to-date 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $4.80. As you'll recall, we discussed the company's 2023 and 2024 guidance on our first quarter call in May. And based on the strength of our results across the first half of the year, we're pleased to affirm both our 2023 and 2024 guidance ranges and our projected long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%. Also, just yesterday, Sempra's Board approved a 2-for-1 stock split with the distribution date on August 21. The split does not impact our reported results for the second quarter, but it's important to note that in the third quarter, our historical and future financial results will reflect the post-split share count. For the last several years, we've had one of the highest stock prices in the S&amp;P 500 Utility Index. So with the planned split, we believe it will increase our trading volume and provide more accessibility for a broader group of investors to join us on our mission to be North America's premier energy infrastructure company. Please turn to the next slide. When Sempra began its journey in 1998, we had a relatively modest rate base of roughly $5 billion. And across the last 2.5 decades, we've been successful in transforming the size and scale of Sempra's overall portfolio while also simplifying our business model. Today, we own $45 billion of rate base and over $80 billion of assets with an investment focus on what we believe is the higher-value, lower-risk portion of the energy value chain or transmission and distribution assets. I'd also note that Sempra's businesses are located in contiguous markets in the southwestern tier of North America and really benefit from strong economic growth across the region. Our strategy focuses on investing in regulated utilities that are decoupled from direct commodity exposure and long-term contracted energy infrastructure while avoiding the volatility associated with commodities and the uncertainties facing legacy generation facilities. In other words, our core value proposition focuses on investing in the transmission and distribution backbone of North America and helping to efficiently move energy from producers to customers. Finally, our T&amp;D utility investments benefit from constructive regulatory mechanisms with competitive returns on equity and the timely return of capital. Sempra Infrastructure's business is underpinned by long-term contracts with world-class counterparties that are expected to provide steady recurring cash flows. Taken together, our 3 platforms provide great visibility to high-quality, long-term earnings growth which is aligned with our overall mission to continue building out the premier energy infrastructure company in North America. Please turn to the next slide, where Trevor will walk you through both our business and financial results.Trevor Ian MihalikThanks, Jeff. As we close the first half of the year, we're pleased with our financial results, which highlight the strength of our business model. For background, Sempra was formed via the merger of the parent companies of SDG&amp;E and SoCalGas. And it's exciting to see how that foundation has allowed us to build a much larger and more successful company over time. Today, we have a leading position with $24 billion of rate base within our Sempra California platform and serve nearly 26 million consumers. As electrification continues to increase, we're seeing significant load growth. Since 2022, SDG&amp;E has experienced load growth of approximately 3%. This is the result of economic expansion and the trend of more business and consumer activity switching to electricity. For example, the Port of San Diego recently unveiled the arrival of 2 all-electric cranes, which are the first of their kind to be unveiled in North America. The port also approved an electrification project, enabling cruise ships to plug into the grid while at berth as opposed to running their diesel engines, thereby significantly reducing emissions. The Port of San Diego is also expecting to receive the first all-electric tugboat to support further emission reductions across their operations. As these trends continue, we see opportunities for increased investment in infrastructure to support continued decarbonization in the region. Another great example is the ongoing electrification of transportation. California is leading the nation in electric vehicles, and SDG&amp;E now has over 110,000 EVs in its service territory as of the first quarter, an increase of almost 35% compared to last year. At Sempra, our employees have also been leaders in promoting electrification. Back in 2015, we set an internal goal to have 500 employees using electric vehicles as a primary means of transportation. We're pleased to report that we have recently exceeded the 1,000-employee mark, making us one of the first companies in Southern California to reach this milestone. And as electrification and customer adoption increases, we expect this to drive increased load growth in our service territory. Further, with an increasingly complex grid, significant modernization is required to maintain safety and reliability. SDG&amp;E's recent commissioning of 171 megawatts of utility-owned energy storage assets is another great example of utilizing technology to store and dispatch clean energy while reducing reliance on conventional gas-fired power plants. To help ensure California can meet its reliability and clean energy goals, CAISO approved the 2022 to 2023 transmission plan in May, awarding SDG&amp;E an estimated $500 million of new development projects. Also, in June, CAISO initiated a comprehensive bidding process with over $2 billion of additional projects located within SDG&amp;E service territory. At Sempra, we're one of the largest owners and operators of transmission assets in North America, and we believe SDG&amp;E is well positioned to compete favorably. The company has a long track record of operating success here in Southern California, and we certainly believe our leadership and credibility in wildfire mitigation will also inform the quality and competitive nature of our bid. Also in June, SDG&amp;E announced that 80% of San Diego County customers are now receiving their electricity supplies from third-party providers. This is consistent with SDG&amp;E's strategy of focusing more narrowly on modernizing the grid to efficiently move cleaner sources of energy to customers or what we refer to as an energy delivery model, much like Oncor in Texas. Turning to SoCalGas. The company released an expanded Clean Fuels analysis, indicating the need to plan and account for increased levels of clean, firm, dispatchable generation. Results highlight the potential reliability benefits of electric resource diversity and the value of hydrogen generation. The report also contemplates how cleaner fuels can be delivered safely and affordably through SoCalGas' existing and potentially new energy networks to help support electrification and decarbonization. In connection with California's new Renewable Gas Procurement Standard, known as SB 1440, SoCalGas recently issued a new request for proposal for biomethane supply in the form of RNG and/or biosynthetic natural gas. At the end of 2022, RNG represented 5% of core gas deliveries at SoCalGas, and the mandated procurement through SB 1440 is expected to support the adoption of RNG in the state and, in turn, help SoCalGas meet its goal of 20% RNG in core customer deliveries by 2030. This is a prime example of how SoCalGas is using its existing energy network to help the state decarbonize in a safe and affordable manner. Finally, our California GRCs are well underway. Our application in those cases are centered around delivering cleaner energy safely and reliably and in alignment with California's decarbonization goals. Recently, SDG&amp;E and SoCalGas participated in evidentiary hearings with interveners and submitted updated testimony, and the regulatory process continues to advance in a constructive manner. The next key milestone is opening briefs, which are scheduled to be filed in mid-August. We continue to expect a proposed decision in the second quarter of 2024, with rates retroactive to the beginning of that year. Please turn to the next slide. Turning to Texas. I first want to acknowledge the excessive heat that customers are currently enduring across the state while also recognizing the strong performance of the grid under some of the challenging conditions. Oncor's innovative and dedicated employees are the driving force maintaining reliable electric service despite challenging external factors, and they go to work each day with this commitment to excellence. When we acquired just over 80% in Oncor 5 years ago, it had $11 billion of rate base, and Sempra made a regulatory commitment to support a minimum $7.4 billion 5-year capital plan. That same capital spend grew to be nearly $12 billion over that same period, and Oncor has nearly doubled its rate base to $21 billion as of the end of 2022. Over the past 5 years, Oncor's system has grown substantially, having added approximately 7,000 miles of transmission and distribution lines. Earlier this year, Oncor increased its 2023 to 2027 capital plan to $19 billion. With continued strong economic growth and the recent positive legislation, we now certainly anticipate upside when we roll forward the new 5-year capital plan. We have long talked about the incredible macroeconomic growth in Texas and how it continues to drive additional capital investments. To put Oncor's customer base into perspective, the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex alone has a larger population than 38 states. Since June of this year, ERCOT set 6 new records for peak demand. And it's also noteworthy that over the past 7 years, there has been a 17% increase in ERCOT's peak demand. Specifically for Oncor, both C&amp;I and residential customer demand continues to grow. A great example of this incremental C&amp;I demand is the roughly $60 billion of chip manufacturing facilities that have begun construction in the cities of Sherman and Taylor over the past 18 months. These large manufacturing sites are expected to drive demand and require the build-out of significant new electrical infrastructure in the surrounding communities. Finally, we also want to provide an update on a series of positive legislative outcomes that could add significant long-term value for Oncor and its customers by attracting additional capital to meet the state's growth and resiliency needs. Please turn to the next slide. Several bills were recently enacted in Texas, that are designed to provide enhanced recovery mechanisms for utilities and reduce regulatory lag. Together, these bills are expected to improve realized ROE and facilitate additional investment to support Texas' growth. We believe that the improved regulatory legislation, coupled with an incredible economic growth story, positions Oncor as one of the premier regulated T&amp;D utilities in the country. Starting with SB 1015, Oncor is now able to file a distribution capital tracker twice a year as opposed to only once. Similar to the existing regulatory mechanism for transmission investments, this should reduce regulatory lag and reflect Oncor's distribution investments in a more timely manner. This should improve both earnings and cash flows and is critical in markets like Texas, which is experiencing increased demand requiring rapid capital deployment. Moving to HB 2555. This bill is designed to allow utilities to file a plan to harden and make its transmission and distribution systems more resilient to potential disruptions. Of note, the bill provides a separate regulatory mechanism for recovery of commission-approved resiliency investments. The PUCT is currently drafting new rules to specify actual implementation, which we expect to be completed by the end of the year. The rulemaking will lay out the procedural steps and time lines between future filings and the actual rate implementation. SB 1076, the Permitting Efficiency Bill, helps address the transmission grids' expansion needs by shortening the time to approve CCN applications from 12 months to 6 months. Finally, HB 5066 directs ERCOT and the PUCT to develop plans for transmission projects to serve high-growth areas of Texas, including the electrification efforts in the Permian Basin, and could provide incremental investment opportunities for Oncor. Together, these constructive legislative outcomes enhance Oncor's ability to better serve customers and support system growth. Please turn to the next slide, where I will turn the call over to Justin to provide an update on Sempra Infrastructure and Port Arthur.Justin Christopher BirdThank you, Trevor. Sempra Infrastructure was formed 2 years ago to streamline our business and bring together decades of energy infrastructure development and operating expertise under a single platform. Our increased scale positions us to capture new opportunities, create portfolio synergies and support the growth of North American energy markets. There are 3 key trends that support these opportunities: decarbonization; energy security; and reshoring of manufacturing to North America, all of which give us confidence in the long-term growth profile of our business. Trade between the U.S. and Mexico continues to grow as a result of a strong reshoring trend. For example, a recent Reuters article identified more than $9 billion of capital that has flowed into Mexico from overseas manufacturers in the last 9 months. And recently, Mexico surpassed Canada to become the largest trading partner of the U.S. Given our position as a leading player in North American energy infrastructure, we are well positioned to support growing cross-border trade with Mexico. More recently, we received several positive regulatory approvals across a number of our assets in Mexico, including in our energy networks and clean power segments. Moving to projects under construction. Our teams have been busy with over 10 million accumulated hours worked without a lost-time incident. We expect these projects will come online over time, with GRO expansion and ECA targeting COD in the second half of 2024 and the summer of 2025, respectively. And finally, Port Arthur Phase 1 is also advancing as expected and continues to target commercial operations of Train 1 and Train 2 in '27 and 28, respectively. Turning to LNG development at Cameron Phase 2. We're at a stage in the competitive feed process where we have selected Bechtel to move forward to complete the remaining work. We are aligned with our partners to invest additional time upfront to reduce construction risks and project costs. We expect this process to continue through the fall, positioning us to take FID next year after satisfactorily finalizing the additional FEED work, securing project financing and any required regulatory approvals. The selection of Bechtel is a significant milestone and we're implementing a strategy similar to what we did at Port Arthur to reduce overall cost and risk to deliver another world-class LNG project. Also, we are pleased with the marketing and development at Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 and are particularly encouraged by recent comments made by the FERC Chairman in support of energy infrastructure projects needed for reliability. Looking ahead, we're also expecting that Sempra Infrastructure Partners will finalize its project-level ownership stake in Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 at 28%. This is within the previously shared target range of 20% to 30%, and we expect the transaction with KKR to close in the third quarter. Based on this updated ownership forecast for the project, Sempra Infrastructure Partners equity requirement is anticipated to be approximately $1.74 billion, and its proportionate share of EBITDA is estimated to be $460 million, which excludes certain upside economics such as Sempra Infrastructure's right to common facility payments from future phases. Please turn to the next slide. At Port Arthur, we're developing a flagship energy hub that showcases the value of Sempra Infrastructure's world-class integrated capabilities. Sempra Infrastructure can leverage development and operational expertise across its portfolio to enhance the total value of Port Arthur. With 13 million tonnes per annum already under construction, Phase 2 is expected to double that capacity. Further, we're leveraging the integrated capabilities of our business segments by developing the proposed Louisiana Connector pipeline, gas storage facilities, Titan Carbon Sequestration facility and an early-stage hydrogen project in the Port Arthur region. This comprehensive development approach supports the sustained growth of our energy infrastructure portfolio and is expected to help us capture a larger piece of the economics from the Port Arthur footprint. At Port Arthur Phase 1, construction is well underway, with more than 2.7 million hours worked without a lost-time incident. Many of you are likely aware that our recent FERC request, which would enable Bechtel to expand staffing and work schedules to include 24-hour shifts, this provides for better optimization of construction activities, focusing on safety and allows for certain tasks to be completed at night, such as material deliveries and next-day site preparation. We also believe it will improve workflows and streamline schedules, so it's a mutually beneficial situation from our perspective. With that, please turn to the next slide, where Trevor will discuss Sempra's financial results.Trevor Ian MihalikThanks, Justin. Turning to Sempra's financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of $603 million or $1.91 per share. This compares to second quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $559 million or $1.77 per share. On an adjusted basis, second quarter 2023 earnings were $594 million or $1.88 per share. This compares to our second quarter 2022 earnings of $626 million or $1.98 per share. Please turn to the next slide. The variance in the second quarter 2023 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized by the following. At Sempra California, $32 million of higher CPUC base operating margin at SDG&amp;E and higher amounts earned under certain CPUC regulatory incentive mechanisms and $14 million of higher CPUC net interest income earned on regulatory balances and higher tax benefits on flow-through items at SoCalGas, partially offset by net higher interest expense. At Sempra Texas, $26 million of lower equity earnings from higher expenses and lower weather-driven consumption, offset by new base rates and customer growth. At Sempra Infrastructure, $40 million of higher earnings attributable to NCI, including the 10% sale of a minority interest in Sempra Infrastructure Partners to ADIA and higher development expense. This was partially offset by $33 million of higher equity earnings, primarily from transportation tariffs, partially offset by lower asset optimization revenues, primarily from lower LNG diversion fees, and lower generation at TdM from a scheduled major maintenance. At Sempra Parent and Other, there were $45 million of higher costs, primarily driven by lower tax benefits and increased net interest expense, partially offset by net investment gains. Please turn to the next slide. Over the past 25 years, Sempra has transformed from a regional Southern California utility to a leading North American energy infrastructure company and is positioned at the intersection of multiple macroeconomic growth trends. Along each step of the way, we've exhibited strong financial stewardship, overseeing meaningful earnings growth and return significant capital to owners in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Looking ahead, we're focused on reaching a constructive outcome on our California rate cases, executing our record capital plan, demonstrating financial discipline and materially advancing critical infrastructure projects across our growth platforms. We've had a great start to the year that highlights our compelling growth story. And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now stop, open the line and take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperatorThank you. This concludes the prepared remarks. (Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.Shahriar PourrezaStarting off on your commentary for Oncor, and I know you obviously -- you've had some assumptions in plan, but the Texas legislation is clearly a material support. For Oncor, we just saw a peer of yours raise CapEx while also kind of highlighting additional opportunities. Can you just help us quantify how and when incremental benefits start getting embedded in plan? When we could start seeing some more of the CapEx benefits reflected, especially if you now have the ability to achieve allowed returns. So like could we further see updates as we approach your normal guidance update cycle later this year around Texas?Jeffrey Walker MartinYes. Thank you for the question. And I certainly agree with you. This has been a very constructive legislative cycle in Texas, and I would start at the very beginning by really expressing our appreciation to Allen and his team. They deserve a lot of credit. They had been doing an exceptional job on the ground there. They're clearly seeing a lot more growth on the system, Shar, and I'll have Allen speak to some of that growth in a second. But we would look forward to refreshing the Oncor plan this fall and providing future updates from Sempra's perspective in February. I do think you may find it helpful though, and I want to mention, as a rule of thumb, the DCRF legislation is expected to improve Oncor earnings in our estimation, around $70 million to $90 million on a full year basis, which falls within our current guidance. But as I mentioned, we'll be updating for 2025 on our February call. Also, it may be helpful that as a ballpark reference, every incremental $100 million of capital added to the plant in Texas is expected to add approximately $0.01 of accretion to Sempra on a pre-split basis. But Allen, it might be helpful to Shar, if you just provide a little bit of visibility into the growth that you're seeing on the system and your future expectations.E. Allen NyeYes, sure, Jeff. Growth continues to be just very, very strong, frankly, at record levels throughout our system and on all the metrics that we track. Just real quickly, premise growth is up about 10.5% quarter-over-quarter. We connected 21,000 approximately new premise in Q2 versus 19,000 same Q last year. Transmission points of interconnection, or POIs, are incredibly strong. We added 92 new requests in Q2 for a total amount now in our Q of $720 million, which is a 37% increase over the same quarter last year. Broken down by retail and generation, retail requests for transmission points of interconnection are up around 22%, and based -- versus the same quarter last year. Generation, incredibly strong, up 50% over the last 12 months, and the total number of generation requests has actually doubled since 2020. So really strong growth on our transmission system. West Texas remains very strong. The Far West Texas weather zone, peak increased by about 11.5% over the '22 peak. Peak on our Culberson transmission loop system out there, 21% year-over-year growth. And then just a couple more stats on things that aren't presently in the numbers. But our economic development team activities, new project requests were up 36% and request for information were up 32%. And all those things -- some of those things ultimately will work their way into the other numbers. So we're very pleased with the continued economic expansion in Texas. We're very pleased with the continued very strong growth we're seeing on our system. If you look back, as Trevor said, we had $11.5 billion -- $11.7 billion in 2017 when the Sempra transaction with Oncor was announced. By the end of '22, we had about $20.8 billion. We've already said we're doing about $3.6 billion in CapEx this year. Looking forward, we still have a $19 billion CapEx plan for the next 5 . We added $200 million in July. We got our Board to approve that. That is new capital that is not pulled forward. And then going into our October and first quarter Board meetings, we'll obviously do another CapEx plan refresh. As Trevor said, we think there's likely to be upside there if we continue to see the growth that we're seeing now as well as the addition of a resiliency plan under HB 2555. That's presently a PUC rulemaking right now. So as Trevor said, we effectively doubled the rate base from the time the Sempra transaction was announced already. Looking forward, we think it's possible we see a path to potentially doubling our rate base again in the next 5 to 6 years in a manner that really benefits our customers, results in a more resilient grid and benefits to the ERCOT market. All those things are obviously subject to the resiliency rulemaking, continuing to see strong growth in all the necessary Board actions. But Texas is -- has a great story, and we're very pleased to be a part of it, and I appreciate the question.Jeffrey Walker MartinSo Shar, I'll just make the kind of concluding comment here that we've guided to $70 million to $90 million of incremental earnings associated with the DCF legislation. We talked about the accretion associated with the $100 million of capital in Texas. And to highlight, I think, a couple of key things from Allen's comments. We've effectively doubled the rate base from 2017 to 2022. And I think Allen highlighted this, but there's more work to be done this fall with our planning team, but we have a real opportunity to more than double their rate base a second time in the next 5 to 6 years. So we've got some more planning work to be done. But we look forward to working with the Oncor Board and finalizing his roll-forward 5-year capital plan and certainly coming back and updating how we think about that from Sempra's perspective in February.Shahriar PourrezaGot it. Perfect. And lastly, Jeff, for me is, obviously, appreciate the stock split strategy to create some more liquidity. Obviously, the hope there is that it could eventually improve the valuation of the stock further. Are there sort of any other thoughts on strategy and optimization? I mean Mexico has shown some desire to renationalize some energy industries. So has there been any interest on the legacy assets, especially as fuel storage and terminals were considered kind of a security need? Or does the SIP ownership structure kind of prohibit for any capital rotation decisions?Jeffrey Walker MartinYes. Thank you, Shar. I'll kind of address both of those questions. I think the thought process behind the stock split is that we currently have the highest stock price in the S&amp;P 500 Utility Index as we celebrate our 25th anniversary, this is the first time that we've announced a stock split for the company. We certainly, to your point, think it will improve trading volumes and make the stock more accessible to a broader group of investors. So we view it just generally as a positive. And I think it really reflects management's bullish view on our future business prospects. Turning to your issue of strategy, and I'll come back to Mexico. Our Board reviews our strategy at every Board meeting. It's been a top focus of our management team for the last 5 years. And it's allowed us to simplify our business model, improve our visibility to future growth. When you think about the updates that Allen just provided and some of the things from our prepared remarks, we feel great about our growth and income story. And we have more work to do, as I indicated, with Allen's team to continue to think about the growth prospects in his business. Turning to Mexico. This kind of goes to the issue of what our prioritization is. And Justin mentioned this in his prepared remarks, but by combining Mexico with LNG, we created a business of larger scale with what are effectively midstream assets, with approximately 17 to 18 years' tenure in that overall contract portfolio. So it's a really high-quality portfolio of cash flows. But as we look to finance our future, there's no question that we're going to continue to prioritize the growth in our utilities. We've demonstrated a willingness to sell down in the capital structure to SI. And I think we've done that quite efficiently in the past 2 years. And opportunities like you identified and continue to capital recycle, that's right in our wheelhouse. So we'll continue to look for assets. They are less core to our future strategy. And that will always be something that we'll take a hard look at with Trevor and his team. So we feel good about our strategy going forward, and we appreciate the question.OperatorOur next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI.Durgesh ChopraJust maybe just looking at your year-to-date performance, just wanted to get your thoughts of that's tracking versus your expectations? I mean the EPS guidance range is still pretty wide. But clearly, you've exceeded my expectations, and I believe, Street estimates. So just how is the year shaping up versus your guidance range?Jeffrey Walker MartinSure. Appreciate the question. You'll recall that in 2022, we really had a banner year. We reported around $9.21 of adjusted EPS. And reporting $4.80 for this year, we think, is a very strong number. So we think we've had a strong first half, a good first quarter. We feel great about our guidance. Honestly, one of the things that we're focused on as a management team in Kevin's business is making sure that we execute very well around our rate cases here in the State of California. And we mentioned on the call that we expect to finalize that in the middle of next summer, with rates retroactive to January 1. So I think we feel very good about where we're at this year. I think it also signals strength to our guidance for next year.Durgesh ChopraGot it. Very strongly positioned, it sounds like. Okay. Then maybe just turning to California, and you mentioned the rate cases. But the CAISO opportunity, $500 million, is that incremental? Or is that embedded in the current CapEx plan? And then you also highlighted $2 billion worth of projects, which are going to be competitively bid on. Maybe just talk to us as to how we see that embedded into your CapEx plans, just the time line and next steps there.Jeffrey Walker MartinSure. I appreciate that question. We actually think, very similar to Texas, there's a very strong underlying growth story in California. We highlighted in our prepared remarks, but SDG&amp;E has seen year-over-year demand growth of about 3%. I've been at the company since 2004. We've never seen that type of growth. And it really is a reflection of the electrification that's taken place in the state. On your issue of whether the $500 million of incremental transmission projects are in our 5-year plan. Just remember, our current plan goes through 2027. We're going to roll that plan forward next February. This is really the CAISO's efforts to lock in the needed transmission, the need for the next 10 years. So most of these projects will be outside of our current 5-year plan and be picked up in future periods. But I thought, Kevin, it might be helpful to give your perspective on the transmission opportunities here in the state and specifically the larger numbers that Durgesh just spoke to.Kevin Cristopher SagaraThanks, Durgesh. Stepping back for a second, as Jeff's talking about it, clearly, the grids all across the country need significant upgrades as we move towards more electrification. In California, we've estimated that electric demand will more than double by 2045, with commensurate investments in grids. And as you mentioned, we're seeing that kind of load growth in San Diego already with a lot of adoption around electric vehicles. So we're really excited about this recent announcement for the CAISO to add $7 billion. This is just like an incremental $7 billion of transmission opportunities. And as Trevor mentioned, $0.5 billion has already been directly awarded to SDG&amp;E, and we're going to bid on those $2 billion to $3 billion of other projects. And I'd note that across the Sempra family of companies, we're one of the largest owners and operators of high-voltage electric transmission in the country and really well positioned to be successful here in California as California continues this path of aggressive, aggressive investments to enhance and facilitate electrification.Durgesh ChopraGot it. Just a quick follow-up. Is there a time line on that? The $2 billion worth of projects that you mentioned, over what time frame is that going to be awarded?Kevin Cristopher SagaraWell, it's going to be -- I think there's going to be a short list close to winter in December and then with something awarded early next year. So I think more to follow here, but there's a process that CAISO is going to follow. And like I said, I'm pretty optimistic, and we're going to be very competitive.OperatorOur next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithAll right. If I can focus first on the LNG side, if you don't mind. I just wanted to understand a little bit of the push out in the time line on the Cameron side. Clearly, this has been, in some senses, articulated previously. But as you think about getting clarity on time line today on when to move forward, are you kind of waiting for inflation to moderate? Are you waiting for certain milestones to be achieved here with your new partner, with Bechtel? Or are there other considerations? Just to kind of understand the shift to '24 now, but also the input parameters to narrow that in a little bit more precise.Jeffrey Walker MartinSure. I'll make a few comments. I'll pass it to Justin maybe to provide a larger overview of his LNG development program. But I would just start by saying, Julien, the best way to think about it is we were on a call very similar to this in August of last year where we were talking about the potential for Port Arthur Phase 1 to leapfrog Cameron. And we were not, at that time, prepared to make an FID estimate for Port Arthur, but we felt good about the progress. We're probably in a similar position today. We've got more work to be done on both of our brownfield projects, Cameron expansion as well as Port Arthur 2, but we're making significant progress. We're very excited to have selected Bechtel. Bechtel is doing a wonderful job, and he's been on site at Port Arthur for probably close to 5 years at this point. So I think that's a big step forward for us to have Bechtel in-house working with us on finalizing cost and design work. And Justin, maybe you could do 2 things, update us on the overall LNG portfolio for Julien's benefit and maybe provide additional details about how you're thinking about timing.Justin Christopher BirdGreat. Well, thank you, Julien. Let me take a step back, as Jeff mentioned, again, our core strategy is to build an LNG infrastructure business. And that would be a business that offers customers LNG volumes from both the Pacific and Gulf Coast. And as you think about where we are to date, Cameron Phase 1 is producing in excess of 100% of its expected volumes. ECA Phase 1 and Port Arthur Phase 1 are under construction, and both are proceeding safely and on schedule. And as you look at our LNG development projects, look, we're very excited about the opportunity set in front of us. At Cameron Phase 2, as Jeff mentioned, the selection of Bechtel is a major milestone. And what we're doing with Bechtel is similar to what we did at Port Arthur. We, and our Cameron partners, will continue to conduct value engineering work through the fall as we finalize the EPC arrangements. And again, you have to remember that the goal is to optimize the design so we can optimize the overall cost structure and timing of COD. These efforts should position us for an FID next year, subject to definitive commercial arrangements and any needed regulatory extensions. So as you think about that timing, we're going to press forward on the EPC arrangements. And we -- I guess I would echo what Jeff said, we were in this position last year on Port Arthur 1, and we'll try to do the same thing. Looking at Port Arthur Phase 2, very optimistic. We continue to advance commercial discussions with potential customers. Importantly, many of whom are also interested in project equity. And at the same time, we're advancing engineering construction with Bechtel, regulatory and financing. Julien, as I kind of think about the business and where we are today, I think the key takeaway is we have made significant progress on our LNG strategy and are very bullish on both Port Arthur Phase 2 and Cameron Phase 2 moving forward next year.Jeffrey Walker MartinAnd then I would just conclude, Julien, by saying that we're going to finalize costs around Cameron expansion. We're going to complete the commercial arrangements and continue to progress our permits and look to take FID next year on Cameron. The most important thing I'd always remind folks is, it's never really a race. It's about putting all the risk in a box and optimizing the project to produce the best returns for our investors. And we've demonstrated the ability to do that. And we've got a great team on it. So we feel good about our progress on both Port Arthur Phase 2 and Cameron expansion.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithGot it. And just in light of those last comments, if you don't mind elaborating, Jeff, you used the term leapfrogging. I heard you the last time talking about it. I'm hearing you this time talking about it. So you feel pretty good about getting -- just the time line here, you're closer than not on announcing incremental commercial terms here, if you will, as just on PA2. And then also the inflationary dynamics. Do you feel confident about the terms there to derisk that project, the second phase as well?Jeffrey Walker MartinNo, I would just clarify that I was reminding ourselves that when we had this call last year, there was still a fair amount of uncertainty around both projects, and we indicated there might be an opportunity for Port Arthur Phase 1 to leapfrog forward. What I'm really referring to is, even though there seems like there's a little bit of uncertainty around both of these brownfield projects, I can assure you that both of them are progressing in advance of what we've said publicly. So we feel very good about both of them going forward, just like we were able to mature Port Arthur Phase 1. We're going to work diligently on Cameron expansion and Port Arthur Phase 2 with the hope of doing the same thing on both of those projects.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithRight. And you said still anticipated to sell down the equity potentially in future expansion. Just considering the backdrop of LNG transactions of late, I figured you just clarify that last comment, too.Jeffrey Walker MartinNo. I mean this goes back to kind of how we tend to finance things. I mean, obviously, as we've talked about before several times, Julien, we're going to maximize our operating cash flows. We've got a lot of flexibility in our overall capital structure to finance things. But you see us at a 50% ownership level in Cameron today. You've seen us now at a 28% ownership position for Sempra Infrastructure Partners in Port Arthur Phase 1. But one of the unique things is we have the opportunity to optimize the capital structure so that we really improve the returns for our shareholders. So certainly, I think that's a pattern or practice you would expect us to continue.OperatorOur next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Securities.Jeremy Bryan TonetJust want to pick up after what Julien was putting down there with regards to Port Arthur 2. More specifically, on the FERC and the lack of the boat there for the expansion, any current sense on timing on your end? And do you see this kind of impacting commercial discussion?Jeffrey Walker MartinNo, we don't. We do think it's important for that FERC certificate to be issued. We certainly think that will be issued in the next month or 2. So we remain optimistic about that.Jeremy Bryan TonetGot it. That's helpful there. And then maybe drawing a bit more of a fine point, as a follow-up, we've seen Cove Point transacted at a much lower multiple than it did in 2019. And just wondering if this is a sign of value of the LNG space changing? Or just any thoughts on the value of that transaction?Jeffrey Walker MartinLook, I think at Cove Point, what you saw take place was the transaction from minority interest. It was not a transaction related to a controlling interest. I think the thing I would fall back on, Jeremy, is when you look at what's taking place in the LNG marketplace today, in the world, has a global capacity of just below 400 million tonnes per annum. That marketplace will grow by more than 50% by the end of the decade and likely double by the middle of the century. So the way we think about it is there is a need today for more LNG. That need will grow as countries around the world look for natural gas to balance out their commitment to cleaner fuels like renewables. We think the United States continues to have a competitive advantage, and we'll take market share. We are the world leader today in 2023. And when you think about the competitive price of natural gas in the United States, you think about the depth of our capital markets and the constructive regulation. This is less about Cove Point or NextDecade or Sempra. This is about the United States taking a leadership position in the world. We think this business will continue to get much bigger. It's grown at about an 8% CAGR from '17 to 2021, and we continue to expect to see strong growth in LNG marketplace. And I think Sempra is well positioned as any company in North America to be a big part of it.Jeremy Bryan TonetGot it. That's very helpful there. And wondering if there's any more commentary you're able to provide as far as commercial discussions or concerns between Asian versus European buyers or portfolio buyers otherwise? Just trying to get a flavor for kind of how that is progressing at this point?Jeffrey Walker MartinWe're having commercial negotiations on Port Arthur Phase 2 as well as on some of the offtake arrangements around Cameron expansion. Many of the same type of customers you would expect in Europe and in Asia are part of those conversations. It is a very vibrant market today, and there's lots of conversations taking place by our marketing team. So we remain optimistic about future announcements in that area.Jeremy Bryan TonetGot it. Real quick last one, if I could. Just wondering if you could provide more details on this latest Port Arthur CCS announcement. Is this project just CCS for Arthur and in Sempra? Or I guess, how -- what's the addressable market that you're targeting there?Jeffrey Walker MartinYes. I would say that we've named this project Titan. It's some recent port space that we've been able to acquire. It is a very competitive process in Louisiana and Texas to have these types of facilities. And Titan has been dedicated to serve the needs of Port Arthur Phase 1 and future phases at Port Arthur. We also expect that it will serve other third-party interest in the region.OperatorOur next question comes from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs.Carly S. DavenportJust wanted to go back to Texas very quickly. You had mentioned the Resiliency Bill. Could you just give us some details from a timing perspective in terms of when you're able to file for that? And kind of how long the approval process is expected to take until you can begin to recover investments under it?Jeffrey Walker MartinSure. It's a really good question. And I will tell you, it is a very, very important development in Texas. We think it will be something that we will participate in once the rulemaking is set. But Allen, perhaps you could talk about the bill itself, when you think the rulemaking will be over and when you expect you'll put your first 3-year filing in front of the Commission.E. Allen NyeYes. You bet, Jeff. Let me -- I'll just run you through kind of the time line that we're seeing for HB 2555, the Resiliency Bill. The bill became effective June 13 of this year. It required a rulemaking to be completed within 180 days. So the statutory deadline for the rule is December 10 of this year, subject to whatever comes out of that rulemaking. Presumably, utilities like us would be free to file thereafter. The plans that are filed with the Commission by law are required to be approved, modified or rejected within 180 days. So with respect to us, we're hoping to file a plan in Q1 of 2024 and seek to have that plan approved in the second half of '24. That's what we know for now.Carly S. DavenportGreat. That's really helpful. And then just to think about the -- maybe shifting to California, just you mentioned the general rate cases kind of going on there. Can you just talk about kind of how that process has (inaudible) so far, if there's initial [expectation], and if there's anything that surprised you so far?Jeffrey Walker MartinSure. I'll make a couple of comments, and I'll pass it to Kevin if he wants to add anything. But the GRC hearings concluded in July and opening briefs will be filed in the middle of this month, with the proposed decisions I indicated in the second quarter of 2024. I think the most important thing, Carly, is the state is very focused on safety, reliability and decarbonization, and that's exactly how we lined up our rate cases. So remember, we had the first ramp rate case back in 2019. This is also a ramp format that we're following, and it's really closely aligned with what we think are the public policy positions of the state. So I think we're in good shape. Kevin, would you like to add anything else about how this unfolds?Kevin Cristopher SagaraI mean just process-wise, Carly, I just would mention that we also just updated our filings for inputs from inflation factors, labor rates, medical insurance costs and the like. So we just updated them. We're going to have a refile this fall and look forward for a PD in the first part of -- mid-next year, first part of the year.OperatorOur next question will come from Nicholas Campanella from Barclays.Nicholas Joseph CampanellaI'll keep it short. So I guess, Port Arthur, good to see you finalize 28% here. Just what's causing you to fall higher in the range that you kind of gave to us? And then when we think about the puts and takes around the funding plan and what was outlined in the first quarter call, now that you've kind of solidified this 28%, should we still think about no kind of external equity financing at the holdco?Jeffrey Walker MartinSure. I would just say that we had originally targeted between 20% and 30% ownership. Obviously, our goal is to own as much of the project as we can. So we are very pleased to guide up to the 28% range. Previously, on calls, we had talked about notionally just giving out information at the 25% level. But our goal all along was to make sure that we could land as high in the range as possible. I think we're well set on financing. I'll pass it over to Faisel Khan, who's the CFO of Sempra Infrastructure, and maybe you can just update us on how he expects the Denali capital process to go forward and your funding for Port Arthur Phase 1.Faisel Hussain KhanYes. Thanks, Jeff. So as is always talked about, we have this sort of flexible capital structure. So first, with our project financing at Port Arthur, sort of well underway. That's roughly $7 billion in capital for the project. Then of course, we have our partners, ConocoPhillips and now KKR as equity partners as well. And then we also have moving up the capital structure, you get into Sempra Infrastructure Partners, where you have ADIA and KKR as well. So again, plenty of capital to be drawn on from all of our partners sort of having that capital -- flexible capital structure in place enables us to sort of maximize returns for the project up to Sempra.Nicholas Joseph CampanellaGot it. And then I know everyone is very focused on Train 4 for Cameron. But can you just give us a sense of how debottlenecking for 1 through 3 is progressing? And whether you remain on track to increase that capacity before Train 4?Jeffrey Walker MartinSure. Justin, you can take that.Justin Christopher BirdYes. Yes, Nick, we're still doing some of that engineering work. I'd say it's very positive. And as -- just as you recall, the debottlenecking won't be binary. So what we'll likely do, as we continue to take trains down for routine maintenance, we will do the debottlenecking activities during those trains, and we'll expect to see additional volumes. So again, debottlenecking is moving forward very positively.OperatorAnd our next question will come from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe.Steven Isaac FleishmanI just wanted to circle back to the -- back to Oncor and some of the things you mentioned, that $70 million, $90 million on DCRF and the kind of sensitivity on investment. So when would you see this benefit of DCRF? Would that be pretty much in place for 2024? Or -- yes.Jeffrey Walker MartinYes, it's a good question. We expect to make our second DCRF filing for this year in September. And the pickup for DCRF, which might be a little bit this year, will primarily be in 2024. So it will be a full run rate benefit in 2024, Steve.Steven Isaac FleishmanOkay. But you said it falls within your guidance because your guidance range is pretty wide, I guess.Jeffrey Walker MartinThat's correct. But we'll also -- we also review that with our Board in the ordinary course as part of our fall financing exercise. And you'll recall, we'll also be updating and issuing our 2025 guidance on the February call.Steven Isaac FleishmanOkay. And tied in with that, just on the capital at Oncor, which you said you'll update in the fall. The -- I mean will that include -- are you going to just update kind of normal course there? Or will that include this reliability aspect as well, which won't have been fully finalized by them? Or would that maybe come later on?Jeffrey Walker MartinYes. I think this goes back to Carly's question. We're going to do our normal roll-forward 5-year planning process, led by Don Clevenger at Oncor. the Oncor Board will be deeply involved with that as well the ownership both of TTI and Sempra. We obviously have seen the capital plan grow from $15 billion to $19 billion just year-over-year, and we certainly think it's going to obviously grow again, as we've already indicated. The key issue for you on this new rulemaking, which Allen indicated, the rulemaking, Steve, will not be finalized until, at the earliest, December 10 of this year. And Allen will be coming back to the Board with an add-on related to resiliency. So the work that we're doing that will be finalized in the fall is the normal roll-forward 5-year capital plan. But once we have the rulemaking in place, Allen and his team will hustle to put together the appropriate analysis for the Oncor Board, and that will lead to the filing that we made with the Commission. And I think, as Allen indicated, we expect to have feedback from the Commission in the second half of the year. Allen, do you want add to that?E. Allen NyeNo, Jeff. I think that's exactly right.OperatorThat concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Jeff Martin for any additional closing remarks.Jeffrey Walker MartinLook, as we close out today's call, I wanted to note that we're pleased with our financial results, both for the quarter and for the first half of the year. I certainly believe we continue to make great progress on our LNG story, and we're making progress at Phase 2 at both Cameron and Port Arthur and are also pleased to guide to the higher ownership percentage of 28% at Port Arthur Phase 1. And as you can tell from today's call, Texas continues to be one of the leading growth stories in the country. And the improved regulatory compact there is a very strong signal, in my opinion, for continued investment. And finally, as we celebrate our 25th anniversary, we're pleased to announce our 2-for-1 stock split. We appreciate everyone making time to join us this morning. We have several IR events this month in Wisconsin and Las Vegas and hope to see many of you there. This concludes our call, and feel free to follow up with our IR team. Thank you.OperatorThank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

A drop in electric fuel and purchased power costs also lifted profit.Sempra has identified liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a growth area and is progressing several new plants, including the Costa Azul LNG export plant in Mexico and another in Texas. First shipments from Mexico could come in 2025.""Port Arthur Phase 1 is also advancing as expected and continues to target commercial operations of Train 1 and Train 2 in '27 and 28, respectively,"" Sempra LNG CEO Justin Bird said on an earnings call.Its Cameron LNG Phase 2 and Port Arthur LNG phase 2 have yet to get a financial go-ahead, the company said.Sempra Infrastructure Partners expects to finalize its ownership stake in Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 at 28%, with an equity requirement at approximately $1.74 billion, Bird said.Sempra also affirmed its full-year adjusted profit between $8.60 and $9.20 and announced a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend, with a distribution date of August 21.The stock split decision was driven by the firm's high stock price compared to other utilities in the S&amp;P 500 and would improve trading volumes, Sempra Chairman Jeffrey Martin said.Shares of the company fell 2.4% on Thursday to close at $143.31.

This compares to earnings of $1.98 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 9.30%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this natural gas and electricity provider would post earnings of $2.76 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.92, delivering a surprise of 5.80%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Sempra , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Gas Distribution industry, posted revenues of $3.34 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.37%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.55 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Sempra shares have lost about 5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 17.6%.What's Next for Sempra?While Sempra has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Sempra: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.97 on $3.87 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $8.93 on $18.12 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Utility - Gas Distribution is currently in the top 27% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the broader Zacks Utilities sector, Consolidated Water (CWCO), has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023.This developer and operator of desalination plants is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.22 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +22.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.9% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.Consolidated Water's revenues are expected to be $30.27 million, up 43.6% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""Identified items"" include adjustments for lower of cost or market (""LCM""), impairments and refinery exit costs.  LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE: LYB) today announced net income for the second quarter 2023 of $715 million, or $2.18 per diluted share. During the quarter, the company recognized identified items of $86 million, net of tax. These items, which impacted second quarter earnings by $0.26 per share, were related to costs incurred from plans to exit the refining business. Second quarter 2023 EBITDA was $1.4 billion, or $1.5 billion excluding identified items.Story continuesGlobal olefins and polyolefins margins improved modestly during the second quarter driven by lower feedstock costs in both the U.S. and Europe. New capacity from the start of LyondellBasell's propylene oxide and oxyfuels plant in Texas was largely offset by planned maintenance at the company's existing assets. Oxyfuels margins remained strong, supported by low butane costs and robust demand for fuels. Refining margins declined from first quarter 2023 highs but remained above long-term averages.LyondellBasell generated $1.3 billion in cash from operating activities in the second quarter and achieved 103% cash conversion(b) over the past twelve months. Available liquidity was $6.6 billion at the end of the quarter. The company remains committed to a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Approximately $300 million was reinvested in the business and $508 million was returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the second quarter, LyondellBasell issued its inaugural green bond for $500 million to support investments advancing the company's strategy for leadership in sustainability.LyondellBasell moved forward on the new strategy revealed at its Capital Markets Day in March. The company's Value Enhancement Program is progressing ahead of schedule. As a result, the program's near-term target was increased by approximately 30% and is now expected to deliver $150 million of net income(c) and $200 million of recurring annual EBITDA(c) by year end 2023. In May, LyondellBasell announced the decision to extend refining operations to no later than the end of the first quarter of 2025, as the company develops options to redeploy the site's workforce and assets in support of the company's sustainable growth strategy. LyondellBasell announced additional acquisitions and partnerships during the quarter toward building a profitable and leading Circular &amp; Low Carbon Solutions business. In June, MSCI recognized the company's progress and upgraded LyondellBasell's ESG rating to 'AA', placing the company within the top 10% of companies in the sector.""Our new strategy is driving focus and purpose across the company. LyondellBasell's employees are enthusiastically implementing our new strategy. We are committed to becoming the leader in fulfilling the rapidly increasing demand for sustainable solutions from our customers and society,"" said Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell Chief Executive Officer.OUTLOOKIn the third quarter, the company expects typical benefits from summer seasonality to be more than offset by soft demand due to ongoing economic uncertainty. Stagnant demand, volatile feedstock costs and new capacity in North America and China are challenging petrochemical margins. Summer demand for transportation fuels continues to support attractive oxyfuels and refining margins. During the third quarter, LyondellBasell expects average operating rates of 85% for North American olefins and polyolefins (O&amp;P) assets and 75% for European O&amp;P as well as Intermediates &amp; Derivatives assets in line with global market demand. The company believes current market conditions will persist amidst challenging economic conditions and a slower than expected recovery in China.""LyondellBasell is steadfast in our resolve to advance on the three pillars of our long-term strategy despite near-term macro challenges. Our rapid progress is laying the necessary groundwork to extend our leadership in Circular &amp; Low Carbon Solutions. I am pleased to see our Value Enhancement Program being embraced by our entire organization and driving sustainable value for our shareholders,"" said Vanacker.(b)  Cash conversion is net cash provided by operating activities divided by EBITDA excluding LCM and impairment.(c)  Estimated based on 2017-2019 mid-cycle margins and modest inflation relative to a 2021 baseline.CONFERENCE CALLLyondellBasell will host a conference call August 4 at 11 a.m. ET.

Actual results could differ materially based on factors including, but not limited to, market conditions, the business cyclicality of the chemical, polymers and refining industries; the availability, cost and price volatility of raw materials and utilities, particularly the cost of oil, natural gas, and associated natural gas liquids; our ability to successfully implement initiatives identified pursuant to our Value Enhancement Program and generate anticipated earnings; competitive product and pricing pressures; labor conditions; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; operating interruptions (including leaks, explosions, fires, weather-related incidents, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, supplier disruptions, labor shortages, strikes, work stoppages or other labor difficulties, transportation interruptions, spills and releases and other environmental risks); the supply/demand balances for our and our joint ventures' products, and the related effects of industry production capacities and operating rates; our ability to manage costs; future financial and operating results; benefits and synergies of any proposed transactions and our ability to align our assets with our core; legal and environmental proceedings; tax rulings, consequences or proceedings; technological developments, and our ability to develop new products and process technologies; our ability to meet our sustainability goals, including the ability to operate safely, increase production of recycled and renewable-based polymers to meet our targets and forecasts, and reduce our emissions and achieve net zero emissions by the time set in our goals; our ability to procure energy from renewable sources; our ability to build a profitable Circular &amp; Low Carbon Solutions business; the continued operation of and successful shut down and closure of the Houston Refinery, including within the expected timeframe; potential governmental regulatory actions; political unrest and terrorist acts; risks and uncertainties posed by international operations, including foreign currency fluctuations; and our ability to comply with debt covenants and to repay our debt.Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in the ""Risk Factors"" section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which can be found at www.LyondellBasell.com on the Investor Relations page and on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at www.sec.gov. There is no assurance that any of the actions, events or results of the forward-looking statements will occur, or if any of them do, what impact they will have on our results of operations or financial condition. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made and are based on the estimates and opinions of management of LyondellBasell at the time the statements are made.LyondellBasell does not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements should circumstances or management's estimates or opinions change, except as required by law.This release contains time sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date hereof. Information contained in this release is unaudited and is subject to change.We undertake no obligation to update the information presented herein except as required by law.INFORMATION RELATED TO FINANCIAL MEASURESThis release makes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.We report our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, but believe that certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA, and EBITDA, net income and diluted EPS exclusive of identified items provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of the company's ongoing operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.We calculate EBITDA as income from continuing operations plus interest expense (net), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to profit or operating profit for any period as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to operating cash flows as a measure of our liquidity. We also present EBITDA, net income and diluted EPS exclusive of identified items. Identified items include adjustments for ""lower of cost or market"" (""LCM""), impairment and refinery exit costs. Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") inventory valuation methodology, which means that the most recently incurred costs are charged to cost of sales and inventories are valued at the earliest acquisition costs. Fluctuation in the prices of crude oil, natural gas and correlated products from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent interim periods, within the same fiscal year as the charge, as market prices recover. Property, plant and equipment are recorded at historical costs. If it is determined that an asset or asset group's undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized to write the asset down to its estimated fair value. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill is below its carrying amount. If it is determined that the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized. In April 2022 we announced our decision to cease operation of our Houston Refinery. In connection with exiting the refinery business, we began to incur costs primarily consisting of accelerated lease amortization costs, personnel related costs, accretion of asset retirement obligations and depreciation of asset retirement costs.Recurring annual EBITDA for the Value Enhancement Program is estimated based on 2017-2019 mid-cycle margins and modest inflation relative to a 2021 baseline.Cash conversion is a measure commonly used by investors to evaluate liquidity. For purposes of this presentation, cash conversion equals net cash provided by operating activities divided by EBITDA excluding LCM and impairment.These non-GAAP financial measures as presented herein, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way the measures are calculated. In addition, we include calculations for certain other financial measures to facilitate understanding.  This release contains time sensitive information that is accurate only as of the time hereof.

LYB is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 earnings before the opening bell on Aug 4.The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters while missed once, the average earnings surprise being roughly 7%. It delivered an earnings surprise of 38.9% in the last reported quarter. LYB's second-quarter results are likely to reflect improved demand conditions and lower feedstock and energy costs.The stock has gained 12.7% in the past year compared with the industry’s rise of 12.9%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $10,396 million, which suggests a decline of 29.9% from the year-ago reported figure.Our estimate for the Olefins and Polyolefins – Americas division’s revenues is currently pegged at $2,845.4 million, implying a decline of 32.9% year over year.The same for the Olefins and Polyolefins – Europe, Asia &amp; International division’s revenues currently stands at $2,451.6 million, indicating a decline of 37.1% from the year-ago reported figure.Our estimate for revenues of LYB’s Advanced Polymer Solutions segment for the second quarter is $833.6 million, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 25.3%.We also expect revenues for the Intermediaries and Derivatives segment to be $2,513.4 million, which implies a 33.3% decline from the prior year’s levels.Our estimate for the Refining segment's revenue is $2,254.6 million, suggesting a decline of 40.5%. The same for the Technology segment stands at $143.4 million, which indicates a 26.1% fall from the year-ago reported figure.A Few Factors to NoteLYB’s second-quarter performance is likely to have been aided by higher demand and moderate feedstock and energy costs. The Olefins and Polyolefins – Americas unit is likely to have benefited from improved demand in the quarter on higher seasonal demand and lower input costs. Improved consumer demand and better operating rates are also likely to have supported the Olefins and Polyolefins – Europe, Asia &amp; International division’s performance in the June quarter.Moreover, the Advanced Polymer Solutions unit is expected to have witnessed continued improvement in demand. In Intermediaries and Derivatives, oxyfuel margins are expected to have remained strong on healthy demand for gasoline in the second quarter. However, weaker demand for durable goods is expected to continue to have hurt propylene oxide margins. The company’s Technology segment is likely to have been aided by improved levels of revenues from licensing and catalyst volumes.Story continuesLyondellBasell Industries N.V.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. Check out our latest analysis for Vulcan Materials How Quickly Is Vulcan Materials Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. We can see that in the last three years Vulcan Materials grew its EPS by 5.0% per year. This may not be setting the world alight, but it does show that EPS is on the upwards trend.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Vulcan Materials maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 15% to US$7.6b. That's progress.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Vulcan Materials' forecast profits?Are Vulcan Materials Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Vulcan Materials has a market capitalisation of US$30b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Given insiders own a significant chunk of shares, currently valued at US$60m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.Story continuesIt's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Vulcan Materials, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$12m.The Vulcan Materials CEO received US$10m in compensation for the year ending December 2022. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Should You Add Vulcan Materials To Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, Vulcan Materials is a growing business, which is encouraging. The growth of EPS may be the eye-catching headline for Vulcan Materials, but there's more to bring joy for shareholders. With a meaningful level of insider ownership, and reasonable CEO pay, a reasonable mind might conclude that this is one stock worth watching. Don't forget that there may still be risks.

Our results through the first half of 2023 highlight both the attractive fundamentals of our aggregates-led business and Vulcan's commitment to compounding profitability through our solid execution of our Vulcan web selling and both with operating strategic disciplines. I'm proud of our teams for delivering yet another quarter of improvement in our trailing 12-month aggregates cash gross profit per ton. That marks 20 of the last 22 quarters. This exceptional execution, coupled with better-than-expected demand environment gives us confidence in our ability to deliver between $1.9 billion and $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA this year. In the quarter, we generated $595 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is a 32% improvement over the prior year. Gross margin expanded by 480 basis points, and importantly, each product line delivered year-over-year improvement. In the Aggregates segment, gross margin improved by 290 basis points. Cash gross profit per ton improved by 22% with healthy year-over-year price improvement and moderating year-over-year cost increases. Shipments declined a modest 1% in the quarter, but were varied across markets. On one hand, we saw a solid growth in our key southeastern markets, where we have the most attractive Aggregates footprint. And we were pleased with the rebound of sales in California after a very wet first quarter. On the other hand, weather continued to be a challenge in Texas. And remember, softer residential activity wait on most markets. All geographies benefited from the continued strong underlying price environment. Our mix adjusted sales price improved 15% in the quarter. Attractive price growth should continue to drive improvement in our unit profitability as we progress through the back half of this year and into next year. In Asphalt, cash gross profit nearly tripled from the prior year to $66 million, and cash unit profitability improved over $10 a ton. Volume growth of 16%, price improvement of 9% and lower liquid asphalt costs all contribute to the stable results. Gross margin improved almost 1,200 basis points. Concrete cash unit profitability improved by 24% in the quarter, and this is despite lower volumes that were impacted by the slowdown in residential construction activity. Prior year Concrete segment benefited for the contribution of the now divested New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania Concrete operations. Now starting with residential. Let me provide a few thoughts about each end market. To date, the impact of the slowdown in residential activity has not been as significant as most of us initially feared. Recent permits and starts were showing that some areas have reached the bottom, and the cinema among homebuilders is much improved. These trends along with the solid underlying fundamentals for residential demand growth such as low inventories, favorable demographic trends and employment growth in our market suggests that single-family demand will bottom in the second half of this year and be -- and then start recovering thereafter. In the private nonresidential construction segment, starts remained at healthy levels, with particular strength in large manufacturing and industrial projects. Our strong Southeastern footprint and logistics innovation efforts are making us a supplier of choice on many of these projects. As an example, we have booked and are currently shipping to projects such as battery plants, electric vehicle manufacturing facilities, LNG facilities and large warehouse parks. On the public side, demand is unfolding largely as we expected, Funding from the infrastructure investment and Jobs Act is beginning to flow through and the pipeline is building with trailing 12-month highway starts up over 20%. 2024 state budgets are at very healthy levels. And internally, our bookings and backlog reflect this increased activity. The level of this year's shipments will depend upon how quickly this increased activity converts to shipments. We expect accelerating growth into next year and continued growth for the next several years. Trailing 12-month other infrastructure starts are also over -- up over 20%. In addition to significant IIJA funding for water, energy, ports and shipments, strong state and local revenue support growth in non-highway investments. Based on the improved private demand backdrop, our first half shipment -- and our first half shipments, we now expect Aggregates volumes to decline between 1% to 4% in 2023 and as compared to our initial expectations of a decline between 2% and 6%. Of course, regardless of the demand environment, our focus is to consistently improve unit profitability and grow earnings that we create value for our shareholders. We're well positioned to do exactly that this year and deliver approximately 20% year-over-year improvement in both our cash gross profit per ton and adjusted EBITDA. And now I'll turn the call over to Mary Andrews for some additional commentary on our second quarter and an update for 2023 outlook.Mary Andrews CarlisleThanks, Tom, and good morning. Our strong operational performance through the first 6 months in this year exhibits the benefits of our strategic focus on enhancing our core. We have improved our adjusted EBITDA margin by 350 basis points year-to-date through a combination of gross margin expansion and disciplined SAG cost management. This operational execution and resulting cash generation have allowed us to deploy capital toward each of our long-standing priorities, to improve our return on invested capital and to maintain the strength of our investment-grade balance sheet. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $677 million in maintenance and growth capital including strategic greenfields. Additionally, we have deployed $340 million for acquisitions, and we've returned $271 million to shareholders via a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We have improved our return on invested capital by 110 basis points on a trailing 12-month basis. And we have reduced our leverage on a net debt to adjusted EBITDA basis to 2x at June 30, 2023, from 2.5x at June 30, 2022. We are well positioned to execute on our strategic objectives of further enhancing our core and also expanding our reach. Talent and technology are critical to achieve our business objectives, and we continue to invest in both while remaining focused on further leveraging our SAG costs. Trailing 12-month, SAG expenses as a percentage of revenue have improved by 50 basis points. Now let me shift to the updates to our full year guidance. As Tom mentioned, we now expect to generate between $1.9 billion and $2 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2023, a 17% to 23% improvement over the prior year. Our revised outlook results in the update to our aggregates volume expectations that Tom described, in addition to the momentum in our Asphalt business. With our non-aggregates businesses now in margin recovery mode, we expect to generate approximately $295 million of cash gross profit from our downstream businesses. With 50% to 55% of the total expected from Asphalt and 45% to 50% of the total expected from Concrete. We continue to expect to spend between $600 million and $650 million on maintenance and growth capital. Additionally, we expect to spend approximately $200 million on opportunistic purchases of strategic reserves in California, North Carolina and Texas, 3 important markets for Vulcan Materials. Because reserves are critical to our long-term success, our land portfolio is extensive and a strategic focus for us. We take a disciplined approach to securing high-quality reserves, the timing of which often depends on a combination of availability, alternative use of the cash and tax efficiency. We manage the entire life cycle of our land to create maximum value for the business, for our shareholders and for our communities, putting land to work both before and after mining. Our excess properties once completely mined and often reclaimed to their highest and best use can generate significant value such as the 2021 sale of previously mined property in Southern California that was reclaimed for commercial and retail development and sold for over $180 million. Of course, the timing of buying and selling land can be uneven, but our focus is on the strategic management of our land portfolio. All other aspects of the full year guidance, as reaffirmed or updated in May remain unchanged.I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for some closing remarks.James Thomas HillThank you, Mary Andrews. In closing, I want to thank and congratulate our teams on an outstanding performance in the first half of this year, and I want to challenge them to remain focused on our Vulcan web selling and Vulcan web operating disciplines so that we can continue to compound improvements and drive value for our shareholders. Most importantly, we will remain committed to each other and keeping each other safe.And now Mary Andrews and I will be glad to take the questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question today comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens.Trey GroomsNice work in the quarter.James Thomas HillThanks, Trey.Trey GroomsSo I guess I wanted to touch on the guide specifically the increase in your volume outlook for the year, I think, Tom, and I know you have some things maybe from a high level, but could you maybe go into a little bit more detail on the primary drivers there, especially as you kind of look on the private side, on res and private non-res, and is that adjustment that you've made here for the full year based more on what you've seen in the results year-to-date or an improvement in the outlook for the balance of the year?James Thomas HillThis last part of that is, I'd say both. We had a strong start, and I think things are looking better than what we had thought at the beginning of the year. Volume in the quarter was only down 1%. It was a great recovery in California, where we had a big washout in the first quarter. Texas was wet in the first quarter, it was wet in the second quarter, causing shipments to be down year-over-year. Interesting in the second quarter, the Southeast was also wet. But after those wet days, we're seeing a faster recovery in these markets. I mean, the volumes go up as soon as it drives out, volumes pop and so that's good news for all of us. The private demand has been stronger than we anticipated. Both single-family and multifamily shipments have held up better than I think our original projections. Nonres has also been better, as we said, driven by the heavy side. So that's why we raised our guidance to negative 1% to negative 4%. Highways, I think, finishes the year about where we thought low single digit. We got really backlogs and bookings are growing. So we'll really build in 2024. But at the end of it, the private side was just stronger -- has been stronger and will be stronger than we originally anticipated.OperatorThe next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital.Garik Simha ShmoisJust wanted to piggyback on Trey's question with respect to the volume outlook. I was wondering, if you could speak a little bit more just for the light non-res side that the players are recognizing that the heavy piece has been strong. Are you seeing any change in trend there? And then also highways are -- it sounds like as expected this year. Just curious if there's any visibility to what kind of growth we might anticipate into 2024.James Thomas HillI'll take non-res first. As I said, it's been a lot better than we thought. It's really driven by as you would expect, warehouse, distribution center. And now we've got the heavy industrial projects coming on, which have been very helpful. I would say a little bit of risk in some geographies and some sectors next year as we've seen maybe some slow in starts in Texas and warehouses. That said, if you look at that segment, warehouse segment in some of our stronger markets like -- strong markets like Georgia, Florida, California, Arizona, we're still seeing growth in starts and warehouses in those markets. So a little bit mixed bag of warehouses. I'd say other really good news in non-res is that we continue to see the big growth in the heavy industrial projects in our footprint. And these projects carry substantial volume needs. We have, I think, 11 of these big projects that we've already booked, most of them were already shipping on, and they'll carry out through 2024. On top of that, we're currently bidding on a number of projects that, as you know, won't ship until '24, '25. So in this sector, geography really does matter. So better growth in non-res than I think we originally expected. I'm sorry, your second question was on how we demand. It's really a matter of timing. We're seeing a lot of growth in -- we're seeing growth in bidding. The funding, as you know, the federal side, the state side and the local side is very good. Highway lettings continue to build our bookings in our backlogs and highways continues to build. And as you know, what we're bidding today, and what we're looking today, we'll ship in '24. So again, low single digit in the sector in '23, but is setting up very well for '24 and '25 and '26.OperatorThe next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel.Stanley Stoker ElliottCould you guys talk about the pricing environment? You mentioned pretty broad-based momentum to the first half of the year. You did leave the pricing guidance unchanged. Is that regional mix? Is it maybe some timing? And to what level are you guys thinking about second price increases and maybe even how that carries off into 2024?James Thomas HillYes. I would tell you that the pricing in '23 is unfolding as we thought it would. Prices were up 15% in the quarter. We expect going to be up 15% that carry through the full year. I think if I step back and remember the sequence in pricing was very different between '22 and '23. In '23, as we told you, we went out much higher, much earlier than we did in 2022. We've gotten more price in '23. We got more price in '23, and we've gotten it earlier. So if you kind of look at -- a good reference would be Slide 5 in that deck. And if you looked at '22, the full year, year-over-year from January 1 to December 31, we went up above 53. So from the beginning of this year until the end of June for '23, we're already up $2.28. So it is compounding, it is much faster, much higher. Second half price increases while they were mixed, will only help that. I'd tell you they're more -- they really are really a good setup for 2024, and we'll continue this momentum. The reason why is -- moment is very good, as you know, but demand is looking better. The private side is better. The public side is growing. So all of us in the sector have very good visibility to a more positive ramp picture. And our customers, I would tell you, continue to be quite confident. So I feel good about the momentum. We're right now planning our January 1 price increases, which will go out in a few months. And I would expect us, again, to go out higher earlier than we did. What point to this, though, and I think really important is our ultimate goal is to take that price to the bottom line. And that's really important that we continue that margin expansion. We're up low 20s in the -- we're in the first quarter, low 20s in the second quarter. We expect that to continue for the next few quarters. And that is a really important number. And we get there in the second half of the year a little different, probably a little -- as a percentage-wise, we got tougher comps on price, but easier comps on costs. So we continue that low 20s margin expansion.OperatorThe next question comes from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.Michael Glaser DahlSo I had a question on the downstream businesses. So it's nice to see certainly good properties and you're referencing that you're in margin recovery mode. You took up the guide for this year. When I take a step back and look at kind of your legacy business combined with the previous U.S. Concrete legacy business, it seems like there will be still like quite a bit more work or runway left on what ""normal"" to be in downstream. So just wanted to get your thoughts on that in terms of timing. Should we be thinking about that, your combined businesses could be like $400 million to $295 million. I'm not saying this year or next, but is that the right normal to be thinking about, or how should we frame that?James Thomas HillYes. I think we were very encouraged that this quarter, we had unit margin growth in all 3 product lines. We battled out a little bit in Asphalt for a year or 2. And then we had to catch up. We said we'd catch up this year in Concrete, and we've got it in the second quarter. I'll take the product lines kind of one at a time, really strong quarter for Asphalt. Gross margins were up -- were at $66 million. They were $26 million last year. Volumes were up 16% in spite of wet weather in Texas, California and Arizona Asphalt volumes were really strong after a tough first quarter because of rain. Prices were up 9%, and our liquid costs were down. So great quarter in Asphalt. We told you guys we would continue to grow this margin than we are. So really encouraged by that. And that will only get better as you see the funding from IIJA and local and state, plenty of go to work in the public sector. Ready-mix, we had a really tough first quarter, slow start to the year. We got really blowing up with weather. We covered -- I thought the team there did a really nice job, recovering rapidly in the second quarter, and it was really driven by unit margin expansion. So on a same-store basis, our volumes were down actually 11%. A combination of rain in Texas and the impact of single-family demand. Prices were up 10% and unit margins were up 24%. So -- we said we'd get back to growth mode and ready mix. I think we are, and I think we'll continue that recovery. But I'm really proud of the ready-mixed teams recovery and the Asphalt team's continued performance in those product lines.Mary Andrews CarlisleYes. And Mike, just on a sort of longer-term horizon, I think in the ready-mix business, we still think that low double-digit gross margins is where we need to be. And so if you look -- we saw a great recovery in the second quarter. If you look at where we are in the trailing 12. As you said, we still have runway ahead of us, and that's the margin expansion that we're looking forward to going forward. And similarly, in the Asphalt business, we've sort of long said high single digit, maybe low double-digit, long-term gross margins in Asphalt. We've hit 10% on a trailing 12-month basis. And I think with where we are right now with the pricing environment and the demand environment ahead of us, we can still see some expansion there as well, but would still think of high single digit, low double digit over the long term.OperatorThe next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.Anthony James PettinariJust following up on margins. I think you previously pointed to cash cost up high single digits year-over-year this year. I'm just wondering, is that still a fair expectation? And I think costs were up a little bit more than that in 2Q. You talked about comps getting easier in the second half. Just any kind of further detail in terms of the cadence from 3Q to 4Q? And if there's any sort of good guys or bad guys from a cost perspective that we should especially keep in mind for the second half?James Thomas HillYes. We're getting better costs, but they're still high. They were up 9% in the quarter. And you really feeling the impact of the inflationary pressures on parts and services. As we said, comps get easier throughout the year, our guidance is the high single, which would put us in kind of mid for the balance of the year. Parts and service costs continue to plague as well. So we have issue of challenges with parts delivery, which hurts our efficiencies. That also is getting better. I think we do have a good guy in the quarter of diesel, which was probably an impact of around $25 million. And our operating efficiencies continue to improve and will help us offset some of this. So we guide you to -- for the full year to high single digit, which would put us kind of mid in the back half of the year, but we're comping over a lot easier numbers.Mary Andrews CarlisleYes. And Anthony, I think most important is it has been a challenging couple of years with inflationary pressure, certainly, but Aggregates is a price/cost winner, and our gross margin on a trailing 12-month basis, returning to expansion in the second quarter, what was great to see. We've got a good runway ahead of us on that. And as Tom highlighted earlier, still expect low 20% growth this year in our cash gross profit per ton.Anthony James PettinariOkay, that's very helpful. And maybe just on labor, are you seeing any change there, maybe not in terms of wage rate or dollar, but in terms of availability of labor that's maybe helping you or hurting you this year?James Thomas HillIt's still tight. I think it is. The labor market has gotten better from our perspective. I think we've also gotten better retention and how we handle that. So still a challenge, but much improved from where it was over the last couple of years.OperatorThe next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.Jerry David RevichTom and Andrews, I wonder if you just talk about how you're thinking about pricing for '24, it feels like one of the big lessons learned for the industry from '22 is the price for a higher level of inflation and inflation is lower, just get the benefits of that. How are you thinking about the magnitude of those January 1 price increase comp that you spoke about versus the historical 4% to 5% CAGR that you and the industry have delivered given the backdrop that we've seen over the past 18 months.James Thomas HillSo as I said, I think we've got a lot of momentum going with this, and this -- the private side demand on this being better is helping that. Everybody's got good visibility to the public side, I think that if you go out there and talk to the segment to the Construction Materials and Construction segment, people are feeling a lot better about the future than maybe we were 6 months ago. And you can see more of the demand. So that positive sentiment, the momentum on pricing and better visibility to demand, all a good setup for price. As far as magnitude, we're working on that right now, but I would -- our strategy last year was to go out higher on January 1. I thought that worked very well. And I think I wouldn't see a stream from that strategy as we look to 2024.OperatorThe next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James.Patrick Tyler BrownSo I'm a little unclear on the CapEx. So I think CapEx is expected to be $600 million, $650 million, but does that include the $200 million in land purchases? Or will that be on top of it? Maybe I'm missing it, but those maybe flow on the acquisition line on the cash flow statement. I'm just not sure. And then just, Tom, any color on the M&amp;A pipeline?Mary Andrews CarlisleYes. So Tyler, to clarify, the $200 million that we're planning to spend on strategic reserves is in addition to the $600 million to $650 million. It will show up as PP&amp;E as it is land. But I think you're thinking about it right in terms of it being more of an opportunistic strategic acquisition type opportunity. And I'll let Tom hit M&amp;A.James Thomas HillYes. I would simply describe the acquisition with the improving picture and clarity to the private demand and it probably looked a little better than maybe we thought. I would expect that to improve the M&amp;A pipeline. We've got -- we always have a couple we're working on, but strategic bolt-ons. But I would think this will help the pipeline.OperatorThe next question comes from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research.Timna Beth TannersWanted to follow up on the strategic cash uses. So talking about property purchases, is this because of opportunistic availability? Or is this a need to reach ore reserves, just some color there? And similarly, just wondered if you would comment on the first share buyback since the pandemic and what that might illustrate for your future plans.James Thomas HillI think we'll split that question. I'll take the land piece. You're exactly right. It is opportunistic. A lot of times, these are when they come up, much like a bolt-on acquisition, and that's both for buying reserves, but also both buying reserves and selling land are going to be lumpy by nature. You heard Mary Andrews, I think it was in '21, where we sold $180 million worth of land. So it is -- it comes when it comes, it's hard to plan. Sometimes you can, most of the time you can't. I would tell you, I'm very pleased with the reserves we got. They were primarily in California, Texas and North Carolina. So glad to give them good use of capital and pleased with the team's effort on that.Mary Andrews CarlisleYes. And in terms of share repurchases, returning excess cash to shareholders through repurchases has been part of our long-standing capital allocation priorities. We believe appropriately following reinvesting in the business, through operating and maintenance CapEx, after growing the business and returning cash through the dividend. So with attractive cash generation and slower M&amp;A in the first half of the year. We repurchased $50 million of shares in the second quarter. And really, our capital allocation decisions in the back half of the year will just follow our same disciplined approach.OperatorThe next question is from Phil Ng with Jefferies.Philip H. NgCongrats on the strong quarter. My question is your guidance for average volumes you're calling for it to be down, call it, 1% to 4%. And you want to down modestly in 2Q. And with housing bottoming and you're calling out pretty good momentum on the infrastructure and heavy commercial side with frankly easier comps in the back half, it feels kind of conservative. Any one-offs that we should be mindful of, and when we look out to 2024, time you're talking about how you're seeing momentum building on infrastructure and heavy on the industrial side. Any color on how to think about the growth profile in those 2 end markets when we kind of look at 2024?James Thomas HillYes. I think if you look at the kind of the upside, downside to our guidance, the low side, the minus 4 would tell you that single-family shipments would have to fall off, of course, than we've seen. I think we bottom -- we're seeing kind of the bottom in single-family. And I think that it gets better for -- hopefully, we get better for 2024. On the high side, at minus 1, we'd have to see a little more volume. How we have -- some of our projects we have to start a little faster. It could happen, and that's why we got the range where we do. I do think that the heavy piece and he is going to help us in the second half. I think it's going to be more help in 2024 on the heavy industrial.Philip H. NgIs there a way to think about how that growth profile is going to look next year? I mean, low single digits for Infra. Is that like a mid- to high single-digit growth story next year?James Thomas HillOn other infrastructure, you mean?Philip H. NgJust infrastructure in general, right? I mean, Tom, you talked about low single-digit growth this year, right? So when we look out to 2024 with all the lettings have been bidding actively flowing through, is that like a mid-single-digit growth or high single-digit growth?James Thomas HillI think it's too early to call. We just got to see more. I would address that we haven't talked about the non-highway infrastructure is also looking very good. Like highways, the local state and federal funding is extremely healthy, and that's IIJA in it. Starts and the other non-highway infrastructure were up in probably 6 months, it was up 18% and trailing 3 is up 20%. So good for '23, probably again low single digit but much better for '24.OperatorThe next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.Brian BirosThis is actually Brian Biros on for Kathryn. Just on the Asphalt business, can you just touch a little bit more on the performance there? Maybe the volume growth specifically, just kind of what projects are you seeing come to market in that business that it's more repair work, or maybe it's more new work coming down the pipeline?James Thomas HillIt's -- as far as the paving is both. You're seeing both new and recovery. You do have -- I mean, and overlays I was pleased with the volume growth because we had a lot of rain in Texas, which is a big asphalt. Flip side of that is California and Arizona probably had some catch-up from the first quarter, which we just didn't do much at all. I am very pleased with the pricing performance and the unit margin performance. So I think a really good start to the year in Asphalt. We're back in unit margin growth mode and the growth in funding for highways is only going to help this product line.OperatorNext question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis.Adam Robert ThalhimerGreat quarter. Tom, I think you characterized the midyear price increases as mixed. What was that? I think there was hope a month or 2 ago, it might be better, and does that bode well for January increases next year?James Thomas HillYes. Remember, as I said, the sequencing from '22 to '23 was very different. We intentionally went out much higher, much earlier in 2023. So kind of as expected, the midyear was successful in some markets. It was successful in some market segments. It will have a little bit of an impact on '23, but it's going to have a much larger impact on '24, and that's simply a matter of timing from timing from project pricing to shipment and also maybe some backlogs. It does impact 2024. I don't think it slows any momentum for January 1 price increases. Again, that strategy of higher early work is really good in '23, and we'll get that strategy towards '24. But -- so that's -- I would tell you that as expected.OperatorThe next question is from Keith Hughes with Truist.Keith Brian HughesGive us some update on the situation in Mexico and Macquarie there and to the process. Any sort of movement at all?James Thomas HillSo the short answer is the same. No news. We've got the NAFTA claim. We'll have the final hearing on that -- on the NAFTA tribunal this year. We should have a result of that in 2024. We feel very good about our position. We feel very good about our case. We feel very good about the evidence, but we won't have -- we'll finish the legal proceedings this year and have a final ruling in '24.Keith Brian HughesAnd what would be the best case scenario if you're successful in that?James Thomas HillI think that we get a large check and because of the shutdown of our business. The magnitude of that, we can't disclose because we have a confidential agreement with the tribune.OperatorNext question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.David Sutherland MacGregorTom, nice quarter. I wanted to maybe just ask a little bit on the guidance and you talked about the third quarter being in California, Texas in the second quarter. What's your sort of best estimate of the carryforward tons into the second half due to the disruptive first half weather?James Thomas HillI think you saw that in California, Arizona in the quarter. You probably will have some of that in the third quarter in Texas. As I said earlier, what I'm impressed with is we're seeing a lot of speedy recovery after wet days in our markets, which tells me that our -- the firepower of our contractors is getting much better. And I'm sure it is because of the work that they got coming out from all the public funding. So I think maybe a little bit in Texas. Everybody else, I think you don't see a lot of carryforward because they've been able to catch up pretty quick.OperatorThe next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.Michael Stephan DudasTom, as you provided some very helpful observations on expectations for the second half year in '24, but if you're going to isolate either better-than-expected pricing, better-than-expected cost and better-than-expected volume as we maybe exit the '23 into '24, what would you point towards or maybe all of the above?James Thomas HillYou're saying if we go from '23 to '24?Michael Stephan DudasYes, as we get through the second half of the year as results come through, your expectation would have been getting to year-end, like say, the high end of your EBITDA range or would it be better pricing, better cost utilization and execution or better volumes?James Thomas HillI would tell you we probably have the best shot at how we work coming on a little faster than maybe we expected is the flip side of that is obviously that if you see a bigger slowdown on -- some -- more slowdown on res, which at this point, we don't think is going to happen unless we'll take it one at a time. On pricing, I think we've got it about right, how we got it because we've got a little bit in the midyear, but it's going to flow through in '24. The cost piece, I think, again, we've got to be mid-single digits at the end of the year. And I think that between efficiencies and comps, we get there. I guess at the end of the day, if I had to pick one, I would probably pick the volume piece of that.OperatorThe next question comes from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.Brent Edward ThielmanTom, nice to see the continued improvement in Aggregates gross margin this quarter. I guess my question was more to the quarter and thinking about this going forward. With the East under some pressure, due to weather and some of those variables, was that actually a net negative to your reported profitability in that segment?James Thomas HillI'm sorry, couldn't understand what you point out as possibly negative.Mary Andrews CarlisleThe East. We do have very attractive margins in our East Coast business. I think while there was some wet weather A lot of the strength in the private non-res and these large industrial projects in those areas. And so our volumes were quite healthy in those markets.James Thomas HillI also would tell you that I think the East -- I was impressed with we had wet weather in East, but the recovery time when those thunderstorms will flow through, the next couple of days was impressive.OperatorIt appears we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to Tom for any additional closing remarks.James Thomas HillWell, thank you all for your interest and your time and your support of Vulcan Materials Company. We look forward to talking to you throughout the quarter, and we hope that you and your families stay healthy and safe. Thank you.OperatorThis does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.]"

The company experienced solid growth in both its top and bottom lines compared to the previous year. This performance can be attributed to the consistent strategic execution and the strong performance of its aggregates-led business. Additionally, the company benefited from large industrial projects and steady residential construction activity, which further contributed to its better-than-expected results.Given the aggregates shipment trends and the earnings momentum in the Asphalt segment, the company lifted its full-year expectations.Shares of the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates jumped 1.6% on Aug 3 post the earnings release.Vulcan Materials Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseVulcan Materials Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseVulcan Materials Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Vulcan Materials Company QuoteInside the HeadlinesAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.29 topped the consensus mark of $1.91 by 19.9% and increased 49.7% from the year-ago level of $1.53.Total revenues of $2,113 million surpassed the consensus mark of $2,062 million by 2.5% and increased 8.1% year over year.Segments in DetailAggregatesRevenues from the segment increased 12.6% year over year to $1,578.4 million due to higher pricing, wherein our model expected the segmental revenues to grow 6% to $1,486.3 million year over year. Aggregate shipments (volumes) declined 1% year over year, with variations observed across different geographic regions. After a weather-impacted first quarter, shipment activity in California rebounded strongly. Additionally, certain markets in the Southeast experienced robust shipment activity, primarily driven by demand from industrial projects.Freight-adjusted average sales price rose 15% to $18.69 per ton year over year. Freight-adjusted revenues rose 14.3% from the prior-year quarter to $1,184.4 million. Solid operational execution helped mitigate continued year-over-year inflationary pressure. Effective pricing actions resulted in accelerated growth.Gross profit of $498.6 million increased 23.9% from the prior year’s levels despite lower shipments. Gross margin expanded 290 basis points (bps) owing to solid pricing and higher efficiencies.Asphalt, Concrete and CalciumRevenues from the Asphalt segment were $337.4 million, up 22.8% year over year. This segment’s reported figure was up from our prediction of $264.8 million, which suggested a 3.6% decline from the prior year. The segment generated a gross profit of $56.6 million, up from $13.6 million a year ago. Shipments registered a substantial increase of 16%, driven by robust growth in Arizona and California, which are the company's largest asphalt markets. Asphalt pricing was up 9%.Total revenues from the Concrete segment were $343.5 million, down 18.7% year over year. Our model predicted segment sales to be $402.3 million (down 4.7% year over year). Gross profit totaled $27 million, down from $30 million in the year-ago quarter. Shipments fell 25% year over year but average selling prices increased 10.1% to $163.83 per cubic yard from the prior-year level. The second-quarter shipments were influenced by two main factors: firstly, the impact of divesting the company's operations in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania in the previous year, and secondly, a slowdown in residential construction activity.Total revenues from the Calcium segment were up to $2.4 million from the prior-year figure of $1.4 million. The company reported better than our expectation of $2.3 million (up 62.4% year over year). The segment reported a gross profit of $1.1 million, up from $0.2 million a year ago.Story continuesOperating HighlightsSelling, administrative and general expenses — as a percentage of total revenues — improved 30 bps to 6.6% from a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was up 32.2% year over year to $595.3 million.FinancialsAs of Jun 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $166 million, up from $161.4 million at 2022-end. Long-term debt was $3,873.2 million at the second quarter of 2023-end, slightly down from $3,875.2 million at 2022-end.In the first half of 2023, capital expenditures were $270 million. On Jun 30, 2023, total debt to trailing-12-months adjusted EBITDA was 2.1x, down from 2.6x from the year-ago quarter. Return on average invested capital was 14.7%, up from 13.6% a year ago on a trailing 12 months basis.2023 Guidance RaisedFor 2023, the company now anticipates adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.9-$2 billion and net earnings of $855-$935 million. In the Aggregates segment, total shipments are likely to be down 1-4%.In Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium segment, cash gross profit is expected to be approximately $295 million.In 2023, the company expects to incur capital expenditures of $600-$650 million.Zacks Rank &amp; Recent Construction ReleasesVMC currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.KBR, Inc. KBR reported mixed second-quarter 2023 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the biotech industry, head directly to 5 Best Biotech ETFs To Buy. According to Precedence Research, the worldwide biotechnology market was valued at approximately $1,224.31 billion in 2022. It is projected to reach a value of around $3,210.71 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.8% from 2023 to 2030. The biotechnology industry in countries like China, Japan, and India is witnessing growth propelled by positive government policies. These initiatives target the improvement of medical regulation, standardization of clinical studies, enhancement of reimbursement policies, and acceleration of product approval processes, all of which are expected to create profitable growth prospects for the biotechnology sectorDon't Miss: 12 Best Agriculture ETFs To BuyTo name a few hindrances plaguing the biotech industry, EY in a report observed that the 2022 revenue of public biotech companies declined by 1% compared to 2021 due to decreased demand for COVID-19 vaccines and antiviral treatments. 2023 is anticipated to see five patent expirations for well-established biologic products, resulting in a significant loss of revenue. Furthermore, over 20 products, accounting for nearly $200 billion in annual sales, are expected to lose patent protection by 2030. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) experienced a decline in approvals for new molecular entities and biologics license applications in 2022, which was attributed to staffing shortages. However, approvals returned to pre-pandemic levels in Q1 of 2023. Lastly, in 2022, all forms of biotech financing, including venture capital investment, debt financing, IPOs, and follow-on offerings, decreased substantially. According to Ashwin Singhania, Principal at EY-Parthenon: “Innovation is the engine that drives the biotech industry. While the approaching patent cliff is an unavoidable challenge, the pipeline continues to be very robust and the pace of innovation continues to accelerate. If executives can prioritize streamlining processes and the ongoing investment in organic innovation and inorganic growth, they will set themselves up for future success.”Story continuesAlso Read: 12 Best Energy ETFs: Top Oil, Gas and Renewable Energy FundsOn a positive note, RBC Capital Markets predicts that large-cap biotech companies with revenue resilience, less binary risk, and optimistic earnings guidance will maintain momentum in early 2023. While some larger companies have set themselves up for future growth and diversification, 2023 may be a flat earnings year for many large caps due to patent expirations and COVID-19 revenue declines. On the other hand, smaller-cap biotechs, though recovering from mid-year lows, have underperformed compared to larger and mid-cap biotechs and pharma. However, some high-quality, catalyst-driven smaller-cap companies are forecasted to perform well in 2023, driven by increasing regulatory permissiveness and potential M&amp;A activity. M&amp;A activity is also expected to rise as large biopharma companies sit on strong balance sheets, face patent cliffs, and experience better policy clarity. This potential uptick in M&amp;A could act as a catalyst for biotech stocks, driving growth and diversification among larger-cap companies facing challenges.Some of the best biotech stocks to invest in include Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Pfizer Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the healthcare industry and go directly to the 5 European Countries with Best Healthcare for Expats.Who are Expats?According to the World Bank's 2023 World Development Report, about 184 million people, 2.3% of the world population, live outside their countries of origin, including 37 million refugees. ‘Expats’ and ‘immigrants’ are often used interchangeably but have distinct meanings and connotations. The Cambridge Dictionary defines an expat as ""someone who does not live in their own country."" According to a BBC interview with Malte Zeeck, founder and co-CEO of InterNations, the motivation behind the decision of moving abroad is what distinguishes an expat from other people moving abroad like immigrants. Since expats have more of a choice they can decide to move to countries that can serve them best, whether it's in terms of employment opportunities, education, or healthcare among other factors.Expats usually do not reside in the destination country long term; for them moving is a choice rather than a necessity. Their main motivation is to add ease, comfort, and value to their lives. When the skills of the person relocating match the skills required at the destination country, it facilitates both the labor supply and demand. According to Expat Insider Report 2023, the top expat-origin nationalities include American, British, Indian, German, and Italian.People move to a new country for better career opportunities and an improved lifestyle. Good health is fundamental to living a peaceful and happy life. Thus, a good healthcare system becomes a primary consideration when deciding which country to move to, especially when retiring overseas. Healthcare Industry at a GlanceThe pandemic has affected almost all industries; however, the healthcare industry experienced unabated growth throughout the pandemic. McKinsey &amp; Company has estimated healthcare industry EBITDA to have a 6% growth rate between 2021 and 2025. This growth rate would add $31 billion in profits to the healthcare industry by 2025. In the USA alone, according to estimates, healthcare profits will increase from $654 billion in 2021 to $790 billion in 2026 at a compound annual growth rate of 4%. Healthcare is experiencing persistent growth across different parts of the industry. The possible challenges to these rates are growing inflation and macroeconomic headwinds.Story continuesThe pandemic has impacted some of the existing trends in the healthcare industry. Care delivery was primarily confined to hospitals and traditional healthcare sub-sectors. However, non-acute sites and post-acute sites are gaining popularity post-pandemic. This shift has considerably impacted hospitals' share of overall provider revenue, which is estimated to decline from 47% in 2019 to 44% in 2025. The main contributing factors causing the shift towards non-acute settings include the advancement of value-based healthcare, related risk payments, and digitization.Some of the largest healthcare companies in the world are UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR). UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) operates through four segments: UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight, and Optum Rx. On July 14, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported a revenue of $92.9 billion and beat Wall Street estimates by $1.94 billion. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported earnings per share of $6.14 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.16. Here are some comments from the company's Q2 2023 earnings call: ""UnitedHealthcare's growth was strong and diversified as well. Today, we're serving nearly 1.6 million more people in our commercial and public sector program offerings than last year. This durable growth, driven by our colleagues' relentless focus on quality and execution, enabled us to achieve second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.14 and to strengthen our full-year outlook to between $24.70 to $25 per share. We know there is great interest in understanding the recent care activity I just mentioned. So I'll give you an overview of how we're seeing care plans progress and how we're responding. I do want to underscore the most critical point first: making high-quality care more affordable and accessible is at the core of our mission. Having more people obtain the care they need is a positive trend for individuals and our health system and society. As we discussed several weeks ago, during the second quarter, we observed increased care patents, notably in outpatient surgeries for seniors and especially with certain orthopedic procedures, which may have been postponed. ""Tech and HealthcareThe healthcare industry is one of the most innovative industries in the world. It largely invests in R&amp;D, pharmaceuticals, and technological advancements. When the pandemic hit, it further came to the forefront. The managing partner at Harris Financial Group, Jamie Cox, in a CNBC interview on July 21, noted the intersection of tech and healthcare. He commented: ""It's all about healthcare, Dom. I mean, you know, tech and healthcare, the intersection of those two sectors cannot be ignored. There's so much innovation, so much R&amp;D that happened during the pandemic and we're just starting to see some of the pieces of it come to the marketplace. One particular area, medical devices - I mean you have people voluntarily wearing continuous glucose monitors. So companies like Insulet or Dexcom, these are companies that are absolutely knocking it out of the park. People are paying really close attention to healthcare and that is brought about by technology.""The recent accelerated digitization in healthcare has popularized virtual care, especially mental health. According to a report by Deloitte, 89% of mental health consultations are being conducted online, and global spending on mental health applications increased 32% from 2019 to 2020 and is estimated to grow by 20% annually. The use of Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) is also getting popularized. This system enables care coordination and improves diagnoses. Through proper communication, duplicate testing can also be avoided. The information using HIEs is effectively distributed across geographical regions and care settings like hospitals. Increased care and service delivery automation would help the healthcare industry's overall growth. The global healthcare sector is expected to experience a 12.1 million skilled healthcare professionals shortage by 2035—the interplay between tech and healthcare is even more significant. Advancements in tech enable the healthcare industry to meet this demand. AI4HealthCro, an innovative not-for-profit public-private consortium of AI experts for healthcare, integrates AI into healthcare technologies. This venture would free up 1,944 man-hours annually, save approximately 403,000 lives and reduce healthcare costs by EUR 212.4 billion.Moving to a new country can be a daunting experience because of the anxieties accompanied by uncertainties. However, you can make the right decision with proper planning and research. We have ranked European countries with the best healthcare for expats to help you decide.  15 European Countries with Best Healthcare for ExpatsOur methodology To determine the European Countries with Best Healthcare for Expats, we first determined the best European countries for expats.

The report includes surveys from 12,000 expats with diverse nationalities currently living in 172 countries.

A copy of the Company’s second quarter 2023 supplemental package will be available on the Company's website at investors.regencycenters.com or by written request to: Investor Relations, Regency Centers Corporation, One Independent Drive, Suite 114, Jacksonville, Florida, 32202. The supplemental package contains more detailed financial and property results including financial statements, an outstanding debt summary, acquisition and development activity, investments in partnerships, information pertaining to securities issued other than common stock, property details, a significant tenant rent report and a lease expiration table in addition to earnings and valuation guidance assumptions. The information provided in the supplemental package is unaudited and includes non-GAAP measures, and there can be no assurance that the information will not vary from the final information in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2023. Regency may, but assumes no obligation to, update information in the supplemental package from time to time.Non-GAAP DisclosureWe believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to our Board of Directors, management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting, forecasting and planning purposes.We do not consider non-GAAP measures an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, rather they supplement GAAP measures by providing additional information we believe to be useful to our shareholders. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, they reflect the exercise of management’s judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures we use to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon in evaluating the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of the Company.Nareit FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains on sale and impairments of real estate, net of tax, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Regency computes Nareit FFO for all periods presented in accordance with Nareit's definition. Since Nareit FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and gains on sales and impairments of real estate, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in percent leased, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs. This provides a perspective of the Company’s financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Thus, Nareit FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of the Company's operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP; and, therefore, should not be considered a substitute measure of cash flows from operations. The Company provides a reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders to Nareit FFO.Core Operating Earnings is an additional performance measure that excludes from Nareit FFO: (i) transaction related income or expenses; (ii) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt; (iii) certain non-cash components of earnings derived from above and below market rent amortization, straight-line rents, and amortization of mark-to-market of debt adjustments; and (iv) other amounts as they occur. The Company provides a reconciliation of Net Income to Nareit FFO to Core Operating Earnings.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements in this document regarding anticipated financial, business, legal or other outcomes including business and market conditions, outlook and other similar statements relating to Regency’s future events, developments, or financial or operational performance or results such as our 2023 Guidance, are “forward-looking statements” made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are identified by the use of words such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “expect,” “estimate,” “believe,” “intend,” “forecast,” “project,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “guidance,” and other similar language. However, the absence of these or similar words or expressions does not mean a statement is not forward-looking. While we believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable when made, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and undue reliance should not be placed on these statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance these expectations will be attained, and it is possible actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Our operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those risk factors described in our Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (“2022 Form 10-K”) under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2023 under Part II, Item 1A. “Risk Factors”. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our other filings and submissions to the SEC. If any of the events described in the risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected. Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made, and Regency undertakes no duty to update its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise, except as to the extent required by law. These risks and events include, without limitation:Risk Factors Related to the Company’s Pending Acquisition of Urstadt Biddle Please refer to disclosures in our 424(b)(3) prospectus, filed with the SEC on July 12, 2023, which contains, among other things, additional risk factors related to such acquisition.Risk Factors Related to the Current Economic EnvironmentContinued rising interest rates in the current economic environment may adversely impact our cost to borrow, real estate valuation, and stock price. Current economic challenges, including the potential for recession, may adversely impact our tenants and our business. Unfavorable developments affecting the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business, liquidity and financial condition, and overall results of operations.Risk Factors Related to Pandemics or other Health CrisesPandemics or other health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect our tenants’ financial condition, the profitability of our properties, and our access to the capital markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Risk Factors Related to Operating Retail-Based Shopping CentersEconomic and market conditions may adversely affect the retail industry and consequently reduce our revenues and cash flow and increase our operating expenses. Shifts in retail trends, sales, and delivery methods between brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce, home delivery, and curbside pick-up may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, and cash flows. Changing economic and retail market conditions in geographic areas where our properties are concentrated may reduce our revenues and cash flow. Our success depends on the continued presence and success of our “anchor” tenants. A percentage of our revenues are derived from “local” tenants and our net income may be adversely impacted if these tenants are not successful, or if the demand for the types or mix of tenants significantly change. We may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy. Many of our costs and expenses associated with operating our properties may remain constant or increase, even if our lease income decreases. Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other building, fire, and safety and regulations may have a material negative effect on us.Risk Factors Related to Real Estate InvestmentsOur real estate assets may decline in value and be subject to impairment losses which may reduce our net income. We face risks associated with development, redevelopment and expansion of properties. We face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial properties. We face risks associated with the acquisition of properties. We may be unable to sell properties when desired because of market conditions. Changes in tax laws could impact our acquisition or disposition of real estate.Risk Factors Related to the Environment Affecting Our PropertiesClimate change may adversely impact our properties directly and may lead to additional compliance obligations and costs as well as additional taxes and fees. Geographic concentration of our properties makes our business more vulnerable to natural disasters, severe weather conditions and climate change. Costs of environmental remediation may adversely impact our financial performance and reduce our cash flow.Risk Factors Related to Corporate MattersAn increased focus on metrics and reporting relating to environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks. An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties may subject us to loss of capital and revenue on those properties. Failure to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our business and operations. The unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of tenant or employee personal, financial or other data or of Regency’s proprietary or confidential information stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues.Risk Factors Related to Our Partnerships and Joint VenturesWe do not have voting control over all of the properties owned in our co-investment partnerships and joint ventures, so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued. The termination of our partnerships may adversely affect our cash flow, operating results, and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.Risk Factors Related to Funding Strategies and Capital StructureOur ability to sell properties and fund acquisitions and developments may be adversely impacted by higher market capitalization rates and lower NOI at our properties which may dilute earnings. We depend on external sources of capital, which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all. Our debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition. Covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition. Increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations. Hedging activity may expose us to risks, including the risks that a counterparty will not perform and that the hedge will not yield the economic benefits we anticipate, which may adversely affect us.Risk Factors Related to the Market Price for Our SecuritiesChanges in economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our securities. There is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at current or historical rates.Risk Factors Related to the Company’s Qualification as a REITIf the Company fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates.

EL as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on CarGurus CARG, Rivian Automotive RIVN and Honda HMC.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Company OverviewFounded in 2011, Sunnyvale, CA-based Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock CrowdStrike is a leader in next-generation endpoint protection, threat intelligence and cyberattack services. The company was formed when co-founders George Kurtz and Dmitri Alperovitch were inspired by the shortcomings in the previous-generation security software technologies. The company gains a leg up on the competition through its use of crowdsourced data from its customer base applied to modern technologies, including AI, cloud computing, and graph databases to detect threats and stop breaches.CrowdStrike specializes in endpoint protection and threat intelligence. Endpoints include devices such as laptops, desktop computers, smartphones, tablets, servers and other internet of things (IoT) devices. Endpoint protection aims to safeguard these devices from a wide range of threats including malware, ransomware, viruses, spyware, phishing attacks and other advanced cyber threats. Threat intelligence focuses on understanding the broader cybersecurity landscape including the motivations and capabilities of different threat actors as well as tactical threat intelligence which involves more specific and detailed information about current threats.A Growth StoryIt's difficult to find a company with higher and more consistent growth than CrowdStrike. Last quarter, earnings grew 84% year-over-year on revenue growth of 42%. Since going public in 2019, the company has grown annual revenue and earnings annually.Not only has CRWD grown earnings each year, the company has beat analyst expectations for every quarter as a public company thus far.Story continuesFuture OutlookIn recent quarters earnings growth has increased even more, spurred on by rising demand for security and networking products amid the growing hybrid working trend. Overall growth in cybersecurity demand is another significant catalyst. As hackers get more sophisticated, demand should rise. Pet Statista, the worldwide cybersecurity market is projected to reach $173.50 billion in 2023 and $262.40 billion by 2027. Analysts expect a similar, yet more robust trajectory for CRWD. Over the next 3 quarters, analysts expect CRWD to grow earnings at a healthy 50% clip.Consistency CrowdStrike is able to be consistent for three reasons: it has a subscription-based model (recurring sales), makes strategic acquisitions, and is using the latest in technology (AI) to stay ahead of the competition.Technical ViewCRWD's 50-day moving average crossed above its 200-day moving average recently, to trigger a bullish golden cross (signals a major trend change).TakeawayCrowdStrike is a leader in the cybersecurity industry because of its focus on new technology to thwart threats, strategic acquisitions, and subscription-based offering. Growing demand for cybersecurity solutions should only increase demand for CRWD's suite of products moving forward.Bear of the Day:Company OverviewNew York-based Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. is one of the world's leading manufacturers and marketers of skincare, makeup, fragrance, and hair care products. The company's products are sold through department stores, mass retailers, company-owned retail stores, hair salons, and travel-related establishments. Though the company is headquartered in the US, its manufacturing and research facilities are spread across Canada, Belgium, Switzerland, Japan, South Africa, and the UK.Inflation and Currency HeadwindsBecause of Estee Lauder's wide-ranging international presence, the company is exposed to unfavorable currency fluctuations. A strong US dollar will lead the company to increase prices or suffer from contracting profit margins. For now, the dollar is up roughly 4% over the past three weeks (a strong move for the dollar) and is on the brink of breaking out.Regardless of the fluctuations in the dollar, Estee Lauder has a much lower profit margin (9.41) versus the cosmetics industry (19.99).The Death of the Department StoreOne headwind that Estee Lauder has little control over is the death of the department store. The COVID-19 pandemic drove consumers away from department stores and to e-commerce platforms such as Amazon (a trend already in motion). Consumer preferences are also changing. Consumers are more drawn to specialty stores, boutiques, and direct-to-consumer brands than ever before.Increased Competition""Fast-fashion"" retailers have gained popularity for their ability to quickly respond to changing fashion trends. While EL earnings dropped 75% last quarter while competitor e.l.f. Beauty saw EPS launch by 182%, year-over-year. Consumers are clearly searching for inexpensive, high-quality cosmetics brands like ELF versus legacy, more expensive brands like EL. The trend is showing up in EL's estimates moving forward.Negative Earnings ESP ScoreEL is expected to report earnings on August 18th. Last quarter, EL missed earnings expectations by 4.08%. Investors should expect earnings to miss this quarter again because of its negative Earnings ESP Score. A negative Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) combined with a poor rank of strong sell suggests that the company will likely miss earnings expectations.Price is the Ultimate ArbiterBeyond the faltering fundamentals and business headwinds, EL shares exhibit relative weakness versus the general market and its industry group. Over the past year, EL shares are down 35%, while the Soap-Cosmetic Industry is flat.TakeawayCurrency headwinds, growing competition, and slowing growth point to a bleak outlook for Estee Lauder.Additional content:3 Auto Stocks Set to Outpace Estimates This Earnings SeasonThe Auto-Tires-Trucks sector is almost halfway through the Q2 earnings season. The picture thus far is one of continued resilience and strength. So far, eight S&amp;P 500 sector components — Tesla, Ford, General Motors, PACCAR, O'Reilly Automotive, Genuine Parts, BorgWarner and LKQ Corp — have reported quarterly numbers. All these companies managed to pull off an earnings beat.Per the Earnings Trend report dated Jul 26, the auto sector's earnings for the second quarter are expected to grow 14.6% on a year-over-year basis. As for revenues, they are estimated to rise 19.9% year over year.With a host of companies still left to release second-quarter 2023 results, we have identified —with the help of the Zacks Stock Screener — a few auto players, which are positioned to outshine the Zacks Consensus Estimate in second-quarter earnings. These include CarGurus, Rivian Automotive and Honda. Before we discuss the companies, let's take a look at the factors shaping the quarterly performance of automotive companies.Factors at PlayMost automakers experienced year-over-year sales growth in the second quarter of 2023, thanks to improving inventory levels. The demand for automobiles remained strong, indicating that the rise in interest rates did not significantly affect purchasing decisions. At the outset of 2023, industry experts anticipated a potential deceleration in the U.S. car market amid inflationary pressure and increased borrowing expenses. However, consumer demand demonstrated greater resilience than anticipated. Quoting Cox Automotive's chief economist Jonathan Smoke, ""Consumers have found a way to buy new wheels.""The seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate for June 2023 was 15.7-15.8 million vehicles, up from 15.1 million vehicles in May 2023 and 12.9 million units in June 2022. Per Cox Automotive, new vehicle sales in the second quarter of 2023 topped 4 million units, up 15% year over year and 13% sequentially.Supply constraints have been considerably alleviated. Limited new vehicle inventory over the past two years that had handcuffed sales is no longer a pressing concern. According to Cox Automotive, new vehicle inventory levels in the United States saw a significant increase of more than 70% in June compared to the same period last year.The rising popularity of new energy vehicles (including all-electric, hybrids and fuel-cell) is also expected to have fueled the revenues of automakers. Despite concerns over high borrowing costs, Americans' unwavering love for cars and pent-up demand are likely to have aided auto sales in the second quarter of 2023.Picking Potential WinnersWhile it is not possible to be sure about which companies are well positioned to beat earnings estimates, our proprietary methodology — Earnings ESP — makes it relatively simple. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Our research shows that for stocks with the abovementioned combination, the chances of an earnings beat are as high as 70%.Our ChoicesCarGurus: The company is an online automotive marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of new and used cars. CarGurus is the #1 listing platform, with the largest selection of vehicles in the United States. The acquisition of the CarOffer platform added wholesale vehicle acquisition and selling capabilities to CarGurus' portfolio of dealer offerings. The acquisition allows the firm to offer Instant Max Cash Offer to customers who wish to sell their car while purchasing a new one. This is likely to have benefited the firm.During the quarter to be reported, CarGurus enhanced automotive search and shopping by introducing the ChatGPT plugin, utilizing generative AI to provide shoppers with greater personalization and ease in exploring vehicle options without being restricted by specific search fields.CarGurus has an Earnings ESP of +7.14% and a Zacks Rank #1. The company is scheduled to release second-quarter results tomorrow. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CarGurus' to-be-reported quarter's earnings and revenues is pegged at 23 cents per share and $230 million, respectively. CARG surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in the other, with the average surprise being 49.5%.Rivian: The company delivered 12,640 vehicles in the second quarter of 2023. It produced 13,992 vehicles at its manufacturing facility in Normal, IL, during the three months, ended Jun 30, 2023. The production and delivery numbers witnessed an uptick from the second-quarter 2022 level. In the second quarter of 2022, the company had produced 4,401 vehicles and delivered 4,467 vehicles. Higher deliveries are likely to have boosted revenues in the quarter under review. Increasing cost efficiency is also likely to have aided its performance and narrowed loss from the year-ago levels.Rivian has an Earnings ESP of +0.75% and a Zacks Rank #2. The electric vehicle startup is scheduled to release second-quarter results on Aug 8. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Rivian's to-be-reported quarter's bottom line is pegged at a loss of $1.41 a share, indicating an improvement of 25.4% year over year. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $979 million. RIVN surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in one, with the average surprise being 6.08%.Honda: Higher year-over-year deliveries in America during the April-June period are likely to boost Honda's to-be-reported quarter results.  In the second quarter of the year, Honda achieved remarkable sales growth in the American market. In June alone, the company experienced a substantial 56.9% year-over-year increase in U.S. sales, reaching a total of 111,498 units sold. Throughout the entire quarter, Honda continued to thrive, with a notable 44.7% year-over-year growth, culminating in the sale of 347,025 units.Honda brand sales in the second quarter surged 42.6% year over year to 306,848 units, while Acura brand sales soared 63.2% to 40,177 units. One of the driving forces behind Honda's success was the surge in electrified vehicle sales.Honda has an Earnings ESP of +9.65% and a Zacks Rank #3. Japan's auto giant is scheduled to release fiscal first quarter 2024 results on Aug 9. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Honda's to-be-reported quarter's earnings and revenues is pegged at 99 cents per share and $33.6 billion, respectively. HMC missed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and beat in one, with the average negative surprise being 9.08%.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

""We continue delivering on our customer-focused strategy, bringing value to the communities we serve by investing in a diverse energy mix and ensuring a safe, reliable and resilient grid.""Utilities and Corporate Services - Alliant Energy’s Utilities and Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc. (Corporate Services) operations generated $0.65 per share of GAAP EPS in the second quarter of 2023, which was $0.04 per share higher than the second quarter of 2022. The primary drivers of higher EPS were higher revenue requirements and allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) from Wisconsin Power and Light Company’s (WPL’s) capital investments, and WPL electric fuel-related costs, net of recoveries. These items were partially offset by lower retail electric and gas sales as a result of temperatures, and higher interest expense. Retail electric and gas sales were higher than normal in 2022 due to the impacts of warmer than normal temperatures, while temperatures had minimal impact in the second quarter of 2023.Non-utility and Parent - Alliant Energy’s Non-utility and Parent operations generated $(0.04) per share of GAAP EPS in the second quarter of 2023, which was a $0.03 per share earnings decrease compared to the second quarter of 2022. The lower EPS was primarily driven by higher interest expense.Story continuesDetails regarding GAAP EPS variances between the second quarters of 2023 and 2022 for Alliant Energy are as follows:VarianceRevenue requirements and higher AFUDC from WPL capital investments$0.06WPL electric fuel-related costs, net of recoveries0.03Estimated temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales(0.05)Higher interest expense(0.05)Other0.02Total$0.01Revenue requirements and higher AFUDC from WPL capital investments - In December 2021, WPL received an order from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) approving WPL’s proposed settlement for its retail electric and gas rate review covering the 2022/2023 Test Period. In December 2022, WPL received an order from the PSCW approving an additional annual base rate increase of $9 million for WPL’s retail gas customers covering the 2023 Test Period. WPL recognized a $0.03 per share increase in the second quarter of 2023 due to higher revenue requirements from increasing rate base, including investments in solar generation. The construction activity related to these investments also resulted in $0.03 per share higher AFUDC in the second quarter of 2023.WPL electric fuel-related costs, net of recoveries - WPL recognized $0.03 per share of higher earnings from changes in WPL electric fuel-related costs since actual fuel and purchased power prices were lower than the 2023 fuel component of retail electric rates, compared to the second quarter of 2022 when actual fuel and purchased power prices were higher than the 2022 fuel component of retail electric rates.Estimated temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales - Temperatures had minimal impact on Alliant Energy’s retail electric and gas sales in the second quarter of 2023, compared to an estimated increase of $0.05 per share in the second quarter of 2022 due to the impacts of warmer than normal temperatures on customer demand.Higher interest expense - Total long-term debt increased due to additional financings in 2022 and 2023 largely to fund capital expenditures, including the solar expansion program in Wisconsin. In addition, increases in short-term debt interest rates contributed to higher interest expense in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.2023 Earnings GuidanceAlliant Energy is reaffirming its consolidated EPS guidance for 2023 of $2.82 - $2.96. Assumptions for Alliant Energy’s 2023 EPS guidance include, but are not limited to:Ability of Interstate Power and Light Company (IPL) and WPL to earn their authorized rates of returnStable economy and resulting implications on utility salesNormal temperatures in its utility service territoriesExecution of cost controlsExecution of capital expenditure and financing plansConsolidated effective tax rate of 2%The 2023 earnings guidance does not include the impacts of any material non-cash valuation adjustments, regulatory-related charges or credits, reorganizations or restructurings, future changes in laws including corporate tax reform in Iowa, regulations or regulatory policies, changes in credit loss liabilities related to guarantees, pending lawsuits and disputes, settlement charges related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans, federal and state income tax audits and other Internal Revenue Service proceedings, impacts from changes to the authorized return on equity for ATC, changes in GAAP and tax methods of accounting that may impact the reported results of Alliant Energy, or certain nonrecurring or infrequent items that are, in management’s view, not reflective of ongoing operations.Because Alliant Energy is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, 2023 EPS, the EPS guidance may not align with GAAP EPS if the assumptions described above are not realized or any nonrecurring or infrequent items occur, and no reconciliation is being provided.Earnings Conference CallA conference call to review the second quarter 2023 results is scheduled for Friday, August 4, 2023 at 9 a.m. central time. Alliant Energy Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer John Larsen, President and Chief Operating Officer Lisa Barton, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Robert Durian will host the call.

REGN delivered better-than-expected second-quarter 2023 results even though lead drug Eylea’s sales declined. Dupixent maintained its stellar performance, driven by continued strong demand in the approved indications, atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis.Regeneron’s shares have gained 1.4% so far this year against the industry’s decline of 13%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company reported second-quarter earnings of $10.24 per share, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.92. The year-ago quarter recorded earnings per share of $9.77.Total revenues in the reported quarter were up 11% year over year to $3.1 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3 billion.Quarterly HighlightsLead drug Eylea’s sales in the United States were $1.5 billion, down 7% year over year, primarily due to a lower net selling price driven by changing market dynamics, including increased competition. Please note that Regeneron co-developed Eylea with the HealthCare unit of Bayer AG BAYRY. Eylea’s sales also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.53 billion.Regeneron records net product sales of Eylea in the United States and Bayer records net product sales of Eylea outside the United States. Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with sales of Eylea outside the United States.Total revenues include collaboration revenues of $1.3 billion from Sanofi SNY and Bayer, up from $1 billion in the year-ago quarter. Sanofi’s collaboration revenues increased by 39% to $944 million, driven by profits associated with higher Dupixent sales. We note that Sanofi records global net product sales of Dupixent and Kevzara, while Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with global sales of both drugs. Dupixent’s sales surged 33% year over year to $2.8 billion.Bayer’s collaboration revenues came in at $377 million, up 5% from the year-ago quarter.Story continuesRegeneron records net product sales of Praluent in the United States and Sanofi records net product sales of Praluent outside the United States and pays the company a royalty on such sales. Prior to Jul 1, 2022, Regeneron recorded net product sales of Libtayo in the United States and Sanofi recorded net product sales of Libtayo outside the United States. Effective Jul 1, 2022, Regeneron records global net product sales of Libtayo outside the United States and pays a royalty to Sanofi on such sales.Total Libtayo sales came in at $210 million, up 49%. Praluent’s global net sales totaled $140.3 million in the reported quarter, up 29% year over year. Kevzara recorded sales of $99.5 million, up 21% from the year-ago quarter.REGEN-COV, its antibody cocktail for COVID-19, did not generate any sales in the quarter. Regeneron records net product sales of REGEN-COV in connection with its agreements with the U.S. government, while its partner Roche RHHBY records net product sales of the antibody cocktail outside the United States. The companies share gross profits from global sales based on a pre-specified formula.Adjusted R&amp;D expenses jumped 41% to $973.6 million, while SG&amp;A expenses increased 34.6% to $562.2 million in the year-ago quarter.Pipeline and Regulatory UpdateThe FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) to the company’s biologics license application seeking approval for the 8 mg dose strength of aflibercept for the treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy.Regeneron has reported that the cause of the CRL is only an ongoing review of inspection findings at a third-party filler, Catalent. The company reaffirmed that the CRL was not levied due to issues with the clinical efficacy or safety, trial design and labeling or drug substance manufacturing of aflibercept 8 mg. The company also stated that the FDA had not requested any additional clinical data or studies for the drug candidate.The FDA has informed Regeneron and Catalent that certain manufacturing data and other information are required from Catalent to allow the regulatory body to approve aflibercept 8 mg. Regeneron expects that these data and information will be submitted to the FDA by mid-August 2023. The FDA plans to prioritize the review of this submission.Regeneron anticipates a regulatory action by the FDA on the aflibercept 8 mg BLA during the third quarter of 2023.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteOur TakeRegeneron’s second-quarter results beat estimates but Eylea’s sales declined. Eylea sales have been under pressure in the last couple of quarters due to competition from Roche’s Vabysmo and sale deductions.Nevertheless, the company should benefit from Dupixent’s continued label expansions and solid demand. The potential approval of aflibercept 8 mg, albeit delayed due to CRL, will be a great boost to the company. The company’s progress with the oncology portfolio is also impressive.Regeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $9.77 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.23%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this biopharmaceutical company would post earnings of $9.25 per share when it actually produced earnings of $10.09, delivering a surprise of 9.08%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Regeneron , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, posted revenues of $3.16 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.77%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.86 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Regeneron shares have added about 1.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 17.6%.What's Next for Regeneron?While Regeneron has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Regeneron: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future.

The current consensus EPS estimate is $10.53 on $3.17 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $39.97 on $12.58 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

484,1aff5f77-6d64-3aac-83eb-61f3d8b30df2,UNP,2023-08-04,All eyes on Vena as he takes helm at Union Pacific,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eyes-vena-takes-helm-union-110000687.html,1691060400,STORY,"['UNP', 'CP']","[Stakeholders are wondering what Jim Vena will do as the next CEO of Union Pacific. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Freight rail stakeholders will be watching closely as Union Pacific’s incoming CEO Jim Vena takes over the company, especially given how labor and operational dynamics have changed over the last three years since the industry veteran was last at UP as chief operating officer and later strategic adviser.Vena, whose appointment came amid hedge fund pressure to change leadership, will assume his new role Aug. 14, replacing outgoing CEO Lance Fritz. Beth Whited, who is currently UP’s executive vice president for strategy and sustainability, will be promoted to the railroad’s president that same day.Growth or OR?What observers see as being the heart of the matter is whether Vena will focus on improving operations and creating efficiencies or on attracting more business to the railroad and pursuing growth opportunities — even if it means potentially higher costs in the short term via ensuring UP (NYSE: UNP) has sufficient employee head count to ensure smooth operations.Union Pacific incoming CEO Jim Vena. (Photo: Union Pacific)Vena is a 40-plus-year industry veteran who was instrumental in implementing precision scheduled railroading (PSR), a tool used to streamline operations and cut costs, at UP. He also worked at CN under Hunter Harrison, who is regarded as introducing the PSR model to the Class I railroads. Harrison had been CEO of Illinois Central, CN, Canadian Pacific and CSX. He died while serving as CSX’s CEO in December 2017.While Vena’s appointment is “undeniably good, it does buck the recent trend of younger, growth-oriented (often former [chief marketing officers]) CEOs” who have been appointed at Norfolk Southern, BNSF, CNI and CSX — “the New Leaders of what I have been calling The Great Experiment,” said independent Wall Street analyst Tony Hatch in a recent note on the appointment. “Which brings us back to the great philosophical question of who should run a railroad — COO or CMO (simplistically)?”And although Keith Creel, president and CEO of Canadian Pacific Kansas City, previously served as Canadian Pacific’s COO and also worked under Harrison, Creel has proven that he can be pro-growth, Hatch said. Meanwhile, others, particularly Harrison, have been known best — “and appreciated by investors” — as margin enhancers who focus on reducing a company’s operating ratio.Story continuesHedge fund Soroban Capital Partners pushed for Vena’s appointment at UP earlier this year, and hedge fund TCI tried to install Vena as CEO at CN to replace former CN CEO Jean-Jacques Ruest. Still, Vena’s appointment at UP points to “existential questions for the future of the railway(s),” Hatch said.Union members skeptical of appointmentLast week’s announcement of Vena’s appointment as CEO has gotten some criticism from union members and skepticism from shippers.After UP’s announcement of Vena’s appointment, five leaders with the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers – Transportation Division (SMART-TD) voiced their disapproval of the selection because of the way Vena implemented PSR at UP. “Watching Union Pacific place this Albatross as CEO for the foreseeable future is heartbreaking for those of us who have worked hard to bring Union Pacific back from the brink,” a July 26 letter to Maqui Parkerson, UP vice president of labor relations, said.The leaders also expressed doubt that Vena would make or maintain SMART-TD’s collective bargaining agreements. They had planned to meet with outgoing UP CEO Fritz in August, but said they would set their sights on tentatively scheduled meetings in September and November.“We have every intention to negotiate in good faith … however, we also feel that there is very little chance your group will be allowed to do likewise,” the letter said. “SMART-TD has worked vigorously to make agreements designed around real change and real quality of life for our membership. Make no mistake, we do not wish to abandon the work we have done or the progress we have made during this time.”The letter went on to say that “Union Pacific took a giant step backwards in its leadership and has lost our trust with the announcement. … We need to see positive actions, not words … from this new group of leadership before any faith can be restored. Until then, we remain skeptical and are preparing our membership for another round of poor service to customers and decreased quality of life.”Greg Regan, president of the Transportation Trades Department (TTD), echoed the senitments of the SMART-TD leaders.“We are deeply disappointed in Union Pacific’s decision to appoint former Chief Operating Officer Jim Vena as CEO given his history with Precision Scheduled Railroading and the pain he inflicted on the rail workforce. Buckling to Wall Street pressure, Union Pacific’s decision to hire Mr. Vena demonstrates that it is doubling down on a failed business model and gambling with the company’s future,” Regan said. TTD is affilated with the AFL-CIO. “The freight rail industry’s success depends on fresh leadership that can guide carriers away from the PSR past and towards a future that prioritizes safety, service, and staffing.”Investors also express surpriseMeanwhile, investment firms generally praised the appointment because of Vena’s operational track record at UP and other Class I railroads, particularly at a time when UP has been seeking to improve service metrics.But investors were also surprised by the timing of the announcement since Vena’s name as a potential successor had been floated around in February by Soroban Capital Partners when UP’s new CEO search became public.Some investors had also thought UP’s next CEO would have a marketing focus or would have been an industry outsider because of the shifting industry dynamics that Hatch alluded to.“We’ve known Mr. Vena since he was COO of CNI in the mid-2010s, and think highly of both his rail operating expertise (developed with Hunter Harrison and Keith Creel) and ability to tell the company’s story crisply to investors,” said a July 26 note from Susquehanna transportation analyst Bascome Majors. “We feel he was the best candidate available to get the trains running consistently at UNP over time, but our sense and read of the market consensus had moved on to ‘the field’ with an outsider most likely the odds-on favorite to win the CEO seat at UNP (similar to Joe Hinrichs at CSX last year). Looking forward, we believe the valuation bump will likely be durable for UNP into 2024 and are eager to see Mr. Vena roll out his strategy to railroaders, customers, and investors this fall and next year.”Said Morgan Stanley transportation analyst Ravi Shanker in a July 26 note: “All eyes will be on the appointment of Mr. Vena as new CEO. We do not expect a redux of his 2019-2020 stint as COO. … Mr. Vena is a well known figure and the market will cheer his appointment. However, we would note that the Rail industry environment of today is very different from the PSR-fueled cost cutting world of 2019, when Mr. Vena was COO of UNP.“On the one hand, UNP likely does not have the bandwidth or low-hanging fruit to cut costs today as it did in 2019 esp. after the long, hard efforts to resource up and restore service in the last 3 years,” Shanker said. “On the other hand, even if UNP tries to aggressively cut costs, we believe customers, regulators (the STB) and perhaps even Congress may take notice with potentially negative outcomes.”UP’s new management team, which will include Whited as president, will likely be focusing on growth given the new industry dynamics, Shanker said.For its part, UP acknowledged that 2023 is a different time from even recent history.In a statement to FreightWaves in response to the July 26 SMART-TD letter, the railroad said: “Class 1 railroads are in a different era with new stakeholder expectations. Transportation and markets demand new approaches and strategies to meet customer requirements. Union Pacific is proud of the sick leave agreements that we reached with 12 of 13 unions and remains committed to continuing work to address quality-of-life issues.“Incoming Union Pacific Chief Executive Officer Jim Vena, who started his railroading career as a brakeman, understands firsthand the challenges of our craft professionals and will be meeting with Union Pacific employees and other key stakeholders soon after assuming his new position Aug. 14.”Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:Vena returning to Union Pacific as new CEOUnion Pacific on lookout for new CEOUnion Pacific Investors Like What They See in New COONew labor agreements expected to cost Union Pacific millionsUnion Pacific and SMART-TD hash out sick leave dealUnion Pacific and locomotive engineers ink sick leave dealUP, train engineers reach ‘historic’ deal addressing work-life balanceThe post All eyes on Vena as he takes helm at Union Pacific appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

(NYSE:AMP) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial Ameriprise Financial Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairman &amp; CEO, James Cracchiolo, sold US$14m worth of shares at a price of US$353 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$352. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In the last year Ameriprise Financial insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Ameriprise Financial Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Ameriprise Financial. In total, Executive VP &amp; Global Chief Information Officer Gerard Smyth dumped US$843k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Ameriprise Financial insiders own about US$115m worth of shares (which is 0.3% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Ameriprise Financial Insiders?An insider sold Ameriprise Financial shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for Ameriprise Financial that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course Ameriprise Financial may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

492,ec2ee533-2573-3453-99e8-06a95452e035,CSCO,2023-08-04,Investing in Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) five years ago would have delivered you a 40% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-cisco-systems-nasdaq-csco-140054865.html,1691071254,STORY,['CSCO'],"[If you buy and hold a stock for many years, you'd hope to be making a profit. Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. But Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 20% over five years, which is below the market return. Over the last twelve months the stock price has risen a very respectable 15%.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for Cisco Systems To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the five years of share price growth, Cisco Systems moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up. Since the company was unprofitable five years ago, but not three years ago, it's worth taking a look at the returns in the last three years, too. Indeed, the Cisco Systems share price has gained 11% in three years. Meanwhile, EPS is up 3.5% per year. That makes EPS very close to the 4% share price growth, each year, over the same period. So one might argue that investor sentiment towards the stock hss not changed much over time. Arguably the share price is reflecting the earnings per share.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Cisco Systems' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Cisco Systems, it has a TSR of 40% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Cisco Systems shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 19% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 7% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. If you would like to research Cisco Systems in more detail then you might want to take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in the company.Of course Cisco Systems may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of growth stocks.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?
