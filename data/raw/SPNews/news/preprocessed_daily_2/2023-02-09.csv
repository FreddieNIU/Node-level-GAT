Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Bowman Consulting Group Ltd. BWMN, OneSpaWorld Holdings Ltd. OSW, Verisk Analytics, Inc. VRSK and MSCI Inc. MSCI.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:4 Stocks to Buy on Solid Rebound in Service Sector ActivityThe U.S. service sector, which had slowed in December, made a solid rebound in January, as new orders recovered and material costs paid by businesses declined. Inflation has been easing over the past few months, indicating that the economy may have a softer landing in 2023 as fears of a possible recession still loom large.The rebound in the services sector activity is also an indication that people are now more confident about the economy and are willing to spend more. Given this situation, business services stocks like Bowman Consulting Group Ltd., OneSpaWorld Holdings Ltd., Verisk Analytics, Inc. and MSCI Inc. are likely to benefit in the near term.Services Sector Activity GrowsThe Institute for Supply Management reported on Feb 3 that its services sector Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 55.2 in January, after declining to 49.2 in December. This was also above analysts’ expectations of a rise to 50.4%. A reading of anything above 50 suggests an increase in service activities.December’s contraction was the first in 30 months or since May 2020. The services sector has now grown for 31 months out of the past 32 months.Given that manufacturing output has been declining and consumer spending has been becoming more constrained as a result of rising commodity prices, a rise in services activity raises hopes that the economy has not yet succumbed to inflationary pressures.In fact, the jump in services sector activity comes as data showed inflation has been easing over the past three months.Story continuesJanuary’s solid rebound was led by a jump in new orders. The New Orders Index rose to 60.4% in January from 49.2% in December. Also, the Business Activity Index increased to 60.4% in January, increasing 6.9% compared to the seasonally adjusted reading of 53.5% in December.The Supplier Deliveries Index remained unchanged at 50%, while the Prices Index came up with a reading of 67.8% in January, down 0.3% from December.Economy StabilizingAlthough inflation is still at multi-year highs, it has been slowing lately. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index fell to 5% in December from 5.5% in November year over year, according to data released by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis on January 27.The preferred inflation index of the Fed, Core PCE, decreased from 4.7% in November to 4.4% in December. The last quarter of 2022 saw a significant slowdown in inflation, which gave millions of people confidence that the economy may see a softer landing in 2023 and receded fears of a recession.Additionally, the U.S. GDP grew 2.9% in the fourth quarter for the second consecutive quarter after declining in the previous two quarters.Consumer sentiment has also increased as a result of GDP growth and easing inflation. According to the University of Michigan’s survey, consumer sentiment increased to 64.9 in January after rising to 59.7 in December. The figure for January is the highest since April 2022, proving once again that people are increasingly optimistic about an economic recovery.Our ChoicesGiven this situation, it makes for an ideal opportunity to invest in these four stocks.Bowman Consulting Group Ltd. provides planning, engineering, construction management, commissioning, environmental consulting, geomatics, survey, land procurement and other technical services to customers operating in a diverse set of regulated end markets.

2,25f91dc0-429a-3291-8d07-20a9a781fedb,TXN,2023-02-09,Why You Should Care About Texas Instruments' (NASDAQ:TXN) Strong Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-care-texas-instruments-nasdaq-110017494.html,1675940417,STORY,['TXN'],"[What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, the ROCE of Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) looks attractive right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Texas Instruments:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.42 = US$10b ÷ (US$27b - US$3.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, Texas Instruments has an ROCE of 42%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 15% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Texas Instruments compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Texas Instruments here  for free.What Can We Tell From Texas Instruments' ROCE Trend?In terms of Texas Instruments' history of ROCE, it's quite impressive. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 42% and the business has deployed 57% more capital into its operations. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn short, we'd argue Texas Instruments has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.If you'd like to know more about Texas Instruments, we've spotted   3 warning signs,  and 2 of them are a bit concerning.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

3,fe01584b-02f1-3f5c-af8c-8340295e813c,TXN,2023-02-09,The 7 Most Undervalued Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in February 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-most-undervalued-blue-chip-144514633.html,1675608314,STORY,"['AXP', 'TXN', 'CVX', 'HD', 'JPM', 'CAT', 'MRK']","[Blue-chip stocks are recognized as being among the largest, most stable stocks an investor can own. And in this article, we’ll be looking at seven undervalued blue-chip stocks to consider now. Many pay a dividend that in many cases has been growing for several years. Better, these are the stocks that allow investors to rest easy during volatile times. That makes them an excellent choice for investors who are looking to stay in the market and protect their capital.  Some of the top ones to consider include:JPMJP Morgan Chase$141.09MRKMerck$102.94CVXChevron$169.45CATCaterpillar$247.76AXPAmerican Express$178.86HDHome Depot$331.50TXNTexas Instruments$182.29JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Blue poker chips stacked next to three stacks of $100 bills representing blue chip stocksSource: ShutterstockStrong fundamentals are a distinguishing quality of blue chips. And few banks have the balance sheet of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). That strength was on display in the company’s first-quarter earnings report. JPMorgan reported earnings per share of $3.57 on revenue of $34.55 billion. Both numbers beat analysts’ expectations. The significance of this double beat takes on more significance in a weakening economy. Banks are setting more money aside to protect against rising credit losses. However, as the largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan should have no problem delivering sufficient earnings that will allow it to support its dividend and continue its share repurchases.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsJPMorgan Chase makes this list of undervalued blue chip stocks with a P/E ratio of 11.67. In addition, the JPM stock has been up 34% since the middle of Oct. Analysts suggest there’s approximately 11% upside for the stock price which is supported by a dividend that currently pays out $4 per share on an annual basis and has an appealing yield of 2.88%.  Merck (MRK) Source: ShutterstockMerck (NYSE:MRK) just delivered another strong earnings report. On Feb. 2, the company Merck posted revenue of $13.83 billion and EPS of $1.62. It’s also one of the top undervalued blue-chip stocks to buy now.Story continuesA significant reason for the company’s strong results is likely the strength of the company’s Keytruda drug which has been approved for the treatment of several forms of cancer. Keytruda has become a cornerstone of Merck’s revenue growth since it was approved by the FDA in 2018. In fact, in 2022 it accounted for approximately 40% of the company’s pharmaceutical sales.  Unlike many stocks on this list, Merck did not benefit from the Jan. rally. After being up about 26% in 2022, MRK stock was down more than 6% in Jan. However, the stock trades for around 17x earnings. And the company’s earnings are projected to increase at an average rate of around 10% over the next five years which will be sufficient for future stock price growth.  Chevron (CVX) 10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockWith the performance of energy stocks in 2022, it might surprise you to find an oil stock on this list of undervalued blue-chip stocks. But things are cheap in the oil patch these days. And that’s great news for companies, like Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Trading at around 9x earnings, CVX stock is a bargain, particularly as their stock is down about 5.5% to start the year. The company’s breakeven price for crude oil is well below the current price of around $80 per barrel. And crude prices may be rising as part of the ongoing budget negotiations between the House of Representatives and the Biden administration. And the story of Chevron isn’t limited to fossil fuels. The company is one of the world’s leading exporters of liquefied natural gas (LNG) which is seeing increased demand, particularly from Europe.  Caterpillar (CAT) Source: ShutterstockEarnings reports can make investors prisoners of the moment. In my opinion, that’s the case of the approximately 6% drop in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) stock in the week it reported mixed earnings. The company beat on the top line but missed on the bottom line.  That was enough for investors looking for a reason to clip the wings of CAT stock which was up nearly 40% in the last 12 months. But it could also be that some investors were taking some profit before sending the stock to new highs. The thesis is simple. Much of the spending for the Infrastructure Act is only now making its way into the economy. And the company is also likely to benefit as the oil and gas sector may increase capital spending this year. That means that Caterpillar will likely see strong revenue and earnings growth for the next several quarters.  American Express (AXP) Source: ShutterstockAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) illustrates the bifurcation that’s happening in the U.S. economy. On the one hand, the company’s most recent earnings report showed that the company is having to set aside more of its profits to cover potential charge-offs as delinquencies rise.  This is troubling because American Express is typically associated with higher-income card members. However, investors may be seeing it as a natural, if an unfortunate byproduct of American Express adopting a business model that encourages cardmembers to carry a balance.  On the other hand, the company still is seeing strong revenue growth and is forecasting solid earnings growth for the rest of 2023. The company is benefiting from “high customer growth.” And that premium customer will likely be the company’s focus for the rest of the year.  AXP stock trades for approximately 17x earnings and is up 16.78% in the last month. Despite the earnings report, the stock is still holding on to a 2% gain in the week since releasing earnings.  Home Depot (HD)  the words ""blue chip"" in bold font overtop of a pile of cash. Blue-chip stocksSource: ShutterstockNext on this list of undervalued blue-chip stocks is Home Depot (NYSE:HD). HD stock is up more than 7% in 2023. That’s continuing a rally that started in the last three months of 2022.  The stock of Home Depot and competitors like Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) was hit hard in 2022 as the housing market dried up in the face of higher interest rates. But prices are rallying as the company’s financials are proving the thesis that homeowners are choosing to love the house they have. This is a good reminder that Home Depot is a home improvement store. And that improvement goes on independently of the real estate market.  I considered putting Lowe’s on this list instead of Home Depot. But as of this writing, HD stock is trading at around 20x earnings which is slightly more attractive than LOW stock. And Home Depot pays a more attractive dividend that currently pays out $7.60 per share annually and has been increasing for the last 13 consecutive years.  Texas Instruments (TXN)  Blue poker chips stacked next to three stacks of $100 bills representing blue chip stocksSource: ShutterstockAnalyzing stocks is an imperfect science. In Oct. I listed Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) on a list of semiconductor stocks that were drawing the attention of analysts. So far, that attention has led to TXN stock climbing by about 15%. This reflects renewed optimism surrounding the demand for semiconductor chips in 2023.  This week, General Motors (NYSE:GM) told analysts that it was seeing an unwinding of the supply chain struggles that have suppressed new car production. Since Texas Instruments gets approximately 25% of its revenue from the automotive market, news like this is likely to be bullish for TXN stock. The average new car now has over 3,000 semiconductor chips. TXN stock is currently trading at a price-earnings ratio of around 19x which makes it slightly less expensive than the S&amp;P 500. However, the company does pay a dividend that pays out $4.96 per share on an annual basis and has been increasing for 19 consecutive years.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in CVX.

Year-end 2022 reserves are supported by 367 proven undeveloped locations that are part of our five-year plan. In addition, Range has thousands of additional high-quality locations beyond this five-year development window that are not currently booked as reserves, and these are supported by continued strong performance from our approximate 1,400 producing Marcellus wells. We believe Range is well-positioned with inventory depth that will drive sustainable, long-term value and capital returns to shareholders.”2022 Proved Reserves Year-end 2022 proved reserves were 18.1 Tcfe, a 2% increase over prior year. By volume, proved reserves were 65.3% natural gas, 33.3% natural gas liquids and 1.4% crude oil and condensate. Proved developed reserves represent 60% of the Company’s reserves.Summary of Changes in Proved Reserves(in Bcfe)  Balance at December 31, 2021 17,775  Extensions, discoveries and additions1,668Performance revisions73Locations Re-entered to Development Plan716Reclassification of PUD to unproved under SEC 5-year rule(1,381)Price revisions1Production(774)  Balance at December 31, 2022 18,078  During 2022, Range added 1.7 Tcfe of proved reserves through the drill-bit, driven by steady Marcellus shale development. Positive field-level performance additions increased reserves by 73 Bcfe. This marked the 15th consecutive year of positive performance revisions driven by continued strong results from existing Marcellus producing wells. Range increased reserves by 716 Bcfe associated with proved undeveloped locations that re-entered the Company’s five-year drilling program, while removing 1,381 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves that now fall outside the SEC mandated five-year development window. The Company expects these proved undeveloped reserves to be added back in future years when they re-enter the development plan. As shown in the table below, the present value (PV10) of reserves under SEC methodology was $29.6 billion at December 31, 2022. For comparison, the PV10 using January 31, 2023 strip prices equates to $15.1 billion using the same proven reserve volumes.Story continues 2022 SECPricing(a)Strip PriceAverage(b)   Natural Gas Price ($/MMBtu)$6.36$4.22WTI Oil Price ($/Bbl)$94.13$63.15NGL Price ($/Bbl)$38.35$24.11   Proved Reserves PV10 ($ billions)$29.6$15.1 (a)SEC benchmark prices adjusted for energy content, quality and basis differentials were $6.08 per mcf and $87.14 per barrel of crude oil. (b)NYMEX 10-year strip prices adjusted for energy content, quality and basis differentials realized an average gas price differential of ($0.37) and an average realized oil differential of ($6.99) per barrel, which equate to $4.24 per mcf and $52.60 per barrel over the life of the reserves.   Year-end 2022 reserves included 7.1 Tcfe of proved undeveloped reserves from 367 wells planned to be developed within the next five years with an expected development cost of $0.41 per mcfe. Future development costs included in the year-end 2022 reserve report utilized estimates consistent with 2023 expected drilling and completion costs. Beyond the five-year reserve calculation window, Range has thousands of high-quality wells in the Marcellus and thousands of locations in the Utica and Upper Devonian horizons. Range also has a network of more than 250 existing well pads that provide Range the opportunity to develop thousands of future wells while utilizing existing roads, pads and infrastructure. Consistent with past years, approximately half or Range’s wells expected to turn to sales in 2023 are from pad sites with existing production.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe believe that the presentation of PV10 is relevant and useful to our investors as supplemental disclosure to the standardized measure, or after-tax amount, because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before taking into account future corporate income taxes and our current tax structure. While the standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each company, PV10 is based on prices and discount factors that are consistent for all companies. Because of this, PV10 can be used within the industry and by creditors and security analysts to evaluate estimated net cash flows from proved reserves on a more comparable basis.RANGE RESOURCES CORPORATION (NYSE: RRC) is a leading U.S. independent natural gas and NGL producer with operations focused on stacked-pay projects in the Appalachian Basin. The Company pursues an organic development strategy targeting high return, low-cost projects within its large inventory of low-risk drilling opportunities.

All statements, except for statements of historical fact, made within this release regarding activities, events or developments the Company expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future, such as those regarding future well costs and productivity, future commodity fundamentals and pricing, anticipated drilling and completion activity, anticipated wells to be turned to sales and expected development costs, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements are based on assumptions and estimates that management believes are reasonable based on currently available information; however, management’s assumptions and Range’s future performance are subject to a wide range of business risks and uncertainties and there is no assurance that these goals and projections can or will be met. Any number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Further information on risks and uncertainties is available in Range’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless required by law, Range undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events after the date they are made. The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose proved reserves, which are estimates that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions as well as the option to disclose probable and possible reserves. Range has elected not to disclose its probable and possible reserves in its filings with the SEC. Range uses certain broader terms such as “resource potential,” “unrisked resource potential,” “unproved resource potential” or “upside” or other descriptions of volumes of resources potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that may include probable and possible reserves as defined by the SEC’s guidelines. Range has not attempted to distinguish probable and possible reserves from these broader classifications. The SEC’s rules prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC these broader classifications of reserves. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized. Unproved resource potential refers to Range’s internal estimates of hydrocarbon quantities that may be potentially discovered through exploratory drilling or recovered with additional drilling or recovery techniques and have not been reviewed by independent engineers. Unproved resource potential does not constitute reserves within the meaning of the Society of Petroleum Engineer’s Petroleum Resource Management System and does not include proved reserves. Area wide unproven resource potential has not been fully risked by Range’s management. “EUR”, or estimated ultimate recovery, refers to our management’s estimates of hydrocarbon quantities that may be recovered from a well completed as a producer in the area. These quantities may not necessarily constitute or represent reserves within the meaning of the Society of Petroleum Engineer’s Petroleum Resource Management System or the SEC’s oil and natural gas disclosure rules. Actual quantities that may be recovered from Range’s interests could differ substantially. Factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of Range’s drilling program, which will be directly affected by the availability of capital, drilling and production costs, commodity prices, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, transportation constraints, regulatory approvals, field spacing rules, recoveries of gas in place, length of horizontal laterals, actual drilling results, including geological and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates and other factors. Estimates of resource potential may change significantly as development of our resource plays provides additional data. In addition, our production forecasts and expectations for future periods are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the undertaking and outcome of future drilling activity, which may be affected by significant commodity price declines or drilling cost increases.

The complex will be integrated into Linde’s existing gas infrastructure on the U.S. Gulf Coast.Linde will develop, own and operate an on-site complex at the OCI facility, which will include auto thermal reforming, a process to produce low-carbon hydrogen with carbon capture. The facility will also include a massive air separation plant.The agreement has been signed as the world seeks low-carbon sources to meet energy requirements and reduce emissions. Per the International Renewable Energy Agency, ammonia production makes up about 15-20% of carbon dioxide emissions from the chemical sector. However, low-carbon ammonia production methods, such as using blue hydrogen, can reduce emissions.Linde will also utilize its pipeline network to provide clean hydrogen to its customers in the Gulf Coast area looking to decarbonize their operations while also supplying atmospheric and rare gases.Linde’s capabilities are enabling the transition to a low-carbon-intensity economy.

8,6789ab92-015e-346e-9bbe-d193a026eb4a,ARE,2023-02-09,What's in Store for W. P. Carey (WPC) This Earnings Season?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-store-w-p-carey-153603110.html,1675870563,STORY,"['WPC', 'PLD', 'ARE']","[W. P. Carey Inc. WPC is set to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 results on Feb 10 before market open. While its quarterly revenues are likely to have witnessed year-over-year growth, funds from operations (FFO) per share might have displayed a decline from the year-ago reported figure.In the last reported quarter, this New York-based net lease REIT delivered a surprise of 5.43% for the adjusted FFO per share.Over the trailing four quarters, W. P. Carey’s adjusted FFO per share surpassed estimates on each occasion, the average surprise being 4.11%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:W.P. Carey Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseW.P. Carey Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseW.P. Carey Inc. price-eps-surprise | W.P. Carey Inc. QuoteThis diversified net lease REIT specializes in sale-leasebacks, build-to-suits and the acquisition of single-tenant net lease properties. WPC is poised to benefit from its portfolio of operationally-critical commercial real estate, which it leases back to creditworthy tenants on a long-term basis with built-in rent escalators. Having contractual rent escalators covering nearly the entire portfolio is a saving grace in the current inflationary environment and indicates credit strength.W. P. Carey focuses on investing in high-quality single-tenant industrial, warehouse, office, retail and self-storage properties. These are located mainly in the United States and Northern and Western Europe.WPC is also focused on capitalizing on accretive investment opportunities. These investments come as part of the company’s external growth strategy and diversified approach.W. P. Carey’s investment volume for the full-year 2022 reached $1.42 billion. High-quality, single-tenant warehouse and industrial properties comprised roughly two-thirds of its 2022 investment volume.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $398.15 million, indicating a 6.21% increase from the prior-year quarter. The consensus estimate for lease revenues for the fourth quarter is currently pegged at $338.24 million, ahead of the prior-year quarter’s figure of $305.09 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from real estate ownership is presently pegged at $392.97 million, up from the $370.32 reported in the year-ago quarter.However, choppiness in the economy and its impact on economic activity might affect the demand for several real estate, and W. P. Carey’s portfolio is not immune to such impacts. Hence, while WPC’s fourth-quarter results are likely to reflect gains from its high-quality diversified portfolio and strategic investments, choppiness in certain real estate categories is likely to have been a concern.W. P. Carey’s activities during the quarter under review were not adequate to secure analysts’ confidence. The consensus estimate for the quarterly adjusted FFO per share has remained unrevised at $1.29 in a month. It suggests a decline of 0.8% year over year.For the full-year 2022, WPC expected adjusted FFO per share in the range of $5.25-$5.31. The full-year guidance is based on some key assumptions, including investments in the company's real estate portfolio between $1.5 and $2.0 billion, dispositions from the company's real estate portfolio between $200 and $300 million and total general and administrative expenses between $88 and $90 million.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted FFO per share is pegged at $5.30. The figure indicates a 5.37% increase year over year on 10.26% year-over-year growth in revenues to $1.47 billion.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for W. P. Carey this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an FFO beat. However, that’s not the case here.W. P. Carey currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Performance of Notable REITsPrologis, Inc. PLD reported a fourth-quarter 2022 core FFO per share of $1.24, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21. The figure climbed 10.7% from the year-ago quarter. Prologis’ quarterly results reflected better-than-anticipated revenues, driven by healthy leasing activity and solid rent growth.Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. ARE reported a fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted FFO per share of $2.14, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. The reported figure also compared favorably with the year-ago quarter’s $1.97. Alexandria Real Estate Equities' results reflected decent leasing activity and rental rate growth during the quarter.Upcoming ReleaseHere is a stock from the REIT sector — Public Storage PSA — that you may want to consider as our model shows that this has the right combination of elements to report a surprise this quarter.Public Storage, scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 results on Feb 21, currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.22% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

(NYSE:PVH) insiders who acquired shares over the previous 12 months, can probably afford to ignore the recent 13% decline in the stock price. Even after accounting for the recent loss, the US$1.2m worth of stock purchased by them is now worth US$1.8m or in other words, their investment continues to give good returns.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for PVH The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PVHOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by CEO &amp; Director Stefan Larsson for US$1.0m worth of shares, at about US$53.94 per share. Even though the purchase was made at a significantly lower price than the recent price (US$80.29), we still think insider buying is a positive. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 22.25k shares worth US$1.2m. On the other hand they divested 6.60k shares, for US$507k. In total, PVH insiders bought more than they sold over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

In total, insiders dumped US$470k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of PVHMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 0.4% of PVH shares, worth about US$18m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.What Might The Insider Transactions At PVH Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought PVH stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. In contrast, they appear keener if you look at the last twelve months. We like that insiders own a fair amount of the company. So the recent selling doesn't worry us too much.

17,8c7717a8-b8d8-3d1f-9ac3-fe8cccd29dbe,CF,2023-02-09,CF Industries (CF) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cf-industries-cf-earnings-expected-150003822.html,1675868403,STORY,['CF'],"[The market expects CF Industries (CF) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 15. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis fertilizer maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11.3%.Revenues are expected to be $2.81 billion, up 10.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10.76% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CF?For CF, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.55%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that CF will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that CF would post earnings of $3.19 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.55, delivering a surprise of -20.06%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.CF appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

He faces the death penalty on state charges.Crusius' attorney Joe Spencer told reporters after the hearing that Crusius had long wanted to plead guilty to the federal charges.""He's glad that it's finally done,"" Spencer said. ""There are no winners in this case. He's going to be serving 90 consecutive life sentences.""Spencer said he could say nothing more, given a gag order that a state court judge issued in the case and with Crusius still facing that state trial. No trial date has been set in the state case.A Texas judge last year put off the state trial, saying that determining how to proceed would be affected by the decision from federal prosecutors on whether they would seek capital punishment.Federal prosecutors say Crusius drove 11 hours to El Paso, on the U.S. border with Mexico, from his home in a suburb near Dallas, on Aug. 3, 2019, and fired at shoppers with an AK-47-style rifle inside the Walmart store. He surrendered to officers who confronted him nearby.A racist manifesto that prosecutors say Crusius posted online on a now-defunct message board called 8chan, often used by extremists, said the attack was ""a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.""Crusius pleaded not guilty in 2020 to 90 federal hate crime charges. Proceedings were delayed while prosecutors decided whether to pursue the death penalty.In 2020, his lawyers argued that Crusius, then 21, had been diagnosed with severe, lifelong neurological and mental disabilities and should not face execution if convicted.

What mattered, she said, was that products tasted like vanilla.DeMaso's lawyer Spencer Sheehan, who filed many lawsuits over vanilla, said he would review the decision and that his client had not decided whether to appeal.Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said in an email: ""We are pleased with the court's ruling and will continue to defend the company against these allegations.""Litigation against the food and beverage industry has grown in recent years, and the law firm Perkins Coie said 325 proposed class actions were filed in 2021.DeMaso had sued on behalf of consumers in 26 U.S. states. The lawsuit said Walmart's cookies sold for at least $1.89 for 10 ounces, and would have sold for less absent the alleged misleading representations.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Noeleen Walder)]"

So let's take a look at UnderArmour. You can see shares down about 8%, and that's really one of their worst days in a while here. And the company reported third quarter earnings that beat the Street, but what happened is really on the call. So the stock was up before the call, up almost 7% this morning. Then the call happens.And the CFO said earlier on the call that basically what happened here is that promotions are going to extend longer than they anticipated. So promotions are going to go further than they initially thought. They're going to go almost to the end of the year. And they highlighted that the consumer, they think, is weaker than people thought retailwide, so across the sector. Again, we were just talking about Capri. We saw an UnderArmour. I think we're seeing it play out, but it's interesting to start hearing that commentary now, too.DAVE BRIGGS: I think it's an UnderArmour problem, and it's Stephanie Linnartz's problem now. Their new CEO comes aboard after 25 years at Marriott. And she's got a lot of problems to solve there at Under Armour. And Kevin Plank, the founder, saying on the call, we look forward to her prioritizing top and bottom line growth for Under Armour. Stephanie Linnartz has her hands full. They're going to open a pop-up Tuesday in Manhattan, something called Slip Speed, a new shoe that actually converts into a slide from a training shoe. Big bet, one she didn't make.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, I'll be interested to try those on, Dave. I don't know how--SEANA SMITH: I'm not sold on that.JOSH SCHAFER: --they're going to pan out. Yeah.SEANA SMITH: I'm not sold. I just think Under Armour, if you take a step back, they've lost their cool factor. Not nearly as many people are wearing them as opposed to, what, 10, 15 years ago. They need to be a little bit more innovative with their products, I think, to really kind of boost their business. And--Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Nike took it, man.JOSH SCHAFER: What happened to the Under Armour brand that used to be the turtleneck, right? That was called an Under Armour to stay warm.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for EQR in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 96 cents per share for EQR, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents per share.

This compares to earnings of $0.12 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 143.13%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this casino and resort operator would post earnings of $0.22 per share when it actually produced a loss of $1.39, delivering a surprise of -731.82%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.MGM , which belongs to the Zacks Gaming industry, posted revenues of $3.59 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.26%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.06 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.MGM shares have added about 25.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 8.5%.What's Next for MGM?While MGM has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for MGM: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.14 on $3.41 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.21 on $13.66 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Gaming is currently in the top 25% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Melco Resorts (MLCO), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022.This casino company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.62 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -93.8%.

Management believes that while certain items excluded from Adjusted EPS may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluating the Company's earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when comparing current performance to prior periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events. Also, management believes certain excluded items, and items further discussed in footnote 2 below, may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. Adjusted EPS should not be construed as an alternative to GAAP earnings per share as an indicator of the Company's performance. In addition, Adjusted EPS may not be defined in the same manner by all companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. A reconciliation of Adjusted EPS to diluted earnings per share can be found under ""Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share"" included in this release.2.""Adjusted EBITDAR"" is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, gain on REIT transactions, net, gain on consolidation of CityCenter, net, rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, gain related to CityCenter's sale of Harmon land recorded within income from unconsolidated affiliates, and income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures.""Adjusted Property EBITDAR"" is the Company's reportable segment GAAP measure, which management utilizes as the primary profit measure for its reportable segments and underlying operating segments. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, gain on REIT transactions, net, rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures, and also excludes gain on consolidation of CityCenter, net, gain related to CityCenter's sale of Harmon land recorded within income from unconsolidated affiliates, corporate expense and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each operating segment, and rent expense related to the master lease with MGP that eliminated in consolidation.""Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR"" is Adjusted Property EBITDAR further adjusted to exclude the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of acquired operating segments from the date of acquisition through the end of the reporting period and to exclude the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of disposed operating segments from the beginning of the reporting period through the date of disposition. Accordingly, the Company has excluded the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of The Cosmopolitan for periods subsequent to its acquisition on May 17, 2022, Aria for periods subsequent to its acquisition on September 27, 2021, and The Mirage for the periods prior to its disposition on December 19, 2022 in Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR for the periods indicated, as applicable.Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a non-GAAP measure and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because management believes this measure is useful in providing meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the results of the Company's operations for operating segments that were consolidated for the full period presented to assist users of the financial statements in reviewing operating performance over time. Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, considered in isolation, or as an alternative to the Company's reportable segment GAAP measure or net income, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, because this measure is not presented on a GAAP basis, and is provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR may not be defined in the same manner by all companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies, and such differences may be material. A reconciliation of the Company's reportable segment Adjusted Property EBITDAR GAAP measure to Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is included in the financial schedules in this release.""Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Adjusted Property EBITDAR"" and ""Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR"" are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, that, in addition to the reasons described above for the presentation of Adjusted Property EBITDAR and Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR, are presented to adjust for the impact of certain variances in table games win percentages compared to the mid-point of the expected ranges. Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Adjusted Property EBITDAR and Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR are calculated by applying a win percentage of 30.0% for Baccarat and 21.0% for non-Baccarat games to the respective table games drops for the quarter, which represents the mid-point of the expected ranges of 25.0% to 35.0% for Baccarat and 19.0% to 23.0% for non-Baccarat at the Las Vegas Strip Resorts properties. Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR adjusted to exclude the hold adjustments related to such acquired and disposed operating segments for the respective periods. Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Adjusted Property EBITDAR and Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR are also adjusted for the gaming taxes, bad debt expense, discounts and other incentives that would have been incurred or avoided when applying the win percentages noted above to the respective gaming volumes. Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Adjusted Property EBITDAR and Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, considered in isolation, or as an alternative to the Company's reportable segment GAAP measure or net income, or to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, because this measure is not presented on a GAAP basis, and is provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Adjusted Property EBITDAR and Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR may not be defined in the same manner by all companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financials measures of other companies, and such differences may be material. A reconciliation of the Company's reportable segment Adjusted Property EBITDAR GAAP measure to Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is included in the financial schedules in this release.Adjusted EBITDAR information is a non-GAAP measure that is a valuation metric, should not be used as an operating metric, and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because management believes this measure is widely used by analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors as a principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies. Management believes that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAR may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of the Company's earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends. Also, management believes excluded items may not relate specifically to current trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when the Company is developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within the Company's resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. In addition, management excludes rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases. Management believes excluding rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases provides useful information to analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors when valuing the Company, as well as comparing the Company's results to other gaming companies, without regard to differences in capital structure and leasing arrangements since the operations of other gaming companies may or may not include triple-net operating leases or ground leases. However, as discussed herein, Adjusted EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, an indicator of the Company's performance, considered in isolation, or construed as an alternative to operating income or net income, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, because this measure is not presented on a GAAP basis and excludes certain expenses, including the rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, and is provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report Adjusted EBITDAR may calculate Adjusted EBITDAR in a different manner and such differences may be material. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes, real estate triple-net lease and ground lease payments, and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDAR.A reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDAR is included in the financial schedules in this release.""Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Net Revenues"" and ""Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same-Store Net Revenues"" are additional supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are presented to adjust Las Vegas Strip Resorts net revenues for the impact of certain variances in table games win percentages compared to the mid-point of the expected ranges, as described herein. Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same-Store Net Revenues excludes the net revenues of acquired operating segments from the date of acquisition through the end of the reporting period and the net revenues of disposed operating segments from the beginning of the reporting period through the date of disposition and also excludes the hold adjustment related to such acquired and disposed operating segments for the respective periods. Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Net Revenues and Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same-Store Net Revenues are also adjusted for the discounts and other incentives that would have been incurred or avoided when applying the win percentages described herein to the respective gaming volumes. Management believes Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Net Revenues and Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same-Store Net Revenues present consistent measures in providing period-to-period comparisons and are useful measures in assisting investors in evaluating the Company's operating performance, and that Table Games Hold Adjusted Las Vegas Strip Resorts Same-Store Net Revenues is useful in providing meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the results of the Company's operations for operating segments that were consolidated by the Company for the full period presented to assist investors in reviewing the Company's operating performance over time.

(NYSE:NCLH) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 20% in the last month. But will that repair the damage for the weary investors who have owned this stock as it declined over half a decade? Probably not. Indeed, the share price is down a whopping 71% in that time. While the recent increase might be a green shoot, we're certainly hesitant to rejoice. The important question is if the business itself justifies a higher share price in the long term.Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Because Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.In the last five years Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings saw its revenue shrink by 30% per year. That puts it in an unattractive cohort, to put it mildly. So it's not that strange that the share price dropped 11% per year in that period. This kind of price performance makes us very wary, especially when combined with falling revenue. Ironically, that behavior could create an opportunity for the contrarian investor - but only if there are good reasons to predict a brighter future.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsStory continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings shareholders are down 25% for the year. Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 9.4%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 11% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings .Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

PRU reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted operating income of $2.42 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.8%. The bottom line declined 23.9% year over year.Prudential Financial's results reflect poor performance across most of the segments, lower premiums and net investment income, offset by lower expenses.Prudential Financial, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePrudential Financial, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePrudential Financial, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Prudential Financial, Inc. QuoteOperational UpdateTotal revenues of $12.6 billion declined 7.9% year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.1%. The fall in revenues was due to lower premiums and reduced asset management fees, commissions and other income, decreased policy charges and fee income and net investment income. The figure was higher than our estimate of $12.3 billion.Total benefits and expenses amounted to $11.5 billion, which fell 5.7% year over year in the fourth quarter. This decrease was on account of lower insurance and annuity benefits and general and administrative expenses. The figure was higher than our estimate of $11.2 billion.Quarterly Segment UpdatePrudential Global Investment Management’s (PGIM) adjusted operating income of $230 million declined 34.3% year over year. The decrease primarily reflects lower asset management fees, due to a reduction in assets under management and lower Other Related Revenues, owing to lower incentive fees, agency income and transaction fees. It was partially offset by lower expenses.PGIM assets under management of $1.2 trillion in the reported quarter, which fell 19% year over year due to higher interest rates and widening credit spreads, as well as declines in equity markets.The U.S. Businesses delivered adjusted operating income of $864 million, which decreased 3.5% year over year. The downside was due to lower net investment spread results because of lower variable investment income and lower net fee income. It was partially offset by more favorable underwriting results.Assurance IQ incurred an adjusted operating income of $29 million against the prior-year quarter’s net operating loss of $10 million. The improvement was driven by higher Medicare commission revenues and lower expenses.International Businesses’ adjusted operating income decreased 25.4% year over year to $618 million in the fourth quarter. This decrease primarily reflects lower net investment spread results due to lower variable investment income, less favorable underwriting results, including unfavorable policyholder behavior and higher expenses.Corporate and Other incurred an adjusted operating loss of $526 million, wider than the loss of $489 million reported a year ago. This higher loss reflects higher expenses, partially offset by higher income from pension and other employee benefit plans.Story continuesCapital DeploymentPrudential Financial managed to return capital to its shareholders in the form of share repurchases worth $375 million and dividends worth $449 million in the fourth quarter.Dividend Hike AnnouncedConcurrent with fourth-quarter results, Prudential Financial’s board of directors approved a 4% hike in the quarterly dividend.

Eighty-eight percent of plan sponsors reported that they are considering a retiree medical buyout and 84% note they are considering a retiree life buyout, according to MetLife’s inaugural Post Retirement Benefits Poll.""Retiree life and medical benefits are promises that retirees and their families count on. Given the long-term nature of these liabilities, plan sponsors are exposed to investment risk, interest rate risk and mortality or longevity risk, which create challenges around managing these liabilities."" said Jay Wang, senior vice president and head of Risk Solutions for MetLife’s Retirement &amp; Income Solutions (RIS). ""For plan sponsors, these risk transfer solutions help to mitigate volatility on their corporate balance sheets. For retirees, it improves security of these promises by shifting these obligations to an insurer with deep expertise and long history of managing these risks.""The Role of Post Retirement BenefitsTraditionally, post retirement benefit offerings, including pensions, retiree life and retiree medical, have played a critical role in attracting and retaining employees. Today, besides the pension benefits, many companies still have open retiree life and retiree medical plans. The Poll found 86% of companies report having open retiree medical insurance plans and the same percentage (86%) report their retiree life insurance plans are still open.""Due to the nature of these offerings, they accumulate liabilities over many years and their promises extend well into the future,"" said Charlie DeClara, assistant vice president and head of RIS Post Retirement Benefits. ""Because of this, plan sponsors have been exploring strategies to fund or transfer obligations associated with these benefits and to address the financial impact of their volatility.""Story continuesMore than eight in ten plan sponsors (85%) report that their company’s post retirement benefits receive significant attention from corporate management because of financial effects on their corporate balance sheet and income statement.Post Retirement Funding and Buyout SolutionsThe Poll found that most of the plan sponsors surveyed were familiar with the concepts of funding or transferring some or all obligations through a retiree medical buyout (89%) or retiree life insurance buyout (89%).According to the plan sponsors surveyed, the most important benefit of a retiree medical buyout is lifetime security for retirees’ healthcare benefits (71%). Half of plan sponsors cited improving benefit security for retirees as an important factor for retiree life insurance buyouts.SECURE 2.0 and the Future of Post Retirement Funding and Buyout SolutionsAn important consideration when looking at a retiree medical or retiree life insurance buyout is the funded status of the obligations. Having a well-funded plan allows plan sponsors to develop long-term solutions to a buyout or to transfer these obligations to an insurance company, which would settle or remove these liabilities from the corporate balance sheet.The COVID Tax Relief Acts of 2020 and 2021 took a significant step in helping plan sponsors improve the funding of these obligations. As a result of this legislation and under Internal Revenue Code 420, plan sponsors have the ability to transfer excess pension assets from an overfunded defined benefit (DB) plan to fund retiree medical/retiree life insurance obligations. In late 2022, the SECURE 2.0 Act was passed extending this provision, delaying its sunset from the end of 2025 to 2032.""SECURE 2.0 ensured plan sponsors have extended access to a valuable tool to help them manage the funding levels of their retiree life and retiree medical liabilities,"" said DeClara, assistant vice president and head of RIS Post Retirement Benefits. ""By making the requirements for transferring excess pension assets to fund these obligations less burdensome, plan sponsors can take an important first step on the road to a potential buyout.""Plan sponsors recognize the importance of this legislation. At the time of the survey, most plan sponsors (87%) had been closely following SECURE 2.0 and related legislation, and 84% believe it was important for SECURE 2.0 to extend this provision.About the StudyThe MetLife 2023 Post Retirement Benefits Poll was fielded between November 1 and November 16, 2022. MetLife commissioned MMR Research Associates, Inc. to conduct the online survey. Survey responses were received from 250 DB plan sponsors in human resources/benefits, treasury, and finance whose organizations have one or more post retirement medical plans and/or post retirement life insurance plans for current or former employees.About MetLifeMetLife, Inc.

Smaller lender Mizuho Financial said last year it would stop lending to new clients who are pure-play coal miners.Kannan said decisions on offering financial support to carbon capture were ""not easy"" as it would still mean developing a coal-based utility, but called ammonia co-firing a ""good option"" provided power generated from coal was quickly displaced by ammonia.""Big picture, we are focused on our finance emissions targets.

That's really the core question for this year,"" said Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin, adding that he felt the decline so far had been ""distorted"" by some falling goods prices.Crude prices eased, with gold firmer as the dollar index fell 0.18%, while MSCI's U.S.-centric index of stock performance in 47 countries shed 0.44%.The market is confused as it thought it understood, despite the Fed's rhetoric, that the U.S. central bank was very close to ending its rate-hiking cycle, said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.In addition, the closely watched inversion of the yield difference between short- and longer-dated Treasuries, which occurs when the two-year's yield is higher than that of the 10-year note, is a cause for concern, Krosby said.""Look at the inverted yield curve, it's steepened. We stare at it and we want to believe it's different this time,"" she said.""All this together, underpinned by a yield curve that is shouting, shouting recession coming. The market has to respect that, it may not agree with it, but it has to respect it.""The gap between two- and 10-year yields remained inverted at -82.3 bps, after steepening to -87.5 bps earlier in the session.The two-year rose 3.4 basis points to 4.488% after hitting an almost 10-week high of 4.514%Story continuesGRAPHIC: Inverted U.S. Treasury curve a harbinger of recession - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zdvxoemlrpx/US0707.pngFutures priced in the Fed's target rate to peak at 5.15% in July, about 25 basis points higher than last week, and by December showed the key rate will have declined to just 4.86%, or some 40 bps more than a week ago when the market expected a rate cut.""There's this belief we can still have a strong economy, a strong labor market and that inflation will continue to decline,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.However, getting inflation down to the Fed's 2% target could easily take more than a year as energy prices may remain elevated, a fact making some in the market nervous, he said.""There's going to be a rude awakening at some point and that you're going to need to see something break to get inflation all the way back down,"" Moya said.Data again showed a tight U.S. labor market even as the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week, news that helped set aside concerns that interest rates will stay higher for longer.In the latest move by major central banks, Sweden's Riksbank on Thursday raised its key interest rate by half a percentage point to 3%, and forecast further tightening in the spring.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.73%, the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.88% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.02%.German consumer prices, harmonized to compare with other European Union countries, rose by a less-than-expected 9.2% on the year in January, helping reassure markets that prices have peaked.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.62%, rebounding from an earlier decline, while Japan's Nikkei eased 0.08%.China's blue chips rose 1.3%, pulling away from a one-month trough, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 1.6%.Barclays upgraded their forecast of China's economic growth to 5.3% this year, from 4.8% previously, with Fitch also revising its forecast up to 5%. Both cited an accelerated recovery in consumer spending.Crude prices eased as oil infrastructure appeared to have escaped serious damage from the earthquake that devastated parts of Turkey and Syria, while U.S. inventories swelled and investors worried about central bank rate hikes.U.S. crude futures settled down 41 cents at $78.06 a barrel, and Brent fell 59 cents to settle at $84.50 a barrel.Gold prices rose for a fourth straight session as the dollar faltered, even as Fed officials indicated more rate hikes are warranted to rein in inflation. Gold is sensitive to high rates, which increase the cost of holding zero-yield bullion.U.S. gold futures settled down $12.20 at $1,878.50 an ounce.(Reporting by Herbert Lash, additional reporting by Huw Jones, Stella Qiu; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Jonathan Oatis)]"

The prospect of higher U.S. interest rates also bodes poorly for oil, given that the ensuing slowdown in economic activity could further hamper demand.Fears of a more hawkish Fed were back in play after stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs data rattled crude markets last week.Brent oil futures steadied at $85.19 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 0.1% to $78.58 a barrel by 20:50 ET (01:50 GMT). Both contracts were up as much as 6% over the past three days, and were trading near two-week highs.Optimism over a demand recovery in China and supply disruptions caused by an earthquake in Turkey and Syria spurred strong gains in crude prices this week. The International Energy Agency had earlier this week reiterated its forecast for a strong recovery in Chinese demand this year.While some pipeline flows from Iraq to Turkey resumed after being stopped earlier this week, exports from the major Ceyhan port are yet to be resumed amid bad weather conditions. The trend heralds a near-term supply shortage in flows to parts of Europe and Israel.But this was in turn offset by fears of a supply glut in the U.S., the world’s largest oil consumer. Government data showed on Wednesday that U.S. oil inventories grew for a seventh consecutive week, with rises in gasoline and distillate stockpiles indicating that retail fuel demand remained weak.Focus is now on a series of inflation readings from major economies in the coming days, starting with China on Friday. Markets will be closely watching to gauge whether price pressures improved in the country after it relaxed most anti-COVID measures earlier this year.Story continuesU.S. inflation data due next week is expected to inform monetary policy in the coming months.Related ArticlesOil cools after 3-day rally amid Fed uncertainty, U.S. inventory buildGold edges lower as markets reassess rate hike outlookWhite House says blog post on Nord Stream explosion 'utterly false']"

(NYSE: FE), invested nearly $10 million in 2022 to complete service reliability projects that will help enhance electric service and minimize the impact of power outages for thousands of customers in Maryland. The company also received approval from the Maryland Public Service Commission to complete additional service reliability projects in 2023.Potomac Edison Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)""Potomac Edison is continually investing in upgrades to our system that help us restore service to our customers faster following severe weather. The enhancements will also help reduce the number of momentary and sustained power outages our customers experience,"" said Linda Moss, president of FirstEnergy's Maryland operations.Potomac Edison completed several distribution automation projects in 2022 that allow personnel to automatically switch customers to an adjacent power line during an outage. By tying customers to a second source of power, the impact of power outages for approximately 2,950 customers in the Beallsville, Boyds and McHenry areas was minimized last year. In 2023, Potomac Edison will complete two similar projects to help improve reliability for nearly 4,900 customers in the West Frederick, Frostburg and Finzel areas.Additionally, Potomac Edison installed equipment called reclosers at eight substations throughout the Frederick, Williamsport and Mt. Airy areas last year that help protect the power lines that deliver electricity to customers. These devices can isolate a problem on one portion of a power line while keeping electricity flowing through the remainder of the line, minimizing the number of customers interrupted by outages. Potomac Edison personnel also can operate the new reclosers remotely to assist line workers in the field during power restoration activities.The reclosers installed in 2022 will improve reliability for nearly 10,000 Potomac Edison customers. In 2023, Potomac Edison plans to install fourteen more reclosers that will improve service for customers in Williamsport, Cumberland, Frederick, Hancock and Oakland counties.Story continuesLastly, each year, Potomac Edison makes a proactive effort to replace aging underground cable with a more reliable type of cable. In 2022, the company replaced more than 30 miles of cable, improving reliability for individual customers and the overall electric system. In 2023, Potomac Edison plans to replace approximately fifty miles of older underground cable.Potomac Edison serves about 275,000 customers in all or parts of Allegany, Carroll, Frederick, Garrett, Howard, Montgomery, and Washington counties in Maryland and 151,000 customers in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia.

The hedge fund, which invests $12.6 billion in assets and sometimes plays the role of corporate agitator, has a broad investment mandate and owns dozens of stocks and other securities in its portfolio.Third Point declined to comment on its stake, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Salesforce has been a magnet for activist investors with Elliott Management, Starboard Value, Inclusive Capital Partners and ValueAct all owning stakes.These firms have said publicly and privately that they would like to see changes at Salesforce.Last month Salesforce appointed three new directors, including the head of ValueAct, Mason Morfit, to join the board on March 1.Elliott, the biggest among the four activists, has laid the groundwork for a board challenge as it was recently interviewing director candidates. The window to nominate at Salesforce opens on February 12.Often investors pile into stocks where one or more activists have taken positions in the hopes that their complaints will lead to positive changes and push the share price higher.Third Point on Wednesday updated its own investors about other investments, including one in Bath &amp; Body Works , where the firm hinted last year that it might mount a boardroom challenge.In the letter, Third Point's founder billionaire investor Daniel Loeb wrote that he sees a chance to work ""constructively"" with Bath &amp; Body Works to ""address its apparent governance issues and help it realize its significant potential.""He praised the company, which had been without a chief executive for months, for selecting Gina Boswell from Unilever. She took over in December from Andrew Meslow who had stepped down in May. But Loeb said she faces a big task of transforming it from largely a U.S. retailer of soaps and candles to a more global ""direct-to-consumer home and personal care brand.""Story continues""We believe BBWI can change its equity story, improve its earnings power, and earn a more premium valuation,"" Loeb wrote.Third Point also said it took a new position in American International Group, a global property and casualty insurer. ""AIG's strong fundamental operating results coupled with the catalysts following the separation of Corebridge position should help AIG close that substantial valuation discount,"" Loeb wrote in the letter seen by Reuters.Last year TP Partners lost 21.7% even as the fund's annualized net return remains at 16%. Last years biggest losers included Walt Disney Co and Amazon.com while Bath &amp; Body Works counted among its biggest winners.(Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; editing by Diane Craft)]"

The venture will begin in March when Bavor leaves Google, that executive wrote in a separate post, and the pair will provide more details at a later date.Taylor, 42, once seen as a likely successor to Salesforce Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff, announced in November that he would leave the enterprise software giant to return to his “entrepreneurial roots.” He helped found companies that were later purchased by Facebook Inc. — now called Meta Platforms Inc. — and Salesforce.Since Taylor announced that he was leaving Salesforce, the company has embarked on significant job cuts, experienced a wave of executive turnover and been pressured by multiple activist investors. Taylor had also been Twitter Inc.’s board chairman, serving as the social media company’s point person during Elon Musk’s acquisition.Read more about Taylor’s dealings with Musk’s purchase of TwitterBavor, who joined Google in 2005, rose in the company’s ranks as a manager on Gmail and Google Drive and is considered a favorite lieutenant of CEO Sundar Pichai. In 2015, Bavor was tapped to run Google’s virtual reality unit, an effort to outpace rivals to the next expected computing platform. Google has released waves of software and some gadgets, but its products have never gained widespread use and the company has retreated from the field.Story continuesIn 2021, Bavor was put in charge of a new Google division called Labs that housed various far-flung projects, including VR and blockchain and the company’s startup incubator. The incubator, called Area 120, was pared back significantly in a recent wave of job cuts at Alphabet.Google doesn’t plan to name a replacement for Bavor, according to spokesperson for the company. Labs projects dedicated to emerging technology will shift to Google’s Tech &amp; Society unit, which is overseen by James Manyika, a senior vice president. Labs projects dedicated to augmented reality will be supervised by Google executives Hiroshi Lockheimer and Rick Osterloh.--With assistance from Julia Love.(Updates with plans for Google in final paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Ben &amp; Jerry’s Ended Up at War With ItselfChatGPT Becomes a New Target for Right-Wing CommentatorsSocial Media Case Tests Limits of Supreme Court’s Tech SavvyUK Getting It ‘Totally Wrong’ on Soaring Child Care CostsThe Pandemic Sent US Consumers Back to the Sugar Bowl©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Additionally, non-U.S. GAAP adjusted financial measures, such as Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (""Adjusted EBITDA""), Adjusted Net Earnings, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (""Adjusted EPS"") and Adjusted Tax Rate, exclude the impact of specified items (""Special Items""), such as restructuring charges, restructuring associated costs, adjustments in the valuation of our ""SEE Ventures"" portfolio (which may include debt, equity method, or equity investments), gains and losses related to acquisition and divestiture of businesses, special tax items (""Tax Special Items"") and certain infrequent or one-time items. Please refer to the supplemental information included with this press release for a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-U.S. GAAP financial measures.Fourth Quarter Financial and Business Segment HighlightsFourth quarter net sales in Food were $874 million, essentially flat as reported. Currency had an unfavorable impact of $41 million, or 5%. On a constant dollar basis, net sales increased $38 million, or approximately 4%. Price realization had a favorable impact of $65 million, or 7%, with increases implemented across all regions in response to the continued inflationary environment. Volumes decreased by $28 million, or 3%, driven primarily by food retail market declines across the Americas and EMEA regions and the adverse impact from prior supply disruptions. Adjusted EBITDA of $202 million, or 23.1% of net sales, decreased 1% from $204 million, or 23.3% of net sales, in the prior year. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to lower volumes and unfavorable currency movements partially offset by favorable net price realization.Fourth quarter net sales in Protective were $532 million, a decrease of 19% as reported. Net sales were unfavorably impacted by currency fluctuation of $26 million, or 4% and the divestiture of Reflectix, Inc. (""Reflectix"") of $5 million, or 1%. On an organic basis, net sales decreased $92 million, or 14%. Volumes decreased by $131 million, or 20% primarily resulting from recessionary pressures in the industrial and fulfillment markets and destocking throughout the value chain. Price realization had a favorable impact of $39 million, or 6%, with increases implemented across all regions in response to the continued inflationary environment. Adjusted EBITDA of $102 million, or 19.2% of net sales, decreased 19% from $126 million, or 19.3% of net sales, in the prior year. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to lower volumes partially offset by favorable net price realization.U.S. GAAP SummaryFourth Quarter 2022Net sales of $1.4 billion decreased 8% as reported in fourth quarter 2022, with APAC decreasing 14%, Americas decreasing 8%, and EMEA decreasing 6%.Net earnings were $95 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, in fourth quarter 2022 as compared to net earnings of $169 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, in fourth quarter 2021. Fourth quarter 2022 was unfavorably impacted not only by lower sales but also by Special Items of $50 million, which includes the impact of a tentative agreement reached with the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") Independent Office of Appeals to resolve the dispute regarding the deductibility of the Grace settlement payments. Such agreement is subject to further review, approval and execution of a definitive agreement by both parties.The effective tax rate in fourth quarter 2022 was 47.2%, compared to 31.6% in fourth quarter 2021. The increase in the 2022 effective tax rate is the result of having reached the tentative agreement to settle the dispute with the IRS described above. The prior year effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the sale of our Reflectix business.Full Year 2022Full year 2022 net sales of $5.6 billion increased 2% as reported, with Americas increasing 6%, APAC decreasing 6%, and EMEA decreasing 3%.Full year 2022 net earnings were $491 million, or $3.33 per diluted share, as compared to net earnings of $491 million, or $3.22 per diluted share, in full year 2021. Special Items had an unfavorable impact of $114 million in 2022, primarily attributable to Tax Special Items due to the impact of the tentative agreement reached with the IRS described above and an impairment loss associated with an equity investment. Comparatively, Special Items had an unfavorable impact of $50 million in 2021.The effective tax rate for full year 2022 was 32.6%, compared to 31.4% for full year 2021. The 2022 effective tax rate included incremental tax expense items associated with the tentative agreement to settle the dispute with the IRS described above. The 2021 effective tax rate included incremental tax expense items associated with the gain on the sale of Reflectix and legislative and administrative changes to enacted foreign statutes.Non-U.S. GAAP SummaryFourth Quarter 2022Fourth quarter 2022 net sales decreased 4% on a constant dollar basis, with the Americas decreasing 7% and APAC decreasing 3%, partially offset by EMEA which increased 5%. Volumes had an unfavorable impact of 10%, partially offset by favorable price realization of 7%.Adjusted EBITDA was $297 million, or 21.1% of net sales for fourth quarter 2022, as compared to $330 million, or 21.5% of net sales for the same period last year. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to lower volumes, partially offset by favorable net price realization. Currency fluctuation had an unfavorable impact of $9 million, or 3%, in fourth quarter 2022.The Adjusted Tax Rate was 26.1% in fourth quarter 2022 compared to 26.2% in fourth quarter 2021.Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.99 in fourth quarter 2022, as compared to $1.12 in fourth quarter 2021. The decrease in adjusted earnings per diluted share was primarily attributable to lower Adjusted EBITDA.Full Year 2022Full year 2022 net sales increased 6% on a constant dollar basis, with EMEA increasing 7%, Americas increasing 6%, and APAC increasing 2%. Price realization had a favorable impact of 13%, while volumes decreased by 6%.Adjusted EBITDA was $1,210 million, or 21.5% of net sales in 2022, compared to $1,132 million, or 20.4% of net sales for full year 2021. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA was largely due to favorable net price realization, partially offset by lower volumes. Currency fluctuation had an unfavorable impact of $33 million, or 3%, for the full year 2022.The Adjusted Tax Rate was 25.4% in 2022, compared to 26.1% in 2021.Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $4.10 for full year 2022 compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.55 for full year 2021. The increase in adjusted earnings per diluted share was primarily attributable to higher Adjusted EBITDA.Cash Flow and Net DebtCash flow provided by operating activities during full year 2022 was $613 million, as compared to $710 million during 2021. Capital expenditures increased to $237 million during full year 2022 to support growth initiatives, as compared to $213 million during 2021. Free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was a source of $376 million during full year 2022, as compared to a source of $497 million, during the prior year.During full year 2022, the Company repurchased 4.5 million shares, valued at $280 million (average of approximately $62 per share), and paid cash dividends of approximately $118 million.Net Debt, defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents, increased to $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 from $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, SEE had approximately $1.6 billion of available liquidity, comprised of $456 million in cash and $1.12 billion available under our committed credit facilities.During the first quarter of 2023, SEE completed the offering of $775 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior notes due 2028. The proceeds from this offering, along with the Company’s incremental term loan facility and cash on hand, were used to finance the Liquibox acquisition and to repurchase the Company’s outstanding 4.500% senior notes due 2023 (the ""2023 Euro Notes"") pursuant to the tender offer and satisfy and discharge all of the Company’s outstanding 2023 Euro Notes in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the 2023 Euro Notes.Outlook for Full Year 2023""We are continuing to face a challenging macroeconomic environment, especially in the first half of 2023. With the acquisition of Liquibox, we are confident we can grow and continue to deliver on our SEE Operating Model performance in 2023.We are advancing the SEE Operating Engine with Reinvent SEE 2.0 which is expected to reduce our cost structure by $35 to $45 million over the next 12 to 18 months. Also, by accelerating the move of our business online with MySEE and automating and digitizing our organization, we expand our access to under-penetrated customer segments creating new growth opportunities and efficiency gains,"" said Ted Doheny.For the full year 2023, SEE expects net sales in the range of $5.85 to $6.10 billion, or an increase of 4% to 8%, which includes a favorable impact of the Liquibox acquisition of approximately 6% and unfavorable currency impact of approximately 1%.Full year Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.30 billion, which includes a favorable impact of the Liquibox acquisition of approximately 8% and unfavorable currency impact of approximately 1%. Going forward, both the costs and benefits from Reinvent SEE 2.0 will be reflected in Adjusted EBITDA. The net benefit of this change in our cost structure is currently excluded from our guidance.The Company forecasts full year Adjusted EPS to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.80, which is based on approximately 146 million shares outstanding and an anticipated Adjusted Tax Rate of approximately 26% to 27%.Free Cash Flow in 2023 is expected to be in the range of $475 to $525 million, with capital expenditures in the range of $260 to $280 million. Cash tax payments, excluding those associated with the tentative agreement described above, are expected to be in the range of $240 to $250 million.Reinvent SEE 2.0Reinvent SEE 2.0 will continue our transformation into a world-class automated packaging solutions company focusing on automation, digital and sustainability.Reinvent SEE 2.0 further enhances:Expanding the Fluids &amp; Liquids Vertical Leveraging Cryovac and Liquibox Competitive Capabilities: Combining highly complementary solutions within SEE’s fast growing fluids &amp; liquids business while generating strong synergies and accelerating innovation.Accelerating Growth Platforms from Product to Customer First Solutions Approach: Expand and grow our portfolio of automation solutions, advance our prismiq™ digital packaging and printing solutions and broaden and diversify with new sustainable innovations while expanding our digital e-commerce platform.SEE Operational Excellence with Automating &amp; Digitizing the Global Network with SEE Touchless Automation: Heightened focus on world-class operations, operating leverage, productivity, zero-harm and flawless quality in everything we do while making every customer a reference.SEE Operating Model / Engine: Focus on high-quality growth to grow faster than the markets we serve as we simplify and digitize our organizational structure to withstand global slowdowns.Conference Call InformationSEE will host a conference call and webcast on Thursday, February 9, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss the Company's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Results.

The full year Fiscal 2023 and fourth quarter guidance excludes restructuring-related and other net charges, as described in the ""Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures"" section of this press release.For Fiscal 2023, the Company continues to expect constant currency revenues to increase approximately high-single digits to last year, or about 8%, on a 52-week comparable basis. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 600 basis points in Fiscal 2023, compared to the previous estimate of 730 basis points. On a 53-week comparable basis, Fiscal 2023 revenue growth is still expected to be negatively impacted by approximately 100 basis points due to the absence of the 53rd week compared to the prior year.The Company expects operating margin for Fiscal 2023 in the range of 13.5% to 14.0% in constant currency, slightly below the previous outlook of approximately 14.0% on moderated gross margin expectations. Foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact operating margin by approximately 180 basis points in Fiscal 2023. This compares to operating margin of 13.1% on a 52-week comparable basis and 13.4% on a 53-week basis in the prior year, both on a reported basis. Gross margin is expected to be about flat in constant currency on a 52-week comparable basis, with AUR growth and favorable product mix offset by higher freight and product cost inflation. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact gross margins by approximately 150 basis points in Fiscal 2023.For the fourth quarter, the Company expects revenue to increase mid- to high-single digits in constant currency to last year on a 13-week comparable basis. Including last year's 53rd week, the Company expects reported revenue to increase 1% to 2% in constant currency to last year. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 500 basis points.Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 5.5% in constant currency, with operating expense leverage more than offsetting continued long-term investments in new consumer recruitment and key city ecosystem expansion. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact fourth quarter operating margin by approximately 160 basis points and gross margin by approximately 140 basis points.Full year Fiscal 2023 tax rate is expected in the range of approximately 24% to 25%, while fourth quarter tax rate is expected at approximately 29%, assuming a continuation of current tax laws.The Company moderated its plan for capital expenditures for Fiscal 2023 to approximately $240 million to $250 million based on timing of projects.Conference CallAs previously announced, the Company will host a conference call and live online webcast today, Thursday, February 9, 2023, at 9:00 A.M.

The move is billed as a key part of Egypt’s broader push to reform an economy tipped into crisis by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which sent food and energy prices soaring.The stake sales should be completed within the next year, he said, and include share offerings to the public, block sales to strategic investors or a combination of the two. The government doesn’t have a target value for the sales, Madbouly told Bloomberg separately.Notable businesses up for grabs include three banks — Banque du Caire SAE, Arab African International Bank, United Bank — and Wataniya, an army-linked fuel-distribution company.The potential sales are being closely watched by investors after Egypt’s three currency devaluations in the past year indicated an effort to reverse years of economic and fiscal missteps. The devaluation helped the country, one of the Middle East’s most indebted, secure a $3 billion IMF program that, in turn, is expected to unlock billions of dollars more in funding.Madbouly said officials had to devise various scenarios for the challenges ahead and needed to “have a clear vision of the path of the Egyptian economy for at least two years.”Tough MeasuresStory continuesThe IMF deal includes some tough measures, such as the government following through on pledges to back out of some industries and support the private sector. At the same time, the state must cut spending without affecting the most vulnerable parts of the population and cope with a rising debt-servicing bill.The risks ahead for Egypt were made even clearer on Tuesday, as Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the country’s credit rating to B3 from B2. Moody’s cited what it said are “reduced external buffers and shock absorption capacity while the economy undergoes a structural change toward a more export- and private sector-led growth model under a flexible exchange-rate regime.”Read from 2018: Egypt Eyes $5.7 Billion Windfall From State Company IPOsThe latest offerings are a continuation of a 2016 program, which, over a period of years, saw little success in selling stakes in the vast majority of more than 20 state-run firms put on the auction block. Officials at the time blamed the downturn in global market conditions and repeatedly delayed pressing ahead with other offerings.Among the companies included in the latest offering are:Banque du CaireArab African International BankUnited BankWataniyaSafi - mineral water manufacturerPachin - paint and chemicalsHelwan FertilizersEthydco- Egyptian Ethylene and Derivatives CompanySinai ManganeseMisr InsuranceEl-Nasr Housing and DevelopmentPort Said ContainersDamietta ContainersELAB - Egyptian Linear Alkyl BenzeneHotels owned by the Public Enterprise Ministry(Updates with additional company names, adds quotes, context and background)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekLab-Grown Meat Has a Bigger Problem Than the LabNestlé’s $6,000 Peanut Allergy Pill Has Been a DudShell’s Grand Plan to Fight Climate Change (and Continue to Cause It)The Skies Look Gloomy for Big Tech’s Cloud AmbitionsThe Shopping Tech That Helps Influencers Make Money©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's 1.11% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.61%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 2.13%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the energy company had lost 0.52% over the past month. This has lagged the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 2.43% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Marathon Oil as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be February 15, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Marathon Oil to post earnings of $0.87 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 12.99%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $1.75 billion, down 2.54% from the year-ago period.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Marathon Oil. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 7.32% lower within the past month. Marathon Oil currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).In terms of valuation, Marathon Oil is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 7.24. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 11.95, so we one might conclude that Marathon Oil is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesInvestors should also note that MRO has a PEG ratio of 0.32 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States was holding an average PEG ratio of 0.45 at yesterday's closing price.The Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector.

82,aaf65f1f-d2be-3726-acc2-8e33197955f1,MRO,2023-02-09,Marathon Oil (MRO) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-oil-mro-reports-next-150103750.html,1675868463,STORY,['MRO'],"[Marathon Oil (MRO) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 15. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.87 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +13%.Revenues are expected to be $1.75 billion, down 2.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 17.62% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marathon Oil?For Marathon Oil, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -9.35%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Marathon Oil will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Marathon Oil would post earnings of $1.19 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.24, delivering a surprise of +4.20%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Marathon Oil doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:SPLK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:""We exited our position in Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) during the quarter. A number of developments caused us to question whether Splunk’s competitive position was eroding. Splunk is a premium product, and less expensive alternatives have made progress increasing the quality of their offerings. Our research has confirmed Splunk is losing market share to these players, including Microsoft’s Sentinel. Sentinel has made a number of improvements over time and integrates with Microsoft’s other products. Notably, both of Splunk’s Co-Presidents left Splunk in 2022 to work for Microsoft. Splunk’s Chief Financial Officer left a few months later. Before the CFO left, Splunk lowered its annual recurring revenue guidance for the year. While the company attributed the change to the macro environment, we were unable to differentiate to what extent the slowdown was caused by the macro environment versus competitive factors. Based on our primary research and competitive concerns, we no longer had sufficient confidence in Splunk’s value stability. Splunk no longer qualifies for investment, and we exited the position.""Story continuesSplunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this largest U.S. drugstore chain have returned +0.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7% change. The Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, to which Walgreens belongs, has lost 4.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Walgreens is expected to post earnings of $1.10 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -30.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.50 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -10.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.83 indicates a change of +7.2% from what Walgreens is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Walgreens.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WBA _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Walgreens, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $33.45 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -0.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $134.51 billion and $139.9 billion estimates indicate +1.4% and +4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWalgreens reported revenues of $33.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.5%. EPS of $1.16 for the same period compares with $1.68 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.28%. The EPS surprise was +0.87%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Walgreens is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walgreens. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

101,5dc5555e-96ad-3740-8d15-5100fcab3064,PH,2023-02-09,Here's Why Parker-Hannifin (PH) is a Great Momentum Stock to Buy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-parker-hannifin-ph-170005818.html,1675875605,STORY,['PH'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Parker-Hannifin (PH), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Parker-Hannifin currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if PH is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this maker of motion and control products holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.For PH, shares are up 9.44% over the past week while the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry is up 3.73% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 12.41% compares favorably with the industry's 5.75% performance as well.Story continuesConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Parker-Hannifin have increased 12.2% over the past quarter, and have gained 14.53% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 9.78% and -5.73%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to PH's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. PH is currently averaging 898,215 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with PH.Over the past two months, 5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PH's consensus estimate, increasing from $19.13 to $19.41 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that PH is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Parker-Hannifin on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

According to a recent report by Morgan Stanley, stocks could have a strong first half of the year despite lingering recession fears. However, the report also mentions that earnings may fall throughout the year. In these fluctuating conditions, investors rely on dividend-focused stocks to ensure regular means of income.During the previous inflationary periods, dividend stocks held up well in comparison with other asset classes. Dividends represented 40% of the market since the 1940s and the ratio increased during decades when inflation was higher, as reported by Hartford Funds. The report also revealed the performance of dividend stocks in the 1970s, when they represented 73% of the S&amp;P 500 returns. Various other reports show that dividends usually grow faster than inflation. One such research was carried out by Fidelity International which revealed that since 1900, the 10-year annual average growth in dividends across the S&amp;p 500 outpaced CPI growth nearly 73% of the time.Companies with strong dividend growth tracks and solid returns become investors’ choices as they prepare them for challenging periods. In addition to this, investors also pay attention to the company’s cash flow generation and sound balance sheet, which warrant future dividend payouts. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP), and Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL) are some major companies that managed to raise their dividends for decades and also outperformed the broader market over the years.

A company that chooses to issue debt without a rating will pay an interest rate that could be higher by half of a percent. The cost of a higher interest rate far exceeds any savings gained by not using the services of S&amp;P.We think of S&amp;P as a toll road that earns fees from its customers in exchange for cost-effective access to capital. As such, the company has extraordinary margins and pricing power and requires little of its own capital to grow. Even after fully reinvesting in its business, S&amp;P still has an excess of cash.

While Southwest cited weather impacts, the union singled out poor preparation and a failure to modernize technology.Democratic Senator Jacky Rosen called it an ""unmitigated disaster"" that had a ""devastating impact on families.""Ted Cruz, the top Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee, called the cancellation of more than 16,000 flights ""an epic screwup"" but said he was confident Southwest executives ""are committed to doing everything possible to prevent its recurrence.""Southwest Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson told reporters that the airline has already paid hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation and reimbursements for expenses and will cut 2022 bonuses to executives when they are awarded in March.""Executive bonuses for 2022 will be reduced because of this,"" he said.Watterson said it has received about 284,000 cases from passengers impacted by meltdown and reimbursed more than 273,000 -- leaving 10,782. He said those still under review had been submitted more recently.""We reimbursed tire chains, strollers, car seats, pet sitting, but things we didn't reimburse were things like $7,000 shopping sprees at luxury stores or chartering a private jet,"" Watterson said, adding that 96% of claims have been completed.Story continuesWatterson said that any passenger claim that was well documented and under $4,000 could be paid on the spot, while higher requests went to a supervisor.He acknowledged that the airline made mistakes and that technology issues were a factor. He said the carrier is introducing an updated crew scheduling system on Friday to address a specific failure during the meltdown.""Let me be clear: we messed up."" After detailing what went wrong, he added that ""none of this is an excuse."" He admitted: ""There were technology issues during the disruption -- we don't dispute that.""Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said, ""We're always going to have these weather events and some of us believe they're going to become more severe. But what we want is to have a system that is ready to address that.""Cantwell said Southwest Chief Executive Officer Bob Jordan, who had been invited to the hearing, ""didn't want to show up."" Southwest said the hearing conflicted with other commitments, including an employee rally in Baltimore on Wednesday.The meltdown caused the cancellation of almost 17,000 flights and is estimated to have cost the airline more than $1 billion. It has also prompted a lawsuit from shareholders and a Department of Transportation investigation.The Dallas-based airline attributed the breakdown in service to a ""historic"" winter storm, both in size and scale, that caused frozen jet bridges and icy aircraft engines.But Southwest's pilot union, which is in contract negotiations with the airline, blamed the company and its leadership for a ""failure"" to modernize crew management processes and technology and to prepare for the storm.Casey Murray, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA), said that the union has been sounding the alarm about the carrier's crew scheduling technology and ""outdated"" operational processes for years.""Unfortunately, those warnings were summarily ignored,"" he said.The debacle has put Jordan in the eye of a storm as he faces pressure to restore the airline's credibility and regain the trust of customers just one year after he took the helm. Jordan has apologized and taken responsibility for the troubles, vowing to prevent a repeat.Murray said that while Jordan inherited a ""massive, complex operation held together by duct tape and baling wire,"" he must show through actions that the company is serious about change.(Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh and David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Josie Kao and Mark Porter)]"

In hindsight, we did not have enough winter operational resilience,"" Watterson's written testimony for a U.S. Senate Commerce Committee hearing seen by Reuters says.In other written testimony seen by Reuters, Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA) President Casey Murray will tell the committee that the low-cost carrier's ""overconfidence"" in planning and a ""systemic failure to provide modern tools"" were responsible for the December meltdown that the union said stranded 2 million passengers and is estimated to have cost it more than $1 billion.Murray will tell the committee that pilots ""have been sounding the alarm about (Southwest's) inadequate crew scheduling technology and outdated operational processes for years. Unfortunately, those warnings were summarily ignored.""Watterson reiterates the company's view that its crew scheduling software didn’t stop working but that it was overwhelmed.""We are doing a system-wide review of our preparedness for winter operations and will implement any measures necessary to mitigate the risk of an event like this occurring in the future,"" his testimony says.Watterson's written testimony offers a new apology: ""It caused a tremendous amount of anguish, inconvenience, and missed opportunities for our customers and employees.""Murray blames the meltdown on ""poor planning, systemic under-investment in crew scheduling technology and processes, and a failure to collaborate with frontline employees.""Story continuesMurray says Southwest's mismanagement forced the airline during the crisis to fly more than 500 flights without passengers to reposition crew or planes and more than 10,000 flights where pilots sat in the back rather than flying.Murray says Congress should demand ""a firm timeline for when crew scheduling technology and associated crew management processes will be fixed.""Southwest is facing an investigation by the U.S. Transportation Department over its flight scheduling during the crisis.The committee had asked Chief Executive Bob Jordan to testify but Southwest told Reuters that he had a prior commitment. Jordan is in Baltimore today for an employee rally.Murray says Jordan and Watterson ""inherited a massive, complex operation held together by duct tape and baling wire. It will take time to tear down and rebuild."" (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Mark Porter)]"

Following the acquisition of Swedish Match, PMI defines ""smoke-free products"" to include all Swedish Match products other than Swedish Match’s combustible tobacco products, in addition to PMI's heat-not-burn, e-vapor, oral nicotine, and wellness and healthcare products.Market share for heated tobacco units (HTUs) in IQOS markets up by 1.1 points to 8.0%, or by 1.4 points to 7.9% excluding Russia and UkraineIncreased regular quarterly dividend by 1.6% to $1.27 per share, or an annualized rate of $5.08 per shareStory continuesFourth-QuarterNet revenues from smoke-free products accounted for 36.0% of total net revenues, or 35.6% excluding Russia and UkraineMarket share for HTUs in IQOS markets up by 1.4 points to 8.5%, or up by 1.8 points to 8.5% excluding Russia and UkraineTotal IQOS users at quarter-end estimated at approximately 24.9 million, of which approximately 17.8 million had switched to IQOS and stopped smoking (approximately 20.3 million and 14.2 million, respectively, excluding Russia and Ukraine)""Despite the challenging operating environment in 2022, due to the war in Ukraine, as well as supply-chain and global inflationary pressures, we delivered very strong full-year adjusted results led by the continued growth of IQOS and a robust performance in the combustible tobacco category,"" said Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer.""We are well on our way to becoming a majority smoke-free company, with smoke-free products accounting for almost one-third of our total net revenues for the year. With the acquisition of Swedish Match and the agreement to take full control of IQOS in the U.S. in April 2024, we achieved two important milestones in our smoke-free transformation in 2022 and are well positioned to accelerate this journey.""""We enter 2023 as a truly global smoke-free champion, with two of the industry's leading smoke-free brands, IQOS and ZYN, and continued innovation across our broader smoke-free product portfolio. For the year, we forecast organic top-line growth of 7% to 8.5% and currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7% to 9%, despite inflationary pressures and transitory impacts related to ILUMA deployment.""""For Swedish Match, we expect continued strong growth from the business in 2023, following a very strong finish to the year, led by ZYN in the U.S.""2022 FULL-YEAR SUMMARYUnless otherwise noted, all references to performance in this section exclude Russia and UkraineAdjusted net revenues increased by 7.7% in organic terms, primarily driven by total shipment volume growth of 3.2% (marking the second consecutive year of growth), the continued favorable mix shift from cigarettes to smoke-free products, and a favorable total pricing variance.Smoke-free product net revenues increased by 18.0% on an organic basis, mainly driven by HTU shipment volume growth of 21.5%, partly offset by lower device revenues.Combustible tobacco product adjusted net revenues increased by 3.7% on an organic basis, driven by a favorable pricing variance of approximately 4% and a cigarette shipment volume increase of 0.8%. International cigarette category share increased by 0.3 points to 24.9% despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization, including a 0.2 point increase for Marlboro.Adjusted operating income margin declined by 0.6 points on an organic basis, primarily reflecting lower gross margins due mainly to: (i) inflationary pressures on cost of sales, (ii) the adverse profitability impact of accelerated switching to ILUMA devices, (iii) the higher initial cost of ILUMA devices and related HTUs; and (iv) higher air freight costs due to supply chain disruptions related to the war in Ukraine. The pressures at the gross margin level were partly offset by the favorable product mix impact of growing HTU volume at higher unit margins, as well as pricing and productivities. The benefits of operating cost efficiencies and operating leverage further offset the gross margin headwinds.Adjusted diluted EPS of $5.34 increased by 11.9%, excluding currency. Including Russia and Ukraine, adjusted diluted EPS of $5.98 increased by 10.1% on a currency-neutral basis.Years Ended December 31,20222021CurrencyVar. excl.CurrencyReported Diluted EPS$ 5.81$ 5.83$ (0.77)12.9%Adjusting Items (a)0.170.30Adjusted Diluted EPS$ 5.98$ 6.13$ (0.77)10.1%Less: Net earnings attributable to Russia and Ukraine0.640.600.08Adjusted Diluted EPS excl.

Excluding a total 2023 adjustment of $0.16 per share and an adverse currency impact, at prevailing exchange rates, of $0.15 per share, this forecast represents a projected increase of 7% to 9% versus adjusted diluted EPS of $5.98 in 2022, as outlined in the above table.2023 Full-Year Forecast AssumptionsThis forecast assumes:The full contribution of the company's operations in Russia and Ukraine for the entire year. In Russia, the environment for divestment has become increasingly challenging and complex (see ""War in Ukraine"" section on page 6). To provide more clarity on the full extent of PMI's business, the company will include both Russia and Ukraine in its 2023 forecast and adjusted reporting.An estimated total international industry volume decline, excluding China and the U.S., of 1% to 2%;A total cigarette and HTU shipment volume change for PMI of approximately flat to +1%;HTU shipment volume of 125 to 130 billion units, reflecting an acceleration in growth versus 2022 on a total PMI basis;Net revenue growth of approximately 7% to 8.5% on an organic basis;An adjusted operating income margin decline of 50 to 150 basis points on an organic basis, primarily reflecting:continued global inflationary pressures, primarily impacting cost of sales for the combustible tobacco business (notably related to leaf, acetate tow and energy prices)the continued transitory impacts associated with the ILUMA roll-out, including the margin impact of accelerated device replacements and higher initial costs of devices and consumables; andincremental investments to drive future growth, including the commercialization of ILUMA and around $150 million with a broadly even split between the U.S. and the wellness and healthcare segment;partly offset by a positive margin impact from the favorable contribution of growing HTU volume within PMI's product mix at higher unit margins, supporting an overall positive margin contribution from the heat-not-burn business.Strong full-year performance for Swedish Match’s existing operations, underpinned by strong shipment volume growth for ZYN in the U.S.;Wellness and Healthcare segment net revenues of around $300 million (including smoking cessation products), with an adjusted operating loss of around $150 million, primarily due to investments in research and development;No contribution from any potential favorable court ruling related to the legality of a supplemental excise tax surcharge on heated tobacco units in Germany, which went into effect in 2022:PMI currently accounts for the supplemental excise tax surcharge as a reduction in net revenues and a liability in its results and outlook, though the obligation to pay the surcharge is currently suspended and under court review;For forecasted 2023 excise surcharges, a favorable ruling would equate, on a full-year basis, to an estimated one percentage point increase in net revenues and three percentage point increase in adjusted diluted EPS, with operating cash flow moving toward the top half of the company's corresponding assumption range outlined below;PMI expects a judgment toward the end of the year;Full-year amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles of $0.16 per share, which includes amortization related to the Swedish Match acquisition based on preliminary purchase price allocation that may be subject to change;A full year’s net positive earnings contribution from Swedish Match including related interest expense, with Swedish Match included in PMI's organic performance as of November 11, 2023;Incremental net interest costs of around $200 million versus 2022 on PMI borrowings excluding Swedish Match-related financing, notably reflecting higher borrowing costs on refinanced debt;An effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax events, of approximately 20.5% to 21.5%;Operating cash flow of $10 to $11 billion at prevailing exchange rates, subject to year-end working capital requirements;Capital expenditures of approximately $1.3 billion, partly reflecting increased investments behind smoke-free product manufacturing capacity, including for ILUMA consumables and Swedish Match's portfolio;No share repurchases in 2023;Top and bottom-line delivery that is second half-weighted, reflecting: certain margin pressures that are skewed to the first-half, timing factors related to shipments and cost saving, and tougher first-half comparisons versus 2022;First-quarter reported diluted EPS in a range of $1.28 to $1.33, including an unfavorable currency impact, at prevailing exchange rates, of $0.10 per share, notably reflecting: HTU shipment volume of around 26 to 28 billion units, low single-digit organic top-line growth and soft margins relative to the full year.Factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to these projections.Swedish Match AB AcquisitionOn November 11, 2022, Philip Morris Holland Holdings B.V. (""PMHH""), a wholly owned subsidiary of PMI, acquired a controlling interest of 85.87% of the total issued and outstanding shares in Swedish Match. Swedish Match's operating results beginning on November 11, 2022, through December 31, 2022, are included in PMI's consolidated statement of earnings and disclosed as a separate segment.On November 28, 2022, PMHH announced that it had acquired 93.11% of the shares in Swedish Match and intended to: (i) initiate compulsory redemption under the Swedish Companies Act to acquire all remaining shares in the company; and (ii) request delisting of Swedish Match’s shares from Nasdaq Stockholm.On December 16, 2022, Swedish Match announced that the compulsory redemption process had been initiated. On December 30, 2022, the shares of Swedish Match were delisted from Nasdaq Stockholm, by which time PMHH had become the owner of 94.81% of the company's shares.New Regional StructureIn November 2022, PMI announced a change in the company’s regional structure -- to four regions, from six -- to further support the growth of its smoke-free business, reinforce consumer centricity, and increase the speed of innovation and deployment, all in alignment with its ambition of becoming a majority smoke-free business by net revenues by 2025. The change to its regional operations was completed in January 2023.PMI will report its financial results based on the new regional structure as of the first quarter of 2023. In March 2023, the company plans to disclose select historical financial information for the 2020 to 2022 period based on the new regional structure.KT&amp;G AgreementsOn January 30, 2023, PMI announced a long-term collaboration with KT&amp;G, South Korea’s leading tobacco and nicotine manufacturer, to continue to commercialize KT&amp;G’s innovative smoke-free devices and consumables on an exclusive, worldwide basis (excluding South Korea).The agreement covers fifteen years, to January 29, 2038, with performance-review cycles and associated commitments, based on volume, to be confirmed for each three-year period, to allow flexibility for evolving market conditions.The agreement gives PMI continued exclusive access to KT&amp;G’s smoke-free brands and product-innovation pipeline, including offerings for low- and middle-income markets, that will enhance PMI’s existing portfolio of smoke-free products.Products sold under the agreement will be subject to assessment to ensure they meet the regulatory requirements in the markets where they are launched, as well as PMI’s high standards of quality and scientific substantiation. PMI and KT&amp;G will seek any necessary regulatory approvals that may be required on a market-by-market basis.War in UkraineSince the onset of the war in Ukraine, PMI's main priority has been the safety and security of its more than 1,300 employees and their families in the country. The company has helped to evacuate more than 1,000 people from Ukraine and relocate over 2,700 others from conflict zones to locations in the country away from the heaviest fighting; provided critical aid to employees who cannot leave or who decide to remain in Ukraine; and provided those who have left the country with a range of support in neighboring countries. The company is continuing to pay salaries to all its Ukrainian employees and is also providing substantial in-kind support to them and their families. In addition, PMI has contributed approximately $10 million in funds and donated essential items across the country.On February 25, 2022, in order to preserve the safety of its employees, PMI announced the temporary suspension of its commercial and manufacturing operations in Ukraine, including at its factory, in Kharkiv. The company subsequently resumed some retail activities where safety allowed, in order to provide product availability and service to adult consumers, and began to supply the market from production centers outside Ukraine, as well as through a contract manufacturing arrangement. Production at the company's factory in Kharkiv remains suspended.As of December 31, 2022, PMI's Ukrainian operations have approximately $0.4 billion in total assets, excluding intercompany balances.On March 24, 2022, PMI announced the concrete steps it had taken to suspend planned investments and scale down its manufacturing operations in Russia.PMI is continuously assessing the evolving situation in Russia, including: recent regulatory constraints in the market that entail very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities; and restrictions resulting from international regulations.As of December 31, 2022, PMI's Russian operations have approximately $2.5 billion in total assets, excluding intercompany balances, of which approximately $0.6 billion consisted of cash and equivalents held mostly in local currency (Russian rubles).PMI recorded pre-tax charges related to the war in Ukraine of approximately $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and approximately $151 million in the full year (including humanitarian efforts). This includes charges in Russia related to the cancellation of the planned launch of ILUMA and the planned production of related HTUs.Conference CallA conference call, hosted by Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer, and Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer, will be webcast at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on February 9, 2023.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Knights that Beat The Market Last 5 Years. With the S&amp;P 500 gaining 8.89% this year so far, the US stock market is showing signs of recovery. According to a recent report by Morgan Stanley, stocks could have a strong first half of the year despite lingering recession fears. However, the report also mentions that earnings may fall throughout the year. In these fluctuating conditions, investors rely on dividend-focused stocks to ensure regular means of income.During the previous inflationary periods, dividend stocks held up well in comparison with other asset classes. Dividends represented 40% of the market since the 1940s and the ratio increased during decades when inflation was higher, as reported by Hartford Funds. The report also revealed the performance of dividend stocks in the 1970s, when they represented 73% of the S&amp;P 500 returns. Various other reports show that dividends usually grow faster than inflation. One such research was carried out by Fidelity International which revealed that since 1900, the 10-year annual average growth in dividends across the S&amp;p 500 outpaced CPI growth nearly 73% of the time.Companies with strong dividend growth tracks and solid returns become investors’ choices as they prepare them for challenging periods. In addition to this, investors also pay attention to the company’s cash flow generation and sound balance sheet, which warrant future dividend payouts. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Roper Technologies, Inc.

The other two largest purchases includes Visa Inc. and Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)  which likewise saw their valuations improve as their estimated free cash flows held up or improved while their enterprise values declined.”14.

S&amp;P and Moody’s have roughly equal market shares and rate more than 90% of all bonds worldwide. The service provides high value for the cost. A company that chooses to issue debt without a rating will pay an interest rate that could be higher by half of a percent. The cost of a higher interest rate far exceeds any savings gained by not using the services of S&amp;P.We think of S&amp;P as a toll road that earns fees from its customers in exchange for cost-effective access to capital. As such, the company has extraordinary margins and pricing power and requires little of its own capital to grow. Even after fully reinvesting in its business, S&amp;P still has an excess of cash. In 2021, S&amp;P produced $3.5 billion of free cash from $8.3 billion of revenues. The company returns the majority of its free cash to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases.”9.

While they might not be as attractive as other types of stocks, they still provide investors with a reliable source of income. However, investors will often take many broad steps to stay ahead of the market. These steps include looking at dividend stocks and deciding which ones are best to sell.The stock market is always changing and adapting to new trends. The popularity of dividend stocks has recently increased due to their low risk and steady cash flow. Nonetheless, there is no one size fits all strategy in the investing world. As a result, there are many ways to invest. Investors should find what they like and stick with it.Investors should consider selling dividend stocks when they feel the company is not growing and has no new ideas or products to offer. This is the best solution if you do not want to be in a stagnant portfolio. It will also ensure that you’re on board with your savings strategy and that your portfolio works for you.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith the momentum in the market relative to the following stocks, it is safe to assume these are the dividend stocks to sell:TickerCompanyPriceWUWestern Union$14.28MMacy’s$24.46CWHCamping World Holdings$26.54Western Union (WU)An image of people walking in front of a Western Union storefrontSource: DW labs Incorporated/Shutterstock.comWestern Union (NYSE:WU) is a global money transfer company. It was founded in 1851 and is based in Atlanta, Georgia.Western Union is the largest money transfer company in the world. It has over 150 million customers worldwide and has been around for a long time. Western Union provides services to consumers, businesses, and government agencies. Its services include wire transfers, person-to-person transfers (P2P), international remittances, currency exchanges, and other financial products.With a dividend yield of 6.63%, a well-entrenched position in the market, and long history of consistent returns, Western Union is often considered a sure-shot stock for any portfolio. However, the world of finance is changing rapidly. And it will have an impact on Western Union as well.Story continuesMastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) are moving quickly regarding accepting digital payments and transfers. They have also found methods of incorporating cryptocurrency into their offerings.At the same time, options like the Near Protocol (NEAR-USD) also upended the market. A domestic money transfer with Western Union is usually completed within 24 hours, while an international transfer can take between one and five business days. In comparison, NEAR, a proof-of-stake platform, features near-instant settlement times and low fees for investors to profit from.Considering the dominance of Western Union, it is hard to see things changing overnight. However, a shift is gradually taking place, and it can do very little to avoid it. Hence, this name will pop up when researching dividend stocks to sell.Macy’s (M)macy's mall department store storefrontSource: digitalreflections / Shutterstock.comEven before the pandemic, Macy’s (NYSE:M) was not doing very well. In the face of the rampant expansion of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other e-commerce players, the retailer was finding it tough to compete amid dwindling sales.There were a couple of reasons why Macy’s was slow to change. One reason was that online sales could not be catered to a person’s specific location. Another reason was that retailers are typically more profitable when physical locations are used instead of digital ones. Macy’s is now adapting and beginning to use online marketing tactics for its stores, providing higher profits for the company in the long run.Macy’s was initially hesitant about the digital business. However, the pandemic meant there was no alternative but to change. It had to move online more significantly and is still fighting for market share from online competitors.Digital sales have paid off for Macy’s. It managed to attract millions of new customers. That has helped the company see its stores’ value skyrocket. The physical locations can now be used as fulfillment centers to serve customers who pick up their orders in the stores.However, due to rampant inflation and decreased consumer spending, Macy’s is facing a tough 2023. In early January, the New York-based department store chain said its Q4 sales would fall towards the lower end of expected guidance because of a drop in spending during the non-peak holiday weeks.Plus, the move to digital is secular and bigger names like Amazon will keep increasing their market share. A yield of 2.58% is certainly enticing, but investors need to know if it is sustainable. On that end, they will need more evidence.Camping World Holdings (CWH)Camping World Holdings logo on a computer screen.

It also has many retail locations in the United States.Camping World Holdings is a dividend stock with a payout ratio of just under 52%. The company has maintained this high payout ratio throughout the years because it can generate enough revenue through its RV sales and retail locations.The company has had a steady growth in revenue and earnings for the past five years, with its revenue increasing from $889.0 million in 2017 to $6.9 billion in 2021 and its earnings increasing from a net loss of $44.3 million to net income of $642.1 million over the same period.Camping World Holdings struggled with a devastating pandemic that crumbled its sales during this time. The pandemic was devastating because it had to contend with decreased travel and lower camping equipment sales. It came roaring back in 2021, but recent data indicates that the comeback story is hitting a few snags.In reporting results for the third quarter, the recreational company saw revenues of $1.9 billion, a decrease of $60.9 million, or 3.2%. Net profit failed to meet analyst expectations, falling to $102.9 million, a 45.6% drop from the previous year.If a recession is on its way, Camping World Holdings will be in the mix when discussing dividend stocks to sell.On the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

I would now like to hand the call over to Jaimie Stemen, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Jaimie Stemen: Thank you, and welcome to TransDigm's Fiscal 2023 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Presenting on the call this morning are TransDigm's President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Stein; Chief Operating Officer, Jorge Valladares; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman. Please visit our website at transdigm.com to obtain a supplemental slide deck and call replay information. Before we begin, the company would like to remind you that statements made during this call, which are not historical in fact, are forward-looking statements. For further information about important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company's latest filings with the SEC available through the Investors section of our website or at sec.gov.The company would also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA as defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings call for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and applicable reconciliations. I will now turn the call over to Kevin.Kevin Stein: Good morning. Thanks for calling in today. First, I'll start off with the usual quick overview of our strategy, a few comments about the quarter and discuss our fiscal '23 outlook. Then Jorge and Mike will give additional color on the quarter. To reiterate, we are unique in the industry in both the consistency of our strategy in good times and bad as well as our steady focus on intrinsic shareholder value creation through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize, here are some of the reasons why we believe this. About 90% of our net sales are generated by unique proprietary products. Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which generally have significantly higher margins and over any extended period have typically provided relative stability in the downturns.Story continuesWe follow a consistent long-term strategy specifically. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. We utilize a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology. We have a decentralized organizational structure and a unique compensation system closely aligned with shareholders. We acquire businesses that fit this strategy and where we see a clear path to PE-like returns. And lastly, our capital structure and allocations are a key part of our value creation methodology. Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital.As you saw from our earnings release, we had a good start to fiscal '23 and increased our guidance for the year. We continue to see recovery in the commercial aerospace market. Our Q1 results show positive growth in comparison to the same prior year period. We are encouraged by the progression of the commercial aerospace market recovery to date, and trends in the commercial aerospace market remain favorable as demand for travel remains robust. International air traffic is closing in on the domestic travel recovery and China reopened its air travel in January with the lifting of its pandemic restrictions. However, there is still progress to be made for the industry as our results to continue to be adversely affected in comparison to pre-pandemic levels since the demand for air travel is still depressed.In our business, we saw another quarter of very healthy growth in our total commercial revenues and bookings. Bookings also outpaced revenues in all 3 of our major market channels, commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense. We also attained an EBITDA as defined margin of 50% in the quarter. Contributing to the strong margin is the continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues, along with diligent focus on our operating strategy. Additionally, we had strong operating cash flow generation in Q1 of almost $380 million and ended the quarter with close to $3.3 billion of cash. We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout the remainder of 2023. Next, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities.The capital allocation priorities at TransDigm are unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our businesses; second, to do accretive M&amp;A; and third, return capital to our shareholders via share buybacks or dividends. A fourth option paying down debt seems unlikely at this time, though we do still take this into consideration. We are continually evaluating all of our capital allocation options. As mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with a sizable cash balance of close to $3.3 billion, which leaves us with significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future. Regarding the current M&amp;A pipeline, we are actively looking for M&amp;A opportunities that fit our model.Acquisition opportunity activity continues and we have a decent pipeline of possibilities as usual, mostly in the small and midsize range. I cannot predict or comment on possible closings, but we remain confident that there is a long runway for acquisitions that fit our portfolio. Both the M&amp;A and capital markets are always difficult to predict, but especially so in these times. Now moving to our outlook for fiscal 2023. As noted in our earnings release, we are increasing our full fiscal year '23 sales and EBITDA as defined guidance, both by $65 million to reflect our strong first quarter results and current expectations for the remainder of the year. The guidance assumes the continued recovery in our primary commercial end markets through fiscal '23 and no additional acquisitions or divestitures.Our current year guidance is as follows and can also be found on Slide 6 in the presentation. The midpoint of our revenue guidance is now $6.155 billion or up approximately 13%. In regards to the market channel growth rate assumptions that this revenue guidance is based on, for the commercial aftermarket, we are updating the full year growth rate assumptions as a result of our strong first quarter results and current expectations for the remainder of the year. We now expect commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the high teens percentage range, which is an increase from our previous guidance of mid-teens percentage range. At this time, we are not updating the full year market channel growth rate assumptions for commercial OEM and defense as underlying market fundamentals have not meaningfully changed.Commercial OEM and defense revenue guidance is still based on our previously issued market channel growth rate assumptions where we expect commercial OEM revenue growth in the mid-teens percentage range and defense revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range. The midpoint of our EBITDA as defined guidance is now $3.11 billion or up approximately 18% with an expected margin of around 50.5%. This guidance includes about 50 basis points of margin dilution from our recent DART Aerospace acquisition. We anticipate EBITDA margins will continue to move up throughout the remainder of the year. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS is increasing primarily due to the higher EBITDA as defined guidance and is now anticipated to be $22.17 or up approximately 29%.Airspace, airplane, flightPhoto by Sean Nufer on UnsplashMike will discuss in more detail shortly some other fiscal '23 financial assumptions and updates. As our fiscal '23 progresses, should the favorable trends in the commercial aerospace market recovery continue, including the expansion of flight activity in China, we could see further upward revisions to our guidance. We believe we are well positioned for the remainder of fiscal 2023. We'll continue to closely watch how the aerospace and capital markets continue to develop and react accordingly. On the organization side, I wanted to announce the retirement of Halle Martin, our General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary. Halle has been an integral part of our team since 2012 and long before as outside counsel. Jes Warren has been promoted from her position as Associate General Counsel to fill this critical role as part of our robust succession planning process.Thank you, Halle, for all of your great counsel and dedication to TransDigm. Let me conclude by stating that I'm very pleased with the company's performance this quarter and throughout the recovery of the commercial aerospace industry. We remain focused on our value drivers, cost structure and operational excellence. Let me hand it over to Jorge to review our current -- our recent performance and a few other items.Jorge Valladares: Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our typical review of results by key market category. For the balance of the call, I'll provide commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2022. That is, assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. The market discussion includes the May 2022 acquisition of DART Aerospace in both periods. DART has been included in this market analysis discussion since the third quarter of fiscal '22. In the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, we'll split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. Our total commercial OEM revenue increased approximately 20% in Q1 compared with the prior year period.Bookings in the quarter were strong compared to the same prior year period and solidly outpaced sales. Sequentially, the bookings improved almost 15% compared to Q4. We continue to be encouraged by build rates steadily progressing at the commercial OEMs and the strong demand for new aircraft. However, ongoing labor instability and supply chain challenges across the broader aerospace sector present risks to achieving OEM production rates. Now moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. Total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 31% in Q1 when compared with the prior year period. Growth in commercial aftermarket revenue was primarily driven by continued strength in our passenger submarket, which is our largest submarket, although all of our commercial aftermarket submarkets were up significantly compared to prior year Q1.Sequentially, total commercial aftermarket revenues grew by approximately 7% and bookings grew more than 25%. Commercial aftermarket bookings were robust this quarter compared to the same prior year period and Q1 bookings significantly outpaced sales. Turning to broader market dynamics. Global revenue passenger miles remained lower than pre-pandemic levels, but have continued to steadily trend upwards over the past few months. Airline passenger demand remained strong throughout the fall and holiday season. IATA currently forecast calendar year '23 air traffic will be within about 15% of pre-pandemic. The recovery in domestic travel continues to be stronger than international travel, although international traffic is catching up. In the most recently reported IATA traffic data for December, global domestic air traffic was only down 20% compared to pre-pandemic.For the U.S., domestic travel in December was within 10% of pre-pandemic levels. Domestic travel in China continued to lag other major air traffic regions and was down about 55% compared to pre-pandemic. However, the lifting of COVID restrictions and the reopening of China to international travelers bodes well for air traffic growth. Roughly a year ago, international travel globally was depressed about 60%, but in the most recently reported IATA traffic data for December, international travel was only down about 25% compared to pre-pandemic levels. International traffic in North America and Europe were within 5% and 15% of pre-pandemic, respectively. Asia Pacific International travel was still down about 50%, but should improve subsequent to the January reopening of China.Global air cargo demand has continued to pull back over the past few months. As of IATA's most recent data, December was another month in which air cargo volumes showed year-over-year decline and were below pre-pandemic levels. The recent easing of pandemic-related restrictions in China could be favorable for air cargo in '23, but it's too early to determine. Business jet utilization has come down from pandemic highs and has continued to temper over the past handful of months. However, activity is still above pre-pandemic levels and business jet OEMs and operators forecast strong demand in the near term. Time will tell how this plays out as there is softening optimism for the business jet market due to the uncertainty within the current macro and financial environment.Shifting to our defense market, which traditionally is at or below 35% of our total revenue, the defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, grew by approximately 3% in Q1 when compared with the prior year period. Defense bookings are up significantly this quarter compared to the same prior year period and Q1 bookings strongly outpaced sales, which bodes well for future defense order activity. Impacting our defense market revenues are the ongoing delays in the U.S. government defense spend outlays. While these delays appear to be slowly improving, they do remain longer than historical average levels. Our teams are steadily making progress with the supply chain, but continue to face challenges. The lack of electronic component availability continues to be the primary focus for our teams.As Kevin mentioned earlier, we continue to expect low to mid-single-digit percent range growth this year for our defense market revenues. Lastly, I'd like to wrap up by stating how pleased I am by our operational performance in this first quarter of fiscal '23. We remain focused on our value drivers in meeting increased customer demand for our products. With that, I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lisman.Michael Lisman: Good morning, everyone. I'm going to quickly hit on a few additional financial matters for the quarter and then expectations for the full fiscal year. First, on organic growth and liquidity. In the first quarter, our organic growth rate was 15%, driven by the continued rebound in our commercial OEM and aftermarket end markets. On cash and liquidity, free cash flow which we traditionally define as EBITDA, less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes was roughly $400 million for the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was exactly 6x, down from 6.4x at the end of last quarter. On a net debt-to-EBITDA basis, this puts us right at the 5-year pre-COVID average level.Additionally, our cash interest coverage ratios, such as EBITDA to interest expense are currently in line with where we've historically operated the business. We feel comfortable here given the benefit of our interest rate hedges and fixed rate debt instruments that were entered into in a lower interest rate environment. As always, we continue to watch the rising interest rate environment in the current state of the debt markets very closely. During the first quarter, we completed an extension of our nearest maturity term loan pushing the maturity date from mid-2024 out into 2027. Pro forma for this refinancing, our nearest term maturity is now 2025. As a result of this refi, our interest expense estimate for FY '23 ticked up very slightly, as you can see in today's updated interest expense guidance.Over 75% of our total $20 billion gross debt balance is at a fixed rate through a combination of fixed rate notes and interest rate caps and swaps through 2025. This provides us adequate cushion against any rise in rates at least in the immediate term. Going forward, we expect to continue both proactively and prudently managing our debt maturity stacks. Practically for us, this means pushing out any near-term maturities well in advance of the final maturity date and then also utilizing hedging instruments where we can in order to lock in the cash interest costs. As we sit here today from an overall cash liquidity and balance sheet standpoint, we think we remain in good position with adequate flexibility to pursue M&amp;A or return cash to our shareholders via share buybacks or dividends during fiscal '23.With that, I'll turn it back to the operator to kick off the Q&amp;A.See also 20 Best For-Profit Colleges in the US and 25 Most Viewed YouTube Videos of All Time.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

This compares to earnings of $0.53 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -33.33%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this toy maker would post earnings of $0.73 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.82, delivering a surprise of 12.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Mattel , which belongs to the Zacks Toys - Games - Hobbies industry, posted revenues of $1.4 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.44%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.79 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Mattel shares have added about 16.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 8.5%.What's Next for Mattel?While Mattel has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Mattel: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.06 on $951.6 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.60 on $5.85 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Toys - Games - Hobbies is currently in the bottom 5% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Jakks Pacific (JAKK), is yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022.This toymaker is expected to post quarterly loss of $1.49 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1164.3%.

Jared Blikre is here. What's moving, my man?JARED BLIKRE: Let's take a look at Disney. We rehashed the numbers. Let's take a look at the stock. It is up about 5% in after-hours trading. I'm going to put a chart on real quick. This is a one-year chart. Tomorrow morning, if we were to stay at these prices-- I believe it was 115 and change-- we would be looking at the highest price since September. And just taking a quick look at the five-year chart, bouncing off those lows we saw in the pandemic-- maybe off to a little bit of a start here.Now, we got to move on to a firm we're also tracking. The buy now, pay later company Affirm, after its quarterly revenue missed estimates with its loss widening to $360 million, the big headline regards its workforce. Affirm is cutting it by 19%. This also happens to be how much its stock was down at the lows in after-hours trading.The company is seeing annual cost savings of $77 to $83 million from the downsizing. It's also delaying some of its projects. Full year revenue guidance is now 1.475 billion to 1.55 billion. This is below the estimate of 1.64 billion. So, all in all, Affirm, this is that big Amazon excitement spike that we saw last year and still hanging out in the lower end of its range.Got to move on to Mattel, also in our sights after missing on profits for the fourth quarter. By segment, the toymaker missed expectations in dolls, as well as the set that includes action filters, building sets, and games. Now Mattel's products for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers also came in substantially light.But it's the full year forecast that's helping send the stock down to the lowest price in a month in after-hours trading. Mattel is seeing adjusted EPS for the year of $1.10 to $1.20. The Street estimate substantially higher at $1.65. Adjusted gross margin also came in light at 47% below the 48% expected. Now here's a five-year chart of Mattel, and you can see doing a little bit better than some of our other guys here, but still about in the middle of its-- I would call that a two-year trading range, and definitely in the upper part of its five-year trading range. Guys.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Jared, thanks so much for those technicals, my man.]"

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's largest oilfield services company have returned -3.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, to which Schlumberger belongs, has gained 1.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Schlumberger is expected to post earnings of $0.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +76.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.8%.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.02 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +38.5%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.78 indicates a change of +25.4% from what Schlumberger is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Schlumberger.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for SLB _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Schlumberger, the consensus sales estimate of $7.55 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +26.6%. The $32.74 billion and $36.4 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +16.5% and +11.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySchlumberger reported revenues of $7.88 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +26.6%. EPS of $0.71 for the same period compares with $0.41 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.74%. The EPS surprise was +2.9%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Schlumberger is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Schlumberger. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The hedge fund, which invests $12.6 billion in assets and sometimes plays the role of corporate agitator, has a broad investment mandate and owns dozens of stocks and other securities in its portfolio.Third Point declined to comment on its stake, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Salesforce has been a magnet for activist investors with Elliott Management, Starboard Value, Inclusive Capital Partners and ValueAct all owning stakes.These firms have said publicly and privately that they would like to see changes at Salesforce.Last month Salesforce appointed three new directors, including the head of ValueAct, Mason Morfit, to join the board on March 1.Elliott, the biggest among the four activists, has laid the groundwork for a board challenge as it was recently interviewing director candidates. The window to nominate at Salesforce opens on February 12.Often investors pile into stocks where one or more activists have taken positions in the hopes that their complaints will lead to positive changes and push the share price higher.Third Point on Wednesday updated its own investors about other investments, including one in Bath &amp; Body Works , where the firm hinted last year that it might mount a boardroom challenge.In the letter, Third Point's founder billionaire investor Daniel Loeb wrote that he sees a chance to work ""constructively"" with Bath &amp; Body Works to ""address its apparent governance issues and help it realize its significant potential.""He praised the company, which had been without a chief executive for months, for selecting Gina Boswell from Unilever. She took over in December from Andrew Meslow who had stepped down in May. But Loeb said she faces a big task of transforming it from largely a U.S. retailer of soaps and candles to a more global ""direct-to-consumer home and personal care brand.""Story continues""We believe BBWI can change its equity story, improve its earnings power, and earn a more premium valuation,"" Loeb wrote.Third Point also said it took a new position in American International Group, a global property and casualty insurer. ""AIG's strong fundamental operating results coupled with the catalysts following the separation of Corebridge position should help AIG close that substantial valuation discount,"" Loeb wrote in the letter seen by Reuters.Last year TP Partners lost 21.7% even as the fund's annualized net return remains at 16%. Last years biggest losers included Walt Disney Co and Amazon.com while Bath &amp; Body Works counted among its biggest winners. (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; editing by Diane Craft)]"
139,061d44fa-9e38-3612-a4ed-ea8926783554,AIG,2023-02-09,American International Group (AIG) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-international-group-aig-expected-150003174.html,1675868403,STORY,['AIG'],"[American International Group (AIG) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 15, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.19 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -24.7%.Revenues are expected to be $11.84 billion, down 13.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.91% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for American International Group?For American International Group, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +8.25%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that American International Group will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that American International Group would post earnings of $0.59 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.66, delivering a surprise of +11.86%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.American International Group appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are high-quality in nature.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.Also, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.Meanwhile, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They in fact club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Find Stocks That Can Beat?Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.Story continuesHere are the four stocks:Genmab: Genmab A/S is a biotechnology company. It specializes in the development of antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2.

The bottom line declined 81.3% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 75 cents.The company’s GAAP loss per share was 89 cents against the year-ago quarter’s EPS of 71 cents.For the full year, adjusted earnings were $2.12 per share, down 64% from the year-ago period’s levels.

The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.4%.Segment DetailsPost the acquisition of GRAIL on Aug 18, 2021, Illumina has two reportable segments — Core Illumina and GRAIL.Core Illumina revenues fell 11% year over year (down 8% at the constant exchange rate or CER) to $1.07 billion. Core Illumina Sequencing Consumable revenues totaled $687 million in the reported quarter, down 13% year over year.Sequencing Instrument revenues for core Illumina were $146 million, down 24% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. The decline was primarily due to lower NovaSeq 6000 shipments in advance of the availability of NovaSeq X. The decline was partially offset by another quarter of record NextSeq 1000/2000 shipments.Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseIllumina, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Illumina, Inc. Quote Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenues were $131 million, up 24% year over year on higher instrument service contract revenues on a growing installed base and an increase in oncology and IBD partnership revenue.GRAIL contributed $23 million to revenues during the reported quarter.MarginsThe adjusted gross margin (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) was 66.5% in the reported quarter, highlighting a contraction of 505 basis points (bps) year over year.Story continuesResearch and development expenses plunged 1.1% year over year to $346 million, whereas selling, general &amp; administrative expenses rose 1.4% to $432 million. These pulled up adjusted operating costs by 0.3% to $778 million.Adjusted operating loss in the quarter was $58 million against the prior-year quarter’s adjusted operating income of $81 million.Financial UpdateIllumina exited 2022 with cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments of $2.04 billion compared with $1.34 billion at the end of 2021.The company did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter.Cumulative net cash used in operating activities at the end of 2022 was $39.2 million compared with $54.5 million a year ago.2023 GuidanceFor 2023, Illumina expects its consolidated revenue growth in the range of 7 to 10% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $4.99 billion.The company expects adjusted EPS for 2023 in the range of $1.25 to $1.50. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $2.26.Core Illumina revenue growth is expected in the range of 6-9%. GRAIL revenues are expected to be in the range of $90 million to $110 million.Our TakeIllumina ended 2022 on a mixed note with lower-than-expected earnings and revenues beat. The year-over-year performance remained sluggish. Sequencing instruments revenue for core Illumina declined due to delayed recruitment for some large research projects in the Americas and Europe, the ongoing impact of COVID disruptions in China, the year-over-year impact of customer inventory management, the anticipated decline in COVID surveillance revenues and headwinds from foreign exchange rates. The base business in regions was impacted by anticipation for NovaSeq X and the slowdown in COVID surveillance and research. Contraction in gross margin is discouraging.On a positive note, Illumina registered another quarter of record NextSeq 1000/2000 shipments as the company continues to witness strong adoption. Further, Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue rose year-over-year, driven primarily by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base as well as an increase in oncology and IBD partnership revenue.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksIllumina currently carries Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Neogen Corporation NEOG, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS is pegged at 48 cents.Our TakeQIAGEN ended fourth-quarter 2022 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. However, on a year-over-year basis, earnings and sales both declined. The massive decline in COVID-19 product sales and severe foreign exchange headwind impacted overall performance. Escalating costs and the contraction of gross margin operating margin is a concern.On a positive note, the ongoing double-digit sales growth in the non-COVID product portfolio, a high level of profitability and strong cash flow are the major upsides. The QIAcuity digital PCR system delivered solid double-digit CER growth for fiscal 2022, supported by the launch of new assays for biopharma applications. Further, QuantiFERON-TB also registered a solid double-digit CER growth in 2022, led by continued conversion of the latent TB market from the traditional skin test.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksQIAGEN currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Neogen Corporation NEOG, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

The adjusted EPS figure considers certain asset amortization costs, opioid litigation charges, and other adjustments.On a reported basis, the company’s GAAP earnings were $1.75 per share, up 78.6% year over year.For the full year, adjusted earnings were $8.69 per share, up 3.5% from the year-ago period’s levels. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.7%.Total revenues in the fourth quarter rose 9.5% year over year to $83.85 billion. The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.8%.Total revenues for 2022 were $322.47 billion, reflecting a 10.4% rise from the year-ago period. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.9%.Quarter in DetailPharmacy Services revenues were up 11.2% to $43.75 billion in the reported quarter. The upside was primarily driven by increased pharmacy claims volume, and growth in specialty pharmacy and brand inflation, partially offset by continued client price improvements.Total pharmacy claims processed rose 3.1% on a 30-day equivalent basis, attributable to net new business, increased utilization and the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season, partially offset by a decrease in COVID-19 vaccinations. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.6% on a 30-day equivalent basis.CVS Health Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseCVS Health Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseCVS Health Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | CVS Health Corporation QuoteRevenues from CVS Health’s Retail/LTC segment were up 4% year over year to $28.18 billion. The impressive growth was driven by increased prescription and front store volume, including the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season compared to the prior year, pharmacy drug mix and brand inflation. However, this growth was partially offset by a decline in COVID-19 diagnostic testing and vaccinations, the impact of recent generic introductions and continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure.Story continuesWithin the Health Care Benefits segment, the company registered revenues worth $23.03 billion in the fourth quarter, up 11.3% year over year.MarginTotal cost (including Benefit Costs) rose 11.2% to $70.03 billion in the fourth quarter. Gross profit rose 1.2% to $13.81 billion. The gross margin contracted 135 basis points (bps) to 16.5%.The adjusted operating margin in the quarter under review contracted 24 bps to 4.4%, despite a 3.9% rise in adjusted operating profit to $3.73 billion.2023 GuidanceCVS Health reaffirmed its adjusted EPS guidance for full-year 2023 in the band of $8.70 to $8.90. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings is pegged at $8.84.The company has also issued its full-year operating cash flow projection in the range of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion.Our TakeCVS Health exited the fourth quarter of 2022 on a strong note, with earnings and revenues beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Robust sales growth across all three operating segments drove the top-line results. Within the Health Care Benefits arm, the continued growth across the entire range of insured and self-insured medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health products and services instills optimism. Meanwhile, the company’s parallel announcement of entering into a colossal $10.6-billion acquisition agreement to purchase Oak Street Health is an added positive. Oak Street Health is a network of value-based primary care centers for adults on Medicare. The acquisition is expected to further advance CVS Health’s care delivery strategy for consumers.However, the contraction of margins on escalating costs does not bode well. The decline in COVID-19 vaccinations and testing sales is a downside. Further, persistent pharmacy reimbursement headwinds also continued to impact business performance in the quarter under review.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCVS Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

INSP delivered earnings per share (EPS) of 10 cents in the fourth quarter of 2022 against the year-over-year loss of 9 cents per share. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 54 cents per share.Full-year loss per share was $1.60, wider than the loss of $1.54 per share at the end of the comparable 2021 period. However, the figure was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $2.26 per share.Revenues in DetailInspire Medical registered revenues of $137.9 million in the fourth quarter, up 75.9% year over year. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.1%.The top-line improvement primarily resulted from strength in U.S. revenues and revenues outside the United States (All other countries).Full-year revenues were $407.9 million, reflecting a 74.7% surge from the comparable 2021 period. The metric topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.05%.Segment DetailsInspire Medical’s operations consist of two geographic regions — the United States and All other countries.For the quarter under review, U.S. revenues of $134.3 million reflected an increase of 78% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis. Per management, this upside can be attributed to several factors, including higher utilization at existing centers, the addition of new implanting centers, expanded direct-to-consumer marketing and a higher number of territory managers.During the reported quarter, Inspire Medical activated 61 new U.S. centers, thus bringing the total to 905 U.S. medical centers implanting Inspire therapy. The company also created 16 new U.S. sales territories in the quarter, bringing the total to 225 U.S. sales territories.Revenues from outside the United States totaled $3.6 million, up 28% year over year on a reported basis.Inspire Medical Systems, Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $554.1 million.Inspire Medical also plans to activate 52-56 new U.S. medical centers implanting Inspire therapy and add 12-14 new U.S. sales territories during each quarter of 2023.Our TakeInspire Medical exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected results. Robust improvement of the top-line and bottom-line results in the reported quarter was impressive. Strength in year-over-year geographic results was promising. The activation of new U.S. centers and the creation of new U.S. sales territories during the reported quarter also look encouraging. Management’s expectations of activating more U.S. medical centers and adding new U.S. sales territories during each of the quarters of 2023 also raise our optimism about the stock.However, the rising operating costs putting pressure on the gross margin, thus leading to its contraction, is worrying.Zacks Rank and Key PicksInspire Medical currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

145,b4c76380-d797-303f-8a0e-e6bb184c5726,HOLX,2023-02-09,4 Top Stocks to Buy on Earnings Beat Potential,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-top-stocks-buy-earnings-130301682.html,1675861381,STORY,['HOLX'],"[It is not surprising that before an earnings season, every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectations. This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are high-quality in nature.In this regard, investors can bet on the likes of Genmab GMAB, Hologic HOLX, ServiceNow NOW and Splunk SPLK.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.Also, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.Meanwhile, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They in fact club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Find Stocks That Can Beat?Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.Story continuesThe Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that raise the chance of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat, per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to four.Here are the four stocks:Genmab GMAB: Genmab A/S is a biotechnology company. It specializes in the development of antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The average earnings surprise of GMAB for the past four quarters is 66.61%.Hologic HOLX: Hologic develops, manufactures, and supplies diagnostics, medical imaging systems and surgical products, which cater to the healthcare needs of women. It has a Zacks Rank #1.The average earnings surprise of HOLX for the past four quarters is 30.60%.ServiceNow NOW: The Zacks Rank #2 company provides cloud computing services that automate digital workflows to accelerate enterprise IT operations. The company’s Now Platform enables enterprises to enhance productivity by streamlining system processes.The average earnings surprise of NOW for the past four quarters is 6.91%.Splunk SPLK: This Zacks Rank #2 company provides software solutions that enable enterprises to gain real-time operational intelligence by harnessing the value of their data.The average earnings surprise of SPLK for the past four quarters is 222.03%.You can sign up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

Be prepared to pay almost 50% more,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sharing-netflix-password-prepared-pay-084905183.html,1675932545,STORY,['NFLX'],"[Netflix is expanding its password-sharing crackdown to four new countries, according to a blog post released on Wednesday, as the company tries to convert more free riders into paying subscribers.The company will start asking users in Canada, New Zealand, Spain, and Portugal to pay extra if they want to share an account with someone living outside their home. The cost of adding a new “subaccount” differs per country: Portuguese customers only have to pay €3.99 (or $4.28) a month, while Spanish customers across the border have to pay €5.99 (or $6.43) a month.Subscribers to Netflix’s Standard and Premium plans can add one and two subaccounts respectively. Those on the company’s Basic plan cannot add a new member.The new fees could add significantly to the cost of a Netflix account in these countries. For example, a Standard plan in Canada costs $16.49 Canadian (or $12.28) a month. Adding one extra member will cost an additional $7.99 Canadian (or $5.49), bumping up the total cost by almost 50%.According to its support page, Netflix defines a household as “people who live in the same location with the account owner.”In its post, Netflix promised that users could stream movies and shows even while traveling, though did not provide details.Why is Netflix stopping password sharing?The company suggests that over 100 million households engaged in some form of account sharing. In a letter to shareholders last month, the company claimed that watchers free-riding off someone else’s account “undermines our long-term ability to invest in and improve Netflix.”Netflix has been testing different ways to discourage password sharing in some of its Latin American markets since last March. The model proposed on Wednesday was first tested in Peru, Chile, and Costa Rica.The company reported a loss of 1.2 million paying subscribers in the first half of 2022, which prompted it to accelerate the crackdown on account sharing. Netflix also launched a new ad-supported subscription tier at a lower price point last November.Story continuesThe company’s subscriber numbers have since recovered, with Netflix adding 10.1 million subscribers in the second half of 2022.In its shareholder letter, Netflix said it would roll out its anti-sharing measures more broadly in the first quarter of 2023. The company warned that these new measures could affect “near-term member growth,” but claimed that it would improve overall revenue as more users who once got accounts for free became paying customers.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeThe 5 most common mistakes lottery winners makeThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $400,000 home]"

The US media giant lost 2.4m Disney+ subscribers in the final three months of 2022, taking the total to 161.8m.In December, Disney raised its US prices from $7.99 to $10.99 per month, while the new ad-funded tier remains $7.99. The company is expected to roll out similar changes in the UK this year.Disney reported a further $1.1bn of losses in its streaming division, which also includes Hulu and ESPN+, though this was narrower than in the previous three months.Chief executive Bob Iger, who returned to the role in November following the ousting of predecessor Bob Chapek, promised to rein in costs.“We are embarking on a significant transformation, one that will maximise the potential of our world-class creative teams and our unparalleled brands and franchises,” he said.“We believe the work we are doing to reshape our company around creativity, while reducing expenses, will lead to sustained growth and profitability for our streaming business, better position us to weather future disruption and global economic challenges, and deliver value for our shareholders.”Chief executive Bob Iger promised to rein in costs and reshape the business around creativity - JUSTIN LANE/EPA-EFE/REXDisney has suffered a slump in its share price and is facing a high-profile proxy battle with activist investor Nelson Peltz, who has built up a $900m stake through his Trian Partners.Mr Peltz has attacked Disney for its “over-the-top” executive pay as well as a run of recent acquisitions, in particular its blockbuster $71bn takeover of 21st Century Fox in 2019.Disney has hit back at the activist, saying he does not understand the media giant’s business and lacks the skills required to help the board.Rival Netflix also posted its first ever fall in subscriber numbers last year as consumers began to tighten their belts amid a deepening cost-of-living crisis.Both Disney and Netflix have launched cheaper, ad-funded tiers of their streaming platforms in a bid to stem the decline.Story continuesMr Iger has already outlined a number of changes since returning as chief executive, including scrapping Disney’s media and entertainment distribution unit.The division, which centralised film and television sales and distribution, was the brainchild of Mr Chapek. It absolition reflects efforts to put more power back in the hands of creatives.Mr Iger last month summoned staff back to the office, suggesting that the shift to home working was stifling creativity, and has frozen new hiring.Despite the streaming drop, Disney’s overall revenue and profits beat forecasts thanks to the success of blockbusters Avatar: Way of Water and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, as well as an increase in visits to its theme parks over the festive period.Revenues stood at $23.5bn, while net profit reached $1.3bn.Disney is reportedly looking at licensing out more of its films and TV series to rivals – a reversal of its previous strategy as it looks to find new sources of revenue.The company is also thought to be giving greater priority to theatrical releases after years of pushing new films and TV shows directly to its streaming platforms.Speculation has also been mounting that Disney could spin off its ESPN sports network – a move previously touted by activist Dan Loeb.]"

The media giant will be keeping Discovery+ as a standalone streaming service. For more, we're joined by Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal. So why this decision?ALLIE CANAL: So, apparently, they don't want to risk losing a chunk of those Discovery+ subscribers, which, right now, are about 20 million. Now they're still going to have this new combo service that's expected to launch sometime in the spring with HBO Max content and most of Discovery+ content, but they're also going to keep that standalone Discovery+ service. Wells Fargo estimated that the overlap between HBO Max and Discovery+ is 4 million in the US.And with this new platform, it's widely expected to be called Max. We don't have pricing on it at the moment. But if you take a look at the pricing of both HBO Max and Discovery+, it's probably going to be a little more. HBO Max costs 16 bucks a month, or $10 with ads. Discovery+ is $7 a month, $5 with ads. So we'll just have to wait and see. But I don't know. This company, to me, it seems like things are messy right now, you know? It's just like, they don't know what to name it.DAVE BRIGGS: That's what investors think.ALLIE CANAL: They don't want to roll out the-- they're just back and forth all the time.DAVE BRIGGS: And the stock falling about 5% today on this-- perhaps on this news or the disorganization.ALLIE CANAL: I reached out to Warner Brothers. They did not even get back to me, so it just seems like it's all over the place right now.DAVE BRIGGS: Rhetoric at the moment.SEANA SMITH: Yes, it certainly is all over the place, so a bit messy, that is safe to say. All right, Allie, as we're talking about these streaming wars, Netflix cracking down, expanding its crackdown that we've been talking about on passwords. Four more countries added to the list?Story continuesALLIE CANAL: Four more countries. That's going to include Canada, New Zealand, Portugal, and Spain as of today. And this comes after that meltdown we saw last week where Netflix unintentionally updated their help page that listed some of the password sharing crackdown.And I just got to say, I've received so many emails from concerned Netflix subscribers. Like, I'm talking lengthy-- like, I'm now the Netflix therapist because they just don't know what the answer is. And there's a lot of questions out there, too. If you own multiple homes, if you're a snowbird, how do you set your primary location?So it seems like Netflix is going to have to answer to a lot of this. We do have potentially a little hint at what it would cost to add members that are outside of your household. For example, if you want to add an extra member to your account, you can add up to two people that you don't live with for an extra $7.99 Canadian per month in Canada.

COST, The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX, Target Corp. TGT and Burlington Stores, Inc. BURL.Industry: Retail - Discount StoresLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2050818/4-retail-discount-stocks-that-warrant-attention-despite-industry-woesOngoing inflation, tight labor market and supply chain issues are some of the headwinds that players in the Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry have been encountering lately. Also, rising prices are squeezing consumers’ disposable income, depleting personal savings and dampening demand. With the desperate need to tame inflation, the Federal Reserve is raising the benchmark interest rate. But a higher interest rate environment is not good news for consumer-centric industries.That said, industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, adding more compelling products, and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Inventory management, supply-chain enhancement, cost-structure realignment and investment to accelerate digitization have been working in favor of companies like Costco Wholesale Corp., The TJX Companies, Inc., Target Corp. and Burlington Stores, Inc.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry comprises companies that offer apparel, accessories, footwear, beauty products, personal and baby care products, cleaning products, pet supplies, and food and beverage products at lower prices than traditional retail outlets. The industry participants also provide home textiles, home furnishings, housewares, arts and crafts supplies, toys and seasonal décor products.These companies sell their products through stores, digital channels, or both. Some industry players operate membership shopping warehouse clubs, offering branded and private-label products in a range of merchandise categories. Most discount stores are gradually emerging as one-stop shopping destinations. The profitability of players depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain and an effective merchandising strategy.Story continues4 Key Industry Trends to WatchPressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail-discount space highly competitive. This has compelled a number of players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs.Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation, a tight labor market and supply-chain issues. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks as well as adopting effective pricing policies.Consumer Confidence Slackens: Escalating prices and rising interest rates continue to pose a threat to consumer spending activity and confidence. Per Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index nudged down to 107.1 in January from December’s upwardly revised reading of 109.0. Undoubtedly, the industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. But rising prices have been discomforting family budgets. The consumer price index rose to 6.5% in December 2022 on a year-over-year basis, albeit at a slower rate when compared with November.Consumers Seek Better Bargains: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers in the low-to-middle income groups who have been seeking both value and convenience amid rising prices. Industry participants have been focusing on creating innovative and compelling products as well as enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. They are trying to tap any surge in demand unless derailed by elevated inflation. We also believe that failure to restock inventory at fair prices or delay getting the products delivered to consumers’ doorsteps could compound retailers’ woes.Digitization is Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives such as building omni-channel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at store are worth mentioning.Simultaneously, companies are investing in the renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #186, which places it in the bottom 26% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates drab near-term prospects.

163,19711643-feb9-3a21-acf4-dcc6b530afa4,AMGN,2023-02-09,There's A Lot To Like About Amgen's (NASDAQ:AMGN) Upcoming US$2.13 Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/theres-lot-amgens-nasdaq-amgn-101326819.html,1675937606,STORY,['AMGN'],"[It looks like Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Amgen's shares on or after the 14th of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 8th of March.The company's upcoming dividend is US$2.13 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$8.52 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Amgen has a trailing yield of approximately 3.5% on its current stock price of $240.2. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether Amgen has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for Amgen Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Amgen paid out more than half (64%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It distributed 48% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's positive to see that Amgen's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. That's why it's comforting to see Amgen's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 35% per annum for the past five years. Management appears to be striking a nice balance between reinvesting for growth and paying dividends to shareholders. Earnings per share have been growing quickly and in combination with some reinvestment and a middling payout ratio, the stock may have decent dividend prospects going forwards.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, Amgen has increased its dividend at approximately 19% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.To Sum It UpIs Amgen worth buying for its dividend? We like Amgen's growing earnings per share and the fact that - while its payout ratio is around average - it paid out a lower percentage of its cash flow. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for Amgen and you should be aware of these before buying any shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-inc-nasdaq-amgn-q4-132559074.html,1675862759,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript January 31, 2023Amgen Inc. misses on earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $4.09 EPS, expectations were $4.1.Operator: My name is Jason and I will be the conference facilitator today for Amgen's Fourth Quarter Full Year 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. I would now like to introduce Mr. Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.Arvind Sood: Okay. Thank you, Jason. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our call to discuss the results for Q4 and full year 2022. 2022 was once again a year exemplified by great execution despite some of the macro challenges. Our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, will make some opening comments, followed by prepared comments from other members of our senior leadership team. You should have received a link to our slides that we have posted. Through the course of our discussion, we will make some forward-looking statements and use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance and just a reminder that actual results can vary materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.Bob Bradway: Okay. Thank you, Arvind and hello, everyone and thank you for joining our call. So beginning the year feeling confident about the long-term growth outlook for our business and let me offer 5 reasons why. First, we have a number of innovative volume-driven products that still have plenty of room to run and we saw that in 2022. Repatha, Prolia and EVENITY each generated double-digit sales and volume growth in the fourth quarter and for the full year. We expect continued growth from these products in 2023 and beyond with Repatha, in particular, helped by important new data from the FOURIER open-label extension study and new prescribing guidelines. OTEZLA delivered 7% volume growth in both the fourth quarter and the full year, benefiting from a label expansion that gives us the opportunity to reach millions of new patients in the U.S. with mild to moderate psoriasis.Story continuesLUMAKRAS and TEZSPIRE collectively contributed more than $450 million in full year sales and we're pursuing additional indications for both products. We're especially pleased to see TEZSPIRE being utilized by patients across all types of severe asthma. Murdo will share more about the performance of our in-line products in a moment. Second, we moved 6 first-in-class molecules into Phase III or potentially registration-enabling trials in 2022, including Olpasiran for LP(a), rocatinlimab for atopic dermatitis, TEZSPIRE in eosinophilic esophagitis and of course, bemarituzimab, tarlatimab in BLINCYTO in cancer. We've also begun enrolling patients in a Phase II trial for AMG 133. Based on early data, this molecule, with its unique mechanism of action, looks like it may have an attractive profile for the treatment of obesity.And more on our pipeline from Dave Reese in a moment. Third, we have an industry-leading biosimilars business that will contribute to our growth over time. In 2022, we delivered positive Phase III data for our biosimilar candidates to EYLEA, SOLIRIS and STELARA, positioning us to be in the first wave of these launches which we know is critical to success. We're also less than 24 hours into the launch of AMGEVITA in the U.S. and AMGEVITA is the leading biosimilar to HUMIRA internationally. And with a 5-month lead over the next entrant, we're well positioned for success in the U.S. All told, we have 6 more biosimilar launches planned in the U.S. and markets around the world between now and the end of the decade, making this another source of long-term growth for us.Fourth, we've often said that we would look to licensing and acquisitions in our stated areas of strategic interest. And that's what we've done, building on our decades of experience in inflammation with 2 significant transactions that will strengthen our presence in this space. Through the acquisition of ChemoCentryx, we added TAVNEOS, a first-in-class treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis and we're off to a strong start there. Our announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics will add several additional first-in-class early in life cycle biologic medicines, including TEPEZZA, KRYSTEXXA and UPLIZNA that will add to our growth profile through 2030 and beyond. We're working our way through the regulatory review processes for that deal and are confident that the deal poses no anticompetitive matters.And we have received a second request from the U.S. FTC and we'll work with them to answer their questions while remaining optimistic that we can complete the deal in the first half of the year. Finally, we've stayed true to our capital allocation priorities, investing in our business to drive long-term growth while also returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and a growing dividend. You'll hear more from Peter on this shortly. And everything we achieved last year and everything we will achieve going forward is due to the hard work and commitment of our people. They're passionate about our mission to serve patients. They're clear on how their work contributes to our success and they're ready to seize the opportunities and meet the challenges that await us.I'm grateful to all of them. I look forward to your questions a little later on but now let me turn the call over to Murdo.Murdo Gordon: Thanks, Bob. 2022 was another year of strong execution of our mission to bring products to the millions of patients in the world who suffer from gravest illness. The evolution of our portfolio continue by record sales for 16 brands. We saw strong volume gains across our general medicine and hematology-oncology growth brands. Our inflammation therapeutic area expanded with the launch of TEZSPIRE and the acquisition of TAVNEOS, 2 first-in-class medicines that treat serious disease. In addition, our announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics will add several important medicines to our portfolio. In total, volume growth for 2022 was 9% with 7% growth in the U.S. and 14% growth ex U.S. as we continue to deliver on our international growth strategy.Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, full year global product sales grew 4% as our volume increases were offset by a 5% decline in net selling price. Including the 2% negative foreign exchange impact, product sales increased 2% year-over-year. In the quarter, we also saw strong volume growth with a 10% increase year-on-year. Starting with our general medicine business which includes Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha and Aimovig, overall revenue for these 4 products grew 21% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 18% for the full year, driven by 19% and 21% volume growth, respectively. In bone health, Prolia sales grew 14% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven primarily by 11% volume growth. EVENITY which complements Prolia in our bone portfolio, had record sales of $225 million for the quarter, driven by strong volume growth across markets.Laboratory, Health, ResearchPhoto by CDC on UnsplashRepatha sales increased 22% year-over-year for the fourth quarter with volume growth of 31%, partially offset by lower net selling price. In the U.S., we generated volume growth of 32% for the fourth quarter, aided by broad adoption of Repatha by cardiologists and increasing adoption by primary care providers. We saw declining net selling prices in the U.S. as we offered higher rebates to support broad Medicare Part D and commercial patient access. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect less year-over-year U.S. price erosion than we saw in 2022. Outside the U.S., fourth quarter sales of Repatha grew 36% year-over-year, driven by 31% volume growth. Globally, Repatha has treated over 1.5 million patients since launch. Repatha's strong prescribing history in cardiology and expanding use in the primary care setting position us well to bring Repatha to more patients globally.With the FOURIER long-term follow-up data, in addition to evolving and more aggressive treatment guidelines, there's a clear rationale that lowering LDL cholesterol as much and as early as possible with Repatha will reduce cardiovascular risk for patients around the world. Transitioning to our inflammation portfolio. Otezla sales decreased 2% year-over-year for the quarter and increased 2% for the full year. We saw 7% volume growth in both periods. This was offset by lower net selling price, stemming from enhancements to our co-pay and patient assistance programs to support new patients starting treatment as well as additional rebates to improve the quality of coverage. During the fourth quarter, our U.S. Otezla business was impacted by new patient demand from 3 drug programs by newly launched topical and systemic competition.We expect that impact to continue in Q1 of 2023. We also expect to see the typical pattern of lower sales in the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters due primarily to the effect of insurance reverifications, co-pays and deductibles for patients. The combined effect could lead to first quarter Otezla sales being similar to or below those from Q1 of 2022. Longer term, we continue to see strong growth potential for Otezla, given its established safety profile, strong payer coverage with limited prior authorization requirements and ease of administration. Otezla remains the only approved oral systemic therapy with a broad indication and is well positioned to help the 4 million U.S. patients with mild to moderate psoriasis, 1.5 million of whom have psoriasis that cannot be optimally addressed by a topical and can benefit from a first-line systemic treatment like Otezla.ENBREL sales decreased 1% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven by declines in volume and net selling price, partially offset by higher year-end inventory levels. ENBREL remains an important product for patients due to its long track record of efficacy and safety. TEZSPIRE continues its strong launch with $79 million in sales in the fourth quarter and $170 million for the full year. Allergists and pulmonologists have prescribed TEZSPIRE across a broad range of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. We're also seeing initiation of TEZSPIRE in both biologic-naive and previously treated patients. Physicians acknowledge TEZSPIRE unique differentiated profile and has broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe uncontrolled asthma without any phenotypic and biomarker limitations.We're now preparing for the anticipated U.S. approval of the prefilled pen in the first quarter which will offer patients the convenient option to administer TEZSPIRE at home. Sales of TAVNEOS were $21 million in the fourth quarter. Our integration of ChemoCentryx is proceeding smoothly, confirming our belief that Amgen's deep experience in inflammation and nephrology and substantial market presence will allow us to bring TAVNEOS to more patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. We're also excited about our announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics. Our combined portfolio which will include will address serious inflammatory diseases and improve the lives of many patients. Amgen's commercial capabilities and global presence in approximately 100 markets will allow our combined team to deliver important therapies that will make a meaningful difference for more patients globally.Today, we announced the launch of AMGEVITA, the first U.S. biosimilar to HUMIRA, a medicine used by more than 1 million patients living with serious inflammatory diseases. With our track record of developing and manufacturing biologics and decades of experience in inflammation, Amgen is uniquely equipped to supply patients with this biosimilar medicine. AMGEVITA is the first significant U.S. biosimilar in the pharmacy benefit space and we expect gradual uptake in the coming months as this market evolves. Moving to our hematology and oncology business which includes LUMAKRAS, KYPROLIS, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate and BLINCYTO. These 6 innovative products grew 14% year-over-year with 17% volume growth for the quarter. Full year sales grew 13%, driven by volume gains.KYPROLIS sales grew 14% in the fourth quarter. Nplate sales in the fourth quarter included $207 million related to a onetime order from the U.S. government. Given the strong performance of our hem/onc portfolio in 2022 and the recent positive data on both BLINCYTO and Vectibix, I look forward to the future growth potential of this portfolio. LUMAKRAS reported $71 million in sales in the fourth quarter and $285 million for the full year. Quarter-over-quarter sales declined 5% with 12% volume growth, more than offset by a lower net selling price driven by a $12 million unfavorable price adjustment resulting from a reimbursement approval decision in France and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. Outside the U.S., LUMAKRAS has now been approved in over 45 countries.We've launched LUMAKRAS in 30 markets and are rapidly pursuing reimbursement in the remaining countries. As we've noted before, the market for LUMAKRAS focused on the 7,000 U.S. and 20,000 ex U.S. patients in the second-line setting. Longer term, we expect LUMAKRAS growth to come from moving into earlier lines of therapy and expanding into additional tumor types. Sales of our oncology biosimilars declined 40% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 30% for the full year, driven by lower price. While our biosimilars for MVASI and KANJINTI both hold leading shares, we expect continued net selling price deterioration and accelerating volume declines, driven by increased competition. The most recently published average selling price in the U.S. declined 38% year-over-year for MVASI and 51% for KANJINTI.Over time, we expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches. And as we start the new year, I'm inspired by the hard work of the thousands of Amgen employees around the world who wake up every day to serve our patients. Our expanding international presence and diverse portfolio of products, further strengthened by the integration of ChemoCentryx and the announced acquisition of Horizon, position us well to serve many more patients globally. And with that, I'll turn it to Dave.David Reese: Thanks, Murdo. Good afternoon, everyone. For research and development, last year was one of high-quality execution and on-time delivery of results as we continued to progress our innovative pipeline. In general medicine, we strengthened our cardiovascular franchise and emerging portfolio of obesity assets, 2 areas of significant unmet need, affecting millions of patients globally. Repatha, of course, is the cornerstone of these efforts. And last November at AHA, we presented FOURIER open-label extension data. These data were recognized by the American College of Cardiology expert consensus decision pathway which indicated there appears to be no LDL cholesterol level below which benefit ceases. Additionally, LDL cholesterol recommendations were updated to reflect a reduction in target LDL levels in highest-risk patients from 70 to 55 milligrams per deciliter.This is a level that is not attainable for a large number of patients without PCSK9 inhibitor therapy. Another molecule that we are excited about is Olpasiran. At AHA, we presented Phase II data where Olpasiran dosed 75 milligrams or higher every 12 weeks reduced Lp(a) concentrations by 95% to 100% in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with baseline Lp(a) levels of approximately 260 nanomolars per liter. Olpasiran appeared both safe and well tolerated in this study. We are encouraged by these data, particularly our dosing frequency, safety and tolerability profile and degree of Lp(a) reduction. We have initiated a Phase III outcome study and 6,000 subjects with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and significantly elevated Lp(a) levels of at least 200 nanomolars per liter.Now turning to obesity. In December, we presented data from a Phase I study where AMG 133 appeared safe, well-tolerated and demonstrated a 14.5% reduction in body weight at day 85 following 3 monthly subcutaneous injections. Body weight reductions were observed up to 150 days after the final AMG 133 administration. Given these favorable attributes, we are now enrolling a 570-subject Phase II study to explore AMG 133 in patients with obesity with or without diabetes and related comorbidities. The study will also investigate different dosing levels and regimensSee also 20 Least Populated States in America and 13 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy .To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

All the banks have committed to stop lending to new coal-fired power plants.Japan's second largest bank by assets was getting most of its new energy funding opportunities in the renewable energy sector, followed by hydrogen, Kannan said, adding that the group would progressively reduce exposure to gas-related transactions.A February 2022 report by 28 non-governmental organisations showed SMBC's rivals Mizuho and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) were the biggest financiers of the global coal industry, which received $373 billion in loans in nearly three years ending November 2021.SMBC's bigger rival MUFG has since halted financing new coal mines, but has not laid out its funding policy for existing mine expansion. Smaller lender Mizuho Financial said last year it would stop lending to new clients who are pure-play coal miners.Kannan said decisions on offering financial support to carbon capture were ""not easy"" as it would still mean developing a coal-based utility, but called ammonia co-firing a ""good option"" provided power generated from coal was quickly displaced by ammonia.""Big picture, we are focused on our finance emissions targets.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the world, is up 48% this year.But CNBC’s Jim Cramer isn’t a fan.Don’t miss'Hold onto your money': Jeff Bezos issued a financial warning, says you might want to rethink buying a 'new automobile, refrigerator, or whatever' — here are 3 better recession-proof buysRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwindsHere's how much money the average middle-class American household makes — how do you stack up?“The charts, as interpreted by Carley Garner, suggest you need to ignore the crypto cheerleaders now that bitcoin’s bouncing,” he says, referencing analysis from DeCarley Trading’s senior commodity market strategist and broker Carley Garner.Some say that cryptocurrencies can be used as a hedge against inflation. Bitcoin, for instance, can’t be printed out of thin air like fiat money. The number of bitcoins is capped at 21 million by mathematical algorithms.Cramer, however, suggests using something much older to fight inflation.“If you seriously want a real hedge against inflation or economic chaos, she [Garner] says you should stick with gold. And I agree,” the Mad Money host says.Of course, if you’ve been following Cramer, you’d already know that he hasn’t been optimistic about the crypto world lately.“The manipulation higher of crypto shows you this is truly a sham market,” he tweeted earlier in January.If you share Cramer’s view and want to use gold as a hedge against inflation and uncertainty, here are three ways to gain exposure to the shiny metal.BullionInvesting in gold has been considered the go-to inflation-fighting move.It can also be a great hedge against uncertainty, as the value of gold is largely unaffected by economic events around the world.And because of the precious metal’s safe-haven status, investors often rush toward it in times of crisis, making it an effective hedge.Story continuesThe first method to invest in gold is the most straightforward one: if you want to own gold, just buy gold.Most bullion shops carry a selection of gold bars and coins, so you can always find something that fits your investment needs. Just remember, if you want to invest in a large amount of gold and don’t want to keep the stash at home, you will likely need to pay for storage at a vault.Read more: Goldman Sachs says bitcoin is not investable — this is where they think you should put 33% of your wealth insteadGold mining companiesWhen the price of gold goes up, your gold bars and coins will be worth more. But gold mining companies can also benefit in such a scenario.Barrick Gold, for instance, is a gold and copper producer operating mines and projects in 18 countries in North and South America, Africa, Papua New Guinea and Saudi Arabia. In 2021, the company produced 4.4 million ounces of gold and generated net earnings of $2.0 billion.There’s also Newmont (NYSE:NEM), another heavyweight player in the gold mining industry and the only gold producer in the S&amp;P 500. Its portfolio of assets span North and South America, Australia, and Africa. The company also produces copper, silver, zinc and lead.Higher gold prices can allow miners to earn higher revenues and profits, which could translate to higher share prices. However, each company is different so make sure to do your research and find the ones that can keep costs down and run efficient operations.ETFsExchange-traded funds have risen in popularity in recent years. They trade on stock exchanges, so buying and selling them is very convenient.Investors can use them to get a piece of the gold action, too.The most well-known ETF in this space is the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEARCA:GLD), which is designed to track the price of gold. GLD is backed by physical gold bullion sitting at its vaults and has an expense ratio of 0.40%.The iShares Gold Trust (NYSEARCA:IAU) is another ETF that allows investors to easily track the price of the yellow metal. It holds gold bullion — just like GLD — but has a lower expense ratio at 0.25%.There are also ETFs that provide exposure to gold mining companies.For instance, the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX) tracks the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index. It has a portfolio of gold mining stocks, with Newmont and Barrick Gold as its two largest holdings.GDX has an expense ratio of 0.51%.A better way to buy gold?Of course, those aren't the only ways to gain exposure to the yellow metal.A Gold IRA, for example, is a type of individual retirement account that allows you to invest in gold and other precious metals in physical forms, such as coins, instead of stocks, mutual funds and other traditional investments.It’s a great alternative because unlike the U.S. dollar, which has lost 98% of its purchasing power since 1971, gold’s purchasing power remains more stable over time.Opting for a Gold IRA gives you the opportunity to both diversify your portfolio and stabilize your finances.If you want to open a Gold IRA, there are reputable services that’ll let you roll over your current 401(k) or IRA into this new account — and quickly.This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

That's really the core question for this year,"" said Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin, adding that he felt the decline so far had been ""distorted"" by some falling goods prices.Crude prices eased, with gold firmer as the dollar index fell 0.18%, while MSCI's U.S.-centric index of stock performance in 47 countries shed 0.44%.The market is confused as it thought it understood, despite the Fed's rhetoric, that the U.S. central bank was very close to ending its rate-hiking cycle, said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.In addition, the closely watched inversion of the yield difference between short- and longer-dated Treasuries, which occurs when the two-year's yield is higher than that of the 10-year note, is a cause for concern, Krosby said.""Look at the inverted yield curve, it's steepened. We stare at it and we want to believe it's different this time,"" she said.""All this together, underpinned by a yield curve that is shouting, shouting recession coming. The market has to respect that, it may not agree with it, but it has to respect it.""The gap between two- and 10-year yields remained inverted at -82.3 bps, after steepening to -87.5 bps earlier in the session.The two-year rose 3.4 basis points to 4.488% after hitting an almost 10-week high of 4.514%Story continuesGRAPHIC: Inverted U.S. Treasury curve a harbinger of recession - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zdvxoemlrpx/US0707.pngFutures priced in the Fed's target rate to peak at 5.15% in July, about 25 basis points higher than last week, and by December showed the key rate will have declined to just 4.86%, or some 40 bps more than a week ago when the market expected a rate cut.""There's this belief we can still have a strong economy, a strong labor market and that inflation will continue to decline,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.However, getting inflation down to the Fed's 2% target could easily take more than a year as energy prices may remain elevated, a fact making some in the market nervous, he said.""There's going to be a rude awakening at some point and that you're going to need to see something break to get inflation all the way back down,"" Moya said.Data again showed a tight U.S. labor market even as the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week, news that helped set aside concerns that interest rates will stay higher for longer.In the latest move by major central banks, Sweden's Riksbank on Thursday raised its key interest rate by half a percentage point to 3%, and forecast further tightening in the spring.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.73%, the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.88% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.02%.German consumer prices, harmonized to compare with other European Union countries, rose by a less-than-expected 9.2% on the year in January, helping reassure markets that prices have peaked.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.62%, rebounding from an earlier decline, while Japan's Nikkei eased 0.08%.China's blue chips rose 1.3%, pulling away from a one-month trough, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 1.6%.Barclays upgraded their forecast of China's economic growth to 5.3% this year, from 4.8% previously, with Fitch also revising its forecast up to 5%. Both cited an accelerated recovery in consumer spending.Crude prices eased as oil infrastructure appeared to have escaped serious damage from the earthquake that devastated parts of Turkey and Syria, while U.S. inventories swelled and investors worried about central bank rate hikes.U.S. crude futures settled down 41 cents at $78.06 a barrel, and Brent fell 59 cents to settle at $84.50 a barrel.Gold prices rose for a fourth straight session as the dollar faltered, even as Fed officials indicated more rate hikes are warranted to rein in inflation. Gold is sensitive to high rates, which increase the cost of holding zero-yield bullion.U.S. gold futures settled down $12.20 at $1,878.50 an ounce.(Reporting by Herbert Lash, additional reporting by Huw Jones, Stella Qiu; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Jonathan Oatis)]"

That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for General Dynamics General Dynamics Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Senior VP, Gregory Gallopoulos, for US$2.5m worth of shares, at about US$228 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$229. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 8.0% of Gregory Gallopoulos's holding. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Gregory Gallopoulos.Gregory Gallopoulos divested 21.77k shares over the last 12 months at an average price of US$233. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. General Dynamics insiders own 6.3% of the company, currently worth about US$3.9b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The General Dynamics Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no General Dynamics insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. While we feel good about high insider ownership of General Dynamics, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

This compares to loss of $1.37 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -5.13%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this casino operator would post a loss of $1.20 per share when it actually produced a loss of $1.20, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Wynn , which belongs to the Zacks Gaming industry, posted revenues of $1 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.78%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.05 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Wynn shares have added about 25.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 8.5%.What's Next for Wynn?While Wynn has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Wynn: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.75 on $1.06 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.72 on $4.8 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Gaming is currently in the top 25% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.NeoGames S.A. (NGMS), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022.This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1000%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.NeoGames S.A.'s revenues are expected to be $67.58 million, up 451.7% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we express in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, adverse macroeconomic conditions and their impact on levels of income and consumer discretionary spending, changes in interest rates, inflation, a decline in general economic activity or recession in the U.S. and/or global economies, the COVID-19 pandemic and the reimposition of restrictions on the general public or certain activities, extensive regulation of our business, pending or future legal proceedings, ability to maintain gaming licenses and concessions, dependence on key employees, general global political conditions, adverse tourism trends, dependence on a limited number of resorts, competition in the casino/hotel and resort industries, uncertainties over the development and success of new gaming and resort properties, construction risks, cybersecurity risk and our leverage and debt service. Additional information concerning potential factors that could affect the Company's financial results is included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as supplemented by the Company's other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. The Company is under no obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) update or revise its forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.Non-GAAP Financial Measures(1) ""Adjusted Property EBITDAR"" is net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, pre-opening expenses, gain on EBH Transaction, net, property charges and other, triple-net operating lease rent expense related to Encore Boston Harbor, management and license fees, corporate expenses and other (including intercompany golf course, meeting and convention, and water rights leases), stock-based compensation, change in derivatives fair value, loss on extinguishment of debt, and other non-operating income and expenses. We use Adjusted Property EBITDAR to manage the operating results of our segments. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses Adjusted Property EBITDAR as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. We also present Adjusted Property EBITDAR because it is used by some investors to measure a company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDAR as a supplement to GAAP. In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their EBITDAR calculations preopening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation, that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. However, Adjusted Property EBITDAR should not be considered as an alternative to operating income (loss) as an indicator of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net income (loss), Adjusted Property EBITDAR does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, triple-net operating lease rent expense related to Encore Boston Harbor, interest payments, debt principal repayments, income taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in Adjusted Property EBITDAR. Also, our calculation of Adjusted Property EBITDAR may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.(2) ""Adjusted net loss attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited"" is net income (loss) attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited before pre-opening expenses, gain on EBH Transaction, net, property charges and other, change in derivatives fair value, loss on extinguishment of debt, and foreign currency remeasurement and other, net of noncontrolling interests.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Knights that Beat The Market Last 5 Years. With the S&amp;P 500 gaining 8.89% this year so far, the US stock market is showing signs of recovery. According to a recent report by Morgan Stanley, stocks could have a strong first half of the year despite lingering recession fears. However, the report also mentions that earnings may fall throughout the year. In these fluctuating conditions, investors rely on dividend-focused stocks to ensure regular means of income.During the previous inflationary periods, dividend stocks held up well in comparison with other asset classes. Dividends represented 40% of the market since the 1940s and the ratio increased during decades when inflation was higher, as reported by Hartford Funds. The report also revealed the performance of dividend stocks in the 1970s, when they represented 73% of the S&amp;P 500 returns. Various other reports show that dividends usually grow faster than inflation. One such research was carried out by Fidelity International which revealed that since 1900, the 10-year annual average growth in dividends across the S&amp;p 500 outpaced CPI growth nearly 73% of the time.Companies with strong dividend growth tracks and solid returns become investors’ choices as they prepare them for challenging periods. In addition to this, investors also pay attention to the company’s cash flow generation and sound balance sheet, which warrant future dividend payouts. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Roper Technologies, Inc.

S&amp;P and Moody’s have roughly equal market shares and rate more than 90% of all bonds worldwide. The service provides high value for the cost. A company that chooses to issue debt without a rating will pay an interest rate that could be higher by half of a percent. The cost of a higher interest rate far exceeds any savings gained by not using the services of S&amp;P.We think of S&amp;P as a toll road that earns fees from its customers in exchange for cost-effective access to capital. As such, the company has extraordinary margins and pricing power and requires little of its own capital to grow. Even after fully reinvesting in its business, S&amp;P still has an excess of cash. In 2021, S&amp;P produced $3.5 billion of free cash from $8.3 billion of revenues. The company returns the majority of its free cash to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases.”9.

""International markets remained strong with sales growth of 7 percent in local currency. Lower volumes, foreign currency and higher operational costs pressured operating margins in the quarter.""""For the full year 2022, we delivered 4 percent sales growth against a 17 percent comp in 2021, and 2 percent adjusted earnings per share growth,"" continued Allman. ""In 2022, despite higher operational costs and softening demand, we delivered earnings growth for our shareholders and executed our capital deployment strategy by returning approximately $1.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.""""In 2023, we believe the near-term demand environment will remain challenging,"" said Allman. ""We are preparing for volumes overall to be down in the low double-digit range and anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.10 to $3.40 per share. Despite the expected near-term market softness, we believe the long-term fundamentals of our repair and remodel markets remain strong. We are focused on capitalizing on these positive long-term demand trends by improving our margins and continuing to invest in growth opportunities. With our industry leading repair and remodel-oriented products in diverse channels, strong balance sheet, and disciplined capital allocation, we believe Masco is well positioned to deliver long-term shareholder value creation.""Dividend DeclarationMasco’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.285 per share, a 2 percent increase, payable on March 13, 2023 to shareholders of record on February 23, 2023.""The Board’s decision to once again increase Masco’s quarterly cash dividend is consistent with our capital allocation strategy of targeting a dividend payout ratio of approximately 30 percent with annual increases through a cycle,"" said Allman. ""This increase underscores the strength of our company’s financial position, our ability to generate consistent, strong free cash flow, and the Board’s confidence in Masco’s future.""About MascoHeadquartered in Livonia, Michigan, Masco Corporation is a global leader in the design, manufacture and distribution of branded home improvement and building products.

Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter decreased 13% to $827 million compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 5% to $2.54 compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share primarily due to a challenging issuance environment continuing to weigh on Ratings revenue, partially offset by growth across the Company's other core businesses, and prudent expense management.For the full year, reported revenue increased 35% to $11.18 billion. 2022 GAAP net income increased 7% to $3.25 billion and GAAP diluted earnings per share decreased 18% to $10.20.

Margin impact was partially offset by lower incentive expenses and cost synergies.Return of Capital: In 2022, the Company returned more than $13 billion to shareholders through a combination of $12 billion in the form of accelerated share repurchases (ASR) and $1 billion in cash dividends.

Additionally, beginning with the first quarter 2023 earnings results, the Company expects to disclose the Billed Issuance volumes, in dollars, for both investment-grade and high-yield issuance, as well as the revenue generated from vitality products, its climate and sustainability-related products, and its private markets-related products. We expect any such quarterly disclosures to be posted to our investor relations website along with the Company's usual earnings results reporting.Market Intelligence: 4th Quarter, 2022: Reported revenue increased 83% to $1,037 million in the fourth quarter primarily driven by the inclusion of IHS Markit revenue and increased 3% compared to pro forma revenue.

Adjusted operating profit increased 16% to $326 million compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin improved 360 basis points to 31.4% compared to non-GAAP pro forma adjusted operating profit margin driven by the achievement of merger-related cost synergies.Ratings: 4th Quarter, 2022: Reported revenue decreased 29% to $705 million.

The Company has included reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP on Exhibits 5, 6 and 7. Reconciliations of certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures are not available due to the challenges and impracticability with estimating some of the items. The Company is not able to provide reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Because of those challenges, reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures are not available without unreasonable effort.The Company's non-GAAP measures include adjustments that reflect how management views our businesses. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that, in the case of non-GAAP financial measures other than free cash flow and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted free cash flow excluding certain items, enables investors to better compare the Company's performance across periods, and management also uses these measures internally to assess the operating performance of its business, to assess performance for employee compensation purposes and to decide how to allocate resources. The Company believes that the presentation of free cash flow and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted free cash flow excluding certain items allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management and that such measures are useful in evaluating the cash available to us to prepay debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, and repurchase stock. However, investors should not consider any of these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information that the Company reports.Conference Call/Webcast Details: The Company's senior management will review the fourth quarter and full-year 2022 earnings results on a conference call scheduled for today, February 9, at 8:30 a.m. ET.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Knights that Beat The Market Last 5 Years. With the S&amp;P 500 gaining 8.89% this year so far, the US stock market is showing signs of recovery. According to a recent report by Morgan Stanley, stocks could have a strong first half of the year despite lingering recession fears. However, the report also mentions that earnings may fall throughout the year. In these fluctuating conditions, investors rely on dividend-focused stocks to ensure regular means of income.During the previous inflationary periods, dividend stocks held up well in comparison with other asset classes. Dividends represented 40% of the market since the 1940s and the ratio increased during decades when inflation was higher, as reported by Hartford Funds. The report also revealed the performance of dividend stocks in the 1970s, when they represented 73% of the S&amp;P 500 returns. Various other reports show that dividends usually grow faster than inflation. One such research was carried out by Fidelity International which revealed that since 1900, the 10-year annual average growth in dividends across the S&amp;p 500 outpaced CPI growth nearly 73% of the time.Companies with strong dividend growth tracks and solid returns become investors’ choices as they prepare them for challenging periods. In addition to this, investors also pay attention to the company’s cash flow generation and sound balance sheet, which warrant future dividend payouts. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP), and Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL) are some major companies that managed to raise their dividends for decades and also outperformed the broader market over the years.

Here is what the firm has to say:“S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is another company we own that is part of a duopoly in the business of credit rating. S&amp;P and Moody’s have roughly equal market shares and rate more than 90% of all bonds worldwide. The service provides high value for the cost. A company that chooses to issue debt without a rating will pay an interest rate that could be higher by half of a percent. The cost of a higher interest rate far exceeds any savings gained by not using the services of S&amp;P.We think of S&amp;P as a toll road that earns fees from its customers in exchange for cost-effective access to capital. As such, the company has extraordinary margins and pricing power and requires little of its own capital to grow. Even after fully reinvesting in its business, S&amp;P still has an excess of cash. In 2021, S&amp;P produced $3.5 billion of free cash from $8.3 billion of revenues. The company returns the majority of its free cash to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases.”9.

All the banks have committed to stop lending to new coal-fired power plants.Japan's second largest bank by assets was getting most of its new energy funding opportunities in the renewable energy sector, followed by hydrogen, Kannan said, adding that the group would progressively reduce exposure to gas-related transactions.A February 2022 report by 28 non-governmental organisations showed SMBC's rivals Mizuho and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) were the biggest financiers of the global coal industry, which received $373 billion in loans in nearly three years ending November 2021.SMBC's bigger rival MUFG has since halted financing new coal mines, but has not laid out its funding policy for existing mine expansion. Smaller lender Mizuho Financial said last year it would stop lending to new clients who are pure-play coal miners.Kannan said decisions on offering financial support to carbon capture were ""not easy"" as it would still mean developing a coal-based utility, but called ammonia co-firing a ""good option"" provided power generated from coal was quickly displaced by ammonia.""Big picture, we are focused on our finance emissions targets.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the world, is up 48% this year.But CNBC’s Jim Cramer isn’t a fan.Don’t miss'Hold onto your money': Jeff Bezos issued a financial warning, says you might want to rethink buying a 'new automobile, refrigerator, or whatever' — here are 3 better recession-proof buysRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwindsHere's how much money the average middle-class American household makes — how do you stack up?“The charts, as interpreted by Carley Garner, suggest you need to ignore the crypto cheerleaders now that bitcoin’s bouncing,” he says, referencing analysis from DeCarley Trading’s senior commodity market strategist and broker Carley Garner.Some say that cryptocurrencies can be used as a hedge against inflation. Bitcoin, for instance, can’t be printed out of thin air like fiat money. The number of bitcoins is capped at 21 million by mathematical algorithms.Cramer, however, suggests using something much older to fight inflation.“If you seriously want a real hedge against inflation or economic chaos, she [Garner] says you should stick with gold. And I agree,” the Mad Money host says.Of course, if you’ve been following Cramer, you’d already know that he hasn’t been optimistic about the crypto world lately.“The manipulation higher of crypto shows you this is truly a sham market,” he tweeted earlier in January.If you share Cramer’s view and want to use gold as a hedge against inflation and uncertainty, here are three ways to gain exposure to the shiny metal.BullionInvesting in gold has been considered the go-to inflation-fighting move.It can also be a great hedge against uncertainty, as the value of gold is largely unaffected by economic events around the world.And because of the precious metal’s safe-haven status, investors often rush toward it in times of crisis, making it an effective hedge.Story continuesThe first method to invest in gold is the most straightforward one: if you want to own gold, just buy gold.Most bullion shops carry a selection of gold bars and coins, so you can always find something that fits your investment needs. Just remember, if you want to invest in a large amount of gold and don’t want to keep the stash at home, you will likely need to pay for storage at a vault.Read more: Goldman Sachs says bitcoin is not investable — this is where they think you should put 33% of your wealth insteadGold mining companiesWhen the price of gold goes up, your gold bars and coins will be worth more. But gold mining companies can also benefit in such a scenario.Barrick Gold, for instance, is a gold and copper producer operating mines and projects in 18 countries in North and South America, Africa, Papua New Guinea and Saudi Arabia. In 2021, the company produced 4.4 million ounces of gold and generated net earnings of $2.0 billion.There’s also Newmont (NYSE:NEM), another heavyweight player in the gold mining industry and the only gold producer in the S&amp;P 500. Its portfolio of assets span North and South America, Australia, and Africa. The company also produces copper, silver, zinc and lead.Higher gold prices can allow miners to earn higher revenues and profits, which could translate to higher share prices. However, each company is different so make sure to do your research and find the ones that can keep costs down and run efficient operations.ETFsExchange-traded funds have risen in popularity in recent years. They trade on stock exchanges, so buying and selling them is very convenient.Investors can use them to get a piece of the gold action, too.The most well-known ETF in this space is the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEARCA:GLD), which is designed to track the price of gold. GLD is backed by physical gold bullion sitting at its vaults and has an expense ratio of 0.40%.The iShares Gold Trust (NYSEARCA:IAU) is another ETF that allows investors to easily track the price of the yellow metal. It holds gold bullion — just like GLD — but has a lower expense ratio at 0.25%.There are also ETFs that provide exposure to gold mining companies.For instance, the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX) tracks the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index. It has a portfolio of gold mining stocks, with Newmont and Barrick Gold as its two largest holdings.GDX has an expense ratio of 0.51%.A better way to buy gold?Of course, those aren't the only ways to gain exposure to the yellow metal.A Gold IRA, for example, is a type of individual retirement account that allows you to invest in gold and other precious metals in physical forms, such as coins, instead of stocks, mutual funds and other traditional investments.It’s a great alternative because unlike the U.S. dollar, which has lost 98% of its purchasing power since 1971, gold’s purchasing power remains more stable over time.Opting for a Gold IRA gives you the opportunity to both diversify your portfolio and stabilize your finances.If you want to open a Gold IRA, there are reputable services that’ll let you roll over your current 401(k) or IRA into this new account — and quickly.This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

BASF SE, which can switch its turbine between gas and fuel oil, is using the dirtier option which emits around 1.5 times more carbon emissions.Even though wholesale gas prices have fallen to about a sixth of last summer’s peaks, companies are reluctant to use the fuel after it was weaponized by Moscow in response to Western sanctions. Signs that the temporary fix will be more permanent pose a huge setback for cutting carbon in Europe’s most polluting economy.Germany is expected to struggle for years to fully replace the supplies it once sourced from Russia, and executives are unwilling to risk volatile gas prices — even if alternatives are more emissions-heavy.Although gas in the spot market has fallen, supply deals offered to companies are still much more expensive, said Sebastian Bolay, energy expert at the trade and industry group DIHK. As long as this remains the case, companies will rely on fuel oil, he said.The transition away from fossil fuels is being delayed across Europe as nations scramble to secure alternative supplies to replace Russia. Germany, which was previously highly dependent on Moscow, pressured all corners of its economy to save resources, while also prolonging the life of several dormant coal plants to make up for the shortfall until March 2024.Story continuesThe country aims to cut emissions by nearly two thirds compared to 1990-levels by 2030, but has so far only managed a reduction of about 39%.“Achieving reduction targets in this situation will certainly be challenging, to impossible,” said Veronika Grimm, part of the five-member council of economic experts that advises the government.While lower gas use helped cut industry carbon dioxide emissions by about 8 million metric tons, the sector could have saved around 12 million tons had it not been for the fuel switch to coal and oil, according to Frank Peter, a director at the Agora Energiewende think tank in Berlin. Germany burned coal for electricity at the fastest pace in at least six years last year.More recently, some parts of German industry have started ramping up production again and increasing gas consumption, facilitated by cheaper prices after a mostly mild winter. The risk is if factory activity drives up prices, “we will certainly see a savings effect for natural gas again, but also an increased use of particularly dirty fuels,” Peter said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow a Big Short Cost India’s Adani Empire $100 BillionLab-Grown Meat Has a Bigger Problem Than the LabNestlé’s $6,000 Peanut Allergy Pill Has Been a DudBrazil's Richest Man Loses Billions as His M&amp;A Machine Breaks DownThe Skies Look Gloomy for Big Tech’s Cloud Ambitions©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

That's really the core question for this year,"" said Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin, adding that he felt the decline so far had been ""distorted"" by some falling goods prices.Crude prices eased, with gold firmer as the dollar index fell 0.18%, while MSCI's U.S.-centric index of stock performance in 47 countries shed 0.44%.The market is confused as it thought it understood, despite the Fed's rhetoric, that the U.S. central bank was very close to ending its rate-hiking cycle, said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.In addition, the closely watched inversion of the yield difference between short- and longer-dated Treasuries, which occurs when the two-year's yield is higher than that of the 10-year note, is a cause for concern, Krosby said.""Look at the inverted yield curve, it's steepened. We stare at it and we want to believe it's different this time,"" she said.""All this together, underpinned by a yield curve that is shouting, shouting recession coming. The market has to respect that, it may not agree with it, but it has to respect it.""The gap between two- and 10-year yields remained inverted at -82.3 bps, after steepening to -87.5 bps earlier in the session.The two-year rose 3.4 basis points to 4.488% after hitting an almost 10-week high of 4.514%Story continuesGRAPHIC: Inverted U.S. Treasury curve a harbinger of recession - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zdvxoemlrpx/US0707.pngFutures priced in the Fed's target rate to peak at 5.15% in July, about 25 basis points higher than last week, and by December showed the key rate will have declined to just 4.86%, or some 40 bps more than a week ago when the market expected a rate cut.""There's this belief we can still have a strong economy, a strong labor market and that inflation will continue to decline,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.However, getting inflation down to the Fed's 2% target could easily take more than a year as energy prices may remain elevated, a fact making some in the market nervous, he said.""There's going to be a rude awakening at some point and that you're going to need to see something break to get inflation all the way back down,"" Moya said.Data again showed a tight U.S. labor market even as the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week, news that helped set aside concerns that interest rates will stay higher for longer.In the latest move by major central banks, Sweden's Riksbank on Thursday raised its key interest rate by half a percentage point to 3%, and forecast further tightening in the spring.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.73%, the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.88% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.02%.German consumer prices, harmonized to compare with other European Union countries, rose by a less-than-expected 9.2% on the year in January, helping reassure markets that prices have peaked.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.62%, rebounding from an earlier decline, while Japan's Nikkei eased 0.08%.China's blue chips rose 1.3%, pulling away from a one-month trough, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 1.6%.Barclays upgraded their forecast of China's economic growth to 5.3% this year, from 4.8% previously, with Fitch also revising its forecast up to 5%. Both cited an accelerated recovery in consumer spending.Crude prices eased as oil infrastructure appeared to have escaped serious damage from the earthquake that devastated parts of Turkey and Syria, while U.S. inventories swelled and investors worried about central bank rate hikes.U.S. crude futures settled down 41 cents at $78.06 a barrel, and Brent fell 59 cents to settle at $84.50 a barrel.Gold prices rose for a fourth straight session as the dollar faltered, even as Fed officials indicated more rate hikes are warranted to rein in inflation. Gold is sensitive to high rates, which increase the cost of holding zero-yield bullion.U.S. gold futures settled down $12.20 at $1,878.50 an ounce.(Reporting by Herbert Lash, additional reporting by Huw Jones, Stella Qiu; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Jonathan Oatis)]"

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned +16.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7% change. During this period, the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, which Qualcomm falls in, has gained 8.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Qualcomm is expected to post earnings of $2.21 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -31.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.90 points to a change of -21% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.5%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.73 indicates a change of +18.5% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Qualcomm is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for QCOM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Qualcomm, the consensus sales estimate of $9.11 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -18.4%. The $38.05 billion and $44.28 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -13.9% and +16.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryQualcomm reported revenues of $9.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -11.7%. EPS of $2.37 for the same period compares with $3.23 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.56 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.12%. The EPS surprise was +0.85%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Qualcomm is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Qualcomm.

While the company predominately makes mobile processors and 5G wireless chipsets, it has been taking steps to diversify its business with a focus on the automotive chip market and Internet of Things technologies. This should help drive growth amid a slowing smartphone market and as the company’s relationship with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) appears to be coming to an end. Qualcomm reported fiscal-first-quarter results on Feb. 2. While earnings came in ahead of analyst estimates, revenue fell short, declining 12% year over year to $9.46 billion. This was mainly due to an 18% drop in handset revenue from a year ago. But revenue for the firm’s automotive segment jumped 58% to $456 million.Story continuesManagement warned that inventory levels could remain high through the first half of the year, and guidance for the current quarter was below what analysts were expecting. However, Qualcomm has been working to reduce operating costs in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty. And the stock held up following the revenue miss and disappointing forecast.In fact, shares are up 32.5% since bottoming out two months ago. QCOM remains down 24% over the past year, though, with shares trading at just 13.6 times forward earnings. That is better than 77% of the semiconductor industry.In late January, Barclays upped its rating on QCOM to “overweight” from “equal weight” and raised its target price to $150 from $120. That is 11% above where shares are currently trading. However, the stock could go much higher long term as the company’s growth in the auto and IoT sectors accelerates.Intel (INTC)Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) is the granddaddy of the chip market and the world’s second-largest chipmaker by revenue, following Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). Investors lost interest in Intel in 2022, with shares dropping 47%. However, it is off to a strong start in 2023, rising 15% despite a big earnings miss.On Jan. 26, Intel reported worse-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue and earnings thanks to weak demand for PC chips. Its guidance for the current quarter also disappointed the Street. Management forecast an adjusted net loss of 15 cents per share on around $11 billion in revenue. Analysts were expecting a profit of 24 cents per share on $13.9 billion in revenue. Not only that, but Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said the company could not provide a full-year forecast due to “the uncertainty in the current environment” with “persistent economic headwinds” expected through at least the first half of 2023.You’d think investors would have punished the stock for such dismal results. Yet, after a brief sell-off, INTC is now trading back above pre-earnings levels. This tells me that pessimism has been baked into the shares.Furthermore, Intel is set to benefit significantly from the CHIPS Act.  The firm has embarked on a $20 billion project to build two semiconductor manufacturing plants in Ohio. In addition to state incentives and tax breaks, Intel is likely to receive billions in funding from the federal government under the CHIPS Act.You would be wise not to count Intel out yet. Long-term investors are likely to see their patience rewarded. And a 5% dividend yield should make the wait much more tolerable.Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comLast but not least on today’s list of undervalued semiconductor stocks to buy is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a leader in graphic processing units. Shares have lost nearly 40% since topping out in November 2021. However, the stock is up 44% year to date and 95% since bottoming out in mid-October. This indicates investors see value in NVDA shares. Nvidia has yet to announce earnings this season, with the company expected to report on Feb. 22. Analysts are calling for a 21% drop in revenue and a 39% decline in earnings. It’s possible the company will disappoint — with its results, guidance or both — as many of its peers have done. However, unless the risk-on trade evaporates, it seems unlikely Nvidia will be punished more severely than other semiconductor stocks.What’s most exciting about Nvidia from a growth standpoint is its role in powering artificial intelligence technologies, including autonomous vehicles and robots. According to Markets Insider, the buzz surrounding language tool ChatGPT has caused investors to flock to NVDA.If you think ChatGPT and other AI applications are the way of the future, investing in NVDA Is a no-brainer.On the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayIt doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

EXPE, may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Expedia is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for EXPE in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.99 per share for EXPE, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for EXPE, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +7.34% heading into earnings season.Expedia Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseExpedia Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseExpedia Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Expedia Group, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that EXPE has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Expedia, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

207,15f74af4-d7f4-3a11-9994-b39978b80846,EXPE,2023-02-09,"Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights Alibaba, Expedia and MercadoLibre",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-alibaba-141702943.html,1675865822,STORY,"['9988.HK', 'EXPE', 'BABA', 'MELI', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – February 8, 2023 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Alibaba BABA, Expedia EXPE and MercadoLibre MELI.Industry: E-commerceLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2050719/3-picks-from-a-strengthening-ecommerce-industryThis year is likely to see a return to normalcy with ecommerce taking away bigger and bigger slices of the total retail pie. The trend started last year itself, as can be seen from the third-quarter (last-reported) data from the Commerce Department: ecommerce sales in the third quarter grew 10.8% over 3Q21 (up 3.0% sequentially), with total retail sales increasing 9.1% (up 0.7% sequentially). Ecommerce accounted for around 14.1% of total U.S. retail sales.As the back-to-stores trend recedes, convenience is returning as a major factor driving volumes in this industry and this is particularly true of Gen-Z, which is becoming a more relevant contributor to sales. Many of these buyers have grown up on the Internet and take a much higher level of digitization as normalcy. They are also likely to hang out on popular social media platforms, allowing themselves to be influenced by the latest trends there. This is driving an entirely new perspective on the ecommerce space, one that is likely to expand with more advanced technology such as AR/VR and the Metaverse.   Valuation, although down over the past year, remains expensive, reflecting the relatively stronger growth prospects. A large number of stocks in this extremely diverse industry are worth buying today, but we’ve picked three: Alibaba, Expedia and MercadoLibre.About the IndustryInternet - Commerce continues to evolve as the technologies driving it advance.On the one side are increasingly powerful and capable user devices. On the other are sophisticated, AI-enabled software platforms facilitating transactions that are thereby, more capable of delivering user satisfaction. Social commerce and chatbots are further facilitating things.Story continuesDifferentiation comes from better technology for improved showcasing, easier navigation and payment, speedier delivery and returns, brand building, comparison shopping, loyalty, etc. as well as more shipping options, which generally tip the scales in favor of larger players. Particularly because there is fierce price competition necessitating deep discounting, which keeps prices down.Current Trends Driving the Internet-Commerce IndustryMacro conditions should continue to improve for the industry, which has been mired for the most part in 2022 by a combination of factors, including a consumer trend back to stores, as well as generally tighter purse strings as people fretted about rising costs and the possibility of a recession that would see significant job losses. But things appear to be clearing up in 2023 with inflation coming down (however slowly), a recession looking less and less likely and people going back to the convenience of online shopping. To top it all, the jobs scenario looks as strong as ever despite the tech layoffs. For producers, supply chain issues have alleviated while the labor situation is still tight. Global uncertainties continue to affect foreign exchange effects for companies with international operations. The higher interest rate is another pressure on producers, and by extension consumers, which is another negative for the year. Therefore, the digital infrastructure that retailers have been building up in the last few years will disproportionately increase profitability this year. The importance of having a digital presence has never been greater, particularly considering the fact that the retail ecommerce market continues to expand into new product segments and geographies.Ecommerce will continue to gain at the expense of brick-and-mortar this year. The Commerce Department’s data for the last available quarter (3Q22) shows that ecommerce growth was already moving past overall retail sector growth in that quarter when the back-to-store trend was also operational. Therefore, this year is likely to be a relatively normal year, which means that ecommerce will continue to grow at the expense of physical stores. Shopify’s Michael Keenan agrees with this analysis. According to a recent statement of his, “Two years ago, only 17.8% of sales were made from online purchases. That number is expected to reach 20.8% in 2023, a 2-percentage point increase in e-commerce market share. Growth is expected to continue, reaching 23% by 2025, which translates to a 5.2 percentage point increase in just five years.”Ecommerce growing at the expense of physical stores doesn’t mean that a physical presence will be downgraded. In fact, with Gen Z entering the marketplace, the demand for convenience and options will remain paramount. In many cases, this will mean faster deliveries or pickups from some nearby convenient location. Since it is only proximity to a consumer that can facilitate quick delivery, both ecommerce pureplays and traditional retailers will continue to balance ecommerce sales with a physical presence. Therefore, a hybrid/omnichannel model will remain of utmost importance, allowing customized, quick and convenient delivery (BOPIS, curbside pickup) through apps. Customers generally downgrade stores that don’t provide these conveniences. Self-driven delivery vehicles and drones are also on the horizon to deal with logistics problems and make deliveries smoother and cheaper.A trend that Gen-Z is popularizing now is social commerce. Social commerce means the ability to discover, research, buy and checkout on a social media platform. Brands usually have store fronts on these platforms where influencers also discuss their products, thus driving traffic to them. The social element of shopping that ecommerce had taken out is thus returning through this route. Since social commerce is already popular in China, it isn’t surprising that the Chinese social media platform TikTok that’s also very popular with Gen Z is the number one place for social commerce. But others like Facebook and Instagram are also in the game. According to The Future of Commerce, “Global sales via social media platforms were estimated at 992 billion U.S. dollars in 2022, and forecasts suggest that social commerce sales will reach around 2.9 trillion U.S. dollars by 2026. Social commerce is critical for brands to reach their target audiences, and is expected to generate $30.73 billion in sales in 2023, accounting for 20% of global retail e-commerce.” Other trends online retailers are focused on include grocery sales and the buy-now-pay-later option.Also, data mining has never been easier. Because of the many details involved in satisfying a customer, data mining has grown in importance over the years, with the party controlling the customer’s data being best positioned to identify and service demand while also delivering the desired experience. Most of the big ecommerce players are also into payments processing, which gives them further insight into a customer’s tastes, preferences and buying habits. As machines read and process this data, they can createZacks Industry Rank Reflects Ongoing StrengthThe Zacks Internet - Commerce Industry is a rather large group within the broader Zacks Retail And Wholesale Sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #34, which places it in the top 14% of 250 Zacks industries.Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. So the group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates relatively strong near-term prospects.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is the result of its relative performance versus others. What we’re seeing in the aggregate estimate revisions is significantly weaker earnings than a year ago. However, expectations for both 2022 and 2023 (2022 results are not all in yet) are off just 3 cents since October, indicating that the return-to-store trend is stabilizing.As things stand now, the aggregate earnings estimate for 2022 is down 38.4% and for 2023 is down 44.9%. Profitability is improving, despite constantly rising SG&amp;A, possibly because some of the store traffic related to the reopening has started moving back online. Supply chain and labor issues are also easing. A recession is looking increasingly unlikely, as employment numbers show no sign of softening, even as prices continue to cool.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags On Shareholder ReturnsThe Zacks Electronic - Commerce Industry has lagged both the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale Sector as well as the S&amp;P 500 index though much of the past year although it has been doing notably better than both since December.Therefore, we see that the stocks in this industry have collectively lost 26.1% of their value over the past year, compared to the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale Sector, which lost 13.1% and the S&amp;P 500, which lost just 9.1%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the price-to-forward 12 months’ earnings (P/E) basis, the industry still looks grossly overvalued (34.34X) with respect to both the S&amp;P 500 (18.73X) and the broader retail sector (22.73X).On the basis of forward sales (P/S) for the year however, the industry trades at its annual low of 1.21X, which trails the sector’s 1.25X (close to its median level) as well as the S&amp;P 500’s 3.59X (also relatively close to its median value). Over the past year, the industry has traded as high as 1.87X, as low as 1.21X and at the median of 1.50X, as the chart below shows.3 Stocks Worth ConsideringWhile the industry’s valuation looks kind of prohibitive, there are quite a large number of stocks that are currently ripe for the picking. That’s because of the significant variety that exists in this industry in terms of lines of business, business model, location, and so forth. All of the following stocks carry a  Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy):Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.: Like Amazon in the U.S., Hangzhou PRC-based Alibaba Group Holding Limited is a leading provider of a whole range of products and services (retail, advertising, media and entertainment, cloud infrastructure), primarily through its Chinese and international ecommerce platforms. Other than online retail platforms like Taobao Marketplace, Tmall, Alimama, 1688.com, Alibaba.com, etc. it owns and operates a retail chain called Freshippo, an import e-commerce platform called Tmall Global, an online-offline integration service for grocery and FMCG brands called Taoxianda, the Cainiao Network logistic services platform, etc.It has a platform to tap every opportunity in the ecommerce space in China, including the Taobao Ad Network and Exchange, a real-time online bidding marketing exchange and media businesses. It also provides elastic computing, storage, network, security, database and big data, and IoT services.Chinese stocks are benefiting from the lifting of draconian measures by the government to fight COVID last year. Alibaba in particular has done better than many others because of the breadth of its offerings and innovation at every level that have helped it retain customers and add new ones. This focus, along with capacity expansion, operating efficiency and cost optimization should translate into disproportionately stronger business flow now that the market is open. Macro concerns and global uncertainties remain, but these concerns aren’t specific to Alibaba.In the last 30 days, analysts have raised Alibaba’s 2023 (ending March) estimates by 7 cents and 2024 estimates by 30 cents.The shares have lost just 7.4% over the past year, a testimony to investor confidence.Expedia Group, Inc.: Seattle-based Expedia is an online travel company operating through Retail, B2B and trivago segments. It serves leisure and corporate travelers. Expedia takes bookings for hotel and alternative accommodation, cruise ships, rental cars, air tickets and such other services. Through Expedia Partner Solutions, a B2B brand and Egencia, it provides corporate travel management services. It also provides advertising and media services.As was evident through most of last year, vaccination has emboldened people, encouraging them to start traveling again. This took Expedia’s revenues to pre-pandemic levels. Growth should remain strong this year, not only because the pandemic is pretty much behind us, but also because there is some pent-up travel demand out there. The strong jobs numbers and softening inflation are also positive for travel sales this year. Expedia also has effective loyalty programs and its app-users are at all-time highs. Its focus on improving user experience through better web and app experiences will ensure that the user base continues to expand.Analysts have raised their 2023 estimates by 40 cents in the last 30 days.The Zacks Rank #1 stock is down 36.6% year to date, so there is much room for expansion.MercadoLibre, Inc.: Buenos Aires, Argentina based MercadoLibre is one of the largest e-commerce platforms in Latin America. Other than its online marketplaces, the company offers payments, advertising and logistics services.The company is seeing very strong growth in its served markets, driven by overall user experience, which is a function of the selection, pricing, logistics services (speed and cost of deliveries), customer service and technology. Its steadfast investments in these areas in the face of the back-to-stores trend in the last couple of years is clearly bearing fruit. This has allowed share gains in Brazil and Chile, resilience in Mexico and strong growth in Argentina. The payments business also continues to grow strongly with continued expansion of the user base. The volume per device is the driving factor in MPOS with device sales being a slight drag.In the last 30 days, analysts have raised their 2023 estimates by 60 cents. They are extremely optimistic about the company’s growth prospects.The shares are up 13.7% in the past year.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Solid demand for the Oracle Dedicated Region Cloud@Customer is anticipated to drive the top line. Oracle expects total cloud growth, including Cerner, to grow from 43% to 47% in USD for the next quarter. Partnerships with Accenture and Microsoft are helping Oracle win new clientele.However, higher spending on product enhancements, especially toward the cloud platform, is likely to limit margin expansion.

210,82036984-ba6a-367a-8d99-81ae795da1ea,LMT,2023-02-09,The 7 Best Manufacturing Stocks to Buy for 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-manufacturing-stocks-buy-113040680.html,1675683040,STORY,"['LMT', 'AMLI', 'MLI', 'OLK', 'IEP', 'A', 'RUN']","[There are lots of reasons to find the best manufacturing stocks to buy in 2023. But the biggest in my opinion is that they are great alternatives to tech stocks that have been so badly beaten in recent weeks.Tech stocks are facing plenty of headwinds as the industry downsizes, correcting the over-hiring committed during and following the coronavirus pandemic. Tech stocks also still have plenty of concerns coming out of Washington, where lawmakers have long made Big Tech a favorite target.Manufacturing stocks may be a little more boring, but they also provide solid growth and stability. While some on this list may not be household names, that doesn’t matter to my Portfolio Grader tool. The Portfolio Grader evaluates stocks based on their earnings history, analyst sentiment, buying momentum, performance and other qualitative measurements. Then it ranks the stocks on an “A” through “F” scale.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are seven manufacturing stocks to buy that are getting good marks with the Portfolio Grader now.RUNSunrun$27.04LMTLockheed Martin$459.07IEPIcahn Enterprises$53.88MLIMueller Industries$70.24OLKOlink Holding$19.92AMLIAmerican Lithium$3.49AAgilent Technologies$153.64Sunrun (RUN)The Sunrun (RUN) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen in front of an American flag.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comSunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) is a renewable energy company that’s involved in battery storage and photovoltaic solar energy systems, which use solar radiation to produce electricity.Both of those spaces are appealing for investors now. Many countries are looking for cleaner energy options out of concern for global climate change.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the challenges European nations have since had in supplying power to its citizens are making it clear how important it is to have control of the energy supply.Those factors are expected to help push global renewable power capacity by 2,400 gigawatts from 2022 to 2027, according to Renewables 2022. If that doesn’t sound like a lot, then consider this – 2,400 gigawatts would power all of China.Story continuesSunrun stock, which is up 13% over the last six months, is already starting to show some serious potential. Earnings for the third quarter included revenue of $631.91 million versus analysts’ expectations for $568.63 million. Earnings per share was 96 cents – an amazing accomplishment considering the Street was expecting a loss of 7 cents per share EPS.RUN stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Lockheed Martin (LMT)A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is one of the best large-cap names in the market today. As an aerospace and defense conglomerate, Lockheed manufactures a variety of weapons and defense systems, including missiles used by Patriot missile-defense systems, Black Hawk helicopters and F-16, F-22 and F-35 fighters.The company will continue to profit from the $1.7 trillion omnibus package signed into law that funds the government through much of 2023. It included $858 billion for the Pentagon and related programs.Lockheed Martin posted revenue of $18.99 billion in the fourth quarter, which topped analysts’ expectations for $18.26 billion. Earnings per share came in at $7.79, better than the $7.39 predicted by analysts. It also pays a quarterly dividend of $3 per share, giving it a 2.6% yield.LMT stock, which is up 19% over the last year, has “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Icahn Enterprises (IEP)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Icahn Enterprises (IEP).Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comIcahn Enterprises (NASDAQ:IEP) is a conglomerate owned by famous investor Carl Icahn. It operates in investments, energy, automotive, food packaging, real estate, home fashion and the pharmaceutical sectors.As an activist investor, Icahn looks for struggling companies and purchases either stock or debt in order to gain a foothold. It then engages in “activist strategies” that can include confronting the board, proxy fights, tender offers or even taking control of companies.In short, investing in Icahn is a good way of investing in a lot of companies that have potential, but aren’t being managed well – at least according to Icahn portfolio managers.While Icahn stock goes through dips and valleys, the stock price is roughly the same as it was six months ago. But IEP also pays a huge 14.9% dividend yield, and that also helps push it to a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Mueller Industries (MLI)Copper ingots in a stack on a white background. Copper stocks.Source: ppart / ShutterstockAs a producer of copper, copper alloy, brass, aluminum and plastic coils, conduit and other products, Mueller Industries (NYSE:MLI) has a firm foothold in the industrial space.It has a broad footprint, selling products in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.What’s good about Mueller is that nations like the U.S. are creating as many manufacturing jobs as possible to not only keep unemployment down but to help drive the economy’s recovery. Manufacturing doesn’t happen without the raw products that Mueller creates.MLI stock is up 27% in the last year and has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Olink Holding (OLK)Phot of test tubes and droplet with purple and reddish-orange sunset visual effectSource: shutterstock.com/Romix ImageSwedish proteomics company Olink Holding (NASDAQ:OLK) is involved in biotech research. The stock is down 21% in the last month, primarily because it held a public offering for 5.8 million American Depository Shares of Olink stock at $20 per share. Following the price drop, shares are holding right around that level now.But when you back up and look at the bigger picture, you see that this is a company whose stock has been on a consistent rise. And even after slipping back to $20, it’s still up 13% from a year ago.Olink is marketing a technology platform that it says will allow researchers to perform large-scale analysis of thousands of proteins at the same time, all from less than a drop of blood.It’s potentially a helpful technology if the company can come through with its promises. But for now, OLK stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.American Lithium (AMLI)a pile of lithiumSource: Bjoern Wylezich/ShutterStock.comThere are a few topics that can make investors take notice as quickly as lithium. It’s a critical component for making electric vehicles and other battery products, and prices continue to be high. American Lithium (NASDAQ:AMLI) has assets in Nevada and also in Peru (the latter being the sixth-largest lithium deposit in the world).American Lithium has also recently being trading for the first time on the Nasdaq exchange, rather than on over-the-counter markets. That change is a good one for investors, as being on a major exchange will require American Lithium to provide more information through its regular reporting to regulators.AMLI stock is up 20% over the last year and has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Agilent Technologies (A)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockAgilent Technologies (NYSE:A) works in the life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets space.

(NYSE:BAX), a global medtech leader, today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended Dec. 31, 2022, and provided its financial guidance for full-year and first-quarter 2023.""Baxter employees worldwide are embracing the power of our lifesaving Mission to navigate a complex healthcare landscape and respond to sustained demand for our essential products,"" said José (Joe) E. Almeida, chairman, president and chief executive officer. ""Ongoing macroeconomic challenges and supply chain headwinds continue to weigh on business performance, underscoring the need for decisive action to create value for the patients, shareholders and other stakeholder communities that rely on us. I am confident that the plans we announced last month to spin off a new kidney care company and implement a new operating model for our remaining businesses will enhance the potential for growth and innovation across both entities.""Fourth-Quarter Financial ResultsBaxter’s worldwide sales in the fourth quarter totaled $3.9 billion, an increase of 11% on a reported basis, 17% on a constant currency basis and 2% on an operational basis. Operational sales in the fourth quarter exclude the impacts of foreign exchange and the December 2021 acquisition of Hillrom.Story continuesSales in the U.S. totaled $1.9 billion, increasing 25% on a reported basis and declining 1% on an operational basis. International sales of $2 billion were flat on a reported basis, and increased 10% on a constant currency basis and 3% operationally.Among Baxter’s product categories, Advanced Surgery and Clinical Nutrition delivered mid-to-high single-digit growth at constant currency rates, reflecting solid demand across both product categories. Renal Care delivered low single-digit growth at constant rates, driven by mid-single-digit growth of peritoneal dialysis therapies offset by low single-digit declines in in-center hemodialysis therapies. Double-digit growth at constant rates in BioPharma Solutions (BPS) reflected strong demand for non-COVID-related services, which more than offset lower COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing revenues. Growth in the quarter was partially offset by low single-digit declines in Pharmaceuticals and Medication Delivery, both at constant rates. Pharmaceuticals performance in the quarter reflects the continued impact of generic competition in the U.S., partially offset by low single-digit constant currency growth internationally. Fourth-quarter Medication Delivery performance was affected by a difficult comparison to the prior year, which benefited from higher levels of pump placements. As expected, Acute Therapies also declined low single digits at constant rates, resulting from a challenging year-over-year comparison following increased sales in the same period of 2021 driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.Legacy Hillrom's Front Line Care, Patient Support Systems and Global Surgical Solutions businesses contributed $734 million to fourth-quarter sales on a reported basis. On a pro forma basis and after adjusting for foreign exchange, fourth-quarter legacy Hillrom sales grew mid-single digits as compared to the prior-year period, reflecting demand for the Physical Assessment and Cardiology portfolios.Please see the attached schedules accompanying this press release for additional details on sales performance in the quarter, including breakouts by Baxter’s product categories and segments.For the fourth quarter, net income attributable to Baxter was $181 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, on a U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) basis. These results include special items totaling $263 million after-tax, which were primarily related to intangible amortization, and goodwill and intangible asset impairments. On an adjusted basis, net income attributable to Baxter totaled $444 million in the fourth quarter, or $0.88 per diluted share, which represented a decline of 15% compared to the prior-year period due to increased supply chain related costs resulting primarily from inflationary pressures, the negative impact of foreign exchange and higher interest expense.Full-Year Financial ResultsBaxter’s 2022 worldwide sales totaled $15.1 billion, an increase of 18% on a reported basis, 23% on a constant currency basis and 2% on an operational basis. Operational sales for the full year exclude the impacts of foreign exchange and the December 2021 acquisition of Hillrom.Sales in the U.S. totaled $7.2 billion, growing 39% on a reported basis and 1% on an operational basis. International sales of $7.9 billion grew 4% on a reported basis, 12% at constant currency rates and 3% operationally.Legacy Hillrom's Front Line Care, Patient Support Systems and Global Surgical Solutions businesses contributed $2.9 billion to full-year sales on a reported basis. On a pro forma basis and after adjusting for foreign exchange, full-year legacy Hillrom sales were flat as compared to the prior-year period, primarily reflecting the impact of supply constraints for electromechanical components.The accompanying schedules include additional details on sales performance by product categories and segments.For full-year 2022, net income (loss) attributable to Baxter totaled ($2.4 billion), or ($4.83) per diluted share on a U.S. GAAP basis. These results include special items totaling $4.2 billion after-tax, led by the $3.1 billion goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges announced in October 2022, which primarily reflected rising interest rates and broad declines in equity valuations, as well as intangible amortization and integration expenses, among other items. On an adjusted basis, 2022 net income attributable to Baxter totaled $1.8 billion, or $3.50 per diluted share, a decline of 3% compared to the prior-year period.For the full year, Baxter generated $1.2 billion in operating cash flow from continuing operations and $532 million in free cash flow (operating cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures of $679 million).""Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes opportunities to advance our performance as a business and drive meaningful impact for our stakeholders,"" said Jay Saccaro, executive vice president and chief financial officer. ""In 2022, Baxter returned approximately $600 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As we execute on our strategic actions outlined at the beginning of 2023, we are first and foremost committed to improving our cash flow generation. Our priorities for cash deployment are focused on accelerating debt repayment, maintaining our dividend and resuming share repurchases over time, while we continue to assess additional inorganic growth opportunities for our new streamlined operations.""New Operating Model to Simplify Baxter’s OperationsAs announced in the company’s Jan. 6, 2023, press release, Baxter is working to finalize a new operating model that it will begin to implement in parallel with its planning for the proposed spinoff of the Renal Care and Acute Therapies businesses.In the coming months, Baxter is preparing to commence a series of changes across its organization that are designed to meaningfully simplify its operating model and manufacturing footprint, drive strategic clarity, improve operational efficiencies, and accelerate future growth. The company plans to consolidate its operations into four vertically integrated global business units (GBUs) focused on broad therapeutic areas.Under the new model, Baxter’s four GBUs will become the company’s functional and financial reporting segments, which will be further updated after the completion of the proposed spinoff of the Renal Care and Acute Therapies businesses:Medical Products and Therapies: comprised of the current Medication Delivery, Advanced Surgery and Clinical Nutrition businesses.Healthcare Systems and Technologies (legacy Hillrom): comprised of the current Patient Support Systems, Global Surgical Solutions and Front Line Care businesses.Pharmaceuticals: comprised of the company’s injectable and premix drug portfolios, and its BioPharma Solutions (BPS) business, pending exploration of strategic alternatives, which could include a sale, for BPS.Kidney Care: comprised of the company’s current Renal Care and Acute Therapies businesses; these businesses are intended to be spun off into an independent, publicly traded company, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, in the next 12 to 18 months.Post completion of the Kidney Care Company spinoff, each of the three Baxter GBUs will be led by a president reporting directly to CEO Joe Almeida and will have a fully integrated organization responsible for its P&amp;L, upstream and downstream commercial operations, research and development (R&amp;D), and aligned manufacturing sites. From a manufacturing perspective, Baxter plans to become a more nimble organization, with manufacturing sites streamlined and mapped directly to each GBU, an optimized distribution network, and a more resilient supply chain. These changes are designed to position Baxter’s GBUs to respond to market dynamics faster and more effectively, while also advancing innovation for patients through R&amp;D prioritization.The new operating model design process is expected to be completed by early second quarter, with an updated reporting framework expected to be implemented during the second half of 2023.In response to the significant macroeconomic challenges Baxter has experienced over the last two years, the company is in the process of executing a cost reduction program in parallel with its operating model redesign that is expected to be finalized later this quarter. This initiative and additional actions the company has undertaken to enhance performance are expected to deliver more than $300 million in total savings during 2023. These actions are currently expected to result in a global workforce reduction of less than 5%.Almeida said, ""While the opportunities ahead are clear, the journey will involve some difficult decisions. We will take these necessary steps with the utmost care and sensitivity, in full knowledge that the passion and commitment of our Baxter team drives our success. We are poised to emerge transformed for a new era, better positioned to compete in the dynamic healthcare marketplace and create value for our stakeholders.""Corporate ResponsibilityBaxter is committed to responsible corporate citizenship in service of the patients, employees and diverse communities the company serves globally as a healthcare leader. Throughout 2022, Baxter continued to advance its 2030 Corporate Responsibility Commitment, comprising 10 goals for prioritized action across three pillars: Empower Our Patients, Protect Our Planet, and Champion Our People and Communities. This Commitment supports a number of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and 2030 Agenda with a global blueprint for achieving a more sustainable future.Key to this focus, Baxter and its philanthropic arm, the Baxter International Foundation, have maintained a sustained emphasis on the company’s expansive ACT (Activating Change Today) initiative, a multidisciplinary effort to advance racial justice by driving meaningful, sustainable change within Baxter and the communities and markets the company serves. Among 2022 ACT milestones, the company donated more than $7 million to a range of organizations in order to advance new racial justice programming, fund student scholarships at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and help address the disproportionate challenges affecting Black Americans related to kidney health.Baxter continues to be recognized for its leadership in corporate responsibility and workplace excellence. In 2022, the company:Was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices – DJSI World and DJSI North America; Baxter has appeared each year since the indices launched, in 1999 and 2005, respectively.Scored 100% on the 2022 Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, designating Baxter as a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality; this marked the eighth consecutive year the company has received a perfect score.Was cited among top scoring companies on Disability:IN’s 2022 Disability Equality Index, designating Baxter as a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion.Was named to 3BL Media’s list of 100 Best Corporate Citizens for 2022.Was recognized by Seramount on its 2022 lists of the 100 Best Companies, Best Companies for Dads, and Best Companies for Multicultural Women; and named a leading organization on the 2022 Seramount Inclusion Index.2023 Financial OutlookFor full-year 2023: Baxter expects sales growth of 1% to 2% on a reported basis and flat to 1% on a constant currency basis. The company expects U.S. GAAP earnings of $1.43 to $1.63 per diluted share and adjusted earnings, before special items, of $2.75 to $2.95 per diluted share. Guidance for 2023 reflects a challenging first half of the year due to increased cost of sales resulting from elevated costs of inventory produced in the second half of 2022, reflecting the significant inflationary pressures the company experienced, that will impact earnings when the related inventory is sold in 2023. Baxter expects the impact from these inflationary pressures on its earnings to begin to ease in the second half of the year. The benefits from the savings programs, which are in the process of being finalized, are expected to ramp over the course of the year, with the majority of the benefit being realized in the second half of the year. Finally, adjusted earnings guidance for 2023 also reflects incremental employee compensation costs, higher interest expense and an increased tax rate assumption as compared to full year 2022.For first-quarter 2023: The company expects sales to decline approximately 3% on a reported basis and 1% on a constant currency basis. The company expects U.S. GAAP earnings of $0.14 to $0.18 per diluted share and adjusted earnings, before special items, of $0.46 to $0.50 per diluted share.A webcast of Baxter’s fourth-quarter 2022 conference call for investors can be accessed live from a link in the Investor Relations section of the company’s website at www.baxter.com beginning at 7:30 a.m. CST on Feb. 9, 2023.

These non-GAAP financial measures provide information on the percentage change in net sales growth as if foreign currency exchange rates had remained constant between the prior and current periods.

Net sales growth rates are also presented on an operational basis. For the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2022, operational sales growth excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the December 13, 2021 acquisition of Hillrom. This measure provides information on the change in net sales growth rates as if foreign exchange rates had remained constant and excluding the impact of the company’s recent acquisition of Hillrom. For the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2022, pro forma sales growth on a constant currency basis, a non-GAAP financial measure, has also been provided for Hillrom to provide supplemental information about its constant currency sales growth as if it had been owned by Baxter for the entire prior-year periods.Other non-GAAP financial measures included in this release and the accompanying tables (including within the tables that provide the company’s detailed reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures) are: adjusted gross margin, adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses, adjusted research and development expenses, adjusted other operating expense (income), net, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted income (loss) before income taxes, adjusted income tax expense (benefit), adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Baxter stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share.

For the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, special items for one or more periods included intangible asset amortization, business optimization charges, acquisition and integration costs, divestiture-related costs, expenses related to European medical devices regulation, product-related items, investigation and related costs, a litigation matter, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, a loss on a product divestiture arrangement, a loss on a subsidiary liquidation, a reclassification of a cumulative translation loss to earnings, a loss on a debt extinguishment, and certain tax matters. These items are excluded because they are highly variable or unusual and of a size that may substantially impact the company’s reported operations for a period. Additionally, intangible asset amortization is excluded as a special item to facilitate an evaluation of current and past operating performance and is consistent with how management and the company’s Board of Directors assess performance.This release and the accompanying tables also include free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure that Baxter defines as operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is used by management and the company’s Board of Directors to evaluate the cash generated from Baxter’s operating activities each period after deducting its capital spending.This release also includes forecasts of certain of the aforementioned non-GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis as part of the company’s financial outlook for upcoming periods.Non-GAAP financial measures may enhance an understanding of the company’s operations and may facilitate an analysis of those operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the company’s reconciliations to corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures (which are included in the tables accompanying this release), may enhance an investor’s overall understanding of the company’s past financial performance and prospects for the future. Accordingly, management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in financial planning, to monitor business unit performance, and, in some cases, for purposes of determining incentive compensation. This information should be considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Forward-Looking StatementsThis release includes forward-looking statements concerning the company’s financial results (including the outlook for first-quarter and full-year 2023) and business development and regulatory activities (including anticipated cost savings). These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions about many important factors, including the following, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: the company’s ability to execute and complete strategic initiatives, asset dispositions and other transactions, including the proposed spinoff of the company’s Renal Care and Acute Therapies product categories; the company’s plans to simplify the company’s operating model and manufacturing footprint and the company’s review of strategic alternatives for the company’s BioPharma Solutions product category, the timing for such transactions, the ability to satisfy any applicable conditions and the expected proceeds, consideration and benefits; failure to accurately forecast or achieve the company’s short- and long-term financial improvement performance and goals (including with respect to the company’s recently announced strategic actions); the company’s ability to execute on its capital allocation plans, including the company’s debt repayment plans, the timing and amount of any dividends, share repurchases and acquisition proceeds and the capital structure of the public company that the company expects to form as a result of the proposed spinoff (and the resulting capital structure for the remaining company); the impact of global economic conditions (including, among other things, inflation levels, interest rates, the potential for a recession, the ongoing war in Ukraine, the related economic sanctions being imposed globally in response to the conflict and potential trade wars) and continuing public health crises, pandemics and epidemics, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or the anticipation of any of the foregoing, on the company’s operations and on the company’s employees, customers and suppliers, including foreign governments in countries in which the company operates; downgrades to the company’s credit ratings or ratings outlooks, and the related impact on the company’s funding costs and liquidity; demand for and market acceptance risks for and competitive pressures related to new and existing products (including challenges with the company’s ability to accurately predict changing consumer preferences, which has led to and may continue to lead to increased inventory levels, and needs and advances in technology and the resulting impact on customer inventory levels and the impact of reduced hospital admission rates and elective surgery volumes), and the impact of those products on quality and patient safety concerns; the continuity, availability and pricing of acceptable raw materials and component parts (and the company’s ability to pass some or all of these costs to the company’s customers through recent price increases or otherwise), and the related continuity of the company’s manufacturing and distribution and those of the company’s suppliers; inability to create additional production capacity in a timely manner or the occurrence of other manufacturing, sterilization or supply difficulties (including as a result of natural disaster, public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, regulatory actions or otherwise); product development risks, including satisfactory clinical performance and obtaining required regulatory approvals (including as a result of evolving regulatory requirements), the ability to manufacture at appropriate scale, and the general unpredictability associated with the product development cycle; the company’s ability to finance and develop new products or enhancements on commercially acceptable terms or at all; loss of key employees, the occurrence of labor disruptions or the inability to identify and recruit new employees; product quality or patient safety issues leading to product recalls, withdrawals, launch delays, warning letters, import bans, sanctions, seizures, litigation, or declining sales, including the focus on evaluating product portfolios for the potential presence or formation of nitrosamines; breaches or failures of the company’s information technology systems or products, including by cyber-attack, data leakage, unauthorized access or theft (as a result of remote working arrangements or otherwise); future actions of (or failures to act or delays in acting by) FDA, the European Medicines Agency or any other regulatory body or government authority (including the SEC, Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services or the Attorney General of any State) that could delay, limit or suspend product development, manufacturing, sale or reimbursement or result in seizures, recalls, injunctions, monetary sanctions or criminal or civil liabilities, including the continued delay in lifting the warning letter at the company’s Ahmedabad facility; failures with respect to the company’s quality, compliance or ethics programs; future actions of third parties, including third-party payers and the company’s customers and distributors (including group purchasing organizations and integrated delivery networks), the impact of healthcare reform and its implementation, suspension, repeal, replacement, amendment, modification and other similar actions undertaken by the United States or foreign governments; the outcome of pending or future litigation, including the opioid, ethylene oxide and Linet antitrust litigation or other claims; the impact of competitive products and pricing, including generic competition, drug reimportation and disruptive technologies; global regulatory, trade and tax policies (including with respect to climate change and other sustainability matters); the ability to protect or enforce the company’s owned or in-licensed patent or other proprietary rights (including trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how) or patents of third parties preventing or restricting the company’s manufacture, sale or use of affected products or technology; the impact of any goodwill or other intangible asset impairments on the company’s operating results; fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates; any changes in law concerning the taxation of income (whether with respect to current or future tax reform); actions by tax authorities in connection with ongoing tax audits; and other risks identified in Baxter’s most recent filings on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and other SEC filings, all of which are available on Baxter’s website.

Both earnings and revenue beat ratios of 81.3% and 62.5%, respectively, also seem impressive. Combining the actual results with the estimates for the still-to-report companies, total earnings for the sector are expected to decline 9% on revenue growth of 4.3% (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).Many industry bigwigs reported solid results, with some beating on earnings or revenues or both. However, solid earnings failed to fully impress pharma ETFs over the past month. VanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF PPH, iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF IHE, Invesco Dynamic Pharmaceuticals ETF PJP, SPDR S&amp;P Pharmaceuticals ETF XPH and First Trust Nasdaq Pharmaceuticals ETF FTXH are modestly up to down in a month.Let’s delve deeper into the earnings of some of the bigwigs:Earnings in FocusJohnson and JohnsonJohnson &amp; Johnson JNJ continued its long streak of earnings beat while missed the revenue estimate. Earnings per share came in at $2.35, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.22 and improving 10% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues declined 4.4% year over year to $23.7 billion and fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.72 billion. For 2023, the world's biggest healthcare products’ maker expects revenues in the range of $96.9 billion to $97.9 billion and earnings per share of $10.45 to $10.65 (read: ETFs in Focus on JNJ's Mixed Q4 Earnings Results).Pfizer Pfizer PFE topped on both earnings and revenues. Earnings per share of $1.14 were well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.01. Revenues of $24.3 billion edged past the consensus mark of $24.20 billion. On a year-over-year basis, earnings increased 45% and revenues rose 2%, respectively. The U.S. drug giant issued weaker guidance for 2023. Revenues are expected in the range of $67-$71.0 billion, indicating a decline of 29-33% from the 2022 level.Merck Merck MRK also reported better-than-expected results. Earnings per share of $1.62 outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56 but declined 10% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues rose 2% year over year to $13.83 billion and came in above the consensus mark of $13.74 billion. For 2023, Merck issued a fresh earnings and sales outlook for 2023. It expects revenues in the range of $57.2-$58.7 billion and earnings per share in the range of $6.80-$6.95.Bristol-Myers Bristol-Myers BMY reported earnings per share of $1.82, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.71 and improving from the year-ago earnings of $1.84. Revenues declined 5% year over year to $11.41 billion and edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.14 billion. Bristol-Myers expects adjusted earnings per share of $7.95-$8.25 for 2023.Eli Lilly Eli Lilly LLY came up with robust results. Earnings of $2.09 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.83 but were 4% lower than year-ago earnings. Revenues declined 9% year over year to $7.30 billion and missed the estimate of $7.32 billion. Eli Lilly reiterated its revenue guidance in the range of $30.3-$30.8 billion in 2023 and lifted the earnings per share guidance to a record $8.35-$855 from $8.10-$8.30.Story continuesETF AngleVanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF (PPH)VanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF follows the MVIS US Listed Pharmaceutical 25 Index and holds 25 stocks in its basket.

213,c1c72d06-a0c2-3b6c-a96f-b48f41fec2b2,JNJ,2023-02-09,ARWR: Catalyst-Rich 2023…,Zacks Small Cap Research,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/arwr-catalyst-rich-2023-103400004.html,1675852440,STORY,"['ARWR', 'JNJ']","[By David Bautz, PhDNASDAQ:ARWRREAD THE FULL ARWR RESEARCH REPORTBusiness UpdateMultiple Catalysts Ahead in 2023Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:ARWR) is developing medicines that cause gene silencing using RNA interference (RNAi), a specific means of inhibiting the expression of genes and stopping the production of a specific protein. The company has a deep and diverse pipeline that includes 12 drug candidates in clinical trials (six that are wholly owned and six that are partnered) with that number anticipated to increase to 15 or 16 by the end of 2023. We are anticipating a number of catalysts this year that includes data readouts and trial initiations:o In the first quarter of 2023 we anticipate Phase 1 data for JNJ-0795, which is being developed by Janssen for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The collaboration with Janssen for JNJ-0795 was announced in November 2021 and stems from a research collaboration and option agreement entered into with Janssen in October 2018. JNJ-0795 targets phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3). A polymorphism in PNPLA3 that results in a change from isoleucine (I) to methionine (M) at position 148 of the protein is strongly associated with increased hepatic fat levels and with hepatic inflammation, two hallmarks of NASH and its precursor non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (Romeo et al., 2008).o In the second quarter of 2023 we anticipate early Phase 1/2 data from normal healthy volunteers (NHVs) for two of the company’s pulmonary programs, ARO-RAGE and ARO-MUC5AC. ARO-RAGE targets the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE). Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human gene for RAGE are associated with an increased incidence of asthma. ARO-MUC5AC targets the expression of MUC5AC, which is a mucin protein that is upregulated in the airway of asthmatic patients (Bonser et al., 2017). ARO-RAGE is being studied in the ARORAGE-1001 trial that will enroll up to 64 NHVs and up to 16 patients with mild-to-moderate asthma (NCT05276570). ARO-MUC5AC is being studied in the AROMUC5AC-1001 trial that will enroll up to 42 NHVs and up to 16 patients with moderate-to-severe asthma (NCT05292950).Story continueso In the second quarter of 2023 we anticipate early data from the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ARO-C3, which targets complement component 3 (C3). The complement pathway is a part of the innate immune system and C3 activation is required for the classical complement pathway, the alternative complement pathway, and the lectin pathway. The Phase 1/2 trial is investigating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics in up to 24 healthy volunteers (Part 1) and up to 24 adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and up to 14 patients with complement-mediated renal disease (Part 2). We anticipate data from Part 1 of the study in the second quarter of 2023 and the company will likely be selecting doses for Part 2 of the study this month in the hopes of opening patient cohort enrollment in the coming months.o In the second quarter of 2023 we anticipate the initiation of the ARO-DUX4 Phase 1/2 clinical trial. ARO-DUX4 is the company’s first muscle targeted program and is being developed for the treatment of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). FSHD is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration most notably in the face, shoulders, and upper arms, however it usually causes weakness in multiple muscle groups all over the body. The disease is caused by the inappropriate expression of the transcription factor double homeobox protein 4 gene (DUX4) (Gabriëls et al., 1999). Arrowhead previously presented preclinical data on the ability of the TRiM platform to be used in muscle and in a mouse model of FSHD with a tamoxifen-inducible human DUX4 gene, ARO-DUX4 prevented the tamoxifen-induced increase in DUX4, prevented DUX-4 induced body weight loss, prevented and reversed muscle fibrosis, and prevented rotarod performance loss.o In mid-2023, we anticipate data from the ARCHES-2 and GATEWAY trials of ARO-ANG3, which targets angiopoietin like protein 3 (ANGPTL3). ANGPTL3 loss-of-function mutations lead to low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides (TG) (Musunuru et al., 2010), with one study showing an ANGPTL3 loss of function associated with a 34% reduction in odds of coronary artery disease (CAD) (Stitziel et al., 2017).▪ ARCHES-2: This is a Phase 2b, double blind, placebo controlled trial in adults with mixed dyslipidemia, which is defined as having TG between 150 and 500 mg/dL and non-HDL cholesterol &gt; 100 mg/dL or LDL cholesterol &gt;70 mg/dL. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ARO-ANG3 and to select a dosing regimen for later stage trials in this patient population. Three dose levels of ARO-ANG3 (50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg) are being tested. Patients will receive a subcutaneous injection on day 1 and week 12. Following the 36-week end-of-study visit, patients will be eligible to continue in an open label extension period. Total planned enrollment of 204 patients is complete. Data presented at AHA showed that patients treated with 50, 100, or 200 mg of ARO-ANG3 had reductions in triglycerides of up to 59% and LDL-C up to 32% at Week 16. In addition, ARO-ANG3 was associated with median relative reduction in liver fat at Week 24 of 28% for the 100 and 200 mg dose, with no liver specific adverse events reported to date. ARO-ANG3 has been well tolerated with TEAEs) reflecting the underlying comorbidities of the study population.▪ GATEWAY: This is a Phase 2, open-label trial in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). Sixteen patients were randomized 1:1 to receive two doses of 200 or 300 mg ARO-ANG3 on Day 1 and Day 84 and they are being evaluated over a 36-week period. The study is fully enrolled and data should be available in mid-2023.o In the second half of 2023, we anticipate data from the SHASTA-2 and MUIR trials of ARO-APOC3, which is targeted to apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3), a component of VLDL and an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase. In support of targeting APOC3, an APOC3 loss-of-function mutation results in lower TG levels (Jørgensen et al., 2014). Arrowhead is also conducting the Phase 3 PALISADE trial of ARO-APOC3 in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). We anticipate enrollment completing for that trial in the second quarter of 2023 and for topline data to be reported in the second quarter of 2024.▪ SHASTA-2: This is a Phase 2b, double blind, placebo controlled trial in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG; TG &gt; 500 mg/dL). The primary endpoint of the trial is the safety and efficacy of ARO-APOC3 and to select a dosing regimen for later-stage patients in this population. The trial is fully enrolled with 216 subjects and data from 177 subjects that had entered the study at the time of data cutoff was recently presented at the 2022 American Heart Association Scientific Sessions (Ballantyne et al., 2022). Following two doses of ARO-APOC3, data showed patients treated with 10, 25, or 50 mg ARO-APOC3 had decreases in TGs up to 86%, non-HDL-C up to 45%, and increased HDL-C up to 99% through the week 16 timepoint. Safety data was encouraging as ARO-APOC3 was well tolerated with the treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reflecting the underlying comorbidities of the study population.▪ MUIR: This is a Phase 2b, double blind, placebo controlled trial in adults with mixed dyslipidemia, which is defined the same as in the ARCHES-2 trial. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ARO-APOC3 and to select a dosing regimen for later stage trials in this patient population. The total planned enrollment of 320 patients has been reached. Data presented by the company showed patients treated with 10, 25, of 50 mg ARO-APOC3 had decreases of TGs up to 65%, non-HDL-C up to 28%, LDL-C of up to 20%, and increased HDL-C up to 50% through the week 16 timepoint.o In the fourth quarter of 2023, we anticipate early data from the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ARO-MMP7, which targets matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7), a secreted endopeptidase that is highly overexpressed in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (Bauer et al., 2017). MMP7 is also useful as a biomarker due to its increased expression being correlated with disease progression. In addition, MMP7 knockout mice are protected from pulmonary fibrosis induced by intratracheal bleomycin (Zuo et al., 2002). Unfortunately, MMP7 is a difficult target for drug development as there is substantial domain homology with other MMPs, thus making gene silencing a potentially useful mechanism for downregulating MMP7 expression. The Phase 1/2 clinical trial is a single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ARO-MMP7 in up to 56 healthy volunteers and in up to 21 patients with IPF.Financial UpdateOn February 6, 2023, Arrowhead announced financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 that ended December 31, 2022. The company reported revenue of approximately $62.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 compared to approximately $27.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. This revenue included the recognition of $16.3 million associated with the Takeda License Agreement, a $15 million milestone payment from Horizon due to the first patient being enrolled in the Phase 1 trial of HZN-457, and a $25 million milestone payment from Amgen following enrollment of the first patient in the Phase 3 trial of olpasiran.R&amp;D expenses for the quarter ending December 31, 2022 were approximately $83.7 million compared to $65.8 million for the quarter ending December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to increased salaries, facilities-related expenses, the progression of pipeline candidates into and through clinical trials, R&amp;D discovery expenses, and non-cash stock-based compensation. G&amp;A expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 were $21.0 million compared to $25.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower non-cash, stock-based compensation.Arrowhead exited the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 with approximately $617.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. As of February 1, 2023, Arrowhead had approximately 108.3 million shares outstanding and, when factoring in stock options and restricted stock units, a fully diluted share count of approximately 114.9 million.ConclusionArrowhead has a large number of important catalysts ahead in 2023. The most important near-term catalyst will be the early data from the ARO-RAGE and ARO-MUC5AC trials. The company has indicated that while there are currently three pulmonary programs in the clinic, the goal will be to eventually have eight or nine pulmonary programs. However, this is contingent upon being able to show that reduced expression of a target gene can be achieved in the proper cell type in a well-tolerated fashion in the lungs. If the early data from the ARO-RAGE and ARO-MUC5AC programs are encouraging, as judged by a favorable tolerability profile and ability to reduce gene expression, it would serve as a significant de-risking event for the entire pulmonary franchise.There were news reports recently about the fact that Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) will be de-prioritizing its hepatitis B franchise, and at this point we are unsure of what that means for JNJ-3989, which JNJ licensed in 2018 as part of a wide-ranging collaboration. We do know that this does not impact JNJ-0795. However, we will have to await word on the fate of JNJ-3989, which may ultimately be returned to Arrowhead. Given the uncertainty surrounding that program we have removed it from our model, which has lowered our valuation to $80 per share.SUBSCRIBE TO ZACKS SMALL CAP RESEARCH to receive our articles and reports emailed directly to you each morning.

The African Descent Network (ADN) at Medtronic is hosting global and local programming around the theme of ""Still WE Rise,"" inspiring the community and allies to know and feel that we are succeeding and growing despite all the challenges we're facing today.NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 8, 2023 / Ashanti Terry remembers exactly where he was when he realized he wanted to get into computer programming to help people - getting his student ID photo taken at Albany State University.In that moment, just starting out at the Historically Black College and University (HBCU), he had no idea that he was about to be introduced to healthcare technology through the Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF).Through the TMCF internship program, Medtronic hires HBCU students studying science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) into summer internships, provides development opportunities, and ultimately aims to hire them full-time - creating an early-career pipeline of diverse talent.Terry is one of 64 TMCF interns Medtronic has hired since the partnership's inception in 2020.And in 2022, we began a similar partnership with the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) for SHPE interns at Medtronic and SHPE scholarships through the Medtronic Foundation.‘More voices like me'""I saw the Eric Garner video and it hurt me,"" Terry said, referring to a Black man who died while in police custody in 2014. ""I just wanted to make something that will help change the world, that would help people - whatever direction that took.""For now, that is as a software engineer in the Pelvic Health business at Medtronic.Building teams with diverse perspectives and backgrounds is crucial for the innovation required to bring life-saving technologies to more patients around the world. But the STEM field continues to fall short in representation of women, Black, and Hispanic professionals.Story continues""I have a different perspective as an African American man. If everyone is the same, then we won't have diverse thinking coming in, and we won't grow. We'll stagnate,"" Terry said. ""That's important, and TMCF is partnering with Medtronic to fix that. They're working to get more voices like me in the room.""Expanding accessAnother part of the TMCF partnership is a multi-year scholarship program for undergraduate students at HBCUs, funded by the Medtronic Foundation.Since the program's inception, over 100 TMCF scholarships have been granted in this first-of-its-kind partnership to build and foster stronger relationships with HBCUs.These scholarships are part of a larger effort by the Medtronic Foundation to elevate its focus on STEM and promote equity and representation with the goal of improving the lives of underserved communities.One of the main components of the scholarship is a mentor/mentee program. Each of the scholarship recipients is paired with a Medtronic employee volunteer who provides guidance, motivation, and emotional support.Additionally, the African Descent Network, a Medtronic employee resource group, donates time and resources to help the scholarship recipients navigate their academic journeys and exposes them to professional opportunities provided by a STEM education.Terry sees diversity as a key to innovation, and so is a willingness to keep trying, he said. But his biggest message for TMCF interns and scholarship recipients is, ""You're here because you earned it.""At Medtronic, we strategically partner with other organizations that share our commitment to removing barriers to equity, particularly in industries like healthcare technology that require top talent in STEM fields.

The latest results, presented today as a late-breaking clinical trial at the American Stroke Association's International Stroke Conference (ISC) 2023, build on the STROKE AF study 12-month primary endpoint results published in JAMA in June 2021.Over the first year, 12.5%* of patients in the ICM arm had AF detected compared to 1.8% of patients randomized to standard of care (consisting of external cardiac monitoring such as 12-lead ECGs, Holter monitoring, telemetry, or event recorders). At three years, the rate of AF detection increased to 21.7% of patients in the ICM arm compared to 2.4% in the control arm, resulting in a statistically significant hazard ratio of 10 (95% CI 4.0-25.2, p&lt;0.001). The study also showed that 67% of patients (31 out of 46) in the ICM arm had clinically relevant AF episodes lasting more than one hour in duration, while 88% of AF episodes were asymptomatic.""What these data show us is that we can't always rely on patients to tell us they are having palpitations or irregular heartbeats because the majority of AF detected in the study was asymptomatic,"" said Lee H. Schwamm, M.D., chief digital advisor, Mass General Brigham, C. Miller Fisher endowed chair in vascular neurology and professor of Neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. ""Importantly, these outcomes underscore the criticality of long-term monitoring with ICMs in these patients as much of the AF detected would have been missed at 30 days. AF is a risk that we can't afford to miss for patients who have already suffered a stroke — the consequences could be devastating.""Story continuesStroke impacts more than 795,000 people every year. More than 87% of strokes are ischemic strokes, which occur when vessels that allow blood to flow to the brain are blocked.1 Patients with AF are at a five-fold increased risk for ischemic stroke.While the STROKE AF study was not designed to detect or explain treatment differences, only 70% of patients with AF detected in the ICM arm were subsequently started on anticoagulation therapy—medication that helps prevent blood clots.New Insights on Predictors of AFThe one-year outcomes from the STROKE AF study Predictors of AF analysis recently published in JAMA Neurology, add insights for predicting AF in patients with small or large vessel ischemic strokes. Patients with either congestive heart failure (CHF) and/or left atrial enlargement (LAE), for example, had an AF detection rate of 23.4% compared to 5% for patients with neither attribute, suggesting these patients are at greater risk of having AF.""The STROKE AF Predictors analysis helps us better identify the patients who are most at-risk of unsuspected AF, which can inform stroke prevention strategies,"" said Schwamm. ""Not every ischemic stroke patient may need an ICM, but these data suggest some patients are more likely to experience AF and should be monitored more closely.""The STROKE AF study is a prospective, randomized study of 496 large and small vessel stroke patients across 33 centers in the U.S. The Reveal LINQ ICM was cleared in the U.S. in 2014 and is available worldwide.About MedtronicBold thinking.

216,77b6387f-ec0c-3e87-bba0-46ee40a03ada,MDT,2023-02-09,3 MedTech Stocks Likely to Beat Estimates This Earnings Season,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-medtech-stocks-likely-beat-124212848.html,1675860132,STORY,"['IART', 'EXAS', 'MDT', 'DGX']","[So far, the fourth-quarter reporting cycle has displayed a year-over-year improvement for the MedTech companies within the broader Medical sector. The handful of MedTech stocks that have released their earnings so far showed market share gain within their base businesses through the months of the fourth quarter compared with 2021, following three years of COVID-induced debacle. Amid the ongoing macroeconomic headwind, this was solely due to the reduction in the severity of COVID-19 despite the emergence of new virus variants in limited geographies.Even if we consider the performance on a sequential basis, the Q4 performance of the majority of the companies is likely to have improved. In this regard we note that, in the last-reported third quarter, the MedTech players witnessed rising raw material costs and other expense pressure, thanks to the global surge in the inflationary situation. Added to this, staffing shortages and supply-chain hazards severely dampened the growth process. Although market watchers expected a similar or a graver macroeconomic situation to hit the fourth-quarter performance of the sector hard, the sequentially better performance so far, in a way, is a breather for investors.Here we talk about three stocks, Exact Sciences Corporation EXAS, Medtronic plc MDT and Integra LifeSciences IART that are expected to beat earnings estimates in the ongoing reporting cycle.Two Major Q4 TrendsThe Q4 reporting cycle depicted a sequential improvement in base sales volumes. This was attributed to a significant reduction in COVID-led severity globally. There has been a significant rebound in non-COVID and elective legacy businesses of the MedTech companies. Also, the fourth-quarter results of the diagnostic testing companies are expected to reflect a sequential rise in testing demand, thanks to rising new cases in selected geographies.However, a contrasting trend is also evident. Considering the deteriorating trade situation, with the global inflationary pressure leading to an extremely tighter situation related to raw material and labor cost as well as freight charges, we expect fourth-quarter results to be disappointing in comparison to the year-ago period. In this regard, IMF, during the fourth quarter provided its World Economic Outlook Update. There it noted thata tentative recovery in 2021 was followed by increasingly gloomy developments in 2022. IMF specifically addressed the ongoing cost of living crisis, tightening financial conditions in most regions, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the lingering COVID-19 pandemic, all of which have been weighing heavily on the MedTech sector’s  business performance.Story continuesThe IMF update noted that global growth is expected to slow down from 6% in 2021 to 3.2% in 2022. If we exclude the global financial crisis and pandemic phase, this marks the weakest growth profile since 2001. Accordingly, industry players are expected to have collectively faced a more severe setback in terms of logistical challenges and increasing unit cost in the fourth quarter, resulting in corporate profitability cuts.Q4 Scorecard Thus FarPer the latest Earnings Preview, 28.6% of the companies in the broader Medical sector, constituting nearly 51.2% of the sector’s market capitalization, have already reported earnings. Of these, 81.3% beat in terms of earnings while 62.5% beat on revenues. Earnings increased 3.6% year over year on 7.6% higher revenues. Overall, fourth-quarter earnings for the Medical sector are expected to decline 9% despite a 4.3% sales increase.Abbott ABT and Quest Diagnostics DGX are a few companies whose base-business performance registered a strong recovery rate.In Q4, Abbott’s Established Pharmaceuticals sales improved 7.9% on an organic basis, backed by strong growth in several geographies, including India, China, Brazil and Mexico, and across several therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, women's health and central nervous system/pain management. Diabetes Care reported organic growth of 17.4% year over year, led by FreeStyle Libre, which contributed $1.1 billion of revenues in the reported quarter. Structural Heart sales rose 13% and Heart Failure sales improved 5.9% year over year organically.However, rising costs and expenses in the face of record inflationary pressure put huge pressure on margins for the company.Quest Diagnostics’ legacy base business (excludes COVID-19 testing) revenues were up 6.3% year over year. However, COVID-19 testing revenues nosedived 74.6% in the quarter.However, pressure on volume, owing to a difficult macroeconomic situation and pricing, constitutes the primary risk for Quest Diagnostics. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, was down 11.2% year over year in the fourth quarter.Zacks MethodologyGiven the high degree of diversity in the Medtech industry, finding the right stocks with the potential to beat estimates might be quite a daunting task.However, our proprietary Zacks methodology makes this fairly simple.We are focusing on stocks that have the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

218,375f5a17-3f25-3d6c-bed9-b94fdf4d3c96,RSG,2023-02-09,Republic Services (RSG) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/republic-services-rsg-expected-beat-150003265.html,1675868403.0,STORY,['RSG'],"[Republic Services (RSG) is expected to deliver flat earnings compared to the year-ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 15. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis waste management company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.02 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter.Revenues are expected to be $3.46 billion, up 17.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.12% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Republic Services?For Republic Services, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +7.50%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Republic Services will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Republic Services would post earnings of $1.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.34, delivering a surprise of +10.74%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Republic Services appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Both numbers beat analysts’ expectations. The significance of this double beat takes on more significance in a weakening economy. Banks are setting more money aside to protect against rising credit losses. However, as the largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan should have no problem delivering sufficient earnings that will allow it to support its dividend and continue its share repurchases.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsJPMorgan Chase makes this list of undervalued blue chip stocks with a P/E ratio of 11.67. In addition, the JPM stock has been up 34% since the middle of Oct. Analysts suggest there’s approximately 11% upside for the stock price which is supported by a dividend that currently pays out $4 per share on an annual basis and has an appealing yield of 2.88%.  Merck (MRK) Source: ShutterstockMerck (NYSE:MRK) just delivered another strong earnings report. On Feb. 2, the company Merck posted revenue of $13.83 billion and EPS of $1.62. It’s also one of the top undervalued blue-chip stocks to buy now.Story continuesA significant reason for the company’s strong results is likely the strength of the company’s Keytruda drug which has been approved for the treatment of several forms of cancer. Keytruda has become a cornerstone of Merck’s revenue growth since it was approved by the FDA in 2018. In fact, in 2022 it accounted for approximately 40% of the company’s pharmaceutical sales.  Unlike many stocks on this list, Merck did not benefit from the Jan. rally. After being up about 26% in 2022, MRK stock was down more than 6% in Jan. However, the stock trades for around 17x earnings. And the company’s earnings are projected to increase at an average rate of around 10% over the next five years which will be sufficient for future stock price growth.  Chevron (CVX) 10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockWith the performance of energy stocks in 2022, it might surprise you to find an oil stock on this list of undervalued blue-chip stocks. But things are cheap in the oil patch these days. And that’s great news for companies, like Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Trading at around 9x earnings, CVX stock is a bargain, particularly as their stock is down about 5.5% to start the year. The company’s breakeven price for crude oil is well below the current price of around $80 per barrel. And crude prices may be rising as part of the ongoing budget negotiations between the House of Representatives and the Biden administration. And the story of Chevron isn’t limited to fossil fuels. The company is one of the world’s leading exporters of liquefied natural gas (LNG) which is seeing increased demand, particularly from Europe.  Caterpillar (CAT) Source: ShutterstockEarnings reports can make investors prisoners of the moment. In my opinion, that’s the case of the approximately 6% drop in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) stock in the week it reported mixed earnings. The company beat on the top line but missed on the bottom line.  That was enough for investors looking for a reason to clip the wings of CAT stock which was up nearly 40% in the last 12 months. But it could also be that some investors were taking some profit before sending the stock to new highs. The thesis is simple. Much of the spending for the Infrastructure Act is only now making its way into the economy. And the company is also likely to benefit as the oil and gas sector may increase capital spending this year. That means that Caterpillar will likely see strong revenue and earnings growth for the next several quarters.  American Express (AXP) Source: ShutterstockAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) illustrates the bifurcation that’s happening in the U.S. economy. On the one hand, the company’s most recent earnings report showed that the company is having to set aside more of its profits to cover potential charge-offs as delinquencies rise.  This is troubling because American Express is typically associated with higher-income card members. However, investors may be seeing it as a natural, if an unfortunate byproduct of American Express adopting a business model that encourages cardmembers to carry a balance.  On the other hand, the company still is seeing strong revenue growth and is forecasting solid earnings growth for the rest of 2023. The company is benefiting from “high customer growth.” And that premium customer will likely be the company’s focus for the rest of the year.  AXP stock trades for approximately 17x earnings and is up 16.78% in the last month. Despite the earnings report, the stock is still holding on to a 2% gain in the week since releasing earnings.  Home Depot (HD)  the words ""blue chip"" in bold font overtop of a pile of cash. Blue-chip stocksSource: ShutterstockNext on this list of undervalued blue-chip stocks is Home Depot (NYSE:HD). HD stock is up more than 7% in 2023. That’s continuing a rally that started in the last three months of 2022.  The stock of Home Depot and competitors like Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) was hit hard in 2022 as the housing market dried up in the face of higher interest rates. But prices are rallying as the company’s financials are proving the thesis that homeowners are choosing to love the house they have. This is a good reminder that Home Depot is a home improvement store. And that improvement goes on independently of the real estate market.  I considered putting Lowe’s on this list instead of Home Depot. But as of this writing, HD stock is trading at around 20x earnings which is slightly more attractive than LOW stock. And Home Depot pays a more attractive dividend that currently pays out $7.60 per share annually and has been increasing for the last 13 consecutive years.  Texas Instruments (TXN)  Blue poker chips stacked next to three stacks of $100 bills representing blue chip stocksSource: ShutterstockAnalyzing stocks is an imperfect science. In Oct. I listed Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) on a list of semiconductor stocks that were drawing the attention of analysts. So far, that attention has led to TXN stock climbing by about 15%. This reflects renewed optimism surrounding the demand for semiconductor chips in 2023.  This week, General Motors (NYSE:GM) told analysts that it was seeing an unwinding of the supply chain struggles that have suppressed new car production. Since Texas Instruments gets approximately 25% of its revenue from the automotive market, news like this is likely to be bullish for TXN stock. The average new car now has over 3,000 semiconductor chips. TXN stock is currently trading at a price-earnings ratio of around 19x which makes it slightly less expensive than the S&amp;P 500. However, the company does pay a dividend that pays out $4.96 per share on an annual basis and has been increasing for 19 consecutive years.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in CVX.

Check out our latest analysis for Boeing The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At BoeingIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when President David Calhoun bought US$4.0m worth of shares at a price of US$160 per share. Even though the purchase was made at a significantly lower price than the recent price (US$214), we still think insider buying is a positive. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.Boeing insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Boeing insiders own about US$73m worth of shares. That equates to 0.06% of the company. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Boeing Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Boeing insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. Insiders own shares in Boeing and we see no evidence to suggest they are worried about the future. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

We've seen already the dramatic ramp-up in activity in our fleet and other lessors' fleets within China,"" Chief Executive Andy Cronin told Reuters.""The international network will understandably take a little bit more time to ramp back up. But from talking to our airline customers in China, they're already seeing really strong demand.""The International Civil Aviation Organization on Wednesday predicted a complete post-pandemic air travel recovery in 2023, while the International Air Transport Association, which represents airlines, is predicting full recovery in 2024.Avolon reported a five-fold increase in adjusted net profit to $253 million for 2022, despite a sharp drop in unadjusted profit on a previously reported impairment charge for jets effectively detained in Russia following sanctions over Ukraine.Cronin, who stepped up to become CEO last year after founder Domhnal Slattery retired, warned there would be no quick fix to the aircraft delivery delays that threaten to dampen the industry's recovery as planemakers wrestle with weak supply chains.Cronin kicked off a volley of protests about last-minute delays from lessors at their annual summit in Dublin last month.""It makes it exponentially more difficult to manage a business when you just don't know what you're going to be at or when you're going to get it,"" Cronin told Reuters on Thursday.Story continuesAirbus is expected to announce a flatter production plan next week to tackle industrial issues. A senior Airbus executive urged suppliers to carry more stocks on Wednesday, though industry sources have also pointed to some internal bottlenecks.""We know where we stand based off the current plan,"" Cronin said, when asked if Airbus and Boeing had finalised 2023 schedules.""The constant problem is the plan may continue to evolve as we move through the year. And it's that fear of the unknown that is driving a lot of the anxiety in our customer base.""Plane giants last month rejected the criticisms, with a Boeing executive telling the Airline Economics conference that restoring production was ""not as easy as an on/off switch"".

It's had its ups and downs for the past few years, but things look to finally be making a solid turnaround. New hires as well as good sales and production numbers are positive signs, especially when many other companies are struggling in this economic environment.Investors have also been optimistic on the stock recently. Although the stock has been on a hot streak lately, up more than 28% in the last six months, it is still below its pre-pandemic levels. Investors might still be wary about the past problems associated with the company and a possible recession.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with BA. Click here to check it out. BA 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of BAPeter Lynch Chart of BABoeing Is Trading at an Attractive Price for Bargain HuntersBA Data by GuruFocusPersonally, I believe Boeing still has room left to run. Management is forecasting healthy returns in 2023, the macroeconomic situation is improving and Boeing has its priorities straight (finally). Brian West, the CEO of the company, says the focus is clear: generate cash and deliver airplanes while paying down debt.Some background for those who live under a rock: Boeing's 737 Max planes were previously grounded for 18 months after two fatal crashes. Right after that, Covid-19 erupted worldwide, upending the global economy. During that time, the company had to take on a lot of debt, leading to a deterioration in the balance sheet.In the aftermath of the pandemic, Boeing has been slow to recover. However, as time progresses, demand for air travel has increased, taking the company with it. The 737 Max is now in full operation again worldwide, and demand for the aircraft remains strong. More importantly, the company has made progress in fixing the toxic culture that put profits before safety and engineering excellence.Gaining pace once againSome investors might be confused Boeing stock is doing well considering the aerospace giant delivered a disappointing fourth-quarter earnings report. Boeing reported a loss of $1.75 per share, while analysts had expected earnings of $0.26 per share. The aerospace giant blamed the loss on supply chain disruptions, which drove up total costs. Boeing 787 planes were also delayed, which added additional costs to their customers. In addition, production delays meant that Boeing had to compensate customers.Story continuesBoeing reported revenues of $19.98 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. This was up 35% from the same quarter of 2021. However, analysts were looking for $20.38 billion in revenue instead.Although the 787 Dreamliners and Max have suffered quality issues, Boeing is optimistic that they won't cause a huge revenue decrease. The company predicts that it will have an unstable period in the interim but will eventually recover once customers restock their planes.However, these numbers still show a recovery. To put things in perspective, the company lost $7.69 a share in the fourth quarter of 2021. When you compare the two numbers, Boeing is heading in the right direction.The biggest positive for Boeing is that it reported positive free cash flow for the first time since 2018. Boeing produced $3.1 billion in free cash flow in the final quarter of 2022, surpassing its own estimates of $2.5 billion. It also simultaneously came within $1 billion of its forecasted earnings per share, which was a notable achievement.According to a recent report by Boeing, it received 774 commercial orders for the next generation of planes. These included 561 orders for its 737 line. It delivered 480 airplanes in the full fiscal year.Considering the reversal of fortunes, I believe Boeing has successfully reinvented itself and restored buyer confidence in its jets. Although earnings disappointed Wall Street, the outlook for Boeing is enticing.Tailwinds are pushing Boeing upwardAside from Boeing itself, several external factors serve as tailwinds, such as the macroeconomic environment. The Fed is speculated to soon ease up on monetary policy. It recently instituted only a quarter percentage point interest rate hike from 4.5% to 4.75%. Although it was the eighth consecutive interest rate hike, it was still smaller than the previous rate increases.The cooling of interest rate increases should greatly impact Boeing's business. The company had to take on huge amounts of debt, and most of it is variable rate external debt, so interest rates are key.In addition, China Southern Airlines recently reinstituted the 737 Max to its flight paths. China is a top aviation market. The Aerospace Forum estimates the value of the Chinese aviation market to be worth around $575 billion in 20 years, growing about $28.75 billion a year. Despite political tensions, trade between the U.S. and China rose to a record high in 2022. Hence, Boeing will benefit immensely from finally being re-approved for Max operations in China.TakeawayAfter a few rough years, Boeing is making a comeback. However, shares still trade at a discount to their 52-week high. Considering its recent performance and prospects, I believe Boeing is undervalued. The recent history of this company has understandably caused long-lasting negative sentiment, but this provides an opportunity for those bullish on the stock.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

(NASDAQ: ILMN), a global leader in DNA sequencing and array-based technologies, today announced that its first NovaSeq X Plus system was recently delivered to the Broad Institute. Alex Aravanis, PhD, chief technology officer of Illumina, made the announcement today in a presentation at the Advances in Genome Biology and Technology (AGBT) conference in Hollywood, Florida. Aravanis also announced much anticipated updates on Illumina's innovation roadmap including Illumina Complete Long Reads, the company's long-read sequencing technology, and its XLEAP SBS chemistry. Both the NovaSeq X Series and Illumina Complete Long Reads were announced in September 2022.Illumina announced that its first NovaSeq X Plus system was recently delivered to the Broad Institute. Seen here is Broad's sequencing operations team with their new NovaSeq X Plus.World's first NovaSeq X deliveryThe NovaSeq X Series is Illumina's most powerful sequencing system, delivering an unprecedented combination of high throughput and accuracy, and featuring streamlined informatics, breakthrough sustainability advancements, and cost-effective sequencing economics. Aravanis announced today that the Broad Institute has received the world's first shipment.""We are thrilled to see the NovaSeq X Plus beginning to ship to our customers after years in research and development, and now their biggest aspirations can be realized: enabling projects never previously thought possible,"" said Aravanis. ""We know our customers are eager to embark on more, deeper, and larger genomic research driven by operational ease and lower costs.""At AGBT, Niall Lennon, PhD, senior director of translational genomics at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, presented alongside Aravanis, where he offered new data confirming that NovaSeq X Plus performance meets or exceeds that of the NovaSeq 6000.""We are always excited to welcome new technologies that will allow the scientific community to do more, and larger, experiments,"" Lennon said. ""We anticipate that, once up and running, this platform will have a large impact on our ability to support groups wanting to access our walk-up sequencing service, our human whole genome product, and our blended genome/exome product.""Story continuesAs previously announced, Illumina is ramping up to ship 40-50 orders in this quarter and the company plans to ship more than 300 instruments in total this year.Illumina Complete Long Reads updateAravanis also unveiled information about the technology behind Illumina Complete Long Reads, which generates highly accurate long reads in an efficient, scalable workflow.""This technology is unlike anything on the market and was engineered to meet and exceed our customers' needs,"" Aravanis said in his presentation. ""Illumina Complete Long Reads is the only offering that addresses the 5% of hard-to-read genic regions: at scale, with high accuracy, all on a single instrument, and with 90% less DNA input than other long read technologies.""Illumina Complete Long Reads leverages ""land-marks"" on the original long, single-molecule fragment analyzed in combination with unmarked standard reads to generate highly accurate, complete long reads. This innovative long-read solution overcomes the pain points of other on-market solutions - high DNA input requirements, complex workflows with low throughput, highly variable results and the need for additional dedicated instruments.Early access customers of the new technology included Wellcome Sanger Institute. ""We are excited about Illumina Complete Long Reads,"" said Michael Quail, PhD, principal scientific manager, Sequencing R&amp;D, Wellcome Sanger Institute. ""The library prep was straightforward, with flexible input requirements. We are impressed with the accuracy of the data, along with the read lengths and phase blocks that can be generated on Illumina sequencers.""The initial Illumina Complete Long Read products are focused on human whole genomes and are compatible with the NovaSeq X Series and the NovaSeq 6000 expanding the capabilities of both systems. In 2023, Illumina will launch two Illumina Complete Long Reads products—a whole-genome assay and an enrichment panel—enabling a comprehensive, high-accuracy, long-read view for as low as $600 per genome.Illumina Complete Long Reads, how it works: 1. DNA is tagmented into large fragments, eliminating need for shearing or size selection. 2. Long fragments are land-marked at the single-molecule scale to capture and preserve long-read information within the fragment. 3. Land-marked fragments are tagmented again and sequenced. 4. During analysis, long reads are generated, and the data combined with a standard, unmarked whole-genome library to produce highly accurate, Illumina Complete Long Reads.About IlluminaIllumina is improving human health by unlocking the power of the genome.

The bottom line declined 81.3% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 75 cents.The company’s GAAP loss per share was 89 cents against the year-ago quarter’s EPS of 71 cents.For the full year, adjusted earnings were $2.12 per share, down 64% from the year-ago period’s levels. The figure also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.4%.RevenuesIn the quarter under review, Illumina’s revenues were $1.08 billion, down 9.6% year over year. However, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.5%.Total revenues for 2022 were $4.58 billion, up 1.3% rise from the year-ago period’s levels. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.4%.Segment DetailsPost the acquisition of GRAIL on Aug 18, 2021, Illumina has two reportable segments — Core Illumina and GRAIL.Core Illumina revenues fell 11% year over year (down 8% at the constant exchange rate or CER) to $1.07 billion. Core Illumina Sequencing Consumable revenues totaled $687 million in the reported quarter, down 13% year over year.Sequencing Instrument revenues for core Illumina were $146 million, down 24% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. The decline was primarily due to lower NovaSeq 6000 shipments in advance of the availability of NovaSeq X. The decline was partially offset by another quarter of record NextSeq 1000/2000 shipments.Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseIllumina, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Illumina, Inc. Quote Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenues were $131 million, up 24% year over year on higher instrument service contract revenues on a growing installed base and an increase in oncology and IBD partnership revenue.GRAIL contributed $23 million to revenues during the reported quarter.MarginsThe adjusted gross margin (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) was 66.5% in the reported quarter, highlighting a contraction of 505 basis points (bps) year over year.Story continuesResearch and development expenses plunged 1.1% year over year to $346 million, whereas selling, general &amp; administrative expenses rose 1.4% to $432 million. These pulled up adjusted operating costs by 0.3% to $778 million.Adjusted operating loss in the quarter was $58 million against the prior-year quarter’s adjusted operating income of $81 million.Financial UpdateIllumina exited 2022 with cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments of $2.04 billion compared with $1.34 billion at the end of 2021.The company did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter.Cumulative net cash used in operating activities at the end of 2022 was $39.2 million compared with $54.5 million a year ago.2023 GuidanceFor 2023, Illumina expects its consolidated revenue growth in the range of 7 to 10% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $4.99 billion.The company expects adjusted EPS for 2023 in the range of $1.25 to $1.50. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $2.26.Core Illumina revenue growth is expected in the range of 6-9%. GRAIL revenues are expected to be in the range of $90 million to $110 million.Our TakeIllumina ended 2022 on a mixed note with lower-than-expected earnings and revenues beat. The year-over-year performance remained sluggish. Sequencing instruments revenue for core Illumina declined due to delayed recruitment for some large research projects in the Americas and Europe, the ongoing impact of COVID disruptions in China, the year-over-year impact of customer inventory management, the anticipated decline in COVID surveillance revenues and headwinds from foreign exchange rates. The base business in regions was impacted by anticipation for NovaSeq X and the slowdown in COVID surveillance and research. Contraction in gross margin is discouraging.On a positive note, Illumina registered another quarter of record NextSeq 1000/2000 shipments as the company continues to witness strong adoption. Further, Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue rose year-over-year, driven primarily by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base as well as an increase in oncology and IBD partnership revenue.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksIllumina currently carries Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Neogen Corporation NEOG, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Quanta Services'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Quanta Services How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Quanta Services is:8.5% = US$444m ÷ US$5.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.09 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Quanta Services' Earnings Growth And 8.5% ROEOn the face of it, Quanta Services' ROE is not much to talk about. However, given that the company's ROE is similar to the average industry ROE of 9.6%, we may spare it some thought. Having said that, Quanta Services has shown a modest net income growth of 11% over the past five years. Taking into consideration that the ROE is not particularly high, we reckon that there could also be other factors at play which could be influencing the company's growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesNext, on comparing Quanta Services' net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 12% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for PWR? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Quanta Services Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Quanta Services has a low three-year median payout ratio of 7.2%, meaning that the company retains the remaining 93% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business.Additionally, Quanta Services has paid dividends over a period of four years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 4.4% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 14% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.ConclusionIn total, it does look like Quanta Services has some positive aspects to its business. With a high rate of reinvestment, albeit at a low ROE, the company has managed to see a considerable growth in its earnings. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

The figure was higher than our estimate of $551.1 million.Adjusted EBITDA increased 11% year over year to $135.3 million because of higher average insured values, premium rates and lender-placed policies in force.

The figure was higher than our estimate of $2 billion.Adjusted EBITDA increased 6% year over year to $166.1 million. The increase was driven by Connected Living and higher net investment income. It was partially offset by weaker performance in Asia Pacific and Europe, including the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, as well as an increase in claims costs within Global Automotive. Connected Living benefited from reduced mobile service and repair expenses compared with the prior year period and a modest increase in North American mobile subscribers.Adjusted EBITDA loss at Corporate &amp; Other was $27.2 million, wider than the year-ago quarter’s adjusted EBITDA loss of $25.5 million due to lower investment income.Story continuesFinancial UpdateThe company exited the fourth quarter with total assets of $33.1 billion, down 2.3% year over year.

Higher 2023 catastrophe reinsurance program costs as well as continued elevated non-catastrophe loss experience across all lines of business, particularly in the first half of 2023, are expected to impact the segment.Global Lifestyle Adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow modestly from revised 2022 results of $809.4 million. Lower contributions from international, including the impact of continued foreign exchange headwinds, are expected to pressure results particularly in the first half of 2023.  Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA loss is expected to be approximately $105 million as the company continues to drive expense leverage.Assurant expects adjusted earnings, excluding reportable catastrophes, per diluted share growth rate to be lower than Adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable catastrophes growth. This is due to higher depreciation expense of approximately $114 million and a higher effective tax rate of approximately 22% to 24%, following a $9 million benefit in 2022.Interest expense is estimated to be approximately $110 million, in line with 2022.Zacks Rank &amp; Peer ReleasesThe company currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.MGIC Investment Corporation MTG reported fourth-quarter 2022 operating net income per share of 64 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.5% and our estimate of 59 cents.

A nine-person jury in New York decided to that the NFT collection was not protected under the First Amendment, and awarded Hermes $133,000 in total damages, Bloomberg Law reported.The NFT collection, dubbed MetaBirkins, was created by Mason Rothschild. The 100 NFTs came in several different colors and were covered in fur instead of leather. Some depicted famous paintings like Vincent van Gogh’s The Starry Night. The bags were originally sold for $450 but were resold on the secondary market for prices approaching the physical Birkin Bags’ price tag of more than $10,000.https://twitter.com/MetaBirkins/status/1465366691085385729The decision could mean that many Web3 creators may need to tread more carefully with the projects they produce. Companies may also seek to do more to protect their intellectual property when it comes to NFTs, cryptocurrencies, and the metaverse.This is the first NFT jury decision around intellectual property, but there are other cases in the works. Online marketplace and clothing reseller StockX is entangled in a lawsuit with Nike that involves NFTs. The shoe and apparel giant sued StockX last year because it argued that its NFTs of Nike shoes infringed on the company’s trademark rights.Some companies have already proactively moved to protect their brands in the metaverse with trademark filings.

A Look At Its Intrinsic Value",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ansys-inc-nasdaq-anss-expensive-172029395.html,1675876829,STORY,['ANSS'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for ANSYS Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$661.7mUS$760.5mUS$935.0mUS$1.07bUS$1.18bUS$1.26bUS$1.33bUS$1.39bUS$1.44bUS$1.48bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x8Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 6.82%Est @ 5.40%Est @ 4.40%Est @ 3.70%Est @ 3.21% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1% US$612US$651US$741US$786US$801US$791US$772US$746US$716US$684(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.3bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.5b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.1%) = US$25bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$25b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$12bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$19b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$277, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at ANSYS as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.007. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for ANSYSStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Software industry.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

Corporation (NYSE:VFC) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript February 7, 2023Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the VF Corporation Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Allegra Perry, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.Allegra Perry: Good afternoon, and welcome to VF Corporation's Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Conference Call. Participants on today's call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC. Unless otherwise noted, amounts referred to on today's call will be on an adjusted constant dollar basis, which we've defined in the press release that was issued this afternoon, and which we use as lead numbers in our discussion, because we believe they more accurately represent, the true operational performance and underlying results of our business.You may also hear us refer to reported amounts, which are in accordance with US GAAP. Reconciliation of GAAP measures to adjusted amounts can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management's view of why this information is useful to investors. Unless otherwise noted, results presented on today's call are based on continuing operations. Joining me on the call will be VF's Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, Benno Dorer; and EVP and Chief Financial Officer, Matt Puckett. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions. I'll now hand over to Benno.Benno Dorer: Hello, everyone. Since I stepped into my new interim role about two months ago, I have been fully immersed in the business. I have uncovered areas of strength and promise, but also gained a deeper understanding of where we must improve. And I have been impressed with our talent at all levels and their leadership and commitment to VF on which our future success is dependent. Many of you know about my career history, which culminated in roles as CEO and Chair of The Clorox Company until my retirement from a full-time corporate career two years ago. This gave me the opportunity to lead a global purpose-driven consumer portfolio company towards more profitable, sustained and responsible growth with financial discipline, a fully engaged organization, brands people love, consistently strong product innovation and a differentiated approach to the portfolio to maximize value.Story continuesYou also know that, I have served on the Board of VF for the last six years, including as leading independent director from July 2021 until December 2022. I believe that, my deep insight into VF. My passion for the company, its people and brands, coupled with my prior career experience gives me a solid foundation for the interim CEO role. And I do plan to use my time to make a positive difference to VF's business and organization. My overall theme for today is that, VF will sharpen its near-term focus on the biggest consumer opportunities, within our existing brand portfolio and on enhanced operational performance. Consistent with this objective, we are shifting resource priorities across the company. This will include rightsizing our dividends, exploring the sale of non-core assets and cutting costs in lower value areas to strengthen our execution and to enable incremental targeted investments in our brands and the consumer.With that, I'm pleased to speak with you today about four topics. VF's results in Q3, our near-term priorities to address performance, how we're taking prudent steps to build a stronger company for the future and why I'm even more optimistic than I was two months ago about the long-term prospects for VF. First, we overcame a very challenging environment in Q3, where our performance highlighted examples of success, while also clearly showcasing areas to improve. Amidst the difficult geopolitical and economic backdrop, we grew Q3 revenue 3% in constant dollars. And today, we are reaffirming our revenue outlook at the low end of our prior range and also the midpoint of our EPS outlook for fiscal year 2023. Our EMEA business continues to be a bright spot, with Q3 revenue up 10%, our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth driven by broad-based strength, including the North Face of 13% and Vans up 7%.Another strength in Q3 has been our consistent performance of the outdoor brands led, of course, by the North Face, where revenue was also up 13% globally with growth achieved in each region and channel. We also saw nice growth in Timberland, up 6% in the quarter with solid performance in EMEA and in wholesale globally. And our outdoor emerging brands continued to grow strongly, up 10% highlighted by Ultra. Finally, in Asia, we saw a sequential improvement with Q3 revenue up 4%. This was driven by the beginning of what could be a return to stronger momentum in Greater China, which was close to flat at minus one. Secondly, we are clear-eyed about VF's performance barriers, which are predominantly operational in nature. And our near-term priority is to put aggressive plans in place to improve our execution.We are not reaching our full potential as a company. The good news, though, is that doing so is largely within our control. We must consistently delight consumers with exciting products, engaging content delivered with effective marketing tools and with great shopping experiences in-store and online. Where we do this well, see the North Face and the broader portfolio in EMEA, our brands continue to thrive where we are inconsistent with Vans being far the highest impact, but not the only example, we must improve our consumer execution to return to full strength. We must also return to delivering products to our consumers and customers on time and at lower cost to VF. Supply chain has long been a core competitive advantage of VF but our recent performance also requires focus.So to improve execution, we have two near-term key priorities, which represent significant value creation opportunities. First, turning around our Vans performance through improved consumer execution; and second, returning to supply chain excellence across the company. On Vans, we clearly have been challenged for some time now. This is predominantly a challenge in the Americas, and it is mostly executional in nature. For perspective, Vans Q3 revenue rose by 7% in EMEA, but declined by 13% in the Americas, which is primarily North America and accounted for 90% of the global Vans Q3 revenue decline. While there are differences in EMEA compared to the North American market, the relatively stronger performance of Vans in EMEA also reflects the benefits of a clear growth strategy and stronger marketplace execution.We must do better with Vans in its home market, and we will. Our action plan follows the four growth drivers laid out in our Investor Day last September; consumer, products, marketplace and operating model. Here are a few specific examples of actions. We will sharpen our view of the changing consumer landscape through a new consumer segmentation, which is underway and will inform the business' overall growth strategy and begin to influence our direct-to-consumer plans as of summer this year. We need to delight consumers in ways that are relevant to their specific needs. And to do so, we must be more intimately familiar with them. We will also better turn data and insights into significant consumer opportunities available today. For example, a strong untapped opportunity exists with our UltraRange product line.Here, awareness is very low at around 10% among all consumers and at below 30% even among Vans loyalists. So we've started to boost awareness, and this is starting to yield results. UltraRange revenue grew 34% in Q3 with much more growth to be had. The MTE and Half Cab product lines have similar potential. And going forward, we will drive these and other promising platforms longer and more continuously. We will significantly increase our investment in product innovation, funded by a reduction in costs in lower value areas with actions, including SG&amp;A reduction and improving store profitability. Vans product development investment as a percentage of revenue lags well behind the company average. We will change that starting with fiscal year 2024.This will help us aggressively pursue new styles and make our innovation pipeline more consistently strong. We will also eliminate unnecessary SKU complexity to simplify and importantly, amplify the shopping experience. A small test at our Irvine, California store led to a footwear revenue improvement of plus 12 percentage points with 30% fewer SKUs. We will begin to expand this initiative as of fall fiscal year 2024. We will move our digital spending principle from budget cap based to flexible and ROI-based to take advantage of available spending opportunities that translate into incremental revenue and profits. It is early days, but we have already seen an improvement in profitable DTC growth rates only a few weeks into this change. We will sharpen our processes.In fiscal year 2024, we will go-to-market at retail, including wholesale customers with clearly aligned and integrated product calendars. This will lead to better plans that are more centered around the consumer. And to drive Vans forward, we have made tremendous progress putting a world-class Vans leadership team in place. Two critical leaders, our new Chief Product and Merchandising Officer; and our new Chief Digital Officer, have both joined in December, and they're off to a fast start. Vans continues to be a fundamentally strong brand. The number of consumers buying Vans during the last 12 months was up, as was brand advocacy. But many people buy the brand less often. So what we do need to do is to fuel the brand more consistently and give people more reasons to buy more Vans.That is on us, and that's what we will do. The momentum we continue to generate with The North Face further proves this point. The brand continues to perform strongly, driven by strong consumer engagement and iconic products. And we will keep investing to fuel that momentum. Our Explorer Pass membership continued to grow significantly in Q3, up 2.1 million members to approximately 17 million in total. It's more than a jackets marketing campaign, launched the season and drove strong outerwear growth globally with the Nuptse jackets, and the recently relaunched Summit Series premium product line leading the business. Our recent first-ever performance-led collab launch with American artist and designer cars was highly successful. Net, the brand's momentum is strong and broad-based.The North Face is a solid and transferable execution blueprint for Vans, and frankly, the entire VF portfolio in the Americas, where we must grow with consumers more consistently. The second near-term priority at VF is to return to the company's hallmark standard of excellence in the supply chain arena. We are working through a variety of external and internal issues that impacted revenues and profits in a high-volume quarter like Q3. Lengthened manufacturing and freight lead times, larger upfront product buys, unpredicted demand spikes from elevated promotional activity in the quarter, plus higher than normal customer order cancellations add up to unsatisfactory customer service, elevated inventory and significantly higher costs. So we're taking aggressive actions to address these issues.We expect to be able to work excess seasonal inventory down to more normalized levels by the end of Q4 of this fiscal year. Our customer service levels are also improving, albeit still below our own and our customers' expectations. We have a plan in place to get back to target levels by the end of the first half of fiscal year 2024. We will also leverage our logistics partnerships to reduce costs by improving ocean and parcel rates for the next fiscal year. And we will see a return to more normalized and predictable promotional patterns and anticipate moderating inflation, which we expect will contribute to lower costs through fiscal year 2024. We are committed to serving our customers better and to getting back to strong supply chain performance at improved costs.Again, much of this is within our control. My third message is that we're taking prudent steps to strengthen VF's financial position and build a stronger company. VF is committed to strong financial discipline. This all starts with a strong core and growth that is profitable and sustainable. And to reinforce this, we are taking significant actions now. We will focus our near-term growth efforts on our existing portfolio. Smart acquisitions will remain part of the VF playbook. But near-term, we believe we are best served to return to strong shareholder value creation by taking advantage of the many opportunities offered by our portfolio of beloved brands, including those acquired in the recent years. Our growth strategy laid out in the company's Investor Day last September, continues to be a solid foundation to achieve this, but we will lean into the consumer even more strongly than in the past.We will also pursue strategic alternatives for our PACS business. This business is performing well, but we need to make sure that we are the highest value owner and that we focus our resources against the highest value opportunities within our existing portfolio. To grow margins and profit while supporting strong investments in the business, we will lean into cost savings through a more systematic and ongoing cross-functional approach to eliminate costs that do have lower strategic value and are less consumer oriented. And we're making the tough, but what we believe to be a principled and financially responsible decision to cut our dividend by about 40%. We do not take this last step lightly and fully understand the value of a solid dividend as part of a comprehensive approach to total shareholder value creation.But we also believe that it is prudent to right-size the dividend to accelerate the path back to our target dividend payout and debt-to-EBITDA ratios and to rebuild the dividend from there based on solid expected cash flows and a return to sustained earnings growth beginning with fiscal year 2024. Returning cash to shareholders through a strong dividend remains a key capital allocation priority. In a continued difficult environment, we are committed to return to a more profitable and consistent growth next fiscal year. Matt will talk you through these actions and the shape of our initial fiscal year expectations in more depth in a moment. My last message for you is that I'm even more optimistic today than I was two months ago about VF's future and our ability to return to strong long-term shareholder value creation.We have significant potential to unlock value from our unique brand portfolio. While not immune to the challenging macroeconomic environment near-term, these brands will benefit from significant long-term category and consumer tailwinds. We will leverage these tailwinds and apply VF's best practices, scale, and capabilities. A distinct competitive advantage. We have a clear set of near-term priorities to inject consistency of execution, which will improve performance across the business over time. We will sharpen our consumer growth strategies on all our brands and ensure we have the right investments against each of them to realize their full potential funded by cost savings. And we have permission from consumers to broaden our reach by taking many of our brands into new financially-attractive categories and countries, and we are putting in place strong future plans to do so.We are committed to returning to strong operational discipline, which will help drive predictability, profit and margin growth and strong and consistent cash flow generation. And we will remain committed to the dividend as part of our comprehensive shareholder value creation plan after today's adjustments. Lastly, we have a talented, engaged and passionate workforce. And we continue to nurture our superb internal talent and attract great new outside hires, reinforcing our confidence that VF remains a top destination for exceptional leaders. Thank you. With that, I'll hand it over to Matt to talk through the financials.Matt Puckett: Thank you, Benno, and good afternoon, everyone. As Benno mentioned, our Q3 results amidst the continued difficult macro environment, exhibited areas of continued strength, as well as parts of the business with clear opportunity for improvement. During the quarter, revenue was up 3%, with balanced growth across both direct-to-consumer and wholesale. Adjusted gross margin was down 140 basis points. And adjusted operating margins declined by 280 basis points, leading to adjusted EPS of $1.12, down 17% or 10% in constant currency. Taking a look at our revenue results across geographies, the Americas region was down 1% during the quarter. As Benno alluded to in his remarks, North America was particularly challenging at Vans and also at Dickies due largely to the continued impact of inventory actions taken by their largest wholesale partner, as well as softer performance across the value and work consumer.Momentum continued in the EMEA region, with revenue up 10%, which marked our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and represented broad-based strength across brands, with 10 out of 11 brands in the geography growing during the quarter, including the five largest brands. Looking at the countries, all major markets were growing with four of the top five by volume, up double digits. Lastly, in our APAC region, we saw further sequential improvement versus half one, with revenue up 4%, driven by improving performance in Greater China, which was down 1%, coupled with strong mid-teens growth in the rest of Asia, where most countries were up double digits. Moving on to gross margin, which was down 140 basis points during the quarter. As anticipated, we saw mix become a tailwind in Q3 for the first time in several quarters, driven by the strength of our international business and channel mix.Most Profitable Industries in the World in 2021Photo by Campaign Creators on UnsplashHowever, this was more than offset by rate, which was down 170 basis points at higher discounts and an increased promotional environment, also impacting our direct channels, were partially offset by strategic pricing actions and FX transaction benefits. Moving down the P&amp;L. Our adjusted operating margin was down by 280 basis points, reflecting the lower gross margin and 110 basis points of deleverage in SG&amp;A, which grew at a 6% rate in constant dollars in the quarter, as compared to the revenue growth of 3%. The primary driver of deleverage was higher marketing spend, which accounted for about 75% of the increase in the SG&amp;A ratio. In addition, deleverage in distribution and freight spending and some direct-to-consumer costs were mostly offset by spending reductions across G&amp;A.As it relates to our cash position at the end of Q3, as anticipated, our liquidity increased during the quarter to approximately $1.9 billion, benefiting from the seasonality of earnings and a reduction in working capital. Within the quarter, we paid the Timberland tax deposits of approximately $875 million, funded by the issuance of a $1 billion term loan, which will mature in December 2024. As Benno outlined earlier, we are taking clear actions to improve our operating performance while maintaining cost discipline and continuing to support our brands' growth opportunities. Turning to the supply chain environment. We continue to see higher lead times across the supply chain during the quarter impact the business. In addition, higher volatility on the distribution and logistics side of things, particularly in the Americas, coupled with the higher volumes of the quarter and event driven spikes in demand, led to inconsistent on-time delivery performance to our wholesale partners and inefficiencies in support of our direct-to-consumer business in the US during parts of the quarter.Looking forward, lead times are improving as anticipated, which will lead to better on-time performance, and we're seeing that with spring deliveries. Importantly, the predictability of ex-factory dates or when the product leaves the factory is more reliable and aligned with historical performance. This is an important data point that will better position us to more fully service the business in fall of 2023 and beyond. In addition, we expect to see reduced and more normalized levels of airfreight volumes moving forward, a continued easing of ocean air rates and generally more modest FOB inflationary impacts expected for fall 2023 and spring 2024 versus what we have seen over the last few seasons. Let me take a couple of minutes to unpack our elevated inventory position today and the work we are doing to reduce it over the next few quarters.Net inventory levels are up 101% versus last year. With gross inventory, excluding the increase relating to change in eco terms to support the supply chain financing program, up 67% or approximately $850 million. Importantly, from a makeup standpoint, the dollar increase is primarily driven by core and excess replenishment inventory across brands, particularly in the Americas. This is primarily driven by COVID challenges affecting the supply chain with prolonged lead times leading to earlier and less accurate inventory buys, coupled with higher cancellations and lower demand, as well as the prior year value comparison having been lower than optimal. We expect to reduce total inventory levels by about $300 million during Q4, but will carry higher levels of core and replenishment inventory into fiscal year 2024 across Dickies, the North Face and Vans, which are contemplated in the assortment and buy plans of the next season, and which will moderate throughout the back half of calendar 2023.Moving on to the outlook for this fiscal year, we are affirming our EPS guidance at the midpoint of and our revenue outlook within the previous range. Within our revenue guidance of about 3% constant dollar growth, we now expect the North Face to be up at least 14% as the brand's broad-based momentum has continued through Q3 and into Q4. In fact, year-to-date, the brand is growing 17%. On the other hand, Vans is now projected to be down high single digits as the performance in the Americas region decelerated in Q3, and we expect Q4 will be impacted by the high inventory levels in the wholesale channel in the US particularly. On a reported basis, we now see about five points of impact from the translation of foreign currency, which is slightly less negative than our previous outlook.As a result of higher promotional and markdown activity and also reflecting higher order cancellations, we expect full year gross margins to be down about 200 basis points. We expect our operating margin to be around 9.5%. Our tax rate is expected to be 13% as we have a greater portion of the mix of regional profit from lower tax regimes, mainly in international markets. These changes lead to a tightened EPS range of $2.05 to $2.15, which sits within our previous outlook of 2 to $2.20. Our adjusted cash flow from operations, excluding the Timberland tax deposit made during Q3, is expected to be about $700 million as we continue to generate solid cash flows despite near-term setbacks in our operating performance. As we highlighted earlier in the year, we will be disciplined with our approach to spending on non-strategic areas.And today, we've moderated our projected CapEx for the year to approximately $200 million from $230 million previously as we sharpen our investment focus on value creation opportunities and specifically those things that impact the consumer experience. In summary, despite the challenges impacting our financial results this year, I'm pleased with the great progress and performance we're seeing in several of our businesses and geographies. And at the same time, the clear enterprise focus on improving our results in those areas where we are underperforming. So let me say a few words about the next fiscal year, particularly our mindset and preliminary financial expectations. First and foremost, with the heightened intensity on planning, we will sharpen our execution in order to strengthen our operating performance and deliver more profitable and consistent financial results in fiscal year 2024.We are watching very closely several factors that have a varying on our plans. The macroeconomic environment impacting consumer sentiment and spending on discretionary goods, particularly in Europe and the US. The recovery trajectory, travel and spending of the Chinese consumer as that market now fully begins to open back up. The inventory rightsizing that is happening across the marketplace. And finally, our own progress in turning around Vans, and the timing of an inflection in that business. As we focus on driving profit margin expansion during the year, we expect continue broad based growth across much of the portfolio and all geographies. And as a result we expect revenue will increase in the range of at least low single digits. As for Vans, you heard Benno reference a number of actions to sequentially advance our plans to reset and reaccelerate, some of which will impact the business more quickly and others which will take longer.In addition, our wholesale partners have adopted a more conservative approach to the Spring/Summer order book impacted both by higher inventory levels in the channel and the ongoing challenging macroeconomic environment. As a result, we will continue to see declines in the business, particularly in the Americas through the first half of fiscal year 2024. We would expect to generate low double-digit operating earnings growth with an expansion in both gross and operating margin. Our actions to increase earnings will include improving profit margins at Vans, while revenue stabilizes, generating cost savings from a more efficient supply chain and continuing to realize the benefits of our ongoing SG&amp;A optimization. We'll also benefit from the efforts to realign inventories over the next few quarters.And coupled with earnings growth, we expect to deliver meaningful increases in both operating and free cash flows in fiscal year 2024. In fact, we expect operating cash flow to grow at an accelerated rate relative to earnings. I look forward to updating you with more details when we provide our full outlook and plans in May. Our capital allocation priorities in the near to medium term will be focused on supporting and driving the performance of our current portfolio, reducing leverage and returning capital to shareholders in the form of the dividend. And today, we announced a number of strategic actions to accelerate the path to our target leverage ratios, while enhancing our focus on value creation. First, the Board has declared a dividend of $0.30 per share, were a reduction of approximately 40% relative to the last quarterly payment.An action that demonstrates the company's financial prudence, considering both an uncertain macro environment and recent inconsistent operational performance as we look to right-size the dividend to our target pay-out ration of about 50%, and accelerate the path toward gross  gross leverage target of 2.5 times. In fact to do a little math for you based on the adjustment to the dividend and the comments today about earnings growth next fiscal year, the payout ratio would be in the mid-50% range in fiscal year 2024. We will then increase the dividend in the future in line with our earnings growth. In addition, as part of our ongoing active portfolio management, we are announcing our intention to explore strategic alternatives for our Packs business, including the Kipling, Eastpak, and JanSport brands.As we take another step in streamlining and focusing our portfolio of brands. As an outcome of this process, we're committed to ensuring these brands are optimally positioned to achieve their full potential while enhancing VF's management focus on our top strategic priorities. Also, we are executing a number of asset sales, which are aligned with our strategic priorities and combined will generate more than $100 million in cash proceeds. We will reduce working capital and align inventories to optimal levels over the next few quarters. And finally, we will increase our efforts to reduce costs in order to point resources toward the company's highest value creation opportunities. This includes several previously announced cost-saving actions, which have been progressively building towards delivering approximately $225 million in annualized savings once completed in fiscal year 2024.I'm confident these actions will enable us to strengthen our financial position and sharpen our focus, specifically providing the financial flexibility to enable an accelerated path toward our target leverage metric, ensure even if facing ongoing macroeconomic challenges, we'll have continued capacity to fully support our biggest organic value creation opportunities. And finally, to continue returning cash to shareholders through the dividend. In summary, VF's brand portfolio is well positioned to deliver long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. That hasn't changed. And importantly, in the near-term, I'm confident the steps we are taking now will lead to elevated shareholder value creation through improved operating performance and consistent earnings and cash flow growth.With that, we'll open the line to your questions.See also 20 Biggest Nonalcoholic Beverage Companies in the US and 30 Largest Trading Partners of the US.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Analysts also expect revenue to climb roughly 7% to $7.39 billion.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureThe company’s stock fell dramatically in 2022, plunging 62% amid a general downturn in the tech sector, before rebounding slightly in the first month of 2023. In response, PayPal announced a $15 billion share buyback program in August and cut roughly 7% of its workforce (some 2,000 jobs) last week.Both moves suggest the company is looking to lower its operating costs ahead of a possible recession. Any form of economic slowdown would impact PayPal significantly, as the electronic payment company is closely tied to consumer purchasing power and the health of the e-commerce industry.PayPal stock rebounds in 2023datawrapper-chart-O0E0ZThe wild, wild west of mobile paymentsEven with a headstart, PayPal is struggling to compete with new players in the e-commerce transaction industry.

Recent research showed that shoppers are 19% more likely to complete a purchase with Venmo over traditional methods of payment. 🍎 Apple Pay: Considered PayPal’s biggest competitor, Apple’s payment technology surged in popularity last year. While PayPal still has a larger market share, Apple and its access to more than a billion iPhone users is closing in fast.Story continues🏦 Zelle: A bit different than its mobile payment rivals, Zelle partners with banks and credit unions in the US to make payments either directly within different banking apps or in Zelle’s standalone app. With more than 100 million eligible users, there’s a good chance you already have access to this mobile wallet.🤖 Google Pay: Android’s answer to Apple Pay, Google’s payment technology draws on the massive Android OS user base with varying levels of success. Accounting for roughly 10% of in-store mobile wallet payments, it pales in comparison to Apple Pay’s share of the market.Recent tech layoffs hit the tech world, by the numbers:1,300: Zoom, the popular web video app and quintessential pandemic brand announced plans to lay off 15% of its workforce on Feb. 8.12,000: Alphabet announced layoffs affecting just over 6% of Google’s global workforce on Jan. 20.18,000: On Jan. 31, Amazon announced a fresh wave of layoffs broadly affecting its many departments.600: Spotify announced on Jan. 23 that it would be downsizing, affecting about 6% of its employees.10,000: Microsoft announced plans to cut 5% of its global workforce on Jan. 18.

If you want to explore similar companies, you can also take a look at 5 Biggest Supply Chain Management Companies in the World.What Is Supply Chain Management?Supply chain management (SCM) is the process of coordinating and optimizing all the activities and processes required to plan, source, produce, and deliver a product or service from the beginning of its lifecycle to the end customer. SCM encompasses a wide range of activities, including supplier selection, production scheduling, inventory management, order fulfillment, delivery, and returns. SCM also includes other functions such as customer service, forecasting, and quality control.From the perspective of a business, supply chain management helps to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and create a competitive advantage in the marketplace. By having a better understanding of the whole supply chain process, companies are able to simultaneously maximize customer value, cut costs, and increase revenue, therefore driving top-line growth.How Does Supply Chain Management Work?In today's fast-paced business environment, effective Supply Chain Management (SCM) is essential in order to maintain a competitive edge. Companies are increasingly recognizing the value of managing their supply chain in order to reduce excess costs and deliver products to the consumer more quickly. This involves closely controlling their own production, distribution, sales, and the inventories of their vendors, as well as the information systems needed to direct these activities. By keeping tighter control of internal inventories, internal production, distribution, sales, and the inventories of company vendors, companies can optimize their supply chain that can help them stay ahead of the curve.The 5-Step Guide to Optimizing Your Supply ChainThe entire supply chain management process consists of five steps and a supply chain manager is responsible for the successful execution of each of these steps. A supply chain manager can be thought of as a one-man show. A supply chain manager is responsible for overseeing and managing a company's entire supply chain, including planning, sourcing, production, logistics, and reverse logistics. They are responsible for developing strategies to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the supply chain, and for ensuring that the company meets its supply chain objectives. They work closely with other departments in the organization to ensure an efficient flow of materials and products.Story continuesThe first stage is the planning stage. This involves the creation of a strategic plan for the product or service. This includes setting objectives, determining the resources needed, and creating a timeline for the project. It is important to consider the customer’s needs and preferences, as well as the competition in order to create a comprehensive plan.The sourcing stage in Supply Chain Management (SCM) involves determining the best tactics for acquiring the materials needed for manufacturing a product. This stage requires research and analysis to evaluate the various suppliers and decide on the most cost-effective and efficient way to source the necessary components. During this stage, companies may consider several factors including cost, quality, delivery time, and reliability. Additionally, companies may focus on sustainability and ethical sourcing practices, such as using eco-friendly materials and working with suppliers who treat their workers fairly. Once the sourcing strategy is in place, companies can begin to procure the necessary materials and components.The production stage is literally at the core of the supply chain management process (in the middle) however it is most certainly not the final stage. The production stage involves the manufacturing process, as well as quality control and testing. At this stage, the focus is on ensuring that goods are produced efficiently and on time, at the right cost, and to the required quality standards.Now that the product is ready to be shipped, the logistics and distribution stage involves the coordination of transportation, warehousing, and inventory management so that the goods are delivered on time and in the most cost-effective manner. This stage also includes customer service activities such as tracking orders and providing customer support. Ultimately, the goal of this stage is to ensure that the customer is satisfied with the product or service delivered.Finally, we have the most critical and final stage: reverse logistics and returns. This stage involves the processes of managing the return of products from customers, either due to defects or customer dissatisfaction. The goal of reverse logistics and returns is to optimize the process of bringing products back into circulation or disposing of them responsibly. This stage of supply chain management involves tracking the returns, evaluating the cause of the return, determining the best arrangement for the product (such as repair, remanufacture, or disposal), and then either reselling the product or disposing of it in an environmentally responsible way. It also involves communicating with customers and providing them with appropriate forms and instructions for returning the product.Photo by Jacques Dillies on UnsplashThe five stages of SCM are all essential in creating a successful business. By managing the entire process carefully, businesses can ensure that their products and services are of the highest quality and delivered on time. With the right SCM strategy, businesses can stay competitive in an ever-changing marketplace and improve their bottom line.A Prime Example of Supply Chain ManagementAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a prime example of a company that has properly executed supply chain management. The company has revolutionised the way that consumers purchase products.

These efforts have helped Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) grow to become an e-commerce giant worth $1.05 trillion, as of February 7.The Global Supply Chain Management Industry: Size and Major PlayersThe global supply chain management industry is constantly evolving to meet the needs of businesses in today's ever-changing global economy. It is a complex and dynamic industry that requires strategic planning, advanced technologies, and the utilization of resources in order to be successful. The industry is composed of a wide variety of stakeholders including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, customers, and third-party logistics providers.According to an industry analysis report by Grand View Research, the global supply chain management industry was valued at $21.12 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow to $48.58 billion by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate of 11.1% from 2023 to 2030. This growth is driven by the increasing demand for supply chain management technologies, such as cloud-based solutions, data analytics, and machine learning. Additionally, the growing need for efficient supply chain operations and improved customer service, as well as the increasing number of mergers and acquisitions, are key factors driving the growth of the market.The global supply chain management industry is benefitting from technological advances that are available today. These tech trends include the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to optimize processes, the use of blockchain technology to ensure the secure flow of goods and the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing to monitor supply chain activities. AI and ML can be used to automate processes, improve accuracy and identify trends, while blockchain allows for the secure and decentralized transfer of data. IoT can be used to monitor the supply chain and provide real-time insights to allow for more efficient operations. Additionally, the use of cloud-based software is becoming increasingly popular, allowing for easier access and management of supply chain data. Finally, digital platforms are being developed to connect buyers and suppliers more efficiently and to streamline communication. Some of the world's biggest providers of supply chain management software and solutions include International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), and Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL).

In other words, they avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.It could be safer to invest in bargain stocks that have been witnessing price momentum recently. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, is pretty useful in identifying great momentum stocks, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.Marathon Petroleum (MPC) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 4.9% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this refiner well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. MPC meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 1.9% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for MPC is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.6. This indicates that the stock moves 60% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that MPC has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped MPC earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, MPC is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. MPC is currently trading at 0.32 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 32 cents for each dollar of sales.So, MPC appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to MPC, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

NWL is expected to witness year-over-year declines in the top and bottom lines when it reports fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Feb 10, before the opening bell.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 12 cents, which suggests a decline of 71.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days. For quarterly revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $2.24 billion, indicating a decline of 20.2% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.In the last reported quarter, the Atlanta, GA-based company delivered an earnings surprise of 12.8%. Its bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 23.7%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Newell Brands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Newell Brands Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNewell Brands Inc. price-eps-surprise | Newell Brands Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteNewell has been witnessing the continued effects of the tough macro environment, reduced inventory, inflationary pressures and the impact of a stronger dollar. The company’s sales for the to-be-reported quarter are likely to have been affected by the adverse impacts of the sale of the Connected Home &amp; Security (CH&amp;S) business, unfavorable foreign currency, and exit of its category and retail store. The company is also expected to have been affected by the significant inflation in food, housing and energy, leading to reduced consumer discretionary spending.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected the aforementioned headwinds to persist in the near term. Newell also predicted the discretionary spending levels to remain constrained.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management envisioned fourth-quarter 2022 net sales to be $2.18-$2.26 billion, with a core sales decline of 9-12%. For the quarter, the company expects a normalized operating margin of 5.1-6.5% and normalized earnings of 9-14 cents per share. The guidance includes the impacts of unfavorable foreign currency, closures of Yankee Candle stores, and the exit of certain product categories, particularly in the Outdoor &amp; Recreation, and Home Appliances segments.Moreover, the company expects 2022 results to reflect the adverse impacts of unfavorable foreign currency and inflation. It anticipates net sales of $9.35-$9.43 billion, with core sales expected to decline 3-4% in 2022, excluding the contribution from the CH&amp;S business. The company anticipates a normalized operating margin of 10-10.3%. Normalized earnings per share are forecast to be $1.56-$1.61 for 2022.However, Newell has been benefiting from the actions to accelerate productivity and efficiency by accelerating fuel productivity plans, driving automation and fully implementing Project Ovid. Increased focus on revenue growth management, aggressive efforts to reduce SKU and supply network optimization are expected to have aided the fourth-quarter performance. Also, the company’s stringent cost-cutting plans, such as rightsizing overhead costs based on the simplification agenda, are likely to have boosted margins and the bottom line to some extent.Newell’s fourth-quarter results are expected to reflect the positive effects of leveraging its robust e-commerce capabilities, which have been strong for some time due to the increasing shifts to the online platform. The company has been strengthening its e-commerce business via increased investments and better customer engagement. Continued digital penetration, driven by expanded omnichannel capabilities, is likely to have supported the top line in the fourth quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Newell this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.

(Reuters) -U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen touted clean energy investments on Wednesday at a Tennessee electric vehicle battery plant benefiting from tax incentives in President Joe Biden's signature climate legislation, adding that she supports Europe's plans for competing subsidies.Yellen told reporters at the Ultium Cells LLC factory under construction near Nashville that the United States and Europe needed to work together to lessen their dependence on China for EV batteries and critical minerals.""If Europe takes action to put in place subsidies similar to ours, this is good climate policy. And there's plenty of business for all of us to be able to benefit from the clean energy transition,"" Yellen told reporters.Her trip to the Ultium plant, a joint venture of General Motors and LG Energy Solution, comes a day after she heard more pleas from French and German ministers not to exclude their companies from tax incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act.In his State of the Union address Tuesday night that served as blueprint for an expected 2024 re-election bid, Biden said the act, passed only by his fellow Democrats last year, would help rebuild the U.S. manufacturing base.

The airline industry is one of the most complicated industries to predict on Wall Street. Like most industries, airlines have inputs and outputs, the sum of which ultimately leads to profitability or large losses. Over the past few years, airlines have had to contend with the following:·      A Global Pandemic: Shrank demand to nearly zero and decreased the number of employees.·      Complex Geopolitical Circumstances: The War in Ukraine drove crude oil prices to near triple digits before pulling back last year.·      Lack of Skilled Employees: Many pilots in the industry aged, some quit, and others were laid off during the pandemic.·      Outdated Airplanes: Supply chain issues and delays due to safety concerns from aircraft manufacturersled to a lack of airplanes.Despite the many challenges mentioned above, the airline industry is showing signs of life.Clear Skies Ahead?Below I will lay out 5 reasons why the tough times experienced by airlines in recent years may finally be over:1.   A Return to Profitability: International airlines survived massive losses during the pandemic and are now back to earning healthy profits. For example, United Airlines lost $28 per share in 2020. In 2022, UAL made $2.50 per share.Panamanian airline Copa Holdings and other international airlines show a similar EPS trajectory.2.   Rising EPS Estimates: Airline providers such as American Airlines, Ryanair and United have rising consensus estimates moving forward. AAL and UAL also have positive Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) scores suggesting that they are likely to surprise earnings to the upside the next time they report. Delta is one of the few airline stocks with a negative ESP score. That said, Delta is coming off a blockbuster quarter where EPS rocketed 573%.Story continues4.   Recovery to Pre-pandemic Levels: Recently, Boeing Ceo Dave Calhoun confirmed his aspirations to return to pre-pandemic aircraft production levels. Airline giants like United are planning to hire thousands of pilots in 2023 to increase staff – with no training capacity constraints. Meanwhile, air travel occupancy levels have recovered fully.5.   Drastically Improving Technical Picture: Uptrend Resumed: After five failed attempts to re-take the 200-day moving average in the past two years, the JETS ETF decisively broke above the line in 2023 – signaling a distinct change in character.Post Earnings Drift Potential / Bull Flags: Because markets are inefficient, stocks tend to trend after reporting stellar earnings like most airlines just did. Stocks like UAL rocketed higher in early 2023 and have been consolidating and digesting gains in a bullish manner since.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Knights that Beat The Market Last 5 Years. With the S&amp;P 500 gaining 8.89% this year so far, the US stock market is showing signs of recovery. According to a recent report by Morgan Stanley, stocks could have a strong first half of the year despite lingering recession fears. However, the report also mentions that earnings may fall throughout the year. In these fluctuating conditions, investors rely on dividend-focused stocks to ensure regular means of income.During the previous inflationary periods, dividend stocks held up well in comparison with other asset classes. Dividends represented 40% of the market since the 1940s and the ratio increased during decades when inflation was higher, as reported by Hartford Funds. The report also revealed the performance of dividend stocks in the 1970s, when they represented 73% of the S&amp;P 500 returns. Various other reports show that dividends usually grow faster than inflation. One such research was carried out by Fidelity International which revealed that since 1900, the 10-year annual average growth in dividends across the S&amp;p 500 outpaced CPI growth nearly 73% of the time.Companies with strong dividend growth tracks and solid returns become investors’ choices as they prepare them for challenging periods. In addition to this, investors also pay attention to the company’s cash flow generation and sound balance sheet, which warrant future dividend payouts. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP), and Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL) are some major companies that managed to raise their dividends for decades and also outperformed the broader market over the years. In this article, we will further discuss dividend knights that beat the market last five years.Story continues15 Dividend Knights that Beat The Market Last 5 YearsPhoto by Nick Chong on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend companies that have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the past five years.

S&amp;P and Moody’s have roughly equal market shares and rate more than 90% of all bonds worldwide. The service provides high value for the cost. A company that chooses to issue debt without a rating will pay an interest rate that could be higher by half of a percent. The cost of a higher interest rate far exceeds any savings gained by not using the services of S&amp;P.We think of S&amp;P as a toll road that earns fees from its customers in exchange for cost-effective access to capital. As such, the company has extraordinary margins and pricing power and requires little of its own capital to grow. Even after fully reinvesting in its business, S&amp;P still has an excess of cash.

The company is witnessing a slowdown in its cloud business and declining videogame sales were headwinds. Decrease in Xbox content and services and Xbox hardware hurt gaming sales due to a decline in first-party content. Increasing spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space from Amazon is likely to dent margins.However, Microsoft’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 results benefitted from consistent execution across renewal sales motions, including strong recapture rates and growth in Azure commitments on a high prior year comparable, partially offset by the slowdown in growth of new standalone business.Revenues benefited from slow yet steady performance of Office 365 and Dynamics.

COST, The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX, Target Corp. TGT and Burlington Stores, Inc. BURL.Industry: Retail - Discount StoresLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2050818/4-retail-discount-stocks-that-warrant-attention-despite-industry-woesOngoing inflation, tight labor market and supply chain issues are some of the headwinds that players in the Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry have been encountering lately. Also, rising prices are squeezing consumers’ disposable income, depleting personal savings and dampening demand. With the desperate need to tame inflation, the Federal Reserve is raising the benchmark interest rate. But a higher interest rate environment is not good news for consumer-centric industries.That said, industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, adding more compelling products, and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Inventory management, supply-chain enhancement, cost-structure realignment and investment to accelerate digitization have been working in favor of companies like Costco Wholesale Corp., The TJX Companies, Inc., Target Corp. and Burlington Stores, Inc.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry comprises companies that offer apparel, accessories, footwear, beauty products, personal and baby care products, cleaning products, pet supplies, and food and beverage products at lower prices than traditional retail outlets. The industry participants also provide home textiles, home furnishings, housewares, arts and crafts supplies, toys and seasonal décor products.These companies sell their products through stores, digital channels, or both. Some industry players operate membership shopping warehouse clubs, offering branded and private-label products in a range of merchandise categories. Most discount stores are gradually emerging as one-stop shopping destinations. The profitability of players depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain and an effective merchandising strategy.Story continues4 Key Industry Trends to WatchPressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail-discount space highly competitive. This has compelled a number of players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs.Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation, a tight labor market and supply-chain issues. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks as well as adopting effective pricing policies.Consumer Confidence Slackens: Escalating prices and rising interest rates continue to pose a threat to consumer spending activity and confidence. Per Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index nudged down to 107.1 in January from December’s upwardly revised reading of 109.0. Undoubtedly, the industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. But rising prices have been discomforting family budgets. The consumer price index rose to 6.5% in December 2022 on a year-over-year basis, albeit at a slower rate when compared with November.Consumers Seek Better Bargains: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers in the low-to-middle income groups who have been seeking both value and convenience amid rising prices. Industry participants have been focusing on creating innovative and compelling products as well as enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. They are trying to tap any surge in demand unless derailed by elevated inflation. We also believe that failure to restock inventory at fair prices or delay getting the products delivered to consumers’ doorsteps could compound retailers’ woes.Digitization is Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives such as building omni-channel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at store are worth mentioning.Simultaneously, companies are investing in the renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector.

295,2306e1cb-f0e4-391c-a548-6383ec1c37a3,ISRG,2023-02-09,Here's What's Concerning About Intuitive Surgical's (NASDAQ:ISRG) Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-whats-concerning-intuitive-surgicals-110023877.html,1675940423.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Intuitive Surgical:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.14 = US$1.6b ÷ (US$13b - US$1.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, Intuitive Surgical has an ROCE of 14%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Medical Equipment industry average of 11% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical roceIn the above chart we have measured Intuitive Surgical's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Intuitive Surgical.The Trend Of ROCEOn the surface, the trend of ROCE at Intuitive Surgical doesn't inspire confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 21%, but since then they've fallen to 14%. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesIn Conclusion...To conclude, we've found that Intuitive Surgical is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Since the stock has gained an impressive 78% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.If you're still interested in Intuitive Surgical it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation  to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.While Intuitive Surgical isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

This compares to earnings of $2.12 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.28%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of $3.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.53, delivering a surprise of 1.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Monolithic , which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry, posted revenues of $460.01 million for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.02%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $336.5 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Monolithic shares have added about 32.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 8.5%.What's Next for Monolithic?While Monolithic has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Monolithic: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.90 on $451.36 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $13.01 on $1.97 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed is currently in the bottom 36% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Analog Devices (ADI), has yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2023. The results are expected to be released on February 15.This semiconductor maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +34%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.Analog Devices' revenues are expected to be $3.14 billion, up 17% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 15. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis semiconductor maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +34%.Revenues are expected to be $3.14 billion, up 17% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.45% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Analog Devices?For Analog Devices, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.96%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Analog Devices will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Analog Devices would post earnings of $2.58 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.73, delivering a surprise of +5.81%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Analog Devices doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For instance, the price of Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) stock is up an impressive 113% over the last five years. It's also good to see the share price up 13% over the last quarter. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 10% in 90 days).So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Analog Devices achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 19% per year.

You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Analog Devices, it has a TSR of 134% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Analog Devices shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 9.7% over one year. That's including the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 19% per year, is even more impressive. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

All the banks have committed to stop lending to new coal-fired power plants.Japan's second largest bank by assets was getting most of its new energy funding opportunities in the renewable energy sector, followed by hydrogen, Kannan said, adding that the group would progressively reduce exposure to gas-related transactions.A February 2022 report by 28 non-governmental organisations showed SMBC's rivals Mizuho and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) were the biggest financiers of the global coal industry, which received $373 billion in loans in nearly three years ending November 2021.SMBC's bigger rival MUFG has since halted financing new coal mines, but has not laid out its funding policy for existing mine expansion. Smaller lender Mizuho Financial said last year it would stop lending to new clients who are pure-play coal miners.Kannan said decisions on offering financial support to carbon capture were ""not easy"" as it would still mean developing a coal-based utility, but called ammonia co-firing a ""good option"" provided power generated from coal was quickly displaced by ammonia.""Big picture, we are focused on our finance emissions targets.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the world, is up 48% this year.But CNBC’s Jim Cramer isn’t a fan.Don’t miss'Hold onto your money': Jeff Bezos issued a financial warning, says you might want to rethink buying a 'new automobile, refrigerator, or whatever' — here are 3 better recession-proof buysRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwindsHere's how much money the average middle-class American household makes — how do you stack up?“The charts, as interpreted by Carley Garner, suggest you need to ignore the crypto cheerleaders now that bitcoin’s bouncing,” he says, referencing analysis from DeCarley Trading’s senior commodity market strategist and broker Carley Garner.Some say that cryptocurrencies can be used as a hedge against inflation. Bitcoin, for instance, can’t be printed out of thin air like fiat money. The number of bitcoins is capped at 21 million by mathematical algorithms.Cramer, however, suggests using something much older to fight inflation.“If you seriously want a real hedge against inflation or economic chaos, she [Garner] says you should stick with gold. And I agree,” the Mad Money host says.Of course, if you’ve been following Cramer, you’d already know that he hasn’t been optimistic about the crypto world lately.“The manipulation higher of crypto shows you this is truly a sham market,” he tweeted earlier in January.If you share Cramer’s view and want to use gold as a hedge against inflation and uncertainty, here are three ways to gain exposure to the shiny metal.BullionInvesting in gold has been considered the go-to inflation-fighting move.It can also be a great hedge against uncertainty, as the value of gold is largely unaffected by economic events around the world.And because of the precious metal’s safe-haven status, investors often rush toward it in times of crisis, making it an effective hedge.Story continuesThe first method to invest in gold is the most straightforward one: if you want to own gold, just buy gold.Most bullion shops carry a selection of gold bars and coins, so you can always find something that fits your investment needs. Just remember, if you want to invest in a large amount of gold and don’t want to keep the stash at home, you will likely need to pay for storage at a vault.Read more: Goldman Sachs says bitcoin is not investable — this is where they think you should put 33% of your wealth insteadGold mining companiesWhen the price of gold goes up, your gold bars and coins will be worth more. But gold mining companies can also benefit in such a scenario.Barrick Gold, for instance, is a gold and copper producer operating mines and projects in 18 countries in North and South America, Africa, Papua New Guinea and Saudi Arabia. In 2021, the company produced 4.4 million ounces of gold and generated net earnings of $2.0 billion.There’s also Newmont (NYSE:NEM), another heavyweight player in the gold mining industry and the only gold producer in the S&amp;P 500. Its portfolio of assets span North and South America, Australia, and Africa. The company also produces copper, silver, zinc and lead.Higher gold prices can allow miners to earn higher revenues and profits, which could translate to higher share prices. However, each company is different so make sure to do your research and find the ones that can keep costs down and run efficient operations.ETFsExchange-traded funds have risen in popularity in recent years. They trade on stock exchanges, so buying and selling them is very convenient.Investors can use them to get a piece of the gold action, too.The most well-known ETF in this space is the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEARCA:GLD), which is designed to track the price of gold. GLD is backed by physical gold bullion sitting at its vaults and has an expense ratio of 0.40%.The iShares Gold Trust (NYSEARCA:IAU) is another ETF that allows investors to easily track the price of the yellow metal. It holds gold bullion — just like GLD — but has a lower expense ratio at 0.25%.There are also ETFs that provide exposure to gold mining companies.For instance, the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX) tracks the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index. It has a portfolio of gold mining stocks, with Newmont and Barrick Gold as its two largest holdings.GDX has an expense ratio of 0.51%.A better way to buy gold?Of course, those aren't the only ways to gain exposure to the yellow metal.A Gold IRA, for example, is a type of individual retirement account that allows you to invest in gold and other precious metals in physical forms, such as coins, instead of stocks, mutual funds and other traditional investments.It’s a great alternative because unlike the U.S. dollar, which has lost 98% of its purchasing power since 1971, gold’s purchasing power remains more stable over time.Opting for a Gold IRA gives you the opportunity to both diversify your portfolio and stabilize your finances.If you want to open a Gold IRA, there are reputable services that’ll let you roll over your current 401(k) or IRA into this new account — and quickly.This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

That's really the core question for this year,"" said Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin, adding that he felt the decline so far had been ""distorted"" by some falling goods prices.Crude prices eased, with gold firmer as the dollar index fell 0.18%, while MSCI's U.S.-centric index of stock performance in 47 countries shed 0.44%.The market is confused as it thought it understood, despite the Fed's rhetoric, that the U.S. central bank was very close to ending its rate-hiking cycle, said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.In addition, the closely watched inversion of the yield difference between short- and longer-dated Treasuries, which occurs when the two-year's yield is higher than that of the 10-year note, is a cause for concern, Krosby said.""Look at the inverted yield curve, it's steepened. We stare at it and we want to believe it's different this time,"" she said.""All this together, underpinned by a yield curve that is shouting, shouting recession coming. The market has to respect that, it may not agree with it, but it has to respect it.""The gap between two- and 10-year yields remained inverted at -82.3 bps, after steepening to -87.5 bps earlier in the session.The two-year rose 3.4 basis points to 4.488% after hitting an almost 10-week high of 4.514%Story continuesGRAPHIC: Inverted U.S. Treasury curve a harbinger of recession - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zdvxoemlrpx/US0707.pngFutures priced in the Fed's target rate to peak at 5.15% in July, about 25 basis points higher than last week, and by December showed the key rate will have declined to just 4.86%, or some 40 bps more than a week ago when the market expected a rate cut.""There's this belief we can still have a strong economy, a strong labor market and that inflation will continue to decline,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.However, getting inflation down to the Fed's 2% target could easily take more than a year as energy prices may remain elevated, a fact making some in the market nervous, he said.""There's going to be a rude awakening at some point and that you're going to need to see something break to get inflation all the way back down,"" Moya said.Data again showed a tight U.S. labor market even as the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week, news that helped set aside concerns that interest rates will stay higher for longer.In the latest move by major central banks, Sweden's Riksbank on Thursday raised its key interest rate by half a percentage point to 3%, and forecast further tightening in the spring.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.73%, the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.88% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.02%.German consumer prices, harmonized to compare with other European Union countries, rose by a less-than-expected 9.2% on the year in January, helping reassure markets that prices have peaked.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.62%, rebounding from an earlier decline, while Japan's Nikkei eased 0.08%.China's blue chips rose 1.3%, pulling away from a one-month trough, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 1.6%.Barclays upgraded their forecast of China's economic growth to 5.3% this year, from 4.8% previously, with Fitch also revising its forecast up to 5%. Both cited an accelerated recovery in consumer spending.Crude prices eased as oil infrastructure appeared to have escaped serious damage from the earthquake that devastated parts of Turkey and Syria, while U.S. inventories swelled and investors worried about central bank rate hikes.U.S. crude futures settled down 41 cents at $78.06 a barrel, and Brent fell 59 cents to settle at $84.50 a barrel.Gold prices rose for a fourth straight session as the dollar faltered, even as Fed officials indicated more rate hikes are warranted to rein in inflation.

Phoenix residents, tourists, public safety agencies and businesses throughout the Valley area will benefit from Verizon’s network investments long after the clock runs out on Super Bowl LVII. In 2022, Verizon deployed 5G Ultra Wideband in many areas throughout Phoenix, adding coverage and capacity to serve customers throughout the Valley and neighboring cities like Tempe, Chandler and Scottsdale. These upgrades include bringing wireless home and business internet to the area, which has provided additional choice for customers in the Valley and has been incredibly popular to date.Throughout State Farm Stadium, Verizon’s customers will be served with a highly complex and sophisticated in-building network, providing game-changing performance for fans to capture and share every important moment of the game when connected.

This partnership extends beyond the Super Bowl to the NFL Draft, Pro Bowl and Kickoff events. Since the partnership began, there have been more than 120 community events and 253,000 trees planted. In addition to participating in community greening events in Arizona leading up to Super Bowl LVII, Verizon will plant 10,700 trees in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests, which were decimated by the Wallow fire in 2011. Overall, Verizon has planted 13.9 million trees since 2009, and plans to plant 20 million trees by 2030.Verizon also continues to tackle the digital divide and promote digital equity in the greater Phoenix area.

Twelve of those schools have received a Verizon Innovative Learning Lab, providing students and teachers with access to emerging technologies – such as virtual reality equipment, 3D printing stations, augmented reality apps and more in a custom-designed, state-of-the-art experiential learning environment, with the latest being unveiled recently at Glendale Elementary School District’s Sunset Vista School.That community-centric approach continues this week: Verizon will be collaborating with Valley of the Sun United Way to welcome over 80 Title-I students to a Feb. 9 Super STEM Digital Equity Day at Arizona State University’s Verizon 5G Innovation Hub. In addition to inspiring the next generation of STEM students, the event will highlight Verizon’s partnership with ASU, as well as the myriad ways Phoenix-area students can thrive on our 5G network.

Excluding a 380 basis point headwind from currency due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar, revenue declined approximately 2% versus last year.Gross profit totaled $1.39 billion, while gross margin was 68.6%, which benefited from lower freight expense of 130 basis points, as well as operational improvements, partially offset by an FX headwind of 100 basis points. This compared to prior year gross profit of $1.46 billion, representing a gross margin of 68.1%.SG&amp;A expenses totaled $971 million and represented 47.9% of sales. This compared to reported SG&amp;A expenses in the prior year period of $995 million, which represented 46.5% of sales. On a non-GAAP basis, SG&amp;A expenses were $981 million, or 45.8% of sales in the prior year period.Operating income was $418 million, while operating margin was 20.6%. The Company’s operating margin was negatively impacted by an FX headwind of approximately 120 basis points. This compared to reported operating income of $463 million and operating margin of 21.6% in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, prior year operating income was $476 million, while operating margin was 22.2%.Net interest expense was $8 million compared to $16 million in the year-ago period.Other income was $7 million in the quarter, primarily due to an FX gain associated with the movement of the U.S. Dollar within the quarter. This compared to $3 million of other expense in the prior year period.Extinguishment of debt in the prior year period was a loss of $54 million on a reported basis due to costs associated with the cash tender completed in the second fiscal quarter of fiscal 2022. There were no charges associated with debt extinguishment in the current year.Net income was $330 million, with earnings per diluted share of $1.36. This compared to reported net income of $318 million and earnings per diluted share of $1.15 in the prior year period. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $368 million with earnings per diluted share of $1.33 in the prior year period. The tax rate for the quarter was 20.9%, as compared to the prior year period tax rate of 18.5% and 19.5% on a reported and non-GAAP basis, respectively.Balance Sheet and Cash Flow HighlightsCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $846 million and total borrowings outstanding were $1.67 billion.Inventory at quarter-end was $976 million, consistent with expectations, versus ending inventory of $750 million a year ago. The Company remains on track to end the fiscal year with inventory up single digits versus prior year.Free cash flow for the second quarter was an inflow of $552 million compared to an inflow of $608 million in the prior year. This included CapEx and implementation costs related to Cloud Computing of $102 million versus $47 million a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow was an inflow of $354 million compared to an inflow of $596 million in the prior year. This included CapEx and implementation costs related to Cloud Computing of $149 million versus $83 million a year ago.Fiscal Year 2023 OutlookThe Company is raising its Fiscal 2023 earnings outlook based on its operational outperformance in the second fiscal quarter, as well as favorability associated with a more moderate currency headwind than previously anticipated. These benefits are partially offset by a more modest revenue growth assumption for Greater China. Of note, Greater China has shown a meaningful sequential improvement quarter-to-date in Fiscal Q3.Tapestry now expects the following for Fiscal 2023, which replaces all previous guidance:Revenue of approximately $6.6 billion, representing a slight decrease compared to the prior year due to approximately 300 basis points of FX pressure. On a constant currency basis, revenue is expected to grow approximately 2% to 3% over the prior year.Net interest expense of approximately $30 to $35 million;Tax rate of approximately 20%;Weighted average diluted share count of approximately 242 million shares, incorporating approximately $700 million of expected share repurchases;Earnings per diluted share of approximately $3.70 to $3.75, reflecting an increase to the previous outlook and a high-single-digit growth rate compared to the prior year on a non-GAAP basis despite a currency headwind of approximately $0.40.The Company's outlook assumes the following:No further appreciation of the U.S. Dollar; information provided based on spot rates at the time of forecast;Continued gradual recovery in Greater China from Covid-related disruption; no further significant lockdowns or incremental supply chain pressures from the Covid-19 pandemic;No material worsening of inflationary pressures or consumer confidence; andNo benefit from the potential reinstatement of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).Given the dynamic nature of these and other external factors, financial results could differ materially from the outlook provided.Conference Call DetailsThe Company will host a conference call to review these results at 8:00 a.m. (ET) today, February 9, 2023.

The Company's management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, the non-GAAP measures utilized by the Company may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The financial information presented above, as well as SG&amp;A expense ratio, and operating margin, have been presented both including and excluding Acceleration Program and Debt Extinguishment costs for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2022. There were no items affecting comparability in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2023.The Company operates on a global basis and reports financial results in U.S. dollars in accordance with GAAP. Percentage increases/decreases in net sales for the Company and each segment have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects from translating foreign-denominated sales into U.S. dollars and compared to the same periods in the prior quarter and fiscal year. The Company calculates constant currency net sales results by translating current period net sales in local currency using the prior year period’s currency conversion rate. Approximately 10% earnings growth compared to last year despite $0.11 of currency neutral headwinds is calculated by taking the Q2FY23 Diluted EPS of $1.36, plus the negative foreign currency impact of $0.11, compared to Q2FY22 non-GAAP Diluted EPS of $1.33.Net sales changes for the Company and each segment are based on absolute sales dollar changes and are not presented in accordance with the Company’s comparable sales definition utilized historically due to the uncertain business environment resulting from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.Management utilizes these non-GAAP and constant currency measures to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods affected and to make decisions about Company resources and performance. The Company believes presenting these non-GAAP measures, which exclude items that are not comparable from period to period, is useful to investors and others in evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating and financial results in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance and understanding how such results compare with the Company’s historical performance. Additionally, the Company believes presenting these metrics on a constant currency basis will help investors and analysts to understand the effect of significant year-over-year foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on these performance measures and provide a framework to assess how business is performing and expected to perform excluding these effects.Schedule 4: Condensed Consolidated Balance SheetsTAPESTRY, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETSAt December 31, 2022 and July 2, 2022(in millions) (unaudited)(audited)December 31, 2022July 2, 2022ASSETS   Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments$846.2$953.2Receivables 252.8  252.3Inventories 975.8 994.2Other current assets 423.8  374.1Total current assets 2,498.6 2,573.8Property and equipment, net 571.1  544.4Lease right-of-use assets 1,358.8 1,281.6Other noncurrent assets 2,829.2  2,865.5Total assets$7,257.7$7,265.3LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY   Accounts payable$436.7$520.7Accrued liabilities 594.2  628.2Short-term lease liabilities 282.7 288.7Current debt 25.0  31.2Total current liabilities 1,338.6 1,468.8Long-term debt 1,647.5  1,659.2Long-term lease liabilities 1,348.4 1,282.3Other liabilities 610.0  569.5Stockholders' equity 2,313.2 2,285.5Total liabilities and stockholders' equity$7,257.7 $7,265.3 Schedule 5: Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash FlowsTAPESTRY, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWSFor the Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022(in millions) (unaudited)(unaudited)December 31, 2022January 1, 2022Cash Flows from Operating Activities   Net income$525.2  $544.8 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash flows from operating activities:  Depreciation and amortization 88.6   99.6 Loss on extinguishment of debt -   53.7 Other non-cash items  30.1   49.6 Changes in operating assets and liabilities (181.5)  (79.6)Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 462.4   668.1     Cash Flows from Investing Activities   Purchases of property and equipment (108.8)  (71.7)Purchase of investments (4.3)  (502.3)Other items 193.7   118.3 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 80.6   (455.7)    Cash Flows from Financing Activities   Dividend payments (144.2)  (137.5)Repurchase of common stock (300.0)  (750.0)Proceeds from issuance of debt, net of discount -   498.5 Payment of debt extinguishment costs -   (50.7)Repayment of debt (18.8)  (500.0)Repayment of revolving credit facility -   - Other items (41.7)  (12.4)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (504.7)  (952.1)Effect of exchange rate on cash and cash equivalents 2.1   (10.6)    Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents 40.4   (750.3)Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period$789.8  $2,007.7 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period$830.2  $1,257.4  Schedule 6: Store Count by BrandTAPESTRY, INC.STORE COUNTAt October 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022(unaudited) As ofAs ofDirectly-Operated Store Count:October 1, 2022Openings(Closures)December 31, 2022Coach    North America 341 1 (1) 341International 608 7 (3) 612 Kate Spade    North America 207 1 - 208International 192 3 (3) 192 Stuart Weitzman    North America 38 - (1) 37International 60 2 - 62 TAPESTRY, INC.STORE COUNTAt July 2, 2022 and December 31, 2022(unaudited) As ofAs ofDirectly-Operated Store Count:July 2, 2022Openings(Closures)December 31, 2022Coach    North America 343 2 (4) 341International 602 17 (7) 612 Kate Spade    North America 207 1 - 208International 191 6 (5) 192 Stuart Weitzman    North America 39 - (2) 37International 61 2 (1) 62 View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230209005109/en/ContactsTapestry, Inc.Media: Andrea Shaw ResnickChief Communications Officer212/629-2618aresnick@tapestry.com Analysts and Investors: Christina ColoneGlobal Head of Investor Relations212/946-7252ccolone@tapestry.com Kelsey Mueller212/946-8183Director of Investor Relationskmueller@tapestry.com]"

TPR may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Tapestry is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for TPR in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.30 per share for TPR, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for TPR, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.82% heading into earnings season.Tapestry, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseTapestry, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseTapestry, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Tapestry, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that TPR has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Tapestry, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on NVIDIA's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for NVIDIA How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NVIDIA is:28% = US$6.0b ÷ US$21b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.28 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.NVIDIA's Earnings Growth And 28% ROETo begin with, NVIDIA has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 18% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, NVIDIA's considerable five year net income growth of 23% was to be expected.Next, on comparing NVIDIA's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 28% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if NVIDIA is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is NVIDIA Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?NVIDIA has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 7.1%, meaning that it has the remaining 93% left over to reinvest into its business. So it looks like NVIDIA is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Additionally, NVIDIA has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 2.5% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in NVIDIA's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 53%, over the same period.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that NVIDIA's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Core Illumina Sequencing Consumable revenues totaled $687 million in the reported quarter, down 13% year over year.Sequencing Instrument revenues for core Illumina were $146 million, down 24% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. The decline was primarily due to lower NovaSeq 6000 shipments in advance of the availability of NovaSeq X. The decline was partially offset by another quarter of record NextSeq 1000/2000 shipments.Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseIllumina, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Illumina, Inc. Quote Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenues were $131 million, up 24% year over year on higher instrument service contract revenues on a growing installed base and an increase in oncology and IBD partnership revenue.GRAIL contributed $23 million to revenues during the reported quarter.MarginsThe adjusted gross margin (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) was 66.5% in the reported quarter, highlighting a contraction of 505 basis points (bps) year over year.Story continuesResearch and development expenses plunged 1.1% year over year to $346 million, whereas selling, general &amp; administrative expenses rose 1.4% to $432 million. These pulled up adjusted operating costs by 0.3% to $778 million.Adjusted operating loss in the quarter was $58 million against the prior-year quarter’s adjusted operating income of $81 million.Financial UpdateIllumina exited 2022 with cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments of $2.04 billion compared with $1.34 billion at the end of 2021.The company did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter.Cumulative net cash used in operating activities at the end of 2022 was $39.2 million compared with $54.5 million a year ago.2023 GuidanceFor 2023, Illumina expects its consolidated revenue growth in the range of 7 to 10% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $4.99 billion.The company expects adjusted EPS for 2023 in the range of $1.25 to $1.50. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $2.26.Core Illumina revenue growth is expected in the range of 6-9%. GRAIL revenues are expected to be in the range of $90 million to $110 million.Our TakeIllumina ended 2022 on a mixed note with lower-than-expected earnings and revenues beat. The year-over-year performance remained sluggish. Sequencing instruments revenue for core Illumina declined due to delayed recruitment for some large research projects in the Americas and Europe, the ongoing impact of COVID disruptions in China, the year-over-year impact of customer inventory management, the anticipated decline in COVID surveillance revenues and headwinds from foreign exchange rates. The base business in regions was impacted by anticipation for NovaSeq X and the slowdown in COVID surveillance and research. Contraction in gross margin is discouraging.On a positive note, Illumina registered another quarter of record NextSeq 1000/2000 shipments as the company continues to witness strong adoption. Further, Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue rose year-over-year, driven primarily by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base as well as an increase in oncology and IBD partnership revenue.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksIllumina currently carries Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Neogen Corporation NEOG, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

However, on a year-over-year basis, earnings and sales both declined. The massive decline in COVID-19 product sales and severe foreign exchange headwind impacted overall performance. Escalating costs and the contraction of gross margin operating margin is a concern.On a positive note, the ongoing double-digit sales growth in the non-COVID product portfolio, a high level of profitability and strong cash flow are the major upsides. The QIAcuity digital PCR system delivered solid double-digit CER growth for fiscal 2022, supported by the launch of new assays for biopharma applications.

The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.9%.Quarter in DetailPharmacy Services revenues were up 11.2% to $43.75 billion in the reported quarter. The upside was primarily driven by increased pharmacy claims volume, and growth in specialty pharmacy and brand inflation, partially offset by continued client price improvements.Total pharmacy claims processed rose 3.1% on a 30-day equivalent basis, attributable to net new business, increased utilization and the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season, partially offset by a decrease in COVID-19 vaccinations.

The impressive growth was driven by increased prescription and front store volume, including the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season compared to the prior year, pharmacy drug mix and brand inflation. However, this growth was partially offset by a decline in COVID-19 diagnostic testing and vaccinations, the impact of recent generic introductions and continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure.Story continuesWithin the Health Care Benefits segment, the company registered revenues worth $23.03 billion in the fourth quarter, up 11.3% year over year.MarginTotal cost (including Benefit Costs) rose 11.2% to $70.03 billion in the fourth quarter. Gross profit rose 1.2% to $13.81 billion.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings is pegged at $8.84.The company has also issued its full-year operating cash flow projection in the range of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion.Our TakeCVS Health exited the fourth quarter of 2022 on a strong note, with earnings and revenues beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Robust sales growth across all three operating segments drove the top-line results. Within the Health Care Benefits arm, the continued growth across the entire range of insured and self-insured medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health products and services instills optimism. Meanwhile, the company’s parallel announcement of entering into a colossal $10.6-billion acquisition agreement to purchase Oak Street Health is an added positive. Oak Street Health is a network of value-based primary care centers for adults on Medicare. The acquisition is expected to further advance CVS Health’s care delivery strategy for consumers.However, the contraction of margins on escalating costs does not bode well. The decline in COVID-19 vaccinations and testing sales is a downside.

The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.1%.The top-line improvement primarily resulted from strength in U.S. revenues and revenues outside the United States (All other countries).Full-year revenues were $407.9 million, reflecting a 74.7% surge from the comparable 2021 period. The metric topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.05%.Segment DetailsInspire Medical’s operations consist of two geographic regions — the United States and All other countries.For the quarter under review, U.S. revenues of $134.3 million reflected an increase of 78% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis.

Robust improvement of the top-line and bottom-line results in the reported quarter was impressive. Strength in year-over-year geographic results was promising. The activation of new U.S. centers and the creation of new U.S. sales territories during the reported quarter also look encouraging. Management’s expectations of activating more U.S. medical centers and adding new U.S. sales territories during each of the quarters of 2023 also raise our optimism about the stock.However, the rising operating costs putting pressure on the gross margin, thus leading to its contraction, is worrying.Zacks Rank and Key PicksInspire Medical currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

They’ve dreamed of being able to inhabit a realistic version of the famous Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, sipping butterbeers at the Gryffindor dormitory in between jaunts to the nearby village of Hogsmeade.Most Read from BloombergUS Says 3 Mystery Objects Likely Private, With No China LinkAmerica's Priciest Neighborhoods Are Changing as the Ultra-Rich Move to FloridaNew Cars Are Only for the Rich Now as Automakers Rake In ProfitsGunman Kills Three at Michigan State; Suspect Found DeadUS Scrambles Jets for ‘Routine’ Intercept of Russian WarplanesThat vision will become a reality on Friday when Hogwarts Legacy is released by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The game is one of the most highly anticipated of 2023 and if pre-orders are any indication, it will likely be one of the most profitable, too. But the views about transgender people espoused by J.K. Rowling, the author of the original book series, have cast a shadow over the launch and left some longtime fans wondering whether they’ll even play it. Many say they’ve struggled to reconcile their love of the fantasy world to which they’ve become so attached with the real-world politics of its creator.The J.K. Rowling Transphobia ControversyRowling began to promulgate views that were widely perceived as transphobic in 2018, “liking” a post on Twitter that said trans women are “men in dresses,” and following certain commentators who described transgender women as men. Then, in the summer of 2020, Rowling wrote a 3,700-word essay on sex and gender issues, saying she refused to “bow down to a movement that I believe is doing ‘demonstrable harm’ to women.” In the months that followed, Rowling spoke out against Scottish legislation that would make it easier for people to change their gender on their birth certificate.Story continuesFans like Max Grosshandler, 25, whose sister is transgender, didn’t know how to feel. “It was a world-crushing experience for me,” he said. “I was just shocked and appalled.”Whereas previous Harry Potter games were mostly mediocre movie tie-ins, Hogwarts Legacy is the first to be treated like a big-budget video game, with high-end graphics and an original story. The technology has significantly evolved since the last Harry Potter console game came out in 2011. Early reviews have been glowing, and certainly are the best for any Harry Potter game yet. For Grosshandler and tens of thousands of other fans on the HarryPotterGame subreddit group he runs, it’s the first real opportunity to immerse themselves in a detailed recreation of Hogwarts Castle. He’s choking back his reservations and plans on buying and playing the game.Others are struggling to resist the temptation. Patrick, who asked to be identified only by his first name, said he is a gay man who adored Harry Potter and saw the game as a childhood fantasy that he would love to play. But after what he perceived as a “betrayal” from the author, he is ambivalent. “I am leaning towards not spending any more money on products connected to J.K. Rowling anymore,” he said in an email. “And I don't feel superior because of it. Quite the opposite. It all feels very sad. What has she done to her own creation?”A representative for Rowling declined to comment. A spokesperson for Warner Bros. said it has been a high priority “to create a game that is representative and diverse, aligning with the wonderful Wizarding World fan community.”Warner Bros. Games and Avalanche Software Team UpHogwarts Legacy is an important release for Warner Bros. and for the console-makers Microsoft Corp. and Sony Group Corp., which are relying on big games this year to goose spending after a thin release calendar in 2022.Development of Hogwarts Legacy first started in 2017, when Warner Bros. acquired the Salt Lake City-based Avalanche Software. Previously, the game studio had been part of Walt Disney Co., making games based on movie franchises like Cars and Toy Story as well as the ambitious Disney Infinity.From the start, the game’s production was riddled with challenges, according to people who worked there. Avalanche dealt with growing pains as it tried to pivot from mostly licensed kids games to a big-budget, open-world role-playing game that was meant to appeal to adults. Departments that were used to operating in silos suddenly had to work closely together, leading to some hostility, the people said, asking not to be named discussing information that’s not public.Newcomers to the company, which was founded in 1995 and still has the same owner and many employees who have worked there for decades, found an entrenched culture that could be difficult to penetrate.Rowling’s comments about transgender people also rattled some developers of Hogwarts Legacy, leading some to question their desire to work on the game. Some Avalanche employees decided to look for new jobs. Others pushed for the company to make a statement or otherwise acknowledge the controversy. Instead, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment President David Haddad said during an employee all-hands meeting that Rowling was “entitled to express her personal opinion.”The author wasn’t involved in the game’s development but she still owns the Harry Potter license and will benefit from sales. Rowling’s creative agency, the Blair Partnership, did work with the developers on creative decisions throughout the project.Eventually Avalanche management decided that Hogwarts Legacy needed to be more inclusive and responded to the controversy in one key way. After Rowling’s comments in the summer of 2020, the studio decided to add a transgender character to Hogwarts Legacy, according to four people familiar with the discussions. One of the game's non-playable characters, a bartender named Sirona Ryan, is now a trans woman.Another feature, the character creator, allows players to mix and match voices, body types and choice of dormitory.“We wanted to make a game that felt welcoming and inviting to everyone,” said Troy Leavitt, formerly a designer and producer on Hogwarts Legacy. “It was a way to extend the invitation a little wider so that more fans could see themselves represented in the Wizarding World,” he said in an email.Leavitt has faced controversy of his own. He resigned from Avalanche in early 2021 after social media users discovered that he had made videos in support of GamerGate, a loose community of gamers who battle vehemently against journalists and developers for voicing progressive views. Leavitt maintains that the movement “was primarily about ethics in journalism” and said he believes the video game press has been “ideologically captured.”A representative for the Blair Partnership said in a statement that the agency was “proud of the work Warner Bros. Games and Avalanche have done on this ground-breaking game and the part we have played in the development of it.”The Warner Bros. spokesperson said “offering players choices in the way they play the game is an element that we have worked on since the start of development. The Character Creator is just one example of that and of course, the large, diverse cast of characters present throughout the game have also had a huge amount of thought from Avalanche, Warner Bros. Games, The Blair Partnership, as well as counsel from outside D&amp;I experts.”Avalanche’s efforts at inclusivity in Hogwarts Legacy don’t go far enough for some fans.Are Fans Boycotting Hogwarts Legacy?Jessie Earl, a transgender woman, writer and YouTuber who has spoken out against Rowling, called for a boycott of the game. “It says we as a culture are going to continue to hold onto what she is making and allow her to have this presence in our society,” Earl said in an interview.Earl, who grew up enamored of the series and even named her cat after a character from the books, said that renouncing Harry Potter has been painful. In her eyes, however, continuing to give Rowling support and attention is even worse.“My ideal world is that we just stop talking about her, stop talking about the game, stop talking about Harry Potter,” Earl said. “If you buy the game, I'm not telling you you're a transphobe or an anti-trans bigot, but I would question whether you're an ally.”Conflicted feelings have prompted some fans to agree to only buy the game secondhand or wait to see if it goes on sale. Others, like 28-year-old Ryan Mills, said they planned to match every dollar they spent on Hogwarts Legacy with a donation to the Trevor Project, a nonprofit organization that offers mental health support to LGBTQ youth. “Life's short and sucky, and I think this game is just going to make me happy, make me feel warm for a while like I did when I was a kid,” said Mills.If the early buzz is any indication, the calls for boycotts may not be as effective as Earl and other activists had hoped. “I think pre-orders have been particularly strong because it’s launching at a time when there has been a vacuum of major releases” of big-budget games, said Piers Harding-Rolls, a research director at gaming and media analytics firm Ampere Analysis. “The budget for Hogwarts Legacy won’t have been small so WBIE has taken significant risk in funding the title, but it looks like that is about to pay off.”On Tuesday, Hogwarts Legacy had more than 1.2 million concurrent viewers on video-streaming site Twitch, breaking the record for most day-one viewers of a single-player game. Warner Bros. offered early access to players who pre-purchased the deluxe edition of the game. It’s also the top-selling game on Steam, a digital distribution platform for video games created by Valve Corp.Rowling, meanwhile, continues to make incendiary comments — last week, she posted a Tweet about “excluding women from women's prisons just because they've got penises” — which makes Hogwarts Legacy feel markedly different than any other blockbuster video game launch. For some people, it’s been hard to discuss without a “but...” attached.Harding-Rolls said he doesn't expect Rowling's comments to have much of an impact on the game's commercial performance. Potential customers will likely fall into three camps: people who won't buy the game due to Rowling, people who aren't aware of Rowling's comments and people who are aware but will buy the game regardless. ""I’m expecting the last two of those to be a big enough majority to drive the game to strong sales,"" he said.Reviews of Hogwarts Legacy have mostly been positive, although several have addressed the Rowling controversy. A lengthy blurb in the middle of an otherwise glowing review by IGN noted that, “As critics, our job is to answer the question of whether or not we find Hogwarts Legacy to be fun to play and why; whether it’s ethical to play is a separate but still very important question.” But the reviewer also declared that “Hogwarts Legacy is the Harry Potter RPG I’ve always wanted to play.”Some who disagree with Rowling’s views are attempting to reclaim the Harry Potter franchise for transgender fans. Moon, who grew up loving Harry Potter and asked only to be identified by his first name, is a moderator for a small Hogwarts Legacy Discord server. He is transgender and said he empathizes with people who have abandoned the franchise or boycotted the game. But, he said, “it's almost impossible to make millions end their relationship with something they like.” Instead, Moon figured he could help build a positive community for those who do choose to play Hogwarts Legacy, no matter how they identify. “The next best thing we can do is spread awareness from the inside,” he said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekZantac’s Maker Kept Quiet About Cancer Risks for 40 YearsHow Ben &amp; Jerry’s Ended Up at War With ItselfAiming to Be the Next Emirates, Air India Makes Record Jet BuyChatGPT Becomes a New Target for Right-Wing CommentatorsSurvey Fatigue Threatens to Undermine US Economic Data©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Options traders continued piling into bets targeting a 6% Federal Reserve peak rate, nearly a percentage point higher than consensus. The two-year yield traded near 4.5%, and earlier pushed above the 10-year rate by the widest margin since the early 1980s — a sign of flagging confidence in the economy’s ability to withstand additional tightening.Adding to the drumbeat of officials signaling the central bank has a ways to go to curb prices, Fed Bank of Richmond President Thomas Barkin said it’s important to continue hiking to rein in inflation. Data on jobless claims reinforced the idea of a hot labor market that points to tight policy, while mortgage rates rose for the first time in more than a month.Read: Fed-Funds Call at 8% Keeps One Strategist Ahead of the 6% Pack“The market is questioning if it’s even possible for the Fed to walk the line to do what they’re aiming to do because it’s a very difficult job — slowing the economy down through interest-rate increases while keeping us from slipping into a severe recession,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank.Amid so many uncertainties, some analysts see room for consolidation, especially after a surge that put stocks near overbought levels. To Katie Stockton at Fairlead Strategies, the biggest potential challenge for the market right now is overly bullish sentiment.Story continuesThe latest survey from the American Association of Individual Investors showed US retail investors turned bullish for the first time since April, with the bull-bear spread rising to 12.5 from -4.7 a week earlier. The percentage of investors with a bearish view over the next six months fell to 25%, the lowest since November 2021.“Well, as human nature never changes, sentiment ALWAYS follows price,” wrote Peter Boockvar, author of the Boock Report. “And the bulls are back now across the board. From a contrarian perspective, we now need to pay attention, and while not extreme and standing room only, the bull boat is getting filled up.”For some market watchers, trades favoring disinflation are soon set to reverse as price increases prove more entrenched than anticipated.This year, higher-duration sectors, such as tech and consumer discretionary have led stocks’ advance, while low-duration ones such as energy and utilities have underperformed. This is a reversal of the trend from late 2021, where investors started to shun high-duration stocks as inflation began to rise rapidly.The performance of megacaps was fairly mixed on Thursday.Tesla Inc. shares extended their breakneck rally to double from the lows touched in early January.

The ComEd EV Toolkit offers a variety of interactive features for individuals and organizations considering EVs as well as those who have already bought an EV. Customers can use the EV Toolkit to:Story continuesCalculate Fuel Cost Savings – get a real-time look at your potential fuel cost savings from switching from a gas or diesel vehicle to an EV by plugging in data on your miles driven, current gas prices and more.Review Vehicles and Chargers – peruse a list of EV brands and models available for purchase, and if you have the option to install in-home charging, choose a charger that meets your needs.Search Incentives – review a list of available state rebates and federal tax credits, and how to qualify for incentives before you buy.New EV Owner – find out about service rate options to maximize savings based on the time you charge, and register your EV with ComEd to help ensure your home is EV ready.Public Charging Locator – search a map of over 500 public charging stations in the area, and where to charge for free, according to your zip code.Fleet Electrification Tips – explore ComEd’s roadmap to fleet electrification, covering everything from vehicle classes to charging models and technology.For those considering an EV, new zero-emissions vehicles provide a range of consumer savings and benefits. This includes significant savings, due to the efficiency of EV engines and their 100 percent use of electricity instead of gasoline. The savings are even higher when considering avoided operations and maintenance costs over the lifetime of the vehicle.In addition to saving at the pump, electrifying transportation – including cars and public transit – can also create tangible environmental and health benefits for all communities and families across northern Illinois. In fact, EVs can reduce air pollutants in the areas that would benefit most: diverse and low-income communities. The American Lung Association estimates that conversion to EVs in Illinois could save a cumulative $3.2 billion by 2050.Additionally, the City of Chicago’s Air Quality and Health Index reports the areas with the worst air quality and health indices are also neighborhoods where people of color make up a higher share of the population, and moreover, these communities are more likely to live close to industrial facilities and busy transit routes, where air pollutant emissions are higher.Illinois is poised to increase EV adoption considerably in the years ahead, thanks to the passage of state and federal climate action. The Climate and Equitable Jobs Act law, passed in 2021, makes Illinois the first state in the Midwest to set a goal of achieving 100 percent clean energy by 2050.

360,5574385f-e09c-3704-8c83-bf274cfdce45,EXC,2023-02-09,Ameren (AEE) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ameren-aee-reports-next-week-150003320.html,1675868403,STORY,"['AEE', 'EXCVV']","[Ameren (AEE) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 15, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.56 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +16.7%.Revenues are expected to be $1.6 billion, up 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.92% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ameren?For Ameren, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.71%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ameren will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ameren would post earnings of $1.72 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.74, delivering a surprise of +1.16%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Ameren doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, Exelon (EXC) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.43 per share for the quarter ended December 2022.

So let's take a look at UnderArmour. You can see shares down about 8%, and that's really one of their worst days in a while here. And the company reported third quarter earnings that beat the Street, but what happened is really on the call. So the stock was up before the call, up almost 7% this morning. Then the call happens.And the CFO said earlier on the call that basically what happened here is that promotions are going to extend longer than they anticipated. So promotions are going to go further than they initially thought. They're going to go almost to the end of the year. And they highlighted that the consumer, they think, is weaker than people thought retailwide, so across the sector. Again, we were just talking about Capri. We saw an UnderArmour. I think we're seeing it play out, but it's interesting to start hearing that commentary now, too.DAVE BRIGGS: I think it's an UnderArmour problem, and it's Stephanie Linnartz's problem now. Their new CEO comes aboard after 25 years at Marriott. And she's got a lot of problems to solve there at Under Armour. And Kevin Plank, the founder, saying on the call, we look forward to her prioritizing top and bottom line growth for Under Armour. Stephanie Linnartz has her hands full. They're going to open a pop-up Tuesday in Manhattan, something called Slip Speed, a new shoe that actually converts into a slide from a training shoe. Big bet, one she didn't make.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, I'll be interested to try those on, Dave. I don't know how--SEANA SMITH: I'm not sold on that.JOSH SCHAFER: --they're going to pan out. Yeah.SEANA SMITH: I'm not sold. I just think Under Armour, if you take a step back, they've lost their cool factor. Not nearly as many people are wearing them as opposed to, what, 10, 15 years ago. They need to be a little bit more innovative with their products, I think, to really kind of boost their business. And--Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Nike took it, man.JOSH SCHAFER: What happened to the Under Armour brand that used to be the turtleneck, right? That was called an Under Armour to stay warm. And now you have a Nike one. And you don't even wear the Under Armour one with that little turtleneck.SEANA SMITH: I still wear mine when I run outside, yeah. They keep it nice and warm.DAVE BRIGGS: Not the full turtle.JOSH SCHAFER: You won't see any of those on Sunday at the Super Bowl, Dave.DAVE BRIGGS: No, you will not, my friend.]"

370,f03c7e7e-400b-3adf-a8a1-36cf5541fdb6,AKAM,2023-02-09,Shopify (SHOP) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shopify-shop-expected-beat-earnings-150003640.html,1675868403,STORY,"['SHOP', 'AKAM']","[The market expects Shopify (SHOP) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 15. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis cloud-based commerce company is expected to post break-even quarterly earnings per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -100%.Revenues are expected to be $1.64 billion, up 18.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.45% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Shopify?For Shopify, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +46.67%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Shopify will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Shopify would post a loss of $0.07 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.02, delivering a surprise of +71.43%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower.

But just as “there’s always a bull market somewhere,” as CNBC’s Jim Cramer loves to say, there are always overvalued stocks to sell.Now is no exception. Despite the market’s strong outlook, many companies face competitive threats that the Street seems to ignore. Meanwhile, amid continued unfounded worries about a recession, the valuations of many staples stocks have gotten far too high. And, of course, as always, I recommend selling the overvalued stocks of any companies whose businesses are based on cryptocurrencies.TickerCompanyPriceSBUXStarbucks$104.30DISWalt Disney$110.71CVSCVS Health$85.77CLColgate-Palmolive Company$74.29PGProcter &amp; Gamble$142.61COINCoinbase$74.63SISilvergate$18.83InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStarbucks (SBUX)Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a StrategySource: monticello / Shutterstock.comOne of the overvalued stocks on this list facing underestimated competitive threats, Starbucks’ (NASDAQ:SBUX) shares look poised to sink this year, despite the coffee retailer’s iconic status.The company’s fiscal first-quarter results, reported on Feb. 2, indicated that Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS) and Luckin Coffee (OTCMKTS:LKNCY), the company’s tough, young competitors in the U.S. and China, respectively, are having a significant, negative impact on SBUX.Specifically, the number of Starbucks transactions at comparable stores fell 2% globally versus the same period a year earlier. Due to a 7% increase in the average amount spent per transaction. The company’s global comp sales rose 5% year-over-year.Still, the average amount spent likely climbed primarily because of multiple price increases that the retailer implemented last year. With competition surging, the company won’t be able to keep fueling revenue gains with sales increases this year.Story continuesAdditionally, as in the past, I’m convinced that the work-from-home trend is hurting the company and that SBUX is consequentially unlikely ever to be as strong as it was in its pre-pandemic days.The company will get a lift from China’s reopening. But worth noting is that the operating income last quarter of its Americas region came in at $1.2 billion, just slightly above the $1.1 billion of OI it generated during the same period last year.With costs and competition still rising and the company probably unable to increase its prices much more in 2023, SBUX’s profitability in the Americas is likely to fall this year versus its 2019 levels. Therefore, it is definitely among the overvalued stocks to consider selling.Walt Disney (DIS)Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.Source: chrisdorney / ShutterstockLike Starbucks, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) has a powerful brand but is facing intense, structural challenges that it probably won’t be able to overcome. And interestingly, like Starbucks, Disney brought back a previous, well-regarded CEO who could not greatly improve its situation.Disney’s main problem is that the two sectors generating the lion’s share of its profits — in-theater movies and cable TV channels — are continuously contracting. And the company’s leading solution to those challenges has been to double, triple, and quadruple down on its streaming products that aren’t profitable.Accordingly, Disney’s total segment operating income came in at $12.12 billion in its fiscal year, which ended in Oct. 2022, versus $14.87 billion in its fiscal year, which ended in Sep. 2019.Last year, the company’s financial results were boosted by lifting the coronavirus lockdowns in many countries. And like Starbucks, DIS has raised its prices multiple times. But facing tougher comparisons this year and probably unable to raise its prices much further, DIS is likely to struggle mightily in 2023.Despite all its issues, DIS is trading at a relatively robust forward price-earnings ratio of 26. As a result, it’s definitely one of the overvalued stocks to sell now.CVS Health (CVS)Source: ShutterstockOver the last decade, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has entered several new businesses and failed to disrupt them meaningfully. But for a few reasons, the company’s two major healthcare initiatives will make a meaningful splash, causing CVS Health’s (NYSE:CVS) financial results to deteriorate by the end of 2023.Amazon will start delivering generic drugs that treat over 80 conditions for $5 per month for its Prime members. According to the company, the service will lower the average Prime member’s costs by $100 annually.Meanwhile, the e-commerce giant is entering the in-person clinic business by acquiring One Medical, which operates a network of primary care clinics.This time will be different for Amazon because its CEO, Andy Jassy, who took the helm at AMZN in 2021, is likely much more eager to disrupt sectors than his tycoon predecessor, Jeff Bezos, was. Moreover, while AMZN tried to disrupt the health sector without acquisitions in the past, this time, its acquisition of One Medical should make its effort to disrupt the clinic business much easier.CVS generates a cumulative 47% of its revenue from its Prescription Drugs and Health Care Services businesses. (The latter business is dominated by its MinuteClinics).Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL)Image of the Colgate-Palmolive logo on a buildingSource: ShutterstockColgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is one of the consumer staples retailers whose valuations have gotten ridiculously overextended because of the massive demand for their stocks due to recession fears. As I noted in this and previous columns, those worries are far overdone.CL is trading for 34 times its trailing price-earnings multiple. That’s double the average P/E ratio of the S&amp;P 500 for the stock of a company that’s never going to grow its revenue and profits, excluding acquisitions, very rapidly.The company’s 2.55% dividend yield is nothing to sneeze at when 2-year Treasuries yield 4.1%. Thus, its dividend yield is nothing to get excited about either.And ominously for CL, its sales volume, excluding acquisitions, actually fell 4% year-over-year last quarter. The company managed to increase its organic sales by 8.5% with a 12.5% average price hike. But after that considerable price hike, I doubt the company will be able to get away with raising its prices again this year.Also boding poorly for CL, as investors have become more upbeat about the stock market and the economy this year, its stock has sat out the market’s rally. In fact, through Feb. 2, its shares had slid 6.4% in 2023.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)A Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) distribution center in Vandalia.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAnother huge staples maker, Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), shares the same basic characteristics as CL. The latter company’s price-earnings ratio is 25, well above the S&amp;P 500’s average, for a company that’s never going to become the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) or the next ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW).And like CL, PG’s sales volume, excluding acquisitions, fell meaningfully last quarter, sinking 6%. While PG, like its peer, more than offset the decline with a 10% price hike, it probably won’t be able to raise prices again by much this year.And PG’s dividend yield of 2.6% is nice, but it’s dwarfed by the two-year Treasury’s 4.1% yield.On Jan. 20, calling PG’s results “mixed,” investment bank Stifel wrote that the shares were trading near fair value and kept a “hold” rating on the name. Since analysts rarely slap “sell” ratings on stocks, that’s a relatively bearish assessment of the company’s prospects.Despite the stock market’s rally so far this year, PG stock fell 6.2% from the beginning of the year through Feb. 2.Coinbase (COIN)The Coinbase (COIN stock) logo on a smartphone screen with a BTC token. Crypto winter is setting in.Source: Primakov / Shutterstock.comSpeaking of overvalued stocks, Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) has soared incredibly so far this year, jumping 130% in 2023 through Feb. 2. But multiple, bearish news indicates that the shares are going to have a very bad 2023.On Jan. 11, Bank of America cut its rating on COIN stock to “underperform” from “neutral” and slashed its price target to $35 from $50. After analyzing Q4 crypto transaction volume data, the firm believes analysts’ average 2023 estimate is meaningfully too high.Also issuing a very bearish note on COIN on Jan. 11 was the Japanese bank Mizuho. The firm stated that the layoffs do not address Coinbase’s most significant challenge: in the words of The Fly, that issue is “deteriorating volumes amid retail crypto trading fatigue.” Mizuho expects the company’s 2023 sales to be 30% below analysts’ average estimate. It kept an “underperform” rating on the shares.In another negative development for COIN, its CEO, Brian Armstrong, has already unloaded $4.5 million of COIN shares in 2023, while his CFO, Alesia Haas, dumped $3.4 million of the stock.And finally, I’ve recently seen signs that Bitcoin (BTC-USD), the most widely held cryptocurrency once viewed as cutting edge, has become a laughingstock for many on the Street and in the financial news media.Specifically, reacting to Cathie Wood’s ridiculous assertion on Feb. 1 that the Bitcoin price would reach $1 million, CNBC’s Jim Cramer said, “That was funny. I mean, I said ‘hoo-ha,’ I laughed.” He added, “When I was in the Sea of Galilee, and I walked on water, it was a pretty good time. I’m trying to find something that could be as outlandish!”And on Feb. 2, in a tone that also appeared to mock Bitcoin, CNBC’s Josh Brown said that artificial intelligence would become very useful for companies and consumers, unlike Bitcoin.Investors often look to experienced traders who appear on TV, like Brown and Cramer, for guidance. Their mocking of Bitcoin will likely cause many retail investors to forego trading cryptos. That, of course, would be bad news for COIN.Silvergate (SI)Person holding smartphone with logo of US financial services company Silvergate Bank (SI) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comSilvergate (NYSE:SI), a bank that’s heavily invested in crypto, was the latest source of bad news for the sector.Specifically, on Feb. 2, Bloomberg reported that the Department of Justice was investigating SI’s links to two firms, FTX, and Alameda Research, both of which had strong ties to Sam Bankman-Fried. The DOJ has charged Bankman-Fried with “money laundering, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud.”Given the accusations against Bankman-Fried and the Biden administration’s general antipathy to crypto, there’s a good chance that DOJ will take significant action against SI.Also ominously for Silvergate, the bank stopped paying dividends on its preferred stock in late January, and its deposits tumbled by more than 50% last quarter.In the past, SI has relied on a “government sponsored enterprise” for significant financial support. With the Biden administration cracking down on SI, that financial support will probably not be available anymore, making bankruptcy a much more likely prospect for SI. Thus, it is among the top overvalued stocks right now.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer had a long position on LKNCY. He was shorting COIN and may open a short position in SI in the next week.Larry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

373,7fa9ecf7-60ce-32c6-b15c-1830e554ee87,XRAY,2023-02-09,DENTSPLY SIRONA (NASDAQ:XRAY investor three-year losses grow to 33% as the stock sheds US$357m this past week,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dentsply-sirona-nasdaq-xray-investor-112036880.html,1675941636,STORY,['XRAY'],"[DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (NASDAQ:XRAY) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 19% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last three years have been less than pleasing. In fact, the share price is down 35% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return.Given the past week has been tough on shareholders, let's investigate the fundamentals and see what we can learn. See our latest analysis for DENTSPLY SIRONA In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over the three years that the share price declined, DENTSPLY SIRONA's earnings per share (EPS) dropped significantly, falling to a loss. This was, in part, due to extraordinary items impacting earnings. Due to the loss, it's not easy to use EPS as a reliable guide to the business. But it's safe to say we'd generally expect the share price to be lower as a result!The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on DENTSPLY SIRONA's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of DENTSPLY SIRONA, it has a TSR of -33% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that DENTSPLY SIRONA shareholders are down 29% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 9.4%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 6% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. Investors who like to make money usually check up on insider purchases, such as the price paid, and total amount bought.

QuoteOperational UpdateTotal revenues of $12.6 billion declined 7.9% year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.1%. The fall in revenues was due to lower premiums and reduced asset management fees, commissions and other income, decreased policy charges and fee income and net investment income. The figure was higher than our estimate of $12.3 billion.Total benefits and expenses amounted to $11.5 billion, which fell 5.7% year over year in the fourth quarter. This decrease was on account of lower insurance and annuity benefits and general and administrative expenses. The figure was higher than our estimate of $11.2 billion.Quarterly Segment UpdatePrudential Global Investment Management’s (PGIM) adjusted operating income of $230 million declined 34.3% year over year. The decrease primarily reflects lower asset management fees, due to a reduction in assets under management and lower Other Related Revenues, owing to lower incentive fees, agency income and transaction fees. It was partially offset by lower expenses.PGIM assets under management of $1.2 trillion in the reported quarter, which fell 19% year over year due to higher interest rates and widening credit spreads, as well as declines in equity markets.The U.S. Businesses delivered adjusted operating income of $864 million, which decreased 3.5% year over year.

The improvement was driven by higher Medicare commission revenues and lower expenses.International Businesses’ adjusted operating income decreased 25.4% year over year to $618 million in the fourth quarter.

This higher loss reflects higher expenses, partially offset by higher income from pension and other employee benefit plans.Story continuesCapital DeploymentPrudential Financial managed to return capital to its shareholders in the form of share repurchases worth $375 million and dividends worth $449 million in the fourth quarter.Dividend Hike AnnouncedConcurrent with fourth-quarter results, Prudential Financial’s board of directors approved a 4% hike in the quarterly dividend.

379,3f2b5015-a5c7-3925-bfbe-24dd69e87b77,DVN,2023-02-09,Here's Why We Think Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) Might Deserve Your Attention Today,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-think-devon-energy-121458780.html,1675944898,STORY,['DVN'],"[Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Devon Energy with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Devon Energy Devon Energy's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. To the delight of shareholders, Devon Energy has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 51%, compound, over the last three years. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. While we note Devon Energy achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 80% to US$19b. That's progress.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Devon Energy's future profits.Are Devon Energy Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Devon Energy has a market capitalisation of US$40b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$295m. This comes in at 0.7% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Story continuesShould You Add Devon Energy To Your Watchlist?Devon Energy's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So at the surface level, Devon Energy is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Devon Energy   (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

380,7e535664-482f-3d3b-9990-11be556af48b,DVN,2023-02-09,EQT Corporation (EQT) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eqt-corporation-eqt-earnings-expected-150003218.html,1675868403,STORY,"['EQT', 'DVN']","[EQT Corporation (EQT) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 15. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.57 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +39%.Revenues are expected to be $1.45 billion, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 38.57% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for EQT Corporation?For EQT Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -28.77%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that EQT Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that EQT Corporation would post earnings of $0.99 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.04, delivering a surprise of +5.05%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.EQT Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, Devon Energy (DVN), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.77 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +27.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $4.65 billion, up 8.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Devon Energy has been revised 12.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.49%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Devon Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

381,73c511b4-d2c1-3bea-a6f3-a870d01f0ad7,DVN,2023-02-09,Devon Energy Corporation (DVN) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/devon-energy-corporation-dvn-trending-140002875.html,1675864802,STORY,['DVN'],"[Devon Energy (DVN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned -1.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, to which Devon Energy belongs, has gained 1.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.77 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -12.9%.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.42 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +138.5%. This estimate has changed -6.6% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.83 indicates a change of -6.9% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -8.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Devon Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $4.65 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +8.8%. The $19.64 billion and $18.62 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +64.8% and -5.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $5.43 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.7%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.58%. The EPS surprise was +2.35%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

382,5d5fce3e-fbc8-3996-94e7-ea2a7a3cea20,URI,2023-02-09,"United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE:URI) Delivered A Better ROE Than Its Industry",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-rentals-inc-nyse-uri-110014636.html,1675940414,STORY,['URI'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE:URI), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for United Rentals How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for United Rentals is:30% = US$2.1b ÷ US$7.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.30 in profit.Does United Rentals Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, United Rentals has a superior ROE than the average (22%) in the Trade Distributors industry.roeThat is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . To know the 2 risks we have identified for United Rentals visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesUnited Rentals' Debt And Its 30% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by United Rentals, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.59. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

383,c397d1f9-a8b2-36a1-b9f2-d2b09bb0eff8,URI,2023-02-09,5 Must-Buy Stocks to Gain From the Ongoing Wall Street Rally,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-must-buy-stocks-gain-130701626.html,1675861621,STORY,"['RNR-PF', 'COMP', '^GSPC', 'URI', 'ARLP', 'ET-PD', 'AXS']","[Wall Street has been witnessing a solid rally since the beginning of 2023 after a highly disappointing 2022. Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — are up 3.1%, 8.5% and 15.7%, respectively.Favorable data for several measures of inflation, various soft economic data and a resilient labor market raised market participants’ hope for a soft landing of the U.S. economy. To tap the ongoing rally, several good stocks are available.We have selected five stocks based on certain criteria to be discussed later. These companies are - United Rentals Inc. URI, Energy Transfer LP ET, Alliance Resource Partners L.P. ARLP, RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. RNR and AXIS Capital Holdings Ltd. AXS.Fed Reduces Magnitude of Interest Rate HikeOn Feb 1, in its February FOMC meeting, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 4.50% to 4.75%, marking its highest rate since late 2007. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said “We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. However, it would be very premature to declare victory or to think we really got this.”Powell categorically denied any possibility of a rate cut in 2023. However, the market applauded Powell’s recognition that the disinflationary process has started. A lower interest rate and lighter monetary control will be good for the stock market as it will boost the margins of most companies.Peak Inflation Seems Behind UsLess-than-expected inflation rates in October, November and December with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers released on Jan 27 showed that the one-year inflation outlook slipped to a final reading of 3.9% this month from 4.4% in December, the lowest reading since April 2021.On Jan 31, the Department of Labor reported that the employment cost index for fourth-quarter 2022 rose 1% compared with the consensus estimate of a 1.2% rise. The metric for third-quarter 2022 was also 1.2%. Year over year, the employment cost index jumped 5.1% in 2022 compared with 5% in 2021. The recent data clearly indicates that wage rate, a major source of current inflation is declining as expected by the Fed.Story continuesOther PositivesThe challenges of the pandemic are also behind us. China has been gradually reopening since the beginning of this year after strict lockdowns last year. This will help revive the completely devastated global-supply chain system. Global trade will also gain momentum.The U.S. labor market remains resilient. So far, the results of fourth-quarter 2022 earnings are not as disappointing as expected. Therefore, the Fed may reach its goal of a soft landing of the economy.Stock Selection ProcessAt this stage, several good stocks are available for investment. We have applied our VGM Style Score to narrow the search to select five companies that have strong growth potential for 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Finally, each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a VGM Score of A.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past month.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnited Rentals is benefiting from the U.S. administration’s increased focus on infrastructural improvement.

The study collected information from 1,500 respondents at enterprises—organizations with more than 1,000 full-time employees in North America or more than 500 in other regions—about how they use the cloud within their organization and found that almost every cloud journey is now becoming a multicloud journey. Read the full report here.Oracle Logo (PRNewsfoto/Oracle)In recent years, cloud has become nearly synonymous with IT as enterprises seek increased business agility and improved operational efficiency from the technology they use. While these trends have existed for some time, more than 90 percent of respondents agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic has been a strong driver of greater interest and investment in cloud technology. As organizations faced new challenges such as increased levels of remote work and collaboration with new business partners and suppliers, they adopted a multicloud strategy to gain the flexibility and scalability they needed for this new reality.""The 'one-stop-shop' mentality has died when it comes to the cloud. Instead, multicloud is the reality of enterprise technology environments as these organizations seek to get the right mix of solutions and capabilities they need to operate effectively,"" said Melanie Posey, research director, Cloud &amp; Managed Services Transformation at 451 Research. ""Multicloud is here to stay, and enterprises are choosing this model for the benefits it provides for a range of different business and operational requirements, like business agility or access to best-of-breed technology.""Key findings from the study include:Almost every cloud journey is multicloud 98 percent of enterprises surveyed are using or plan to use at least two cloud infrastructure providers and 31 percent are using four or more.96 percent reported they are using or plan to use at least two cloud application providers (Software-as-a-Service), with 45 percent using cloud applications from five or more providers.This multicloud strategy allows IT departments to meet the specific technology needs of different teams across the organization.Story continuesData sovereignty and cost optimization are driving demand for multicloud strategiesThe top two drivers of multicloud strategies in enterprises are data sovereignty (41 percent) and cost optimization (40 percent).Other drivers of multicloud strategies include business agility and innovation (30 percent), best of breed cloud services and applications (25 percent) and cloud vendor lock-in concerns (25 percent).Multicloud strategies give enterprises more control over where and how their data is stored and used, while also ensuring businesses can control the costs of their cloud operations by adjusting which services they use from different providers.Enterprise organizations are proactively planning multicloud strategies for the futureData redundancy (54 percent) is the most anticipated future use case, followed by data mobility (49 percent) and cost optimization across public clouds (42 percent).IT departments also plan to use multicloud strategies for risk mitigation for the entire IT environment (40 percent) and geographic expansion or global service delivery (38 percent).The fact that IT departments are planning multicloud strategies shows that they see multicloud as a way to get ahead of their technology needs, instead of simply a tactic to react to crises.""Multicloud is here, whether enterprises are ready for it or not. Business mergers can turn even the most stable of IT strategies into a multicloud environment overnight,"" said Leo Leung, vice president, OCI and Oracle Technology. ""Whether IT teams are starting their multicloud plans from scratch or already have an implementation in place but want to add best-of-breed cloud services, OCI's distributed cloud can help. With the recent introduction of MySQL HeatWave on AWS and Oracle Database Service for Microsoft Azure, customers have even more capabilities to help their multicloud strategies succeed.""This research validates the approach OCI has taken with its distributed cloud and management offerings, which earned Oracle recognition as a leader in the recent Omdia Universe: Hybrid and Multicloud Management Solution, 2022–23 report (December 2022).

Solid demand for the Oracle Dedicated Region Cloud@Customer is anticipated to drive the top line. Oracle expects total cloud growth, including Cerner, to grow from 43% to 47% in USD for the next quarter. Partnerships with Accenture and Microsoft are helping Oracle win new clientele.However, higher spending on product enhancements, especially toward the cloud platform, is likely to limit margin expansion.

If you want to explore similar companies, you can also take a look at 5 Biggest Supply Chain Management Companies in the World.What Is Supply Chain Management?Supply chain management (SCM) is the process of coordinating and optimizing all the activities and processes required to plan, source, produce, and deliver a product or service from the beginning of its lifecycle to the end customer. SCM encompasses a wide range of activities, including supplier selection, production scheduling, inventory management, order fulfillment, delivery, and returns. SCM also includes other functions such as customer service, forecasting, and quality control.From the perspective of a business, supply chain management helps to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and create a competitive advantage in the marketplace. By having a better understanding of the whole supply chain process, companies are able to simultaneously maximize customer value, cut costs, and increase revenue, therefore driving top-line growth.How Does Supply Chain Management Work?In today's fast-paced business environment, effective Supply Chain Management (SCM) is essential in order to maintain a competitive edge. Companies are increasingly recognizing the value of managing their supply chain in order to reduce excess costs and deliver products to the consumer more quickly. This involves closely controlling their own production, distribution, sales, and the inventories of their vendors, as well as the information systems needed to direct these activities. By keeping tighter control of internal inventories, internal production, distribution, sales, and the inventories of company vendors, companies can optimize their supply chain that can help them stay ahead of the curve.The 5-Step Guide to Optimizing Your Supply ChainThe entire supply chain management process consists of five steps and a supply chain manager is responsible for the successful execution of each of these steps. A supply chain manager can be thought of as a one-man show. A supply chain manager is responsible for overseeing and managing a company's entire supply chain, including planning, sourcing, production, logistics, and reverse logistics. They are responsible for developing strategies to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the supply chain, and for ensuring that the company meets its supply chain objectives. They work closely with other departments in the organization to ensure an efficient flow of materials and products.Story continuesThe first stage is the planning stage. This involves the creation of a strategic plan for the product or service. This includes setting objectives, determining the resources needed, and creating a timeline for the project. It is important to consider the customer’s needs and preferences, as well as the competition in order to create a comprehensive plan.The sourcing stage in Supply Chain Management (SCM) involves determining the best tactics for acquiring the materials needed for manufacturing a product. This stage requires research and analysis to evaluate the various suppliers and decide on the most cost-effective and efficient way to source the necessary components. During this stage, companies may consider several factors including cost, quality, delivery time, and reliability. Additionally, companies may focus on sustainability and ethical sourcing practices, such as using eco-friendly materials and working with suppliers who treat their workers fairly. Once the sourcing strategy is in place, companies can begin to procure the necessary materials and components.The production stage is literally at the core of the supply chain management process (in the middle) however it is most certainly not the final stage. The production stage involves the manufacturing process, as well as quality control and testing. At this stage, the focus is on ensuring that goods are produced efficiently and on time, at the right cost, and to the required quality standards.Now that the product is ready to be shipped, the logistics and distribution stage involves the coordination of transportation, warehousing, and inventory management so that the goods are delivered on time and in the most cost-effective manner. This stage also includes customer service activities such as tracking orders and providing customer support. Ultimately, the goal of this stage is to ensure that the customer is satisfied with the product or service delivered.Finally, we have the most critical and final stage: reverse logistics and returns. This stage involves the processes of managing the return of products from customers, either due to defects or customer dissatisfaction. The goal of reverse logistics and returns is to optimize the process of bringing products back into circulation or disposing of them responsibly. This stage of supply chain management involves tracking the returns, evaluating the cause of the return, determining the best arrangement for the product (such as repair, remanufacture, or disposal), and then either reselling the product or disposing of it in an environmentally responsible way. It also involves communicating with customers and providing them with appropriate forms and instructions for returning the product.Photo by Jacques Dillies on UnsplashThe five stages of SCM are all essential in creating a successful business. By managing the entire process carefully, businesses can ensure that their products and services are of the highest quality and delivered on time. With the right SCM strategy, businesses can stay competitive in an ever-changing marketplace and improve their bottom line.A Prime Example of Supply Chain ManagementAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a prime example of a company that has properly executed supply chain management. The company has revolutionised the way that consumers purchase products. Through the implementation of sophisticated technology and data-driven processes, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has created a seamless and efficient supply chain.

These efforts have helped Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) grow to become an e-commerce giant worth $1.05 trillion, as of February 7.The Global Supply Chain Management Industry: Size and Major PlayersThe global supply chain management industry is constantly evolving to meet the needs of businesses in today's ever-changing global economy. It is a complex and dynamic industry that requires strategic planning, advanced technologies, and the utilization of resources in order to be successful. The industry is composed of a wide variety of stakeholders including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, customers, and third-party logistics providers.According to an industry analysis report by Grand View Research, the global supply chain management industry was valued at $21.12 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow to $48.58 billion by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate of 11.1% from 2023 to 2030. This growth is driven by the increasing demand for supply chain management technologies, such as cloud-based solutions, data analytics, and machine learning. Additionally, the growing need for efficient supply chain operations and improved customer service, as well as the increasing number of mergers and acquisitions, are key factors driving the growth of the market.The global supply chain management industry is benefitting from technological advances that are available today. These tech trends include the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to optimize processes, the use of blockchain technology to ensure the secure flow of goods and the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing to monitor supply chain activities. AI and ML can be used to automate processes, improve accuracy and identify trends, while blockchain allows for the secure and decentralized transfer of data. IoT can be used to monitor the supply chain and provide real-time insights to allow for more efficient operations. Additionally, the use of cloud-based software is becoming increasingly popular, allowing for easier access and management of supply chain data. Finally, digital platforms are being developed to connect buyers and suppliers more efficiently and to streamline communication.

388,6be304db-cc12-3539-97ab-c0da0b0f522f,MU,2023-02-09,Micron (MU) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micron-mu-considered-good-investment-143002502.html,1675866602,STORY,['MU'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Micron (MU).Micron currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.78, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 26 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.78 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 26 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 65.4% and 3.9% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MUBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MUCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Micron here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Micron, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in MU?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Micron, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 2% over the past month to -$2.09.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Micron. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Micron with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this chipmaker have returned +8.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7% change. The Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry, to which Micron belongs, has gained 9.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Micron is expected to post a loss of $0.63 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -129.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of -$2.09 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -125%. This estimate has changed -2% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.08 indicates a change of +151.7% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -19.3%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Micron.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MU _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Micron, the consensus sales estimate of $3.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -51.1%. The $16.4 billion and $22.95 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -46.7% and +39.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMicron reported revenues of $4.09 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -46.9%. EPS of -$0.04 for the same period compares with $2.16 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.08 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.07%. The EPS surprise was -100%.Over the last four quarters, Micron surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Micron is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Micron. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

394,44eea4a3-8da5-34b7-bdbb-8df8cbd0cc34,FIS,2023-02-09,Analysts Estimate Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-fidelity-national-information-150003621.html,1675868403,STORY,['FIS'],"[The market expects Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 15, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis banking and payment technologies company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.70 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -11.5%.Revenues are expected to be $3.68 billion, up 0.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.85% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Fidelity National?For Fidelity National, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.68%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Fidelity National will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Fidelity National would post earnings of $1.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.74, delivering a surprise of -0.57%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Fidelity National doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerGlobal Payments (GPN), another stock in the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $2.45 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +15%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $2.03 billion, up 2.1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Global Payments has been revised 0.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.12%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Global Payments will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Knights that Beat The Market Last 5 Years. With the S&amp;P 500 gaining 8.89% this year so far, the US stock market is showing signs of recovery. According to a recent report by Morgan Stanley, stocks could have a strong first half of the year despite lingering recession fears. However, the report also mentions that earnings may fall throughout the year. In these fluctuating conditions, investors rely on dividend-focused stocks to ensure regular means of income.During the previous inflationary periods, dividend stocks held up well in comparison with other asset classes. Dividends represented 40% of the market since the 1940s and the ratio increased during decades when inflation was higher, as reported by Hartford Funds. The report also revealed the performance of dividend stocks in the 1970s, when they represented 73% of the S&amp;P 500 returns. Various other reports show that dividends usually grow faster than inflation. One such research was carried out by Fidelity International which revealed that since 1900, the 10-year annual average growth in dividends across the S&amp;p 500 outpaced CPI growth nearly 73% of the time.Companies with strong dividend growth tracks and solid returns become investors’ choices as they prepare them for challenging periods. In addition to this, investors also pay attention to the company’s cash flow generation and sound balance sheet, which warrant future dividend payouts. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Roper Technologies, Inc.

S&amp;P and Moody’s have roughly equal market shares and rate more than 90% of all bonds worldwide. The service provides high value for the cost. A company that chooses to issue debt without a rating will pay an interest rate that could be higher by half of a percent. The cost of a higher interest rate far exceeds any savings gained by not using the services of S&amp;P.We think of S&amp;P as a toll road that earns fees from its customers in exchange for cost-effective access to capital. As such, the company has extraordinary margins and pricing power and requires little of its own capital to grow. Even after fully reinvesting in its business, S&amp;P still has an excess of cash.

406,0bed3061-97f1-3e5e-b8fe-8869b3fd8ddb,MCD,2023-02-09,McDonald’s worker claims manager ‘pulled his pants down in the stockroom’ when she asked for permission to head home sick,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcdonald-worker-claims-manager-pulled-131338858.html,1675862018,STORY,['MCD'],"[Working at McDonald's was ""one of the worst experiences of my life"", Christine recalls, while looking back on the seven years at the fast food giant which ended, she claims, with her being sexually harassed by a manager.Having just moved to London, she started working at McDonald's in 2011, thinking “it would be really great"". Now, she says, “I had no idea what I was walking into.""She described a South London branch’s toxic workplace culture to the BBC, where she claims managers flirted with junior staff, touched “everyone’s bum” and said ""inappropriate things"".The publishing of the allegations bring focus back to fast food chain as it faces an apparent wave of sexual harassment claims—and continued reverberations from the 2019 ouster of its previous CEO over inappropriate workplace relationships.The stockroom incidentFor Christine, things went from bad to worse when in 2018, she says, she was sexually harassed in the stockroom by a manager.Feeling unwell, Christine went to the stockroom to ask for a manager's permission to head home but was instead met with “really inappropriate sexual suggestions”.""He pulled his pants down in the stockroom and wanted me to do inappropriate things,"" she said while adding that she wasn’t “comfortable” with the advances and that the experience left her ""terrified"".Christine said she walked out and raised a complaint with her business manager.But she was told to ""get back in the kitchen and work with him"" after the business manager spoke to the man in question. When she objected, she was told to call the police. ""So I was like, fine. I packed up my stuff and went home,"" she said.Christine never worked at McDonald's again, although she claims the manager in question is still employed there.Union says McDonald's swept complaints under the carpetMcDonald's said the experiences described by Christine were ""completely unacceptable and have no place in our restaurants"".Story continuesMcDonald's added in a statement to Fortune: ""We work hard to create a positive work environment and culture. The safety of our teams and customers is our absolute priority. We have an open door policy, and encourage all employees to speak up if they have any concerns of any kind – we have a People Services Helpdesk and an Employee Assistance phone line, both of which can be contacted anonymously.""The total number of sexual harassment complaints made by McDonald's workers in the U.K. is unclear.But four years ago, union officials at the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU) said they had received at least 1,000 from women claiming that they had been abused by fellow workers.In 2019, BFAWU officials said that the company had “swept under the carpet” complaints of sexual harassment. They added that workers had been “victimized” for lodging complaints and that some had been paid compensation on the condition that they signed non-disclosure agreements.Concerns about the inadequate processes to deal with the allegations were raised by employees via the union, causing the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to get involved.As a result, McDonald's has signed a legal agreement with the EHRC to protect staff from sexual harassment. The EHRC told the BBC that it did ""not enter into agreements lightly"".As part of the agreement that was announced today (Feb. 8), the fast food giant has committed to a number of measures including anti-harassment training for employees and the introduction of training for managers to “identify areas of risks” and to “take steps to prevent sexual harassment”.Now the equality watchdog is monitoring McDonald's to ensure it is complying with the law. Meanwhile, it is taking action to require the U.S. business—where there have also been sexual harassment allegations by workers over the years—to sign a similar agreement.Former CEO fined over relationshipRevelations come in the wake of the company's ouster of its last chief executive for violating its policies on work relationships.Just last month, former Mcdonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook was fined $400,000 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for “concealing the extent of his misconduct” over sexual relationships with more junior employees.McDonald's fired the British-born boss in 2019 for violating its policies on work relationships, after discovering he had a consensual relationship with an employee.At the time, the board ruled he was axed without cause, entitling him to over $40 million in compensation, benefits and stock, as part of a “separation agreement”The company claimed he denied having any other affairs ""physical or non-physical"" with McDonald's workers. But further investigation after a tip-off uncovered hidden relationships with other staff members, including emails and messages with nude photos and videos confirming affairs with at least two other employees.The chain accused Easterbrook of trying to cover his tracks by deleting the intimate images from his inbox, but they still existed on the firm's email servers.As a result, McDonald’s decided to sue him to recover the full severance package he received.The SEC announced in January that it had “charged” McDonald’s former CEO and president with making “false and misleading statements to investors about the circumstances leading to his termination”.The regulator said Easterbrook and McDonald’s were not honest with investors about the reason that led to Easterbrook’s termination, and this “allowed him to retain substantial equity compensation that otherwise would have been forfeited”.Easterbrook has agreed to pay the $400,000 penalty, without admitting or denying the claims.Before his shortfall, Easterbrook who grew up in Watford, Hertfordshire was dubbed the ""Wizard from Watford"" for doubling McDonald’s share value during his tenure.He helmed the company from March 2015 to November 2019, after previously leading its U.K. operations. During that time, he was also hailed for revitalizing the chain’s menus, remodeling stores and using better ingredients.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Olympic legend Usain Bolt lost $12 million in savings to a scam.

Carey (WPC) This Earnings Season?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-store-w-p-carey-153603110.html,1675870563,STORY,"['WPC', 'PLD', 'ARE']","[W. P. Carey Inc. WPC is set to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 results on Feb 10 before market open. While its quarterly revenues are likely to have witnessed year-over-year growth, funds from operations (FFO) per share might have displayed a decline from the year-ago reported figure.In the last reported quarter, this New York-based net lease REIT delivered a surprise of 5.43% for the adjusted FFO per share.Over the trailing four quarters, W. P. Carey’s adjusted FFO per share surpassed estimates on each occasion, the average surprise being 4.11%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:W.P. Carey Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseW.P. Carey Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseW.P. Carey Inc. price-eps-surprise | W.P. Carey Inc. QuoteThis diversified net lease REIT specializes in sale-leasebacks, build-to-suits and the acquisition of single-tenant net lease properties. WPC is poised to benefit from its portfolio of operationally-critical commercial real estate, which it leases back to creditworthy tenants on a long-term basis with built-in rent escalators. Having contractual rent escalators covering nearly the entire portfolio is a saving grace in the current inflationary environment and indicates credit strength.W. P. Carey focuses on investing in high-quality single-tenant industrial, warehouse, office, retail and self-storage properties. These are located mainly in the United States and Northern and Western Europe.WPC is also focused on capitalizing on accretive investment opportunities. These investments come as part of the company’s external growth strategy and diversified approach.W. P. Carey’s investment volume for the full-year 2022 reached $1.42 billion. High-quality, single-tenant warehouse and industrial properties comprised roughly two-thirds of its 2022 investment volume.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $398.15 million, indicating a 6.21% increase from the prior-year quarter. The consensus estimate for lease revenues for the fourth quarter is currently pegged at $338.24 million, ahead of the prior-year quarter’s figure of $305.09 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from real estate ownership is presently pegged at $392.97 million, up from the $370.32 reported in the year-ago quarter.However, choppiness in the economy and its impact on economic activity might affect the demand for several real estate, and W. P. Carey’s portfolio is not immune to such impacts. Hence, while WPC’s fourth-quarter results are likely to reflect gains from its high-quality diversified portfolio and strategic investments, choppiness in certain real estate categories is likely to have been a concern.W. P. Carey’s activities during the quarter under review were not adequate to secure analysts’ confidence. The consensus estimate for the quarterly adjusted FFO per share has remained unrevised at $1.29 in a month. It suggests a decline of 0.8% year over year.For the full-year 2022, WPC expected adjusted FFO per share in the range of $5.25-$5.31. The full-year guidance is based on some key assumptions, including investments in the company's real estate portfolio between $1.5 and $2.0 billion, dispositions from the company's real estate portfolio between $200 and $300 million and total general and administrative expenses between $88 and $90 million.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted FFO per share is pegged at $5.30. The figure indicates a 5.37% increase year over year on 10.26% year-over-year growth in revenues to $1.47 billion.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for W. P. Carey this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an FFO beat. However, that’s not the case here.W. P. Carey currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

PLD reported a fourth-quarter 2022 core FFO per share of $1.24, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21. The figure climbed 10.7% from the year-ago quarter. Prologis’ quarterly results reflected better-than-anticipated revenues, driven by healthy leasing activity and solid rent growth.Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. ARE reported a fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted FFO per share of $2.14, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. The reported figure also compared favorably with the year-ago quarter’s $1.97. Alexandria Real Estate Equities' results reflected decent leasing activity and rental rate growth during the quarter.Upcoming ReleaseHere is a stock from the REIT sector — Public Storage PSA — that you may want to consider as our model shows that this has the right combination of elements to report a surprise this quarter.Public Storage, scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 results on Feb 21, currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.22% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

NWL is expected to witness year-over-year declines in the top and bottom lines when it reports fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Feb 10, before the opening bell.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 12 cents, which suggests a decline of 71.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days. For quarterly revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $2.24 billion, indicating a decline of 20.2% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.In the last reported quarter, the Atlanta, GA-based company delivered an earnings surprise of 12.8%. Its bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 23.7%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Newell Brands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Newell Brands Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNewell Brands Inc. price-eps-surprise | Newell Brands Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteNewell has been witnessing the continued effects of the tough macro environment, reduced inventory, inflationary pressures and the impact of a stronger dollar. The company’s sales for the to-be-reported quarter are likely to have been affected by the adverse impacts of the sale of the Connected Home &amp; Security (CH&amp;S) business, unfavorable foreign currency, and exit of its category and retail store. The company is also expected to have been affected by the significant inflation in food, housing and energy, leading to reduced consumer discretionary spending.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected the aforementioned headwinds to persist in the near term. Newell also predicted the discretionary spending levels to remain constrained.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management envisioned fourth-quarter 2022 net sales to be $2.18-$2.26 billion, with a core sales decline of 9-12%. For the quarter, the company expects a normalized operating margin of 5.1-6.5% and normalized earnings of 9-14 cents per share. The guidance includes the impacts of unfavorable foreign currency, closures of Yankee Candle stores, and the exit of certain product categories, particularly in the Outdoor &amp; Recreation, and Home Appliances segments.Moreover, the company expects 2022 results to reflect the adverse impacts of unfavorable foreign currency and inflation. It anticipates net sales of $9.35-$9.43 billion, with core sales expected to decline 3-4% in 2022, excluding the contribution from the CH&amp;S business. The company anticipates a normalized operating margin of 10-10.3%. Normalized earnings per share are forecast to be $1.56-$1.61 for 2022.However, Newell has been benefiting from the actions to accelerate productivity and efficiency by accelerating fuel productivity plans, driving automation and fully implementing Project Ovid. Increased focus on revenue growth management, aggressive efforts to reduce SKU and supply network optimization are expected to have aided the fourth-quarter performance. Also, the company’s stringent cost-cutting plans, such as rightsizing overhead costs based on the simplification agenda, are likely to have boosted margins and the bottom line to some extent.Newell’s fourth-quarter results are expected to reflect the positive effects of leveraging its robust e-commerce capabilities, which have been strong for some time due to the increasing shifts to the online platform. The company has been strengthening its e-commerce business via increased investments and better customer engagement. Continued digital penetration, driven by expanded omnichannel capabilities, is likely to have supported the top line in the fourth quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Newell this time around.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the returns of dividend growers, and go directly to read 5 Companies Likely to be Dividend Kings in the Future. Dividend Kings are companies that have raised their payouts for 50 years or more. Due to consistent interest rates hike and growing inflation, investors are steadily loading up on dividend securities to ensure regular income. Moreover, these stocks also offer potential for capital appreciation as the stock price increases over time. When considering dividend stocks, investors focus on companies that hold extended track records of dividend growth. West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (NYSE:WST), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are some companies that have been rewarding investors with growing dividends for decades.Dividend-growing stocks perform well during inflation as increased income can protect investors’ purchasing power. Various reports revealed that dividend growers exhibited strong performance during previous inflationary periods. The S&amp;P 500 dividend growth has outpaced inflation since 2000, as reported by Wall Street Journal. The report cited S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and Bureau of Economic Analysis data and mentioned that dividends now represent 7.3% of personal income, up from 3.2% in 1980. Another report by ClearBridge Investments showed that dividend growers delivered an annual average return of 11.1% in a 12-month period starting after the rate hikes in 1994 to Q3 2022, versus a 9.2% return of the broader market. Similarly, in 12 months before the Fed rate hike during the same period, dividend growers returned 21.4%, compared with a 15.7% return of the S&amp;P 500.Another important factor worth considering is the payout ratios of dividend companies. This is important to measure the proportion of the company’s earnings that is paid out as dividends to shareholders. Moreover, it also shows the financial health of the company and the stability of its future dividends. Generally, companies with payout ratios below 50% are considered healthy as these companies have sufficient cash flow generation to fulfill shareholder obligations.Story continuesIn view of this, we will discuss companies that are likely to be dividend kings in the future.10 Companies Likely to be Dividend Kings in the FutureOur Methodology:For this article, we shortlisted dividend companies that have raised their payouts for 29 years or more. From that list, we selected companies that have a 5-year average dividend payout ratio of less than 50%, which shows the stability of their future dividends. This also indicates that these companies allocate a healthy portion of their earnings in dividend payouts. The stocks are ranked in descending order of their consecutive years of dividend growth.10. Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB)Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 29  5-Year Average Dividend Payout Ratio: 32.1%Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) is a New Jersey-based insurance company that specializes in personal and commercial property insurance. In January, BMO Capital initiated its coverage on the stock with a Market Perform rating and a $225 price target. The firm expects the company's margins to improve this year.In the fourth quarter of 2022, Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) reported net premiums of $10.55 billion, which showed a 13.2% growth from the same period last year. The company's operating cash flow came in at $2.65 billion. It returned $345 million to shareholders in dividends during the quarter.Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.83 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.57%, as of February 7. The company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 29 years. With a 5-year average dividend payout ratio of 32.1%, CB is likely to be a dividend king in the future.In addition to popular dividend stocks like West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (NYSE:WST), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) is also gaining investors' attention.As of the close of Q3 2022, 41 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB), up from 35 in the previous quarter. These stakes are worth nearly $2 billion collectively. Among these hedge funds, Viking Global was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q3.Aristotle Capital Management mentioned Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Our investment in Chubb began in the fourth quarter of 2015, shortly after ACE Limited announced it would acquire the Chubb Corporation, creating the largest global property and casualty insurance company by underwriting income. During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”9. T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW)Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 37 5-Year Average Dividend Payout Ratio: 38.2%T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.

And in this article, we’ll be looking at seven undervalued blue-chip stocks to consider now. Many pay a dividend that in many cases has been growing for several years. Better, these are the stocks that allow investors to rest easy during volatile times. That makes them an excellent choice for investors who are looking to stay in the market and protect their capital.  Some of the top ones to consider include:JPMJP Morgan Chase$141.09MRKMerck$102.94CVXChevron$169.45CATCaterpillar$247.76AXPAmerican Express$178.86HDHome Depot$331.50TXNTexas Instruments$182.29JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Blue poker chips stacked next to three stacks of $100 bills representing blue chip stocksSource: ShutterstockStrong fundamentals are a distinguishing quality of blue chips. And few banks have the balance sheet of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). That strength was on display in the company’s first-quarter earnings report. JPMorgan reported earnings per share of $3.57 on revenue of $34.55 billion. Both numbers beat analysts’ expectations. The significance of this double beat takes on more significance in a weakening economy. Banks are setting more money aside to protect against rising credit losses. However, as the largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan should have no problem delivering sufficient earnings that will allow it to support its dividend and continue its share repurchases.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsJPMorgan Chase makes this list of undervalued blue chip stocks with a P/E ratio of 11.67. In addition, the JPM stock has been up 34% since the middle of Oct. Analysts suggest there’s approximately 11% upside for the stock price which is supported by a dividend that currently pays out $4 per share on an annual basis and has an appealing yield of 2.88%.  Merck (MRK) Source: ShutterstockMerck (NYSE:MRK) just delivered another strong earnings report. On Feb. 2, the company Merck posted revenue of $13.83 billion and EPS of $1.62. It’s also one of the top undervalued blue-chip stocks to buy now.Story continuesA significant reason for the company’s strong results is likely the strength of the company’s Keytruda drug which has been approved for the treatment of several forms of cancer. Keytruda has become a cornerstone of Merck’s revenue growth since it was approved by the FDA in 2018. In fact, in 2022 it accounted for approximately 40% of the company’s pharmaceutical sales.  Unlike many stocks on this list, Merck did not benefit from the Jan. rally. After being up about 26% in 2022, MRK stock was down more than 6% in Jan. However, the stock trades for around 17x earnings. And the company’s earnings are projected to increase at an average rate of around 10% over the next five years which will be sufficient for future stock price growth.  Chevron (CVX) 10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockWith the performance of energy stocks in 2022, it might surprise you to find an oil stock on this list of undervalued blue-chip stocks. But things are cheap in the oil patch these days. And that’s great news for companies, like Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Trading at around 9x earnings, CVX stock is a bargain, particularly as their stock is down about 5.5% to start the year. The company’s breakeven price for crude oil is well below the current price of around $80 per barrel. And crude prices may be rising as part of the ongoing budget negotiations between the House of Representatives and the Biden administration. And the story of Chevron isn’t limited to fossil fuels. The company is one of the world’s leading exporters of liquefied natural gas (LNG) which is seeing increased demand, particularly from Europe.  Caterpillar (CAT) Source: ShutterstockEarnings reports can make investors prisoners of the moment. In my opinion, that’s the case of the approximately 6% drop in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) stock in the week it reported mixed earnings. The company beat on the top line but missed on the bottom line.  That was enough for investors looking for a reason to clip the wings of CAT stock which was up nearly 40% in the last 12 months. But it could also be that some investors were taking some profit before sending the stock to new highs. The thesis is simple. Much of the spending for the Infrastructure Act is only now making its way into the economy. And the company is also likely to benefit as the oil and gas sector may increase capital spending this year. That means that Caterpillar will likely see strong revenue and earnings growth for the next several quarters.  American Express (AXP) Source: ShutterstockAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) illustrates the bifurcation that’s happening in the U.S. economy. On the one hand, the company’s most recent earnings report showed that the company is having to set aside more of its profits to cover potential charge-offs as delinquencies rise.  This is troubling because American Express is typically associated with higher-income card members. However, investors may be seeing it as a natural, if an unfortunate byproduct of American Express adopting a business model that encourages cardmembers to carry a balance.  On the other hand, the company still is seeing strong revenue growth and is forecasting solid earnings growth for the rest of 2023. The company is benefiting from “high customer growth.” And that premium customer will likely be the company’s focus for the rest of the year.  AXP stock trades for approximately 17x earnings and is up 16.78% in the last month. Despite the earnings report, the stock is still holding on to a 2% gain in the week since releasing earnings.  Home Depot (HD)  the words ""blue chip"" in bold font overtop of a pile of cash. Blue-chip stocksSource: ShutterstockNext on this list of undervalued blue-chip stocks is Home Depot (NYSE:HD). HD stock is up more than 7% in 2023. That’s continuing a rally that started in the last three months of 2022.  The stock of Home Depot and competitors like Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) was hit hard in 2022 as the housing market dried up in the face of higher interest rates. But prices are rallying as the company’s financials are proving the thesis that homeowners are choosing to love the house they have. This is a good reminder that Home Depot is a home improvement store. And that improvement goes on independently of the real estate market.  I considered putting Lowe’s on this list instead of Home Depot. But as of this writing, HD stock is trading at around 20x earnings which is slightly more attractive than LOW stock. And Home Depot pays a more attractive dividend that currently pays out $7.60 per share annually and has been increasing for the last 13 consecutive years.  Texas Instruments (TXN)  Blue poker chips stacked next to three stacks of $100 bills representing blue chip stocksSource: ShutterstockAnalyzing stocks is an imperfect science. In Oct. I listed Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) on a list of semiconductor stocks that were drawing the attention of analysts. So far, that attention has led to TXN stock climbing by about 15%. This reflects renewed optimism surrounding the demand for semiconductor chips in 2023.  This week, General Motors (NYSE:GM) told analysts that it was seeing an unwinding of the supply chain struggles that have suppressed new car production. Since Texas Instruments gets approximately 25% of its revenue from the automotive market, news like this is likely to be bullish for TXN stock. The average new car now has over 3,000 semiconductor chips. TXN stock is currently trading at a price-earnings ratio of around 19x which makes it slightly less expensive than the S&amp;P 500. However, the company does pay a dividend that pays out $4.96 per share on an annual basis and has been increasing for 19 consecutive years.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in CVX.

419,600db57e-a9bf-38ea-a18b-9371e9e0f6a9,MLM,2023-02-09,Analysts Estimate Martin Marietta (MLM) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-martin-marietta-mlm-150003601.html,1675868403,STORY,['MLM'],"[The market expects Martin Marietta (MLM) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 15, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis seller of granite, limestone, sand and gravel is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.02 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.1%.Revenues are expected to be $1.5 billion, up 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8.39% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Martin Marietta?For Martin Marietta, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.07%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Martin Marietta will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Martin Marietta would post earnings of $4.74 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.69, delivering a surprise of -1.05%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Martin Marietta doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

422,86a83dbc-a912-3b2a-8949-f25d295ea981,OXY,2023-02-09,Is There An Opportunity With Occidental Petroleum Corporation's (NYSE:OXY) 35% Undervaluation?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opportunity-occidental-petroleum-corporations-nyse-120022133.html,1675944022,STORY,['OXY'],"[How far off is Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.49bUS$7.90bUS$8.48bUS$8.31bUS$7.91bUS$7.95bUS$8.03bUS$8.13bUS$8.25bUS$8.39bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 0.49%Est @ 0.96%Est @ 1.30%Est @ 1.53%Est @ 1.69% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% US$8.6kUS$6.5kUS$6.3kUS$5.6kUS$4.8kUS$4.4kUS$4.0kUS$3.7kUS$3.4kUS$3.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$50bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 10%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.4b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10%– 2.1%) = US$103bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$103b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$38bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$89b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$63.9, the company appears quite good value at a 35% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Occidental Petroleum as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.401. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Occidental PetroleumStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.OpportunityTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 4 years.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

423,5350bf16-42e6-3b0e-a893-9b296a32d678,OXY,2023-02-09,Investors Heavily Search Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-occidental-petroleum-140002764.html,1675864802,STORY,['OXY'],"[Occidental Petroleum (OXY) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned +0.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, which Occidental falls in, has lost 2.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Occidental is expected to post earnings of $1.74 per share, indicating a change of +17.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.60 points to a change of +276.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 indicates a change of -31.8% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Occidental is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OXY _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Occidental, the consensus sales estimate of $8.65 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +8%. The $37.19 billion and $33.4 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +41.3% and -10.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $9.5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +39.4%. EPS of $2.44 for the same period compares with $0.87 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.35 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.58%. The EPS surprise was -1.61%.Over the last four quarters, Occidental surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The adjusted earnings also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of $3.53 and $3.32, respectively. Strong cystic fibrosis (“CF”) product revenues during the quarter, partially offset by higher research and development expenses, boosted earnings.The company reported total revenues of $2.30 billion, comprised fully of CF product revenues. This figure surpassed both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates of $2.29 billion and $2.26 billion, respectively. Total revenues rose 11% year over year, primarily driven by higher international sales of Trikafta (marketed as Kaftrio in Europe).In the past year, shares of Vertex have risen 28.1% against the industry’s 9.4% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarter in DetailThe company markets four CF products — Trikafta/Kaftrio, Symdeko (marketed as Symkevi in Europe), Orkambi and Kalydeco.CF product sales rose 5% year over year in the United States to $1.46 billion, while sales outside the United States surged 24% to $842 million.Trikafta generated sales worth $2.02 billion, up 19.4% year over year, driven by strong uptakes in international markets and additional patients starting treatment with Trikafta, most notably pediatric patients (6-11 years of age) in the United States. Trikafta sales also beat our model estimate of $1.99 billion.Symdeko/Symkevi registered sales of $34 million in the quarter, down 57.5% year over year.Kalydeco recorded sales of $136 million in the quarter, down 10.5% year over year. Orkambi generated sales of $111 million in the reported quarter, down 24.5% from the prior-year quarter’s levels. Sales of Kalydeco, Symdeko/ Symkevi and Orkambi were hurt by patients switching to Trikafta.Full-Year ResultsFor 2022, Vertex generated revenues of $8.9 billion, reflecting 18% growth year over year.Story continuesFor the same period, the company reported earnings of $14.88 per share, up 54% year over year.Costs RiseAdjusted operating expense was $872 million in the quarter, up 5% from the prior-year quarter’s levels. This rise in expenses was caused by the company to support the clinical development of its pipeline candidates and increased costs incurred by management to support the company’s product launches across the globe.Adjusted research and development (R&amp;D) expenses rose 26.4% from the year-ago quarter’s levels to $623 million due to the expanding the company’s mid- and late-stage pipeline.Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses increased 7.6% to $226 million in the reported quarter due to expenses for CF launches and pre-commercial activities for exa-cel.During the fourth quarter, Vertex recorded acquired IPR&amp;D costs of $23 million compared with $127 million in the year-ago quarter.2023 GuidanceThe company expects total revenues from CF products in the range of $9.55-$9.70 billion for 2023, suggesting a 7-9% year-over-year growth.For the full year, management expects to record adjusted operating expenses in the band of $3.9-$4.0 billion. The adjusted tax rate is expected in the range of 21-22%.Pipeline &amp; Other UpdatesVertex announced that it has filed for label expansions in the U.S. and Europe for using Trikafta/Kaftrio in children aged two to five years. A final decision from the FDA is expected before April 2023-end.Last December, the FDA accepted the company’s IND applicationseeking to start clinical studies on VX-522, an investigational mRNA-based therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF) indication. With this therapy, management intends to target a patient populationwho still cannot benefit from its four marketed CF medicines. This study is expected to begin in early 2023.VX-522 is being developed in collaboration with Moderna MRNA. Vertex and Moderna entered into a collaboration in 2016 to discover and develop mRNA therapeutics for CF. Per the terms of collaboration, Vertex is responsible for leading the preclinical and clinical development of therapies under this collaboration. Moderna is responsible for mRNA and lipid nanoparticle (LNP) process development and manufacturing. Moderna is also eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties on sales of potential products resulting from this collaboration.Apart from CF, Vertex is rapidly advancing its pipeline consisting of rapidly advancing mid- and late-stage candidates across seven disease areas. Vertex stated that programs in five disease areas are entering or progressing through late-stage clinical development.Vertex is co-developing a gene-editing treatment, exa-cel, in partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics CRSP in two devastating diseases — transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT) and sickle cell disease (SCD). Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics started a rolling review submission with the FDA for exa-cel in SCD and TDT indications last November, which is expected to be completed by first-quarter 2023. Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics have also filed similar submissions on exa-cel in Europe, which were validated in fourth-quarter 2022. VRTX expects the CRSP-partnered candidate to be its next commercial launch.Vertex continues to enroll study participants in the ongoing pivotal phase III study evaluating its non-opioid NaV1.8 inhibitor VX-548, as a potential treatment for moderate to severe acute pain following bunionectomy or abdominoplasty surgery. This study is expected to be completed by 2023-end or early 2024.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $10.01 billion, suggesting 5.7% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.For fourth-quarter earnings, the consensus mark is pegged at 45 cents, suggesting flat results from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has moved down 4.3% in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 revenues is pegged at $42.9 billion, suggesting 10.9% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. For 2022 earnings, the consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $2.48, suggesting growth of 6.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days.We expect the company’s fourth-quarter total revenues to increase 1.5% year over year to $9,603.7 million and the bottom line to decline 2% to 44 cents per share. For 2022, we estimate revenue growth of 9.9% to $42,482.7 million and earnings per share growth of 6.6% to $2.47.In the last reported quarter, the leading soft-drink behemoth delivered an earnings surprise of 7.8%. Its bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.8%, on average, over the trailing four quarters.CocaCola Company (The) Price and EPS SurpriseCocaCola Company (The) Price and EPS SurpriseCocaCola Company (The) price-eps-surprise | CocaCola Company (The) QuoteKey Points to NoteCoca-Cola’s performances in recent quarters have been benefiting from strategic transformation and ongoing recovery around the world. The company’s fourth-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and an increase in concentrate sales. Underlying share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels are also expected to have bolstered the performance.The company’s volumes in the fourth quarter are expected to have benefited from the ongoing recovery in markets. Category-wise, volume has been benefiting from growth in trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; the nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; and hydration, sports, coffee and tea categories.Coca-Cola’s fourth-quarter results are likely to reflect gains from innovations and accelerating digital investments. The company has been witnessing a splurge in e-commerce with the growth rate of the channel doubling in many countries. KO has been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities. The company has been consistently strengthening consumer connections and piloting various digital-enabled initiatives through fulfillment methods to capture the online demand, which are likely to have boosted fourth-quarter sales.However, Coca-Cola has been witnessing pressures from higher supply-chain costs, including rising commodity input costs and transportation expenses. The pressures from input cost inflation and other costs are likely to have hurt the company’s performance in the fourth quarter.Coca-Cola has been investing in its markets and brands to support sales growth with higher spending on consumer-facing activities. This has led to higher marketing investments in the past few quarters. Higher marketing spending and an increase in short-term incentives and stock-based compensation are expected to have led to increased selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, the company expected adverse currency rates to hurt the top and bottom lines in the fourth quarter. It expects a currency headwind of 8% on comparable revenues and 9% on comparable earnings per share for the fourth quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Coca-Cola this time around.

NWL is expected to witness year-over-year declines in the top and bottom lines when it reports fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Feb 10, before the opening bell.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 12 cents, which suggests a decline of 71.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days. For quarterly revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $2.24 billion, indicating a decline of 20.2% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.In the last reported quarter, the Atlanta, GA-based company delivered an earnings surprise of 12.8%. Its bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 23.7%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Newell Brands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Newell Brands Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNewell Brands Inc. price-eps-surprise | Newell Brands Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteNewell has been witnessing the continued effects of the tough macro environment, reduced inventory, inflationary pressures and the impact of a stronger dollar. The company’s sales for the to-be-reported quarter are likely to have been affected by the adverse impacts of the sale of the Connected Home &amp; Security (CH&amp;S) business, unfavorable foreign currency, and exit of its category and retail store. The company is also expected to have been affected by the significant inflation in food, housing and energy, leading to reduced consumer discretionary spending.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected the aforementioned headwinds to persist in the near term. Newell also predicted the discretionary spending levels to remain constrained.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management envisioned fourth-quarter 2022 net sales to be $2.18-$2.26 billion, with a core sales decline of 9-12%. For the quarter, the company expects a normalized operating margin of 5.1-6.5% and normalized earnings of 9-14 cents per share. The guidance includes the impacts of unfavorable foreign currency, closures of Yankee Candle stores, and the exit of certain product categories, particularly in the Outdoor &amp; Recreation, and Home Appliances segments.Moreover, the company expects 2022 results to reflect the adverse impacts of unfavorable foreign currency and inflation. It anticipates net sales of $9.35-$9.43 billion, with core sales expected to decline 3-4% in 2022, excluding the contribution from the CH&amp;S business. The company anticipates a normalized operating margin of 10-10.3%. Normalized earnings per share are forecast to be $1.56-$1.61 for 2022.However, Newell has been benefiting from the actions to accelerate productivity and efficiency by accelerating fuel productivity plans, driving automation and fully implementing Project Ovid. Increased focus on revenue growth management, aggressive efforts to reduce SKU and supply network optimization are expected to have aided the fourth-quarter performance. Also, the company’s stringent cost-cutting plans, such as rightsizing overhead costs based on the simplification agenda, are likely to have boosted margins and the bottom line to some extent.Newell’s fourth-quarter results are expected to reflect the positive effects of leveraging its robust e-commerce capabilities, which have been strong for some time due to the increasing shifts to the online platform. The company has been strengthening its e-commerce business via increased investments and better customer engagement.

Recovery across markets and channels, a nag for innovative products, robust demand for premium and high-quality products, market share growth, and improved pricing have been the key trends in the Beverage industry, which are expected to have bolstered the performances of participants in the fourth quarter of 2022.Beverage companies have been putting their best foot forward to spice up their product lines. The companies have been continually developing products by blending the best qualities of different drinks, which has been blurring the lines between product categories. Notably, the Ready-to-Drink (RTD) has emerged as the fastest-growing alcohol category since 2018.Beverage companies are also expected to have gained from accelerating digital investments. Companies have been investing in the latest capabilities and leveraging technology to better connect with customers and consumers to expand their digital capabilities.

Effective marketing and exceptional commercial execution have been boosting the sales of beverage companies.However, players in the beverage industry are anticipated to have witnessed higher advertising and promotional expenses, and SG&amp;A costs. These are expected to have hurt margins in the quarter under review. Elevated ingredient and other input costs, including shipping and freight, labor, trucking, fuel, co-packing fees, secondary packaging materials, and increased outbound freight costs, are expected to have resulted in increased costs of sales and higher operating costs, denting the gross and operating margins in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesHow to Identify Potential Outperformers?With the fourth-quarter earnings season in full swing, it is worthwhile to invest in companies with earnings beat potential, as a stock generally rallies on an earnings beat.A strategy to arrive at the potential winners is by picking stocks that have the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

435,063bb4c0-43d0-347c-84ef-d0c9a680da0a,KO,2023-02-09,12 NASDAQ Penny Stocks Under 10 Cents,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-nasdaq-penny-stocks-under-144753090.html,1675867673,STORY,"['KO', 'PG', 'LGSTU', 'ENERU', 'IQMDU', 'SBIG']","[In this article, we discuss 12 NASDAQ penny stocks under 10 cents. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 NASDAQ Penny Stocks Under 10 Cents. According to Morgan Stanley, it is possible that stocks will see robust performance in the first half of this year, though the threat of a recession in the latter half cannot be disregarded. Investors should be on the lookout for value stock opportunities and those in the Asia ex-Japan region. Over the 12-month period following a midterm election year like 2022, the S&amp;P 500 has historically seen an average increase of 33%. The trend has held true in every midterm election year thus far, suggesting a promising outlook for the current quarter. Additionally, economic indicators remain robust – such as GDP and employment rate – which means there will not be a collapse in first quarter earnings. The strong performance of financials, industrials, and materials sectors in recent months also suggests that a first quarter collapse in earnings may not occur, as prices of these cyclical stocks typically decrease before the economy weakens. Emerging markets are believed to be in the early stages of outperforming due to the declining trend of the US dollar since September 2022. This has led to non-US markets performing better, with Asia ex-Japan leading the charge since October 2022, followed by Europe and Japan. These markets have also outperformed the US. Based on the trend of outperforming emerging markets, Asia ex-Japan, particularly China, is considered to be an attractive equity area for 2023.On February 7, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the process of disinflation has begun and that he anticipates significant decreases in inflation this year. These comments align with what he said after a recent policy-setting meeting, which many in the market expected him to retract. Powell's comments at the Economic Club of Washington have boosted investor confidence in a possible easing of monetary tightening, even though he emphasized that returning inflation to the Fed's 2% target will take time and will not be a smooth process. Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Jersey, told Reuters: Story continues""He seems to reiterate the fact that in his view inflation is cresting. That's been the biggest fear for participants in the market: that with all the rate increases, that in the Fed's view no real progress is being made against inflation. And he's saying 'no, it's having its effect.'"" According to futures, the Federal Reserve's overnight lending rate is expected to reach its peak of 5.12% in the summer and then decrease to 4.785% by December, due to the anticipation of Fed rate cuts as the economy slows down. Phil Orlando, the chief equity strategist at Federated Hermes in New York, has expressed concerns about the stock market due to a slowing economy, rising corporate expenses, and declining profit margins. He noted: ""The stock market is overvalued. The Street hasn't quite figured that out in terms of what the implication is for the full year. You have the sword of Damocles hanging over the market's head during a period seasonally where the market tends to struggle anyway.""Despite a dire market outlook and anticipation for an improved future, the stock market will continue to make moves. Penny stocks are frequently ignored by investors who prefer blue chip stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). However, investing in penny stocks, which are stocks that trade for less than $5 per share, has several advantages that make them an appealing option. The low stock price allows investors to buy more shares, which can enhance their potential gains. Additionally, penny stocks, due to their smaller market value and elevated risk, have the possibility of yielding much higher returns than blue chip stocks. Penny stocks are characterized by high volatility, resulting in rapid price changes within a short period. This feature presents both opportunities for substantial profits as well as significant losses. Although the investment in penny stocks comes with more risk, it offers the prospect of investing in companies with robust growth prospects and the chance for quick, substantial returns. Penny stocks also present investors with a distinct possibility to attain long-term gains not typically found in blue chip investments. Our Methodology We used a stock screener and filtered stocks listed on the NASDAQ exchange which were also priced under 10 cents on February 7.

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Most Valuable Beverage Brands in the World.From the early 1900s, the beverage market was modestly equipped by some regional manufacturers that only had the capacity of supplying to local markets. However, this industry has seen giant cooperation and trade internationally. Although the ingredients and production process vary according to each typical type of drink, there are certain trends that overcome the beverage industry. An example of this is the seltzer boom of the past few years, where drinks with subtle displays of flavor have taken center stage. With the seltzer market beginning to saturate, beverage makers are now seeking ways to differentiate from the competition, opting for bigger and bolder profiles. With health and wellness continuing to drive trends as we move further into 2023, beverage brands will opt for simplicity in beverage formulations across the board.The beverage industry has an enormous growth potential given the constant upheavals and changing trends. Several reports suggest that consumers now prefer healthy beverages over sugary sodas and traditional drinks. According to a report by MarketResearch.com, the global beverage market is expected to grow from $1,561.084 billion in 2019 to $1,859.278 billion by 2026 increasing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.53% over the period. The market is projected to grow at a decent rate during the forecast period owing to the growing per capita global consumption of drinks in major developing regions owing to rising disposable income and changing preferences of consumers towards ready-to-drink beverages. However, rising health concerns regarding the sugar content of packed beverages coupled with health concerns regarding the consumption of alcohol may hinder the growth of the market during the forecast period.Story continuesAs is the case with most industries out there, Asia Pacific is the strongest growing segment and the largest segment of the market as well due to a large population and rapidly rising incomes.

437,557ecd64-825e-3fdc-a84f-ad84998c6f4b,KO,2023-02-09,The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) insiders sold US$14m worth of stock suggesting impending weakness.,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-company-nyse-ko-140049990.html,1675864849,STORY,['KO'],"[Over the past year, many The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Coca-Cola Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President &amp; CFO, John Murphy, sold US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$62.29 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$60.07. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Coca-Cola shares, than buying. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Coca-Cola Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Coca-Cola shares. In total, Senior VP &amp; Chief Technical and Innovation Officer Nancy Quan dumped US$840k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes Coca-Cola Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Coca-Cola insiders own 0.6% of the company, worth about US$1.7b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Coca-Cola Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought Coca-Cola stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. On the plus side, Coca-Cola makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that Coca-Cola has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.But note: Coca-Cola may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned -3.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7% change. During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which Coke falls in, has lost 2.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.45 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.48 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +6.9%. This estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.55 indicates a change of +2.7% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Coke is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for KO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Coke, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.01 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $42.86 billion and $44.22 billion estimates indicate +10.9% and +3.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $11.06 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.2%. EPS of $0.69 for the same period compares with $0.65 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.37%. The EPS surprise was +7.81%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 17.35%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 7%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Intuit as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be February 23, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Intuit to post earnings of $1.43 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 7.74%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $2.9 billion, up 8.44% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $13.64 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion. These totals would mark changes of +15.11% and +10.8%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Intuit.

Ultimately, 250 resilient, energy-efficient homes will be completed in five years, and findings from the initiative will be used to create resources that can be scaled and implemented across the U.S.Whirlpool Corporation funds two types of grants that Habitat for Humanity affiliates use to help construct BuildBetter with Whirlpool homes:1. BuildBetter with Whirlpool Code-Plus GrantsUsed to increase the efficiency and resilience of a new home build through both energy-efficiency AND hazard-resilience measures. Construction practices or materials used in the homes will exceed building code minimum requirements. Most of the projects of this type will be funded over the three years of the program. 12 HOMES are in Whirlpool Corp. manufacturing plant communities2. BuildBetter with Whirlpool Renewable Energy GrantsUsed to install a solar power system on at least one home. For the first two years, these grants were only open to California affiliates. In the third year, any affiliate in the U.S. can apply. Nine projects will be funded over three years.Energy resilient means the homes are designed and built to conserve energy, resulting in lower operating costs and the ability to better maintain interior temperature and function in times of energy scarcity. Examples of how homes are made energy resilient include increasing insulation, using high-efficiency heating and cooling equipment and installing energy efficient appliances.Hazard resilient means the structures are designed and built to reduce damage caused by disasters. Adding more roof fastening hardware, tape-sealing roof deck seams, using water-resistant insulation and fire-resistant siding are examples of hazard resilient options affiliates may choose to add to homes using grant funds.Story continuesAnother determinant the BuildBetter with Whirlpool homes will have to measure resiliency is through the Home Energy Rating System, or HERS, a nationally recognized energy-use rating scale for residential construction. The lower the number, the less energy used. A typical home in the U.S. is at about 100 or more. The homes in BuildBetter with Whirlpool will be 60 or below, with some going below zero due to on-site power generation, renewable energy systems.Results from the first phase of the program have been positive. A total of 58 energy and hazard resilience projects were completed in 20 states. The average HERS rating was 54, with the lowest being 11.Twelve homes are in areas where Whirlpool Corporation has manufacturing plants.The second phase of the program was built upon the success of the first phase, completing 85 energy and hazard resilience projects in 31 states, with 12 additional homes in areas where Whirlpool Corp. has plant locations.The goals for the third phase of the program include 120 projects in 82 locations, with 70 additional U.S. markets in a minimum of 30 states, with three renewable energy installations (solar panels).At the end of the third phase, a formal evaluation of post-occupancy energy use and performance measurement of BuildBetter with Whirlpool homes will be conducted by Habitat for Humanity's U.S. Research and Measurement (USRM) team in partnership with Auburn University Rural Studio®. The study will collect data from homeowners, including a Homeowner survey on energy use habits and utility data collection at the monthly aggregate level. Energy data collection equipment will be installed in some homes for real-time information. The results, which will be published in 2025, will be compared to non-BuildBetter with Whirlpool Habitat homes and to national Residential Energy Consumption data.The results are expected to show that Whirlpool Corporation's investment in affordable, climate-resilient housing helps protect the planet, and passes on energy reduction cost savings to homeowners who need it most.View original content hereWhirlpool Corporation, Wednesday, February 8, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Whirlpool Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Whirlpool CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/whirlpool-corporationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Whirlpool CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/738547/BuildBetter-With-Whirlpool-Progress-and-Outcomes]"

449,5ea246bc-efc5-36b7-afc7-f4bc8d884d3a,SRE,2023-02-09,L.A. is shutting down its largest gas plant — and replacing it with an unproven hydrogen project,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/l-shutting-down-largest-gas-005452858.html,1675904092,STORY,['SRE'],"[The Los Angeles City Council's approval of an $800-million plan to convert the city's largest gas-fired power plant to green hydrogen is being hailed as the kind of project needed to solve the climate crisis. But critics say keeping the Scattergood Generating Station open would harm vulnerable communities. (Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times)The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously Wednesday to move forward with an $800-million plan to convert the city's largest gas-fired power plant to green hydrogen — a first-of-its-kind project that was hailed by supporters as an important step to solve the climate crisis but slammed by critics as a greenwashing boondoggle that will harm vulnerable communities.Council President Paul Krekorian described hydrogen as crucial to meeting L.A.'s goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035.""It was widely seen as being an impossible goal. And we're now on the precipice of achieving that,"" he said.The vote authorized the L.A. Department of Water and Power to begin the contracting process for revamping Scattergood Generating Station, which sits along the coast near El Segundo.DWP plans to install turbines capable of burning significant quantities of hydrogen, which has never been done before on such a large scale. The fuel would be produced from water, with renewable electricity — from solar panels or wind turbines, for instance — splitting H2O molecules into hydrogen and oxygen atoms.The city-run utility hopes to ultimately convert its other gas plants to hydrogen as well: Harbor and Haynes farther down the coast, and Valley Generating Station in Sun Valley. Those facilities wouldn't be fired up often, but they would help Los Angeles keep the lights on during times when there's not enough solar and wind power to go around, such as hot summer nights.The city's ultimate goal is burning 100% green hydrogen — but DWP officials have acknowledged the technology might not be ready right away. That means the initial fuel mix at Scattergood might include more planet-warming natural gas than hydrogen.Jason Rondou, DWP's director of resource planning, told The Times that Scattergood should be able to burn at least 30% green hydrogen on Day One — the same percentage the utility is targeting at its coal-fired Intermountain Power Plant in Utah.Story continues""There's a lot of things that need to be figured out over the coming years,"" Rondou said.That uncertainty helps explain why many climate and environmental justice activists opposed Wednesday's City Council motion.A smokestack at Scattergood Generating Station near El Segundo. (Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times)In public comments before the vote, critics from groups including Communities for a Better Environment, Pacoima Beautiful and the Sierra Club noted that although hydrogen doesn't produce planet-warming carbon emissions when burned, it does generate lung-damaging nitrogen oxide pollution — much more than gas, at least using current technology.That's especially problematic for low-income communities of color that have already suffered from years of fossil fuel pollution — like those around DWP's Valley Generating Station, where residents were forced to live with a years-long methane leak.Jasmin Vargas, an organizer with Food and Water Watch, described hydrogen as ""fundamentally racist and inequitable."" She also objected to public comments from labor union and business leaders saying hydrogen would create good-paying jobs.""The jobs that everybody's talking about are not clean energy jobs,"" she said.Other activists pointed to the risk of explosions from hydrogen leaks and to research finding that hydrogen can worsen climate change in the short term if too much of it leaks from pipelines before it’s burned. They also raised the possibility that DWP's experimental green hydrogen project could fail, leaving L.A. stuck burning natural gas when the city instead could have invested more heavily in battery storage, energy efficiency and other strategies to ditch fossil fuels while keeping the lights on.""DWP should go back to the drawing board,"" said Theo Caretto, a UCLA legal fellow at Communities for a Better Environment.After hearing from opponents and supporters, the council voted 12 to 0 to move forward with the hydrogen plan — but only after approving a separate motion that newly elected Councilmembers Traci Park and Katy Young Yaroslavsky said would require DWP officials to more closely examine alternatives and more robustly engage with communities near the gas plant.""Even with the additional oversight, safeguards and engagement, I am still very reluctant to vote to move this project forward,"" Yaroslavsky said before the vote. ""However, I am willing to support allowing the process to move to the next stage so that we can all collectively gather more information and understand its risks and its alternatives.""It's not yet clear, though, whether the City Council would be able to stop the Scattergood conversion if something went awry — costs spiraling out of control, for instance, or an inability by DWP to reduce nitrogen oxide pollution from burning hydrogen.Further steps in the contracting process must be approved by the DWP board, whose members are appointed by the mayor. The City Council can override those decisions — but only with 10 supporting votes from the 15-member council, a high bar to clear.A view of Los Angeles City Hall on Jan. 19. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)In 2021, L.A. got one-quarter of its electricity from natural gas — a major contributor to the worsening fires, droughts and heat waves of the climate crisis. Gas usage on California's power grid as a whole was even higher, at 38% — roughly the same as the country overall.Green hydrogen has emerged in the U.S. and around the world as a potential substitute for natural gas on the electric grid — as well as gas piped to homes for heating and cooking. It's one of many relatively high-cost technologies competing to complement low-cost solar panels, wind turbines and battery storage to zero out global climate pollution by midcentury.Many climate activists do see a role for hydrogen — but mostly in ""hard to electrify"" industries where switching from dirty fuels to clean electricity is expected to be too expensive, such as shipping, aviation, steelmaking and potentially long-haul trucking. Those activists' preferred technology is hydrogen fuel cells, which produce no pollution and can power heavy-duty trucks.Activists are also cautious because the vast majority of hydrogen currently in use globally is produced from fossil fuels, adding to the climate crisis. The renewable ""electrolysis"" method for producing hydrogen planned by DWP is costlier and less efficient.Adding to the skepticism over green hydrogen is that its loudest proponents are often fossil fuel companies.In Los Angeles, that would be Southern California Gas Co., the nation's largest gas utility. Last year, the company proposed Angeles Link, a massive and potentially lucrative pipeline that would bring green hydrogen fuel to the L.A. Basin.“It allows California to dramatically advance its climate and environmental goals,” SoCalGas President Maryam Brown said at the time. “It creates a cornerstone for the California green hydrogen economy, and the hydrogen economy in general.""""Southern California Gas is an infrastructure company. And we use that infrastructure to be able to meet customers’ needs,” she added. “Customers’ needs are changing. We see our customers needing cleaner and cleaner fuels.”In an email ahead of the City Council's vote Wednesday, SoCalGas spokesperson Chris Gilbride said company executives ""have not been engaged, and are currently not engaged, on the Scattergood project.""But there's little question it could be a boon for SoCalGas, fueling demand for the company's proposed pipeline and potentially leading to more widespread use of hydrogen.Federal dollars could also accelerate L.A.'s hydrogen plans. The City Council voted last year to apply for a share of $8 billion in federal ""hydrogen hub"" funds, allocated by Congress as part of the bipartisan infrastructure bill signed by President Biden in 2021.Whether or not that money materializes, DWP's Rondou said Los Angeles has little choice but to bet on hydrogen.""We certainly looked at all the different pathways to get to 100%"" clean energy, he said, referring to an in-depth study conducted with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. ""But the study was clear. ... There wasn't an alternative.""This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Ergo, when we looked at the ROCE trends at LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE:LYB), we liked what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for LyondellBasell Industries, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$6.1b ÷ (US$36b - US$7.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, LyondellBasell Industries has an ROCE of 21%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Chemicals industry average of 12%. Check out our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries roceIn the above chart we have measured LyondellBasell Industries' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From LyondellBasell Industries' ROCE Trend?It's hard not to be impressed by LyondellBasell Industries' returns on capital. The company has consistently earned 21% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 40% in that time. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. You'll see this when looking at well operated businesses or favorable business models.Story continuesThe Bottom LineLyondellBasell Industries has demonstrated its proficiency by generating high returns on increasing amounts of capital employed, which we're thrilled about. In light of this, the stock has only gained 19% over the last five years for shareholders who have owned the stock in this period. That's why it could be worth your time looking into this stock further to discover if it has more traits of a multi-bagger.LyondellBasell Industries does have some risks, we noticed   5 warning signs  (and 1 which shouldn't be ignored)  we think you should know about.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.Dennis McDaniel: Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our year-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors.

On this call, you'll first hear from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Johnston; and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions.At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including President, Steve Spray, and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Investment Officer, Steve Solaria, Chief Claims Officer, Mark Schambow, and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer. First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP.Story continuesNow I'll turn over the call to Steve.Steve Johnston: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. We see positive momentum in several areas and are bullish (ph) about our future prospects despite 2022 financial results that were somewhat below our expectations. Challenges during the year included elevated inflation and higher losses from natural catastrophe events for us and the property casualty industry, in addition to the market volatility affecting the valuation of investment portfolios. Our experience in managing adversity, coupled with the company's financial strength allows us to maintain a long-term view and supports our confidence as we execute our plans. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2022 was just over $1 billion, that's 31% or $457 million less than last year's outstanding fourth quarter, largely due to $307 million less benefit on an after-tax basis in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio.Non-GAAP operating income of $202 million for the fourth quarter was down $118 million from a year ago, including catastrophe losses that were $66 million higher on an after-tax basis. Our 94.9% fourth quarter property casualty combined ratio was 10.7 percentage points higher than the 84.2% for the fourth quarter of last year, which was amongst the best combined ratios we've ever recorded. We think longer-term comparisons are also important. On a current accident year basis, excluding catastrophe losses, our 90.2% combined ratio compares favorably with each of the five years prior to 2020 and was 1.5 percentage points better than the average for that period with each accident year measured as of the respective year-end. On a calendar year basis, our 2022 combined ratio experienced a larger negative impact from catastrophe losses than in 2021, as they increased 4.2 percentage points for the fourth quarter and 1.2 points for the year.Inflation also pressured our combined ratio throughout 2022, contributing to less favorable results for both the current accident year and for reserve development on prior accident years as we have increased reserves for estimated ultimate losses. We've responded with actions to improve underwriting selection and pricing, including premium rate increases and increased expectations by underwriters as they factor inflationary trends into areas such as risk selection criteria, pricing of policies and adjusting premium factors for changes in exposure. We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to improve results next year with a 2023 GAAP combined ratio in the low to mid-90% range. We also believe our 2023 property casualty premium growth rate can be 8% or more.We recognize that weather and significant changes in industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends or some of the variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report. In recent quarters, we've noted that commercial umbrella loss experience has been elevated. Although, still elevated in the fourth quarter, it was to a less degree than earlier in 2022. While recent profitability for our commercial umbrella business is not as strong as we previously estimated after strengthening reserves during 2020. The average combined ratio for the years 2018 through 2022 is still good, below 85% on a calendar year basis and below 90% on an accident year basis with development through year end 2022. Overall premium growth was very good and continues to incorporate pricing segmentation.Our underwriters work to retain and write more profitable accounts while also addressing ones that we determine have inadequate pricing. They do an excellent job serving Cincinnati Insurance appointed agencies that are outstanding at producing business for us. Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 10% for the fourth quarter and 13% for the full year 2022, that includes a 13% increase in fourth quarter renewal written premiums with a significant portion from higher levels of insured exposures as we factor in elevated inflation. In addition to exposures increases, our Commercial Lines Insurance segment continued to experience estimated average renewal price increases in the mid-single digit percentage range, higher than the third quarter.Our Excess and Surplus Lines Insurance segment continued in the high-single digit range. Personal lines average renewal price increases were at the high end of the low-single digits with both auto and homeowner higher than in the third quarter. As we previously disclosed, we expect premium rates for our personal auto line of business will continue to rise. Based on our rate filings that have averaged low double-digit rate increases for policies effective beginning January 1, 2023, we expect the full year 2023 personal auto written premium effect will be an average premium rate increase of approximately 10%. Policy retention rates improved from year end 2021 with our Commercial Lines segment moving higher in the upper 80% range. In our Personal Lines segment, rising to the low to mid-90% range.Moving on to highlight premium growth and profitability by Insurance segment. The Commercial Lines segment grew both fourth quarter and full year 2022 net written premiums 9%. Its combined ratio for both the quarter and full year 2022 was approximately 99%. That's above where we aim for and reflects elevated inflation effects and catastrophe losses that were higher than a year ago. For our personal lines segment, net written premium grew 16% for the quarter and 15% for the full year 2022, as we continued our planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies. Its full year combined ratio was approximately 99% and reflected elevated inflation effects and is likewise above our near-term profit target. We have confidence that our proven long-term strategy and near-term actions we have taken will blend to improve results for both commercial and personal lines.Our Excess and Surplus Line segment finished the year with a 90.4% combined ratio, a good result, combined with 2022 net written premium growing 18%. Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global each had another year of healthy growth. Cincinnati Re grew full year 2022 net written premiums by 27% with a combined ratio of 97.4%. Cincinnati Global had a 2022 combined ratio of 88.9% with net written premiums growing 23%. Our life insurance subsidiary continued its good performance with full year 2022 net income of $66 million, up 50% from a year ago and term life insurance earned premiums grew by 5%. On January 1 of this year, we again renewed each of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. Our strong capital supports retaining additional risk and managing cost of rising reinsurance ceded premiums.Technology, Business, MeetingPhoto by Campaign Creators on UnsplashFor our per risk treaties, terms and conditions for 2023 are fairly similar to 2022, other than premium rate increases that averaged approximately 13%. The primary objective of our property casualty treaty -- catastrophe treaty is to protect our balance sheet. The treaty's main change this year is retaining a greater share of losses for layers of coverage than what was effect for 2022, while adding $92 million of coverage in a new layer between $900 million and $1.1 billion. In 2023, we'll retain all of the first $200 million of losses and the share of the next $900 million for a catastrophe event compared with 2022 when we retained the first $100 million and the share of the next $800 million. Should we experience a 2023 catastrophe event totaling $1.1 billion in losses, we'll retain $542 million compared with $499 million in 2022 for an event of that magnitude.We expect 2023 ceded premiums for these treaties in total to be approximately $130 million, approximately $16 million or 14% higher than the actual $114 million of ceded premiums for these treaties in 2022. Our investment department continued to perform quite well, and Mike will provide some details. Investments is another area where we like to keep an eye on longer-term trends. For example, for the five years ended with 2022, our equity portfolio, compound annual total shareholder return was 11.1%, 170 basis points better than the S&amp;P 500 Index. I'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Net income before investment gains or losses contributed favorably to VCR 2.1% for the fourth quarter and 5.2% for the full year 2022.The contribution from valuation of our investment portfolio was mixed, 10.5% favorable for the quarter, but unfavorable by 19.4% for the year due to challenges for both the stock and bond markets. A positive VCR of 12.8% for the quarter improved our 2022 full year VCR to negative 14.6%. Although that's below our expectations for a typical year, the 11.2% annual average over the past five years is within our annual average target range of 10% to 13%. Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will add comments about several other important points for evaluating our financial performance.Michael Sewell: Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income continued to grow at an outstanding pace, up 12% for the fourth quarter and 9% for full year 2022 compared with the same periods of last year. Dividend income rose 7% for the quarter. Net equity securities purchased during 2022 totaled $36 million. Bond interest income was up 11% in the fourth quarter. The pretax average yield of 4.16% for the fixed maturity portfolio was 17 basis points higher than a year ago. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds continue to rise to 5.01% during full year 2022. We continue to emphasize investing in fixed maturity securities with net purchases during the year totaling $788 million.Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2022 were favorable in aggregate for both our stock and bond holdings. The overall net gain for the quarter was nearly $1.3 billion before tax effects, including an additional $230 million of unrealized gains in our bond portfolio. At the end of 2022, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $4.7 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $5.5 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $847 million. Cash flow, in addition to rising bond yields contributed to the 7% increase in interest income we reported for the year. Cash flow from operating activities for full year 2022 generated almost $2.1 billion, a record high amount, up 4% from a year ago.For the fourth quarter of this year, it rose 36%. Turning to expense management. Our objective is to appropriately balance expense control with continuing to make strategic investments in our business. The full year 2022 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.2 percentage points lower than last year reflecting lower accruals for agency profit-sharing commissions. Regarding loss reserves, our approach remains consistent and target net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. We have now had $34 million of net favorable development on prior accident years. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business.During 2022, our net increase in the property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $1.029 billion, a 15% increase from the net reserve balance at year end 2021. The IBNR portion of that reserve addition was $765 million a further indication of the quality of our balance sheet. For full year 2022, we experienced $159 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 2.3 percentage points. Of that $159 million in net favorable development, $25 million of the net unfavorable amount from our commercial casualty lines of business, including an unfavorable $41 million for commercial umbrella and a net favorable $16 million for other coverages included in commercial casualty.On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the full year 2022 included favorable $96 million for 2021, favorable $124 million for 2020, unfavorable $72 million for 2019 and a favorable $11 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2019. Our approach to capital management also remains consistent, and we repurchased shares that include maintenance intended to offset shares issued through equity compensation plans. We still believe we have plenty of flexibility and also believe that our financial strength is in great shape. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we repurchased just over 101,000 shares at an average price per share of $109.55. As in the past, I'll conclude with a summary of the fourth quarter contributions to book value per share.They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.47. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.10. Investment income, other than life insurance and net of non-insurance items added $0.83. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $1.14. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $5.15. And we declared $0.69 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $7 per share during the fourth quarter to $67.01 per share. Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.Steve Johnston: Thanks, Mike. We faced a number of challenges in 2022 and still recorded an underwriting profit for our insurance business. That result bolsters our belief that we'll see future benefits from our efforts to continually refine pricing precision and segmentation and our efforts to expand our geographic footprint and produce -- and product offerings. When you consider our financial strength, our experienced service-oriented associates and our Premier Agency force, I'm confident we'll be able to continue delivering shareholder value far into the future. Our Board of Directors shares that confidence and expressed it by increasing our quarterly cash dividend 9% last month, setting the stage for a 63 year of rising dividend payments.So that's not just paying the dividend for 63 straight years. That sets the stage for increasing the dividend for a 63 consecutive year. We believe that's a record that can only be matched by seven other publicly traded U.S. companies. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Soloria, Marc Schambow and Theresa Hoffer. Cole, please open the call for questions.See also 20 Least Populated States in America and 13 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

It has also prompted a lawsuit from shareholders and a U.S. Department of Transportation investigation.The Dallas-based airline attributed the breakdown in service to a ""historic"" winter storm, both in size and scale, which caused frozen jet bridges and icy aircraft engines.It has also defended its computer system, saying the technology ""worked as designed,"" while adding the airline has tapped General Electric Co to improve crew rescheduling capability and hired consultant Oliver Wyman, a unit of Marsh McLennan, to recommend operational changes.Southwest's Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson repeated that message in his testimony, saying the airline experienced a ""historic event"" with a combination of challenges it had not confronted before.""What began as a weather event on December 21st turned into a crew scheduling event by December 24th,"" said Watterson.But Southwest's pilot union, which is in contract negotiations with Southwest, blames the company and its leadership for a ""failure"" to modernize crew management processes and technology and to prepare for the storm.Casey Murray, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA) said the union has been sounding the alarm about the carrier's crew scheduling technology and ""outdated"" operational processes for years.Story continues""Unfortunately, those warnings were summarily ignored,"" he said.The debacle has put Chief Executive Bob Jordan in the eye of a storm as he faces pressure to restore the airline's credibility and regain the trust of customers, just one year after he took the helm.Jordan has apologized and taken responsibility for the troubles, vowing to prevent a repeat.Murray said while Jordan inherited a ""massive, complex operation held together by duct tape and baling wire,"" he must show through actions that the company is serious about change.The committee had asked Jordan to testify but Southwest said the hearing conflicted with other commitments, including an employee rally in Baltimore on Wednesday.

This brought the total federal debt to over $31 trillion.With the current Fed Funds rate at 4.25% to 4.5%, that puts the estimated yearly interest payment on the nation’s debt at over $575 billion for 2023. For comparison, the U.S. paid roughly $475 billion in 2022 and $352 billion in 2021.To stay updated with top startup investments, sign up for Benzinga’s Startup Investing &amp; Equity Crowdfunding NewsletterAs this number continues to spiral, there’s no clear answer on how to get it under control. If the central bank begins printing more money to repurchase the debt “that’s how you get hyperinflation,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, former chair of the Fed, said in a 2019 investors conference.What investors can do: Inflation is a difficult concept from an investing perspective. You can’t hold cash because you’re losing purchasing power while you wait for inflation to pass. With inflation rates hitting as much as 9.1% in recent years, you’re effectively losing a substantial amount of money by holding it. But as markets have shown, the uncertainty causes high-growth stocks to decline substantially, and inflation can hurt margins, causing earnings misses and stock declines. Rising interest rates also could begin to cripple any company already struggling or relying on debt to fund growth and operations.Story continuesTraditionally, one of the best ways to weather this storm is investing in companies focused on products or services that are in high demand regardless of economic conditions. For example, healthcare companies have performed well compared with the overall market. UnitedHealth Group Inc. is up 2.8% in the past year, despite many companies declining in the same period. UnitedHealth also has a yearly dividend of $6.60 per share further adding to its performance.For those with a longer investment timeline and higher risk tolerance, startups can also be a strong option. Valuations are currently suppressed and many don’t have debt because they raised funds from venture capital or retail investors. Sensate, for example, is a startup raising on Wefunder, which means anyone can invest for a limited time. The startup has created a patented solution to stress relief and raised over $2 million from everyday investors and venture capitalists.Other easily recognizable brands like Walmart Inc. can be strong options, depending on your investment thesis. As the Fed works to address these issues, investors can look to both find value in suppressed companies and pivot to safer options until a clearer plan is in place to address these concerns around the looming national debt crisis.See more on startup investing from Benzinga.Never Lose Your Things Again — The Startup Pouring Gasoline on the Apple AirTagMartin Tobias Invested in Google, DocuSign, OpenSea and Over a Dozen Other Unicorns — Here’s What Startup He Is Investing in Next and How to Invest Alongside HimOriginal story found here.Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

460,dafd8635-12ba-36a0-9ce0-2a4b76148420,UNH,2023-02-09,The 3 Most Undervalued Growth Stocks for Your February Buy List,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-most-undervalued-growth-stocks-111504303.html,1675682104,STORY,['UNH'],"[Undervalued growth stocks are often overlooked by investors, they can offer significant potential for capital appreciation.One way to identify undervalued growth stocks is to look for companies with high revenue and earnings growth, but low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. A low P/E ratio means that the stock is trading at a lower multiple of its earnings compared to other stocks in the same industry or market.Another way to identify undervalued growth stocks is to look for companies with strong fundamentals such as high return on equity (ROE) and strong balance sheets. These companies are typically more financially stable and have a better chance of weathering market downturns.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsUNHUnitedHealth Group $472.02BNTXBioNTech$142.06UMCUnited Microelectronics $8.40UnitedHealth Group (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) might not initially appear to be an undervalued growth stock but it is. The healthcare giant provides health insurance, healthcare coverage and related software and consultancy services. In short, it’s more aligned with defensive stocks than growth stocks, at least at first blush. But dig a little deeper and you’ll see that UnitedHealth saw its fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth to end the fiscal year 2022. The growth narrative behind the company is actually very apparent. UnitedHealth’s current return on equity is at a 10-year high of 26.94. This means UnitedHealth uses the equity shareholders provide to create a strong net income for the company. UNH stock doesn’t boast a strong P/E ratio.  However, it does boast a healthy return on invested capital that exceeds its weighted average cost of capital by 3% over the last 12 months. That financial strength, combined with its dividend and 2022 top-line results, makes UNH stock undervalued indeed. BioNTech (BNTX) The headquarters of BioNTech (BNTX) in Germany.Source: Palatinate Stock / Shutterstock.comStory continuesBioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock is significantly undervalued according to Wall Street. Analysts there believe it should trade for $211 yet it currently trades well below that. Other sites that rely on metrics-based comparisons, like Gurufocus, believe its value is actually more than 10X higher, at $2,037. BioNTech is essentially undergoing the hangover that comes from having successfully co-developed a Covid-19 vaccine with Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). It is now dealing with the resultant waning revenues as the pandemic fades. Analysts believe BioNTech will report around $17.95 billion in 2022 but a far smaller $10.09 billion in 2023.  But BioNTech continues to ride its Covid-19 success and in December received FDA fast-track designation with Pfizer for their influenza/Covid-19 single-shot vaccine.In the meantime, BioNTech has done what most successful pharma firms do. The firm has invested heavily in its pipeline after developing a blockbuster drug. Its P/E ratio is better than 92% of its peers so most investors are hesitant to pay for its earnings because they are expecting its Covid-19 vaccine to be a one-off success. United Microelectronics (UMC)Semiconductors chips and blurred UMC United Microelectronics Corporation logo.Source: Ascannio via shutterstockUnited Microelectronics (NYSE:UMC) stock represents Taiwan Semiconductor’s (NYSE:TSM) lesser-known compatriot and is an outstanding value currently. The company is one of the largest foundries in the world. UMC provides a wide range of services including wafer fabrication, design, and packaging services. It primarily serves fabless semiconductor companies. Important semiconductor firms are moving away from fabless partners and attempting to develop manufacturing on their own. That likely won’t be easy due to the technological know-how involved and the investment required, which implies fabless demand may spike again. That notion is reflected in growth projections for UMC moving forward. United Microelectronics is expected to record approximately $7.86 billion in revenues this year and $9.55 billion next year. So the growth narrative is there for UMC stock as an investment. Further, traditional value metrics favor UMC stock as an investment as well. Its P/E ratio of 7.33 is well below its 10-year median P/E ratio of 18.21(2). That P/E ratio spiked above 50 at one point in the last decade. That’s a clear indication that when the right mix of factors conspires, fabs like United Microelectronics get very hot. The company’s return on equity is currently very strong as well, further suggesting it to be a solid choice straddling growth and value. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:EL) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) is the leader in prestige beauty, which is the only category it sells in. In fact, one of the only differences between Estée and L’Oréal, which we also own, is that more than a third of L’Oréal’s sales are mass-market products. We view these companies as a global duopoly and a combined position. We originally purchased Estée Lauder for Global Growth in Sept 2020. We then sold it purely due to valuation reasons a year later, trading at over 45x earnings. We were able to purchase it back this quarter at ~28x earnings and believe it is an even stronger business today than when we initially purchased it in 2020. Estée generates most revenues outside the U.S. (&gt;70%) and operates in over 150 countries. The pandemic has enabled the company to accelerate a shift to more direct-to-consumer sales. In 2019 online as a percentage of total sales was 15% and now it is well over double that, bringing with it higher margins, more control over their brands, and greater omnichannel and e-commerce capabilities. Like L’Oréal, Estée has become stronger in the face of changing basis of competition, and we feel that it is an extremely durable company with many years of compounding ahead.”Story continueswithGod/Shutterstock.comThe Estée Lauder Companies Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investments and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Knights that Beat The Market Last 5 Years. With the S&amp;P 500 gaining 8.89% this year so far, the US stock market is showing signs of recovery. According to a recent report by Morgan Stanley, stocks could have a strong first half of the year despite lingering recession fears. However, the report also mentions that earnings may fall throughout the year. In these fluctuating conditions, investors rely on dividend-focused stocks to ensure regular means of income.During the previous inflationary periods, dividend stocks held up well in comparison with other asset classes. Dividends represented 40% of the market since the 1940s and the ratio increased during decades when inflation was higher, as reported by Hartford Funds. The report also revealed the performance of dividend stocks in the 1970s, when they represented 73% of the S&amp;P 500 returns. Various other reports show that dividends usually grow faster than inflation. One such research was carried out by Fidelity International which revealed that since 1900, the 10-year annual average growth in dividends across the S&amp;p 500 outpaced CPI growth nearly 73% of the time.Companies with strong dividend growth tracks and solid returns become investors’ choices as they prepare them for challenging periods. In addition to this, investors also pay attention to the company’s cash flow generation and sound balance sheet, which warrant future dividend payouts. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP), and Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL) are some major companies that managed to raise their dividends for decades and also outperformed the broader market over the years.

Offsetting this increased tech weight was a 3-percentage point decrease in industrials and a two-percentage point decline in health care. The other two largest purchases includes Visa Inc. and Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)  which likewise saw their valuations improve as their estimated free cash flows held up or improved while their enterprise values declined.”14.

A company that chooses to issue debt without a rating will pay an interest rate that could be higher by half of a percent.

As such, the company has extraordinary margins and pricing power and requires little of its own capital to grow. Even after fully reinvesting in its business, S&amp;P still has an excess of cash.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 NASDAQ Penny Stocks Under 10 Cents. According to Morgan Stanley, it is possible that stocks will see robust performance in the first half of this year, though the threat of a recession in the latter half cannot be disregarded. Investors should be on the lookout for value stock opportunities and those in the Asia ex-Japan region. Over the 12-month period following a midterm election year like 2022, the S&amp;P 500 has historically seen an average increase of 33%. The trend has held true in every midterm election year thus far, suggesting a promising outlook for the current quarter. Additionally, economic indicators remain robust – such as GDP and employment rate – which means there will not be a collapse in first quarter earnings. The strong performance of financials, industrials, and materials sectors in recent months also suggests that a first quarter collapse in earnings may not occur, as prices of these cyclical stocks typically decrease before the economy weakens. Emerging markets are believed to be in the early stages of outperforming due to the declining trend of the US dollar since September 2022. This has led to non-US markets performing better, with Asia ex-Japan leading the charge since October 2022, followed by Europe and Japan. These markets have also outperformed the US. Based on the trend of outperforming emerging markets, Asia ex-Japan, particularly China, is considered to be an attractive equity area for 2023.On February 7, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the process of disinflation has begun and that he anticipates significant decreases in inflation this year. These comments align with what he said after a recent policy-setting meeting, which many in the market expected him to retract. Powell's comments at the Economic Club of Washington have boosted investor confidence in a possible easing of monetary tightening, even though he emphasized that returning inflation to the Fed's 2% target will take time and will not be a smooth process. Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Jersey, told Reuters: Story continues""He seems to reiterate the fact that in his view inflation is cresting. That's been the biggest fear for participants in the market: that with all the rate increases, that in the Fed's view no real progress is being made against inflation. And he's saying 'no, it's having its effect.'"" According to futures, the Federal Reserve's overnight lending rate is expected to reach its peak of 5.12% in the summer and then decrease to 4.785% by December, due to the anticipation of Fed rate cuts as the economy slows down. Phil Orlando, the chief equity strategist at Federated Hermes in New York, has expressed concerns about the stock market due to a slowing economy, rising corporate expenses, and declining profit margins. He noted: ""The stock market is overvalued. The Street hasn't quite figured that out in terms of what the implication is for the full year. You have the sword of Damocles hanging over the market's head during a period seasonally where the market tends to struggle anyway.""Despite a dire market outlook and anticipation for an improved future, the stock market will continue to make moves. Penny stocks are frequently ignored by investors who prefer blue chip stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). However, investing in penny stocks, which are stocks that trade for less than $5 per share, has several advantages that make them an appealing option. The low stock price allows investors to buy more shares, which can enhance their potential gains. Additionally, penny stocks, due to their smaller market value and elevated risk, have the possibility of yielding much higher returns than blue chip stocks. Penny stocks are characterized by high volatility, resulting in rapid price changes within a short period. This feature presents both opportunities for substantial profits as well as significant losses. Although the investment in penny stocks comes with more risk, it offers the prospect of investing in companies with robust growth prospects and the chance for quick, substantial returns. Penny stocks also present investors with a distinct possibility to attain long-term gains not typically found in blue chip investments. Our Methodology We used a stock screener and filtered stocks listed on the NASDAQ exchange which were also priced under 10 cents on February 7.

This compares to FFO of $0.51 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this commercial real estate investment trust would post FFO of $0.50 per share when it actually produced FFO of $0.50, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus FFO estimates.Piedmont Office , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $147.21 million for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.73%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $138.16 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Piedmont Office shares have added about 14.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 8.5%.What's Next for Piedmont Office?While Piedmont Office has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Piedmont Office: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.49 on $148.08 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.88 on $589.57 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

Welcome to the Macerich Company Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Samantha Greening. You may begin.Samantha Greening : Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. During the course of this call, we will be making certain statements that may be deemed forward-looking within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding projections, plans, or future expectations. Actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks and uncertainties set forth in today's press release and our SEC filings, including the adverse impact of the novel coronavirus on the U.S., regional and global economies and the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its tenants. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the earnings release and supplemental filed on Form 8-K with the SEC, which are posted in the Investors section of the company's web site at Macerich.com.Joining us today are Tom O'Hern, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Kingsmore, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Healey, Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.Tom O'Hern : Thank you, Samantha. We are pleased to report another strong quarter with the majority of our operating metrics continuing to trend very positively. After a solid first 3 quarters of '22, we had a very strong fourth quarter. We saw robust retailer demand. And although tenant sales were flat in the fourth quarter versus a very strong fourth quarter of '21, we were up 3% for the year. Our average sales per square foot for tenants under 10,000 square feet was $869, a 7% increase over 2021. We continue to see traffic at about 95% of pre-COVID levels, but tenant sales are exceeding pre-pandemic levels with year-to-date sales up 13% compared to the same period in 2019. The quarter continued to reflect retailer demand that is at a level that we have not seen since before the great financial crisis.Story continuesSome of the other fourth quarter highlights include occupancy, which ended the year at 92.6%. That was a 110 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of '21 and a 50 basis point sequential quarter improvement over the third quarter of '22. We continue to see strong leasing volumes, which for the year, were in excess of '21 levels. For the quarter, we executed 261 leases for 900,000 square feet. Doug will be providing more detail on that in a few moments. We saw same-center NOI growth of 2% in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of '21, which was a very strong quarter and a tough comp. FFO per share for the quarter came in at $0.53. For the year, FFO was $1.96, which was about 3% -- $0.03 ahead of consensus. On January 27, we declared a dividend of $0.17 per share, payable March 3 to record holders as of February 17, '23.Since our last earnings call, we've had a significant amount of financing activity, which Scott will elaborate on shortly. The debt markets for our A-quality town centers is improving, and we're getting our deals done. We continue to focus on redevelopment and repositioning of our top-quality centers. Much of this work is mixed-use, diversification and densification. Some examples of that include at Kierland Commons, we're moving forward with a 110-unit luxury apartment project which leverages a developable surface parking lot at this highly attractive open-air center. At FlatIron Crossing in Broomfield, Colorado, in partnership with a national residential developer, we are planning a 330-unit luxury multifamily project, centered around 2.5 acres of public amenities.At Biltmore Fashion, we're advancing plans for a 10-story, 250,000 square foot Class A office tower, including best-of-class retail and food and beverage. Plans are also evolving for a 250-unit luxury apartment complex at Biltmore. At Scottsdale Fashion Square, we're moving forward with plans for multifamily, residential and up to 500,000 square feet of Class A office. This is in addition to the re-merchandising of the Nordstorm wing with luxury brands and dining, which is well underway. At our flagship Tysons Corner Center, we're building upon the highly successful Phase 1 mixed-use development that brought Tysons Tower, Vita and the Hyatt Regency to the center. We are using a portion of our 2.4 million square feet of available entitlements to plan for another mixed-use project.Also recently, we announced the addition of Arte Museum at Santa Monica Place. Arte is an immersive digital art destination which is expected to occupy 48,000 square feet of space on the third level of the property in the in the former ArcLight theater space. Arte expects to attract 1 million visitors per year. It's a great entertainment addition and a major traffic generator that will bring tremendous energy to the third level of Santa Monica Place. As Doug will elaborate on shortly, we continue to be pleased with the strength of the leasing environment. As expected, given the depth and breadth of the leasing demand, we've had a very robust leasing result in 2022. The leasing interest continues to come from a wide range of categories. That includes health and fitness, such as Lifetime at Broadway and Scottsdale Fashion Square, food and beverage usage, including Pinstripes and Round1, entertainment such as Arte Museum and sports such as Scheels and Dick's Sporting Goods, co-working, hotels such as Caesars Republic at Scottsdale and multifamily projects at Kierland, FlatIron, Tysons.Interest continues at levels we've never seen before. Bankruptcies continue to be at a record low, and we continue to expect gains in occupancy and net operating income as we progress through '23. And now I'll turn it over to Scott to discuss in more detail the financial results for the quarter, significant financing activity and guidance for '23.Scott Kingsmore: Thank you, Tom. Now on to the highlights of the quarterly financial results. This morning, we posted solid operating results for the fourth quarter. Same-center NOI increased 2% versus the fourth quarter of 2021, excluding lease termination income. For the year, same-center NOI increased 7.5% versus 2021, excluding lease termination income. This was consistent with our prior estimates and our prior guidance. This is the second straight year of NOI growth that has exceeded 7% with 2021 same-center NOI growing 7.3% over 2020. FFO per share for the quarter was $0.53 and was $1.96 per share for 2022. The quarterly result was equivalent to FFO per share during the fourth quarter of 2021, which was also $0.53 per share.Similar to our same-center NOI growth result, this FFO result was consistent with our prior estimates and prior guidance. FFO per share exceeded Street consensus, as Tom mentioned, by roughly $0.03 a share. Primary and offsetting factors contributing to this quarterly FFO per share -- this quarterly FFO per share result are as follows: One, we had a $7 million increase in straight line of rent due to straight line rent from the Google lease at One Westside as well as from straight-line receivable write-offs during the fourth quarter of 2021 as we then finalized our remaining pandemic tenant-related receivables last year. Secondly, a $4 million increase from same-center NOI. And third, a $4 million relative improvement in valuation adjustments pertaining to our retailer investments, net of taxes.Offsetting these 3 positive factors were the following: One, a $7 million increase in interest expense due to rising rates; two, a $5 million quarterly decrease in FFO generated from land sales; and three, a $3 million decline in lease termination income. On to guidance. This morning, we issued our initial guidance for 2023 FFO, which is estimated in the range of $1.75 to $1.85 per share. Here are some details underlying the guidance. This FFO range includes an estimated same-center NOI growth range of 2% to 3%. This FFO range includes an estimated decline in lease termination income from $25 million in 2022 to a more normalized $10 million in 2023. In terms of the quarterly cadence for 2023 FFO guidance, we expect 23% in each of the first and second quarters, 25% in the third quarter, and the remainder in the fourth quarter of 29%.Primary factors to reconcile between our 2022 actual FFO that we've just reported and this 2023 estimated FFO were as follows: Same-center NOI growth is estimated to contribute $0.08 of FFO. Secondly, $0.05 of FFO is estimated to come from a relative improvement in valuation adjustments pertaining to our retailer investments, net of taxes. These factors are offset by a $0.21 increase in estimated interest expense due to rising rates; secondly, a $0.07 decline in lease termination income; and then lastly, approximately a $0.02 decline in noncash straight line of rental income. To emphasize, our 2023 outlook continues to reflect healthy operating cash flow of roughly $315 million before payment of dividends. More details of the guidance assumptions are included within the company's Form 8-K supplemental financial information specifically on Page 15 that was filed earlier this morning.Now on to the balance sheet. We continue to make good progress in our financing pipeline. In early December, we closed a 3-year extension of our $300 million CMBS loan on Santa Monica Place. The loan extended -- the extended loan carries a very attractive floating rate of LIBOR plus 1.48%, which is converted to SOFR probably in the next 2 to 3 months. The loan now matures on December 9, 2025, including extension options. On January 3, as we turn the page on the calendar year, we closed a $370 million 5-year refinance of the previous $363 million of combined loans that formally encumbered the Green Acres Commons, both on the mall and the power center, both of which were scheduled to mature in the first quarter of 2023. This new CMBS loan bears a fixed interest rate of 5.9%, is interest only during the entire term and matures on January 6, 2028.The company's joint venture that owns Scottsdale Fashion Square is in the process of refinancing the existing $405 million mortgage loan. The new 5-year loan is expected to be a fixed rate that will -- the loan balance will be $700 million, and that is expected to generate roughly $150 million of incremental liquidity to the company. The CMBS loan is expected to close within the coming several weeks. At year-end, we had $512 million of available liquidity. Debt service coverage was a healthy 2.7x. Net debt to forward EBITDA, excluding leasing costs, at the end of the quarter was 8.8x. Now I'll turn it over to Doug to discuss the leasing and operating environment.Doug Healey : Thanks, Scott. We closed out 2022 with very strong leasing metrics and leasing volumes. In fact, 2022 was a record leasing year dating back to before the global financial crisis when viewed on a same-center basis. Fourth quarter sales were basically flat versus fourth quarter 2021. But for the full year 2022, sales were up almost 3% when compared to the same period in 2021. And given the very strong sales volumes we saw in 2021, it was a very difficult year to comp positively against. Sales per square foot as of December 31, 2022, were $869, down just a little from our record $877 at the end of the third quarter. Trailing 12 leasing -- trailing 12-month leasing spreads remained positive at 4% as of December 31, 2022.Real Estate, BuildingPhoto by sean pollock on UnsplashThat's down from 6.6% last quarter, and essentially flat when compared to December 31, 2021. In the fourth quarter, we opened 226,000 square feet of new stores. For the full year 2022, we opened almost 900,000 square feet of new stores, which is just about on par with where we were during the same period in 2021. Notable openings in the fourth quarter, including Anthropologie at Biltmore Fashion Park, Aritzia and Timberland at Fashion Outlets of Chicago, Free People at The Oaks, Freebird at Kierland Commons, Lululemon at San Tan Village, North Face at Washington Square and 3 stores with JD Sports at Country Club Plaza, Scottsdale Fashion Square and Victor Valley. In the luxury corridor -- luxury category, we opened Brunello Cucinelli, Dolce &amp; Gabbana and GUCCI Men, all at Scottsdale Fashion Square.We also opened Shake Shack at Kings Plaza and Capital One Cafe at Country Club Plaza. In the digitally native and emerging brands category, we opened Alo Yoga at Kierland Commons, Brilliant Earth at Santa Monica Place, Everlane and Oak + Fort at Tysons Corner, Fabletics at Broadway Plaza and Chandler Fashion and Vuori at Kierland Commons and Village Corte Madera. Now let's look at the new and renewal leases we signed in the first quarter -- fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we signed 261 leases for just over 900,000 square feet. For the full year 2022, we signed 974 leases for 3.8 million square feet. And as I mentioned earlier, 2022 was a record leasing year dating back to before the global financial crisis when viewed on a same-center basis.Our focus in the fourth quarter was, in large part, addressing our lease expirations, finalizing 2022 and getting a head start in 2023. In doing so, in the fourth quarter, we signed over 200 renewal leases with almost 100 different brands totaling 640,000 square feet. With that, we now have commitments on 52% of our 2023 expiry square footage with another 27% in the letter of intent stage. These figures are virtually unprecedented at this early stage in the year. And given the noise and uncertainty that exists in the macroeconomic environment, I'm pleased with these statistics as we are basically taking a great deal of risk off of the table in 2023. 2022 is also a year of newness for us, bringing new, unique and emerging brands with a major initiative for our leasing team and a way for us to really reimagine and differentiate our town centers from our competition.To that end, in 2022, we signed over 100 leases with 88 new-to-Macerich brands totaling 440,000 square feet. Examples include Arte Museum, as Tom mentioned, Hermes, Balenciaga, Everlane, Oak + Fort, Parachute, Reformation, Roark, Rothy's and Samsung. That's just to name a few. Turning to our leasing pipeline. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had 140 leases signed for just over 2 million square feet of new stores, which we expect to open in 2023, 2024 and early 2025. In addition to these signed leases, we're currently negotiating nearly 100 new leases for stores totaling about 0.5 million square feet, which will also open in '23, '24 and early 2025. So in total, that's over 2.5 million square feet of new store openings throughout the remainder of this year and beyond.And I want to emphasize, these are new leases with retailers not yet open and not yet paying rent. And these numbers do not include renewals. And I can tell you that this leasing pipeline of new store openings now accounts for $62 million of incremental rent. And this represents approximately 8% of our current net operating income. And this incremental rent will continue to grow as we approve new deals and sign new leases. So to conclude, our leasing and operating metrics were very solid in 2022. Sales in 2022 outpaced 2021 by nearly 3%, and 2021 was a very strong year to comp against. Occupancy is up 110 basis points since the end of 2021 and up 410 basis points in only 7 quarters since our trough at the end of first quarter 2021, and we expect this trend to continue throughout 2023.Leasing spreads remain positive and will also continue to improve as we increase occupancy. There are no bankruptcies in our portfolio in the fourth quarter and only 3 for all of 2022. And bankruptcies overall are at their lowest level since 2015, which is consistent with our significantly reduced tenant watch list. Leasing volumes were at record level when viewed on a same-center basis. The result of which is a very strong, vibrant and exciting pipeline of tenants slated to open this year and into '24 and even 2025. I mentioned this last quarter, but I think it's worth repeating. Although the future remains unknown and despite the macroeconomic backdrop and looming potential recession, to date, we continue to see very little pullback from the retailers.And I think this is the result of the very healthy retail environment that exists today as well as a testament to our best-in-class portfolio of super regional town centers.

The airline industry is one of the most complicated industries to predict on Wall Street. Like most industries, airlines have inputs and outputs, the sum of which ultimately leads to profitability or large losses. Over the past few years, airlines have had to contend with the following:·      A Global Pandemic: Shrank demand to nearly zero and decreased the number of employees.·      Complex Geopolitical Circumstances: The War in Ukraine drove crude oil prices to near triple digits before pulling back last year.·      Lack of Skilled Employees: Many pilots in the industry aged, some quit, and others were laid off during the pandemic.·      Outdated Airplanes: Supply chain issues and delays due to safety concerns from aircraft manufacturersled to a lack of airplanes.Despite the many challenges mentioned above, the airline industry is showing signs of life.Clear Skies Ahead?Below I will lay out 5 reasons why the tough times experienced by airlines in recent years may finally be over:1.   A Return to Profitability: International airlines survived massive losses during the pandemic and are now back to earning healthy profits. For example, United Airlines lost $28 per share in 2020. In 2022, UAL made $2.50 per share.Panamanian airline Copa Holdings and other international airlines show a similar EPS trajectory.2.   Rising EPS Estimates: Airline providers such as American Airlines, Ryanair and United have rising consensus estimates moving forward. AAL and UAL also have positive Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) scores suggesting that they are likely to surprise earnings to the upside the next time they report. Delta is one of the few airline stocks with a negative ESP score. That said, Delta is coming off a blockbuster quarter where EPS rocketed 573%.Story continues4.   Recovery to Pre-pandemic Levels: Recently, Boeing Ceo Dave Calhoun confirmed his aspirations to return to pre-pandemic aircraft production levels. Airline giants like United are planning to hire thousands of pilots in 2023 to increase staff – with no training capacity constraints. Meanwhile, air travel occupancy levels have recovered fully.5.   Drastically Improving Technical Picture: Uptrend Resumed: After five failed attempts to re-take the 200-day moving average in the past two years, the JETS ETF decisively broke above the line in 2023 – signaling a distinct change in character.Post Earnings Drift Potential / Bull Flags: Because markets are inefficient, stocks tend to trend after reporting stellar earnings like most airlines just did. Stocks like UAL rocketed higher in early 2023 and have been consolidating and digesting gains in a bullish manner since.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase Aflac's shares on or after the 14th of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of March.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.42 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.68 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Aflac has a trailing yield of 2.4% on the current share price of $70.46. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether Aflac has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for Aflac Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Aflac is paying out just 24% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events.Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Aflac, with earnings per share up 3.3% on average over the last five years.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Aflac has delivered an average of 9.8% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.Final TakeawayShould investors buy Aflac for the upcoming dividend? It has been growing its earnings per share somewhat in recent years, although it reinvests more than half its earnings in the business, which could suggest there are some growth projects that have not yet reached fruition. In summary, Aflac appears to have some promise as a dividend stock, and we'd suggest taking a closer look at it.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Aflac is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Aflac (of which 1 can't be ignored!) you should know about.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

482,afb52513-4b6c-30e1-a057-eecfa51ef79e,AFL,2023-02-09,The Added Perks of Boosting Workplace Benefits,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/added-perks-boosting-workplace-benefits-141500870.html,1675865700,STORY,['AFL'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 8, 2023 / Aflac IncorporatedOriginally published on InsuranceNewsNet.comBy Matthew OwenbyWhen workplace benefits meet the needs of employees, there are as many benefits to employers as there are to employees. Offering the right mix of benefits can lead to increased happiness, satisfaction and overall well-being among employees. This paves the way for businesses to see a boost in productivity and business outcomes - and feel less anxious about employee retention.Rising health care costs and the effects of the pandemic have shifted U.S. employers' mindsets on the benefits they offer, aiming to remain competitive in their total compensation packages. According to my organization's recent Aflac WorkForces Report, nearly 3 in 4 employers' benefits costs went up in the last year, a notable uptick from 2021.The rising costs of health care have forced some Americans to make difficult decisions - pay a medical bill or purchase a vital prescription, possibly avoid doctor visits or delaying important procedures. It would benefit both employers and employees if organizations revamped their offerings to enhance the overall employee experience.But where should leaders start?Look at employee benefits through a new lensThe benefits employers offer may appear to satisfy the needs of their employees, but there's more than meets the eye. Our study revealed employers have a more positive view of their employees' satisfaction with their benefits packages than what employees actually think.That 22% gap - up 14% from last year - between employers' perceptions of employee satisfaction and employees' self-reported satisfaction underscores the opportunity employers have to shrink this widening gap. Employers can help their employees by better understanding their needs, educating them about the inner workings of their benefits and offering new ways to boost benefits packages.Seek employee feedback and act on itLeaders often guess what they think their employees want when it comes to benefits programs. The organizations that are most successful in addressing their employees' needs and concerns are those that simply ask for their employees' input and address that feedback.Story continuesGiven that employers are seeing benefits packages as ""very important"" aspects of talent management - more than they did before the pandemic, according to McKinsey research - it's crucial to assess what they currently provide and how they can make those offerings even better. This helps to enhance both employee well-being and employee retention.Supplemental benefits take center stageEmployers are turning to supplemental insurance offerings to help enhance their teams' additional benefits such as accident and critical illness coverage, as well as benefits that focus on mental health and well-being. This is opening the door to new advantages for businesses. More than three-quarters of employers (77%) who offer supplemental insurance believe these benefits help with employee recruitment, and 80% said it helps with employee retention, according to our study.Adding supplemental insurance to benefits packages can help provide peace of mind for employees and put them at ease so they can focus on their emotional and financial wellness. Supplemental insurance also can help employers rise above increasing costs since most plans are employee-funded.Leaders know their people have expectations for a well-rounded benefits program, which is important from a management perspective - not only to take care of their people, but also in the critical race for talent.Taking a close look at your current offerings and where you want to go is the first step in helping address whatever gap exists to meet the varied benefits demand. This is all in the name of helping ensure your people are taken care of in all facets of their well-being.Matthew Owenby is chief human resources officer, Aflac.

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Sherwin-Williams’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams Is Sherwin-Williams Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, Sherwin-Williams seems to be fairly priced at around 16.21% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Sherwin-Williams today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $205.17, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Sherwin-Williams’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Sherwin-Williams look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Sherwin-Williams' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 34%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? SHW’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SHW, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about Sherwin-Williams as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for American Water Works Company How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for American Water Works Company is:17% = US$1.3b ÷ US$7.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.17.Does American Water Works Company Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, American Water Works Company has a higher ROE than the average (8.7%) in the Water Utilities industry.roeThat's what we like to see. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. To know the 3 risks we have identified for American Water Works Company visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining American Water Works Company's Debt And Its 17% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by American Water Works Company, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.53. While its ROE is pretty respectable, the amount of debt the company is carrying currently is not ideal. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: American Water Works Company may not be the best stock to buy.

492,ca124cdf-ad90-3125-ab40-666738e007e3,AWK,2023-02-09,American Water Works (AWK) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q4 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-water-works-awk-expected-150003186.html,1675868403,STORY,['AWK'],"[The market expects American Water Works (AWK) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 15. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis water utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.76 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -10.6%.Revenues are expected to be $884.07 million, down 7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7.41% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for American Water Works?For American Water Works, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.66%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that American Water Works will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that American Water Works would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.63, delivering a surprise of +9.40%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.American Water Works appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection to treat preterm infants with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Following this first pediatric approval, EYLEA is now indicated to treat five retinal conditions caused by ocular angiogenesis.“Retinopathy of prematurity is a leading cause of childhood blindness worldwide. Until now, the only FDA-approved treatment in common use was laser photocoagulation, a complex and lengthy procedure that permanently ablates retina tissue and is stressful not only for infant patients but also the family navigating a delicate time after a preterm birth,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron, and a principal inventor of EYLEA. “For the first time, physicians will now have an FDA approved medication in EYLEA to treat this heartbreaking disease in these smallest of patients. We thank the investigators and the many families who participated in the clinical trials.”Each year in the U.S., between 1,100 to 1,500 infants develop ROP that is severe enough to require medical treatment. This rare eye disease often impacts infants who are born before 31 weeks of pregnancy have been completed or who weigh less than 1,500 grams (3.3 lbs) pounds at birth. As retinal blood vessels are often only fully developed once an infant is full-term (~9 months of pregnancy), these infants are at risk of developing retinal blood vessels that are abnormal (retinal neovascularization) potentially leading to retinal detachment and irreversible vision loss. Mild cases of ROP may improve without treatment, but some cases require treatment to keep ROP from causing significant visual impairment and even blindness.Story continues“With no existing FDA approved guidance for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity with anti-VEGF therapies, there was a significant need for research to understand how best to treat the disease in a manner that puts patient safety first and preserves vision for a lifetime,” said Jeff Todd, Chief Executive Officer, Prevent Blindness. “Regeneron’s trials investigating EYLEA in retinopathy of prematurity have advanced our understanding of how to treat this disease and provided a needed evidence-based treatment option to potentially help preterm infants preserve their vision.”About the Phase 3 Program in ROPThe FDA approval is supported by data from two randomized global Phase 3 trials – FIREFLEYE (N=113) and BUTTERFLEYE (N=120) – investigating EYLEA 0.4 mg versus laser photocoagulation (laser) in infants with ROP. In both trials, approximately 80% of EYLEA-treated infants achieved an absence of both active ROP and unfavorable structural outcomes at 52 weeks of age, which is better than would have been expected without treatment.No new EYLEA safety signals were observed in either trial. Comparing EYLEA to laser, ocular adverse events (AEs) among patients occurred in 39% versus 37% in FIREFLEYE and 18% versus 26% in BUTTERFLEYE, with serious ocular AEs occurring in 8% for both groups in FIREFLEYE and 6.5% versus 11% in BUTTERFLEYE. AEs in both trials were consistent with infant prematurity or to the injection procedure, and with the AEs in similar ROP trials. The results of FIREFLEYE were published in Journal of the American Medical Association, and data from BUTTERFLEYE were presented at ROP Update 2022 meeting in the U.S.Both trials were conducted pursuant to FDA Pediatric Written Request, and a Pediatric Exclusivity Determination was granted by FDA on October 12, 2022. This grant extends the period of U.S. market exclusivity for EYLEA by an additional six months through May 17, 2024.EYLEA is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Bayer. The lead sponsors of the trials were Regeneron for BUTTERFLEYE and Bayer for FIREFLEYE. Bayer and Regeneron are collaborating on the global development of EYLEA. Regeneron maintains exclusive rights of EYLEA in the United States. Bayer has licensed the exclusive marketing rights outside the United States, where the companies share equally the profits from sales of EYLEA.About EYLEAEYLEA is a VEGF inhibitor formulated as an injection for the eye. It is designed to block the growth of new blood vessels and decrease the ability of fluid to pass through blood vessels (vascular permeability) in the eye by blocking VEGF-A and placental growth factor (PLGF), two growth factors involved in ocular angiogenesis. The EYLEA safety and efficacy profile is supported by a robust body of research that includes eight pivotal Phase 3 trials, more than 11 years of real-world experience and greater than 57 million EYLEA injections globally.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATIONS FOR EYLEAEYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection is a prescription medicine administered by injection into the eye. You should not use EYLEA if you have an infection in or around the eye, eye pain or redness, or known allergies to any of the ingredients in EYLEA, including aflibercept.Injections into the eye with EYLEA can result in an infection in the eye and retinal detachment (separation of retina from back of the eye) can occur. Inflammation in the eye has been reported with the use of EYLEA.In some patients, injections with EYLEA may cause a temporary increase in eye pressure within 1 hour of the injection. Sustained increases in eye pressure have been reported with repeated injections, and your doctor may monitor this after each injection.In infants with Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), treatment with EYLEA will need extended periods of ROP monitoring.There is a potential but rare risk of serious and sometimes fatal side effects, related to blood clots, leading to heart attack or stroke in patients receiving EYLEA.The most common side effects reported in adult patients receiving EYLEA were increased redness in the eye, eye pain, cataract, vitreous (gel-like substance) detachment, vitreous floaters, moving spots in the field of vision, and increased pressure in the eye.The most common side effects reported in pre-term infants with ROP receiving EYLEA were separation of the retina from the back of the eye, increased redness in the eye, and increased pressure in the eye.

The calls were made to check in on the progress made so far and remind the railroads the White House expects the companies will do more for their workers, a second White House official said.CSX announced on Tuesday that it had reached a deal with two railroad unions regarding paid sick leave, the sticking point in last year's contract dispute between 12 rail unions and U.S. freight railroads.The deal is a ""good step"" and in part a result of continued engagement from the administration, the second White House official said.Asked whether the White House played a role, CSX said on Thursday it appreciates the ""administration's engagement on this matter"" and that it will continue to pursue agreements with the remaining 10 unions. Union Pacific, BNSF and Norfolk Southern do not currently offer workers paid sick leave.On Dec. 2, Biden signed legislation to block a railroad strike that could have wrecked the nation's economy, upsetting unions that had been negotiating for months. At the time, Biden pledged to secure paid sick leave for American workers ""before it's all over.""Railroads have slashed labor and other costs to bolster profits in recent years, and have been fiercely opposed to adding paid sick time that would require them to hire more staff.Story continuesAfter Biden signed the bill in December, rail unions said they are discussing an executive action with the White House on paid sick time.Celeste Drake, deputy director of the White House's National Economic Council, told Reuters in a statement the administration has continued to evaluate ""all legislative and administrative options"" on the issue.(Reporting by Nandita Bose in Washington; Editing by Heather Timmons and Leslie Adler)]"

504,77b6387f-ec0c-3e87-bba0-46ee40a03ada,DGX,2023-02-09,3 MedTech Stocks Likely to Beat Estimates This Earnings Season,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-medtech-stocks-likely-beat-124212848.html,1675860132,STORY,"['IART', 'EXAS', 'MDT', 'DGX']","[So far, the fourth-quarter reporting cycle has displayed a year-over-year improvement for the MedTech companies within the broader Medical sector. The handful of MedTech stocks that have released their earnings so far showed market share gain within their base businesses through the months of the fourth quarter compared with 2021, following three years of COVID-induced debacle. Amid the ongoing macroeconomic headwind, this was solely due to the reduction in the severity of COVID-19 despite the emergence of new virus variants in limited geographies.Even if we consider the performance on a sequential basis, the Q4 performance of the majority of the companies is likely to have improved. In this regard we note that, in the last-reported third quarter, the MedTech players witnessed rising raw material costs and other expense pressure, thanks to the global surge in the inflationary situation. Added to this, staffing shortages and supply-chain hazards severely dampened the growth process. Although market watchers expected a similar or a graver macroeconomic situation to hit the fourth-quarter performance of the sector hard, the sequentially better performance so far, in a way, is a breather for investors.Here we talk about three stocks, Exact Sciences Corporation EXAS, Medtronic plc MDT and Integra LifeSciences IART that are expected to beat earnings estimates in the ongoing reporting cycle.Two Major Q4 TrendsThe Q4 reporting cycle depicted a sequential improvement in base sales volumes. This was attributed to a significant reduction in COVID-led severity globally. There has been a significant rebound in non-COVID and elective legacy businesses of the MedTech companies. Also, the fourth-quarter results of the diagnostic testing companies are expected to reflect a sequential rise in testing demand, thanks to rising new cases in selected geographies.However, a contrasting trend is also evident. Considering the deteriorating trade situation, with the global inflationary pressure leading to an extremely tighter situation related to raw material and labor cost as well as freight charges, we expect fourth-quarter results to be disappointing in comparison to the year-ago period. In this regard, IMF, during the fourth quarter provided its World Economic Outlook Update. There it noted thata tentative recovery in 2021 was followed by increasingly gloomy developments in 2022. IMF specifically addressed the ongoing cost of living crisis, tightening financial conditions in most regions, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the lingering COVID-19 pandemic, all of which have been weighing heavily on the MedTech sector’s  business performance.Story continuesThe IMF update noted that global growth is expected to slow down from 6% in 2021 to 3.2% in 2022. If we exclude the global financial crisis and pandemic phase, this marks the weakest growth profile since 2001. Accordingly, industry players are expected to have collectively faced a more severe setback in terms of logistical challenges and increasing unit cost in the fourth quarter, resulting in corporate profitability cuts.Q4 Scorecard Thus FarPer the latest Earnings Preview, 28.6% of the companies in the broader Medical sector, constituting nearly 51.2% of the sector’s market capitalization, have already reported earnings. Of these, 81.3% beat in terms of earnings while 62.5% beat on revenues. Earnings increased 3.6% year over year on 7.6% higher revenues. Overall, fourth-quarter earnings for the Medical sector are expected to decline 9% despite a 4.3% sales increase.Abbott ABT and Quest Diagnostics DGX are a few companies whose base-business performance registered a strong recovery rate.In Q4, Abbott’s Established Pharmaceuticals sales improved 7.9% on an organic basis, backed by strong growth in several geographies, including India, China, Brazil and Mexico, and across several therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, women's health and central nervous system/pain management. Diabetes Care reported organic growth of 17.4% year over year, led by FreeStyle Libre, which contributed $1.1 billion of revenues in the reported quarter. Structural Heart sales rose 13% and Heart Failure sales improved 5.9% year over year organically.However, rising costs and expenses in the face of record inflationary pressure put huge pressure on margins for the company.Quest Diagnostics’ legacy base business (excludes COVID-19 testing) revenues were up 6.3% year over year. However, COVID-19 testing revenues nosedived 74.6% in the quarter.However, pressure on volume, owing to a difficult macroeconomic situation and pricing, constitutes the primary risk for Quest Diagnostics. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, was down 11.2% year over year in the fourth quarter.Zacks MethodologyGiven the high degree of diversity in the Medtech industry, finding the right stocks with the potential to beat estimates might be quite a daunting task.However, our proprietary Zacks methodology makes this fairly simple.We are focusing on stocks that have the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Here we present three MedTech stocks that are expected to beat earnings estimates in this reporting cycle.Exact Sciences: Exact Sciences’ Screening segment’s fourth-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from a continued increase in Cologuard volume. Per the last-reported quarter's earnings call, roughly 292,000 healthcare providers ordered Cologuard since its launch, with 10,000 new orders received in the third quarter. Moreover, the company added 65,000 new ordering healthcare providers, which is expected to have benefited fourth-quarter performance.(Read more: Exact Sciences to Post Q4 Earnings: What's in Store?)Exact Sciences’ Earnings ESP of +23.64% and a Zacks Rank #2 raise the possibility of an earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter.Exact Sciences is slated to release results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 on Feb 21.Exact Sciences Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseExact Sciences Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseExact Sciences Corporation price-eps-surprise | Exact Sciences Corporation QuoteMedtronic: Medtronic has been witnessing an adverse trend of procedure volume across its core business over the past few quarters, impacted by the choppy macroeconomic scenario globally in the form of supply chain disruption, a severe shortage of health professional labor and a record level of inflationary pressure.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corp., Cisco Systems, Inc. and Target Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Microsoft are off to a good start this year, doing better than the market (+9.7% vs. +7.4% for the S&amp;P 500 index) but modestly lagging the Zacks Tech sector (+9.7% vs. +14.9%). The company is witnessing a slowdown in its cloud business and declining videogame sales were headwinds. Decrease in Xbox content and services and Xbox hardware hurt gaming sales due to a decline in first-party content. Increasing spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space from Amazon is likely to dent margins.However, Microsoft’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 results benefitted from consistent execution across renewal sales motions, including strong recapture rates and growth in Azure commitments on a high prior year comparable, partially offset by the slowdown in growth of new standalone business.Revenues benefited from slow yet steady performance of Office 365 and Dynamics. Strength in Marketing Solutions and steady performance in Talent Solutions aided LinkedIn revenues. We expect fiscal 2023 revenues to grow by 4.7% over fiscal 2022.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Cisco shares have modestly underperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past year (-14.0% vs. -13.5%). The company witnessed cautious spending in European markets due to a dramatic increase in energy costs and market volatility. Nevertheless, it believes this situation provides growth opportunities for low-power-consuming technologies, including IoT, Silicon One and Power over Ethernet.Cisco’s investments across its security business, focusing on cloud-based offerings, is expected to drive growth in the long haul. Cisco provided strong outlook for second-quarter fiscal 2023.Cisco’s first-quarter fiscal 2023 results benefited from easing supply chain conditions, greater availability of components and redesigning of some products. Cisco witnessed strong demand for its products, including the Catalyst 9000 family, Cisco 8000, Wireless, Meraki, ThousandEyes and Duo.(You can read the full research report on Cisco Systems here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Target have underperformed the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry over the past year (-18.4% vs. +1.9%). The company’s bottom line continued to struggle marking the third straight miss. Sales and profit trends softened in the latter part of the quarter. Evidently, soaring inflation, rising interest rates and ongoing geopolitical tensions have brought a drastic change in consumer behavior.Target cautioned that softening sales and profit trends have continued in the final quarter. It now foresees a low-single-digit decline in comparable sales and an operating margin rate of around 3% in the holiday quarter.Nonetheless, to simplify and improve efficiencies across the business, Target announced an enterprise-wide cost-containment effort and plans to save between $2-$3 billion over the next three years.(You can read the full research report on Target here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Fomento Economico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V., Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. and Las Vegas Sands Corp.Story continuesWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

507,6eea55dc-d71b-3cb3-a910-ecae2427d01d,CSCO,2023-02-09,Cisco Systems (CSCO) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-csco-reports-next-150003910.html,1675868403,STORY,['CSCO'],"[The market expects Cisco Systems (CSCO) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended January 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 15, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis seller of routers, switches, software and services is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.86 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2.4%.Revenues are expected to be $13.43 billion, up 5.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.13% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cisco?For Cisco, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.66%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Cisco will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cisco would post earnings of $0.84 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.86, delivering a surprise of +2.38%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Cisco appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Fulfilling our purpose to Power an Inclusive Future for All means reimagining how we come together and how we respect each other's identities and the roles we play inside and outside of work. It means tearing down barriers to equity, collaboration, and connection-both in the many places we work and in the wider world.For years, Cisco has taken considerable steps to fight injustice and inequity around the world. In 2020, we came together to make our commitment to social justice integral to our company's purpose by creating our Social Justice Beliefs and Actions-the beginning of a five-year, US$300 million commitment to address our biggest challenges and drive lasting, generational change.One of the most powerful examples of Cisco's focus on bold action and generational impact is our US$150 million commitment to preserve the legacy and sustainability of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) through Social Justice Action 8. Our commitment makes Cisco the largest corporate donor in HBCU history.Of Cisco's total commitment through 2025, US$50 million is dedicated to fund STEM education as the first corporate donor to the Student Freedom Initiative's Access to Education endowment. An additional US$100 million is focused on driving technology modernization at four-year HBCUs. In collaboration with key partners and suppliers, we've recently completed the modernization initiatives for an initial group of eight HBCUs. By building a bridge to technology excellence, we're not only supporting compliance, but also helping these remarkable institutions meet cybersecurity compliance standards while preserving their legacies. In addition to technology modernization, we are supporting HBCUs by:Offering Cisco Networking Academy at approximately 50 HBCUs, with plans to introduce it at all 107 institutionsJoining the HBCU Partnership Challenge, a commitment to create strategic partnerships with HBCUs and hire HBCU graduatesConvening a Cisco HBCU Advisory Board to share best practices and engage community stakeholdersStory continues""Our intention is to make a lasting impact for HBCUs and their students for generations to come. We need to act now to help ensure that we are all doing our part to empower this community."" shared Maria Martinez, Cisco Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.To learn more about the progress we're making to power a more inclusive future, visit our Cisco ESG Reporting Hub, where you can read our 2022 Cisco Purpose Report.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/738548/Making-Bold-Moves-for-HBCUs]"
