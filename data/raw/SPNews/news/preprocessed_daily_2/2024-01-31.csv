Please go ahead.', 'Jack Sullivan', ""Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Nucor's Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2023 Earnings Review and Business Update. Leading our call today is Leon Topalian, Chair, President and CEO, along with Steve Laxton, Executive Vice President and CFO. We also have other members of Nucor's executive team with us, including Dave Sumoski, Chief Operating Officer; Al Behr, responsible for Plate and Structural Products; Brad Ford over fabricated construction products; Noah Hanners, Raw Materials; John Hollatz, Bar and Rebar Fabrication; Doug Jellison, Corporate Strategy; Greg Murphy, Business Services, Sustainability and General Counsel; Dan Needham, Commercial, Rex Query, Sheet and Talent Resources; and Chad Utermark, New Markets and innovation.

Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information within the meaning of securities laws. Actual results may be different than forward-looking statements and involve risks outlined in our safe harbor statement and disclosed in Nucor's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information and disclosures, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. So with that, let's turn the call over to Leon."", 'Leon J. Topalian', ""Thanks, Jack, and welcome, everyone. I'd like to begin by congratulating our 32,000 Nucor teammates for delivering another strong year of financial results. We closed out 2023 with solid performance, earning $3.16 per share in the fourth quarter on our way to $18 per share for the full year. This represents the third most profitable year in Nucor's history behind 2022 and 2021. In fact, Nucor's combined net earnings over the past three years exceeds the combined net earnings of the last 20 years. This is a testament to the focus and dedication of our team as we execute our strategy to grow the core, expand beyond and live our culture. In keeping with our commitment to shareholders and our balanced approach toward capital allocation, Nucor invested $2.2 billion in CapEx and returned $2.1 billion to shareholders in 2023, representing 46% of our net earnings. We are coming off the 3 best years in Nucor's history, but in spite of that, we're even more excited about what lies ahead. The U.S. economy continues to be resilient and steel-intensive megatrends are starting to drive increased demand for the products we make and our focus on expand beyond businesses downstream are generating excellent returns. Turning to our safety performance, 2023 statistically was the safest year in Nucor's history making five straight years of improvement. We also had 29 divisions going the entire year without a recordable injury. We finished the year with a company-wide injury and illness rate of 0.79, which is 17% lower than 2022 and well below the steel industry average. However, with that said, Nucor will not internally acknowledge 2023 as a record year in safety. We'll not celebrate 2023 as a record year because on November 3, we lost a Nucor team member to a workplace accident. Subsequently, on November 9, we had a company-wide safety stand-down. It was a chance to honor our fallen team member and his family, reflect on our most important value, safety and reinforce that the health, safety and well-being of every Nucor team member is what matters most. Our team members come to work each and every day to support themselves, their loved ones and they must go home each and every day. That is our greatest responsibility to all 32,000 team members who make up our Nucor family. Every leader inside of Nucor is committed to delivering our mission to become the world's safest steel company, and there is no doubt in my mind, we will achieve our goals together. Nucor is the largest and most diversified steel producer in North America. We pioneered the commercial application of EAF steelmaking over 50 years ago, and today, we own and operate 30 electric arc furnaces with 4 more under construction. EAF steelmaking and our unique entrepreneurial culture have made us the industry leader and our current strategy, we'll keep Nucor out in front as we continue to deliver the financial results and capabilities our investors and customers have come to expect. Today, Nucor leads the North American steel industry across financial, operational and environmental criteria. Value creation for shareholders through prudent capital deployment is our primary financial objective. Since the beginning of 2020, we have invested over $12 billion in CapEx and strategic acquisitions to grow our core and expand beyond. During the same time, our average annual ROE has exceeded 30% and our annualized EPS growth rate has exceeded 40%. In terms of operation, Nucor makes approximately one out of every 4 tons of steel produced in the United States. We have a highly efficient business model and our unrivaled breadth of products and capabilities serve the widest range of end markets. Sustainability is a key differentiator for Nucor and a major part of our growth strategy. We are the largest recycler in the Western Hemisphere and among the lowest in greenhouse gas intensity across global steelmaking. And we're taking steps to position us even better for the future. Supplying customers with the sustainable solutions they've come to expect. That's why we helped create the Global Steel Climate Council and announced a commitment towards net zero steelmaking by 2050 across Scopes 1, 2 and 3. Our business strategy and investments are driving growth for shareholders. In raw materials, we are leveraging our market intelligence and flexible supply chain to provide more sustainable inputs. We're investing in advanced scrap separation technologies and near zero emission iron-making and we've partnered with ExxonMobil to capture and store up to 800,000 tons of CO2 per year at our Louisiana DRI facility beginning in 2026. In our steel mills segment, we are shifting the mix towards higher-margin value-added products. We continue to ramp up Brandenburg, the most capable EAF plate mill in the world. We're constructing a state-of-the-art sheet mill in West Virginia, and we're expanding our rebar micro mill footprint, targeting some of the highest growth regions in the U.S. Turning to steel products, we have a strategic advantage on the supply side, given the integration between our mills and steel product teams. We'll continue to leverage this advantage while pursuing more cross-selling and companion tons through our solutions teams and we're investing in automation and technology to improve efficiency and reduce the risk of injuries. And finally, our Expand Beyond strategy into its steel adjacent platforms is paying off. We are leveraging our core competencies to grow into higher-margin businesses aligned with steel-intensive megatrends. We're executing this strategy through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth, including the construction of 2 new utility structure production facilities. For 2023, our Expand Beyond platforms contributed roughly $415 million in EBITDA, led by overhead doors and insulated metal panels. We remain confident in hitting our $700 million EBITDA run rate goal for Expand Beyond divisions in the coming years. We believe the American steel industry is still on the front end of megatrends working their way into steel markets. We're starting to see some increased activity in certain markets like bridge and highway, semiconductor chip plants, EV factories and renewable energy. And as we've shared before, Nucor expects the federal programs that support these megatrends to add somewhere between 5 million to 8 million tons of incremental annual demand for steel over the next several years. While the long-term trends look favorable, we've seen some pockets of slower-than-expected activity. For instance, adoption rates for electric vehicles are tracking lower than some have predicted and several offshore wind projects have been canceled or delayed due to supply chain challenges as well as higher costs. Warehouse starts are expected to decline again in 2024, but we still expect them to stay above pre-pandemic levels. And despite some of these near-term headwinds, Nucor remains optimistic about the longer-term prospects for these end markets. Non-res construction is our largest end market, and it has proven to be incredibly resilient. Some of the strongest growth is coming from the sharp rise in advanced manufacturing and infrastructure investment, both expected to rise double digits over the next 2 years according to Dodge construction forecast. This is helping to offset some of the softness we're seeing for more rate sensitive sectors, which should begin to pick up later in the year if interest rate cuts occur as many expect. Before turning it over to Steve, I'd like to share a few thoughts on how Nucor's business model continues to deliver attractive returns for our shareholders. From 2020 to 2023, we've generated a combined EBITDA over $30 billion, net earnings of nearly $20 billion and returned nearly $10 billion to our shareholders. Throughout it all, we've maintained the strongest balance sheet of any North American steel producer, allowing us to grow the company by investing in higher-margin less-volatile businesses. As our results demonstrate, Nucor is a growth company and given our investment plans and the long-term outlook for steel in the U.S., we see more opportunities for growth in the years ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve, who will share additional details on our financial results and near-term outlook. Steve?"", 'Stephen D. Laxton', ""Thank you, Leon and thanks to our shareholders for joining us this morning. Nucor ended 2023 on a strong note with fourth quarter consolidated net earnings of $785 million, including $127 million of pre-operating start-up costs. We exceeded the midpoint of our guidance due primarily to better-than-expected performance from our steel mills segment in the month of December. In addition to solid earnings for the quarter, the power of Nucor's business model allowed us to generate more than $1.5 billion of operating cash flow during the quarter, with working capital contributing about $250 million of that total. Turning to our operating segment results, our Steel Mills Group generated $588 million of pretax earnings in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 33% from the third quarter. Total steel mill shipments declined 4% from the prior quarter, and realized pricing for the segment was lower across all major products. Our mill utilization rate was 74%, down from 77% in the prior quarter, but higher than the 70% in the fourth quarter of 2022. In the back half of the fourth quarter, we saw an uptick in customer confidence as the UAW strikes were resolved and the Federal Reserve signaled the end to interest rate hikes. Shipment volumes increased as the quarter progressed and we began to realize higher pricing for sheet steel consistent with pricing trends in the published indices. We're expecting further improvements in both shipments and realized pricing to favorably impact results in the first quarter of 2024. Our Steel Products segment delivered another strong quarter with pretax earnings of $656 million. This represented just over half the total segment earnings for the fourth quarter and is the sixth consecutive quarter with steel products contributed at least 40% of our total segment earnings. For the year, Steel Products generated segment earnings of $3.4 billion, its second best year behind 2022. Realized pricing and margins continued to moderate in the fourth quarter, but on an earnings per ton basis for the full year of 2023 only gave up about 6 percentage points. Our raw materials segment posted a pretax loss of about $14 million for the quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, pricing is relatively stable, but output was lower and per ton cost rose due to planned outages at our DRI facilities. Now turning to capital allocation with $2.2 billion in capital spending and $2.1 billion in shareholder returns in 2023, Nucor once again, demonstrated a measured and balanced approach to its capital deployment. With respect to our shareholder returns, it's worth noting that next week, we'll pay our 203rd consecutive quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.54 per share. This represents a 6% increase over the prior dividend. As Leon highlighted, Nucor is taking meaningful steps to grow its earnings power and cash flow potential. Since 2018, we've been able to increase our dividend by 42% and reduced our shares outstanding by 23%. For the foreseeable future, we remain confident we'll continue to be able to return at least 40% of our net earnings to shareholders by way of dividends and share repurchases. A cornerstone of our capital allocation framework is a commitment to a strong investment-grade credit rating and liquidity that enables our strategy. Nucor's balance sheet remains well positioned to enable continued execution of our balanced capital allocation philosophy with a debt-to-capital ratio of 25% and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 1%. We have a long history of putting capital to use and returning capital to shareholders. Given that principle, and our ambitious growth plans, we do expect to end 2024 with a lower cash balance than when we started the year. We finished 2023 with a strong cash position for several reasons. First, with more than $7 billion of cash from operations, we generated robust cash flows throughout the year. Second, we experienced some timing delays in our planned capital spending. And finally, we were preserving liquidity for possible acquisition opportunities, which ultimately did not materialize. Now that we've broken ground in West Virginia, the pace of our capital spending should accelerate. For 2024, we expect total capital expenditures of approximately $3.5 billion with our 7 largest growth projects represented approximately 2/3 of this total. In addition, we're firmly committed to growing our portfolio of solutions and expand beyond footprint through value-creating acquisitions. To that end, we are actively fostering a pipeline of acquisition candidates. As always, we will be selective, opportunistic and disciplined in our approach. But unlike our organic growth strategy, the timing and size of potential acquisitions is far less predictable. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we expect consolidated earnings to be higher than the prior quarter with improved performance from the steel mills and raw materials segments, partially offset by weaker earnings from the steel products segment. For the steel mills segment, we expect quarterly earnings to increase due to higher realized pricing and higher volumes, in particular, from our sheet mills. In the steel products segment, we expect lower realized pricing compared with the prior quarter. Across most of our steel products groups, current backlogs are consistent with historic norms, while margins have remained higher than historic averages. For the raw materials segment, we expect modest profitability on higher shipments and relatively stable pricing.Looking ahead, 2024 appears to have a more stable outlook than may have been expected just a few months ago, with a reasonable probability of seeing the much discussed soft landing. As Leon mentioned in his opening remarks, the U.S. economy appears relatively healthy with inflation and unemployment metrics continuing to trend favorably. Market expectations for gradual declines in interest rates could result in more demand for consumer durables, light vehicles and increased activity across a broad construction sector. As the most diversified producer of steel and steel products with the widest array of market solutions, these potential expectations bode well for Nucor. Looking beyond 2024, several steel-intensive megatrends are only in the early stages. While economic cycles will continue to impact the markets, we broadly see positive demand drivers that provide a constructive backdrop to Nucor's midterm growth potential. With that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator, if you would, please open the line for Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Curt Woodworth with UBS.', 'Curtis Rogers Woodworth', ""Sorry to hear that you guys lost a team member in November, but overall, congratulations on what's been a pretty strong safety performance for the past several years. My first question is more end market related though in your slide deck, you did have a generally constructive outlook to use your words with regards to commercial construction as well as infrastructure. But when we look at the volume performance of the bar and beam mills and even plate to some degree, it's been pretty choppy to down for almost 2 years now. So I guess what gives you confidence that, that market can inflect? What signs are you seeing in terms of either increased bidding activity on the highway bridge side? Or how your order book is shaping up?"", 'Leon J. Topalian', ""Yes, Curt, I'll kick it off, and if there's any other comments from team, I'll certainly let them jump in, and thank you for the condolences regarding our team member. As we've mentioned for decades now, the health, safety and well-being of our 32,000 Nucor team member family is the greatest responsibility we all bear each and every day. They are the ones that are delivering every result we're about to talk about. So again, thank you for acknowledging that. It's interesting. There's a lot of talk about new capacity, particularly in the sheet. And we get a lot of questions, Curt, as you know, around well, as we think about new market entrants or increased demand or that flattening of the cost curve change the profile and earnings. And what I would point to is what you really asked about the longs as we look at structural and while we don't break out the individual structural mill Nucor-Yamato or Berkeley being on the financial performance or the individual rebar mills. I would tell you the performance of our long products divisions has been incredible from a financial result. They are generating incredible returns for our company. Nucor-Yamato is operating at a much higher utilization rate. And so -- over the last 2 or 3 years and they have been 10 prior. I think prior to the pandemic, our average utilization rate at NYS, for example, is in the upper 60s to low 70s that shifted much higher to the mid to upper 70s, low 80s. So that flow through and that run rate is generating great returns. So I would tell you, the outlook and continued demand for our structural products and loan products remains pretty optimistic. And again, we've seen incredibly consistent returns in our long products divisions and groups that we think will continue into 2024."", 'Daniel R. Needham', ""Curt, this is Dan. I'll give a little perspective on what we see in the market, in particular, with the funding programs as well, but if you think of the trends right now, we're seeing activity in some of the (inaudible) and the advanced manufacturing. If you're seeing it in EV, battery plants, those types of things. From a standpoint of IRA, CHIPS, and the Infrastructure Act, there's more activity going on, on the energy side with the IRA and also with the CHIPS. We're active in shipping to multiple CHIPS plants that are under construction today. From an IRA standpoint, we've seen a lot of activity in solar, particularly, 2023 was a record shipment year for us on (inaudible) to go into these solar projects. And we're seeing that growing into 2024. It was about 22 gigawatts built in '23. We see growing to '22 -- about 36 gigawatts in '24. What I would say is some of the headwinds, we see the peak of those activities in the volume and demand coming in the next few years. And the reason for that, there's a couple of things that are headwinds in that. One is we've talked about on past calls, the labor constraints. That's real out there. A lot of these projects are competing for the same labor pool. So we do see that having an impact. And then the other thing that's also impacting the pace of these projects is really around regulations. And what I mean by that is getting access to energy for some of these plants is important. That's a slow process. The other thing is environmental permitting. So we're seeing some headwinds with those, but not just delaying the projects. And lastly, around the infrastructure, it can take upwards of 18 months to go from when these projects are announced is actually when they start getting shipped. So that's why we still see some optimism and are very positive in the outlook and we're well positioned to take advantage of all of these trends going forward."", 'Curtis Rogers Woodworth', ""Great. And then just as a follow-up for Steel Products. You noted incremental pricing weakness in the quarter. Can you just comment -- can you give any more specificity around how you see margins trending in this quarter or the margin profile of the backlog? I mean, obviously, there's a lot of moving pieces within the Steel Products segment. But do you have a view on where margins should normalize? And then with respect to getting up to that $700 million EBITDA number, can you do that organically? Or would you need to acquire as well to reach that?"", 'Leon J. Topalian', ""Yes, Curt, that's a lot to unpack in there. What I would tell you on the macro, and I'll let Brad Ford share a little bit more of the details, could be more proud of how our products groups and teams and divisions have performed over the last several years. The non-res sector of our economy has remained incredibly resilient. We had 10 straight quarters over $1 billion earned in that business on the downstream side of our portfolio. And while it was a little bit under that in 2023 for Q4 of '23, its continuing performance is strong. We're seeing order entry rates that are strong. As we move into Q1, we see that moving upwards. I'm not going to get detailed on the margins, but we see that improving. And so Brad, maybe provide a little bit more context to what we're seeing as we enter 2024."", 'Brad Ford', ""Yes. Thanks, Leon, and thanks for the question. Like Leon, I couldn't be more pleased with the performance of our downstream product teams. Performance of safety, the clear step change in earnings and the solutions and value we're providing to our customers, and our team is executing extremely well. Joist and deck tends to get a lot of headlines. And while joist and deck is coming off its second best year ever, Nucor downstream products is far more than just joist and deck. For example, our insulated metal panel group is coming off a record year; rebar fabrication, a record year; pre-engineered metal building, second best year ever; Particular Products Group, second best year ever; [garage door], [fasteners], towers, structures, warehouse systems, Skyline on down the list. This amazing product diversity positions Nucor uniquely to take advantage of strength in a variety of the market segments. As Dan mentioned, we see strength in advanced manufacturing and data centers supported by IRA and CHIPS, infrastructure supported by the IIJA. We also see strength in health care, education and warehousing while down is still forecasted significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Our ability to offer this breadth of downstream products is unparalleled in the industry. These are secure, sustainable solutions for our customers and partners that continue to differentiate Nucor as the supplier of choice. We're coming off a period in '21 and '22 of extremely high demand. And while we see demand moderating back towards historical levels, it's still quite strong. And while volumes have moderated, our backlog remains very healthy, and pricing has stabilized at levels far higher than historical averages. In fact, Q4, industry-wide bookings in joist and deck were the highest in 6 quarters and 40% higher than Q4 of last year. So we're optimistic, and we're entering '24 with more market activity and momentum than we entered 2023."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Katja Jancic with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Katja Jancic', ""At your Investor Day in 2022, you provided an EBITDA bridge that would get you to normalized EBITDA of about $6.7 billion. Can you provide an update on how you're progressing on reaching that goal?"", 'Leon J. Topalian', ""Yes, I'd actually be pleased to. So in November of 2022, we stood in New York and rolled out the most comprehensive detailed analysis that we've ever published before to show you as the analysts what we were going to do and the accountability by which we're going to hold ourselves to that through-cycle EBITDA with the completion of our CapEx investments would yield about a $6.7 billion through-cycle EBITDA performance. I'd tell you at 7.4% for the third best year in Nucor, we're doing really well and that's going to continue to improve because not all those projects have come to fruition yet. We've got Galv Lines being built, we've got our new micro mill being built in Lexington, North Carolina, we've got the investments in Kingman, Arizona that we're making, where we're expanding our resource pool and how we bring these products to market. So I would tell you we're doing incredibly well. And again, we'll look back at times and look -- coming out of the cycle, did we hit the trough? And what I would tell you is like I'm really proud of our earnings. I'm proud of the way the team has been able to accomplish those. And then again, the results that we've been able to see, as we shared with you on the opening remarks, to generate $30 billion over the last 4 years, $20 billion in net earnings and 10% or $10 billion given back to our shareholders has been an incredible well disciplined growth strategy and that's going to continue. We're going to be very disciplined in how we think about capital allocation moving forward. Steve, anything you'd like to add on as we continue to grow and looking at that run rate of 6.7%?"", 'Stephen D. Laxton', ""Yes. Katja, just to add on to what Leon said, a lot of those projects are ahead of us. If you take a look at some of the biggest ones in our company's history like West Virginia, those are only in the early stages of their project life. So they haven't even started to contribute. And in terms of our Expand Beyond investments, we told you that we felt confident those investments would hit $700 million in EBITDA. And we still -- and we reaffirm that today, and tell you we feel very confident, we'll hit $700 million at the run rate at the end there. So there's still more to come on that. And like Leon said, cycles go where they go, but we're continuing to execute on our business on all fronts."", 'Katja Jancic', ""And maybe just quickly on the Brandenburg plate mill. What do you -- how much do you expect the mill will produce in '24? I think previously you were expecting about 500,000 tons."", 'Allen C. Behr', ""Yes, Katja, this is Al Behr. That's still our number for 2024. I would expect to be there or north of it. I'm just super proud of that team on how they've worked through the ramp-up there. We continue to be focused on the new part of the market that we can't service out of our existing portfolio, and we remain mindful of the returns we generate through there at Hertford and Tuscaloosa that contributed to the strong results you see in front of you, and we want to add to that out of Brandenburg. So we're going to continue that thoughtful process, but Q4 was a meaningful productive quarter for that team. We continue to set new standards. We shipped another Nucor first of 120-foot long plates to a bridge fabricator, 30 tons a piece. We shipped them by truck and by rail. So these are the kinds of things that we'll be able to do on a Brandenburg that's never been done before by Nucor or perhaps the rest of the industry, and we're just excited as we roll into this year. But that remains our number, and we're confident in that."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research.', 'Timna Beth Tanners', ""I wanted to ask a little bit more about capital allocation. I guess first off, the comment on lower cash balance. What do you think is the right level? Because clearly, it's been running kind of high recently. So just to get a little more color there. And secondly, you made mention of preserving liquidity for potential M&A and acquisition that you thought (inaudible) it didn't. And here at an industry conference, there's a lot of chatter about Nucor's supposed involvement in the acquisition process for U.S. Steel. Just wondering if you can comment on that or give us some more color perhaps on your M&A pipeline, what that might look like, what types of companies, et cetera?"", 'Leon J. Topalian', ""Yes, Timna, I'll kick it off and then let Steve. So I'll begin with the second part of your question, which, again, obviously, the proxies have, Nucor took a hard look at some of the select assets within the U.S. Steel portfolio. But at the end of the day, we're not going to overpay for any assets. We're going to continue to be very disciplined in how we think about growth, some of the cash generated was just stronger results and stronger shipments and some pricing that had (inaudible) that we didn't fully anticipate. But I would tell you, again, from my perspective, we continue to remain an incredibly undervalued stock. As we think about the growth metrics that I have already shared, I won't repeat again, but at 7.5x EBITDA, I think we are a great value in terms of the things that we're doing in producing. In regards of who ends up owning U.S. fields assets, Nucor today's market cap is larger than the next 3 largest combined steel companies in North America. We are the industry leader. And so again, as we look at our strategy and our growth, we're going to be incredibly disciplined in making sure that the investments we make in our core and expand beyond are delivering the results our shareholders expect. And then the Expand Beyond particularly that it's providing some insulation to the traditional cyclicality of steel that we're looking for the steel adjacent downstream businesses that, again, operate a little countercyclical to what we're seeing in steel and we're seeing those, again, manifest themselves with C.H.I., the megatrends that we're seeing in towers and structures and some of the other businesses that we've acquired over the last 3 or 4 years."", 'Stephen D. Laxton', ""Timna, this is Steve. I'll just add to what Leon said that we don't -- we have such a good opportunity in front of us. And you highlight us the areas that we think about growth. So we're always going to keep enough liquidity to move on the things we need to move on. And we also highlighted that we will spend around $3.5 billion in CapEx in this year. So that's a higher rate than our historic averages. Despite that, we will -- Leon highlighted this one, too. We still feel like our stock is a good buy here. So you'll see us at a higher pace for share buybacks in Q1 than we did last year."", 'Timna Beth Tanners', ""Okay, that's super helpful. I guess one quick one, if I could add. I know there was a question already about Brandenburg run rate, but I was just wondering, is there still more room to see Gallatin on an annualized basis ramp up? Or is it already pretty fully running out to the expansion?"", 'Leon J. Topalian', ""Sorry, was your question on Gallatin's ramp-up?"", 'Timna Beth Tanners', 'Yes, the status of that, if you could, please?', 'Leon J. Topalian', ""Okay. Yes, I'll provide some high level. What I would tell you in the last 3 or 4 months of 2023, the team has executed incredibly well. We've seen daily, weekly, monthly production records set at that facility. They're -- have realized the full run rate potential of that mill and now are operating at an extremely high level. So they have turned -- more than turned in the quarter and again, are producing at or near run rate capabilities, and we'll continue to add as we move into 2024."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.', 'William Chapman Peterson', ""So I guess, first, in the plate market. I guess what are your views on the plate market given the step-up in service center inventories we saw in December and the year-on-year decline in shipments despite Brandenburg's ramp? And I guess following up on that Brandenburg sort of ramp commentary, when can we expect to see Brandenburg turn profitable this year?"", 'Allen C. Behr', ""Yes. Bill, this is Al Behr, again. I'll comment on the plate stuff. We did have an increase year-over-year in shipments by 11% and part of that is, of course, Brandenburg. But just speaking about the plate market overall, I'd say we're reasonably optimistic. I mean, there's areas of weakness that get some headlines and higher interest rates are a compressive force when it comes to vertical construction where plate is used. But there's plenty of bright spots in other areas like power transmission and railcar manufacturing. Heavy equipment is still strong. It's probably declining, but it's still strong and a good pull-through for us. So -- and then, of course, you've got the bridge and highway tons that are mostly yet to come, and that will come for years in the future. So our Skyline business that Brad mentioned pulls a lot of plate tons through almost all of their work is infrastructure related, not just bridge and highway, but many other types of projects. So our view is not that the plate market is going to be wildly robust, but it's going to remain pretty steady and has plenty of tailwinds to offset some of the other forces working against us."", 'William Chapman Peterson', 'And on the Brandenburg profitability timeline?', 'Allen C. Behr', ""I'd expect we hit a run rate of breakeven sometime in the middle of the year."", 'William Chapman Peterson', ""Okay. Second question is a little bit longer dated, longer focused. But in the last earnings presentation, there's been certainly less on the decarbonization efforts. But with the team having many multi-faceted approach across biocarbon and green pig iron, the CCS program you mentioned, power generation, zero emission and so forth. I guess are any of these showing up in 2024 within your investments in CapEx, for example, the CCS program that you have planned for '26. I guess how should we think about these programs in terms of what's leading and how they flow through over the next several years?"", 'Leon J. Topalian', ""Yes. Look, I'll begin and Greg Murphy, our EVP and Business Services and sustainability can jump in as well. But from a high level, look, it's a great question. One of the beautiful things about Nucor and our positioning is one of the top 5 recyclers in the world and certainly the largest in the Western Hemisphere. Our EAF steelmaking technology means that we don't have to take the billions and billions and billions of dollars of profit we're making in pivot, in transition from the old style integrated facilities. You're seeing headlines around the world, companies in Europe that are -- have made the pledge to 100% switch to EAF steelmaking technologies because they have no choice. The question in my mind isn't about (inaudible). This nation is going to move to a greener, more sustainable platform as we rebuild, restore and continue to grow the digital economy. The real question in my mind is the pace in which we changed. Do we have the infrastructure? Do we have the grid hardening? Do we have the resources across the United States to be able to effectively help the EV users power their cars at homes and everything else. But it's a long-winded way to get to the answer of your question. If you think about the VPPAs that were part of, when you think about some of these investment projects, the Louisiana partnership in Exxon, they didn't cost us anything because of the strength of our balance sheet, the strength of Nucor's leadership position, it wasn't a huge outlay of cash. If you think about some of the other investments that are smaller in size. So they're not -- they're tens of millions rather than hundreds of billions. It's positioning ourselves and finding partners out there that are doing different things with carbon and biochar. We're looking at technologies in Europe that are producing pig iron at or near net zero embodied carbon. So there's a number of things that we're examining that are not, at this point, large scale from a CapEx standpoint. Greg, anything you'd add to that?"", 'Gregory J. Murphy', ""Yes. I guess on the timing issue, we see the Louisiana project beginning to pay dividends probably in 2025. But as Leon said, that is not at all a capital-intensive investment for Newport. We were able to structure that as an over-the-fence solution, working with a partner who really understands the geology and the petrochemical attributes there in ExxonMobil. And with the 45Q tax credit, that has proven to be a financial winner for Nucor really from beginning to end. And a lot of the other strategies that we will deploy as an EAF producer go to things like our source and supply of raw materials and how we can get lower embodied carbon raw materials, how we can use obsolete scrap and extract some of the tramp elements from that and use that to replace things like pig iron. So from a capital intensity standpoint, Leon nailed it. We are in a well-positioned place. And really, what we're trying to do is to take a world-class level and make it even better, and we're very, very excited. The last thing I would mention is that Scope 2 emissions, that's a big opportunity for Newport. You've seen us make investments in both nuclear fission and nuclear fusion technology. We believe that's going to be an essential element in delivering reliable, affordable baseload power in the future that's zero carbon. That's still going to be a number of years out into the future. But we believe it's going to be absolutely essential to supplement the solar and wind and other renewable clean sources in the future. But again, we don't want to build nuclear power plants. We want to be the offtakers and use that power."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Martin Englert with Seaport Research Partners.', 'Martin John Englert', ""A question on conversion costs, they were pretty similar year-on-year around $465 per ton. Just wanted to see if -- what your thoughts were if this was a reasonable range to expect on a go-forward basis considering today's operating structure? Or is this something that has an opportunity to come down as start-up costs (inaudible) to subside from some of the growth projects?"", 'David A. Sumoski', ""Yes, this is Dave Sumoski. Certainly, some of the growth projects, especially Gallatin has -- that's increased our cost based on some of the things that we've done up there and some of the -- it was a little bit slower with starting than we had expected. So we can expect the costs to come down a little bit, but not a lot. I think Gallatin is running at a really good rate now. (inaudible) we were probably near full run rate so we're going to be in a good spot this year."", 'Martin John Englert', 'Okay. And I just wanted to circle back on the discussion of plate and structural and this is from the mill perspective, looking at the plate volumes and the beam volumes. There was just year-on-year divergent trend when you look at the quarterly where you saw plate come down in 4Q, but had been growing and then you have the opposite in structural products. Anything else to add there as far as color as to why those would have pivoted so differently through the course of the year?', 'Allen C. Behr', ""Sure, Martin. This is Al Behr, again. I'll start with plate, so year-over-year growth, but you see same quarter year-over-year, we took a step back. A lot of that is just we're not going to chase cheap tons. And in Q4, we had some of the imports come in, and those spreads just got to be where we're not going to load our books with tons that aren't profitable and aren't going to drive returns for us. So I think that will change as we move forward, and I spoke to our outlook for 2024 in plate. In beams, you saw a really great quarter of beams. Part of that speaks to the resiliency of the market and Brad spoke to that and we spoke to that. It just remains a resilient market, and there's plenty of areas of strength where we can go and compete and win and you see that. But part of that is also the breadth of Nucor's portfolio. And some of those tons, you see in the beam group, are tons to our downstream customers, Skyline being one of them, that won some nice projects and you'll see them ship those tons through the first half as they convert and perform. So there's just always -- Nucor's success is a multilayered story. There's always a cylinder firing. And the numbers that you see, I think, just reflect that, especially on the beam side."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Tristan Gresser with BNP.', 'Tristan Gresser', ""The first one is on capital allocation, and thank you for touching on the M&A situation. If I could just have a quick follow-up there. When you look at the pipeline of opportunities, is it fair to assume the most -- well, all those opportunities are inside the U.S. and you're not looking at opportunities abroad. And in the past, when you look at the balance between organic and inorganic, I wonder if you could comment a little bit where, in the priority list, greenfield projects are essentially. That's my first question."", 'Leon J. Topalian', ""Yes, Tristan, I'll kick it off and certainly let Steve (inaudible) and share any additional comments. But if you look at our M&A pipeline, you think about our strategy. If you think about growing the core and expanding beyond, what we said is roughly we expect over the next 5, 6 years, that we would begin to generate about 20% to 25% of our overall revenues through expand beyond businesses. So we're moving to that. So it sort of gives you a rough breakdown to where you're going to see us continue to think about growth, where we're going to continue to channel our capital dollars. Regarding the geography, I would tell you, it's probably a safe bet that Nucor is going to stay in North America. That's the sector of this economy that we know the best, where we have the most advantages to use the strength of Nucor from our culture, our team, our conversion model and understanding. As the market leader in 12 of the 14 major steel market and categories, we've been in business a long time. We understand the boundaries around this industry, and we also understand our customers and where they're wanting to go. We're making investments not for our benefits. We're making investments not to be the largest by volume, we're being disciplined in those investments to create capability sets that our customers continue to grow their businesses and continue to flourish."", 'Tristan Gresser', ""All right. That's helpful. Moving on to maybe the rebar market, can you discuss a little bit the demand trends you've been seeing there over the past couple of weeks? And we've seen the price hikes coming through, putting an end to some metal spread compression, do you see any reason on the ground to expect further moderation? Or you believe the market has now found kind of a new equilibrium there?"", 'John J. Hollatz', ""Yes, Tristan. This is John Hollatz. We did see some improved margins in rebar in the fourth quarter. And over the course of the year, rebar remained pretty steady as we've talked about these infrastructure projects and other demand and construction continuing to grow, we're bullish on the rebar market for the future."", 'Tristan Gresser', ""Okay. That's clear. Maybe last question then on plate. I know it has been discussed a bit but in your outlook, the weakness you're seeing in heavy equipment or earthmoving machinery, how new is that? How severe is it? And in terms of outlook, I think you mentioned something, you said it would be steady. Should I understand it as weakness -- those incoming part or portion of weakness being offset by more supported construction infrastructure that's coming on?"", 'Allen C. Behr', 'Yes, Tristan, Al again. Is your question primarily just around that heavy equipment piece? I want to make sure I get that right.', 'Tristan Gresser', ""Yes, the kind of the red dot you put in the table and that includes heavy equipment, earthmoving machinery. So some weakness you're seeing there, just trying to figure out if that's new and if it's severe. And then when you look at the outlook for metal spreads for plate, they've been pretty steady in January. Is that something you expect to continue? Or do you think that weakness you just flagged could potentially imply some further moderation there?"", 'Allen C. Behr', ""Okay. Let me address the heavy equipment piece. My comments about it declining, I wouldn't say, are new in terms of the decline in that sector. That's been happening through the second half of the year. I wouldn't say we see that as a really strong decline going into 2024 because there's obviously -- with infrastructure, there's going to be some spending in that end-use market that will keep that somewhat buoy, but we do see it continuing to decline a bit as one of several end markets where we serve with plate. So all of that put together with non-res construction and some of the other highlights that we talked about in those markets, our outlook for plate is relatively optimistic just in terms of small, like low single-digit incremental growth year-over-year, that there's plenty of different parts where we can compete separate from the ramp-up that we'll have in Brandenburg, where we'll grab some incremental time just by that alone. Is that helpful?"", 'Tristan Gresser', ""Yes, that's really helpful."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Curt Woodworth with UBS.', 'Curtis Rogers Woodworth', ""I just had a quick follow-up on capital spending outlook. So of the growth capital you've outlined for this year, how much of that will carry over into next year? And can you just remind us on the time line of when you think Steel West Virginia will start to ramp? And then you also noted a potential, I think, new micro mill bar project in the Pacific Northwest. If you could just comment on that."", 'Stephen D. Laxton', ""Yes. Curt, this is Steve. The $3.5 billion projection is our expectation for 2024. And I think if you're trying to extrapolate what future years are going to be, some of those projects like West Virginia are going to push our capital spending into '25 higher than historic averages. But likely, if you're potentially not something -- it's probably below that $3.5 billion, if you're trying to look for a direction, but north of $3 billion, if I would guess. And in terms of when West Virginia is completed, it will be in 2026. So that's a project that will keep going for some time for us."", 'Leon J. Topalian', ""And then, Curt, your last question on the exploration in the Pacific Northwest. What I would tell you is we're doing just that. Again, it's a market we've been in for 2 decades. Our team in Seattle continues to do an incredible job. And again, we're going to continue to evaluate that market, recognizing the customers that we serve in that market. And where does that most make sense and stay tuned."", 'Operator', 'This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Leon Topalian for any closing remarks.', 'Leon J. Topalian', ""In closing, I just want to say thank you to our Nucor team members for another great year in 2023. As we begin '24, let's make sure we take care of our most important value, the health, safety and well-being of our Nucor family. Thank you to our customers for the trust you placed in us with each and every order and thank you to our shareholders for the valuable capital that you entrust us with each and every day.

Please go ahead, Joel."", 'Joel S. Marcus', ""Thanks, Paula, and welcome, everybody. Consistent with the Alexandria who is building the future of life-changing innovation in medicine and at the Vanguard and the heart of the $5 trillion secularly growing industry, I want to wish everyone a safe and healthy 2024. On the cover of our press release and supplemental package, we've included the great [Jim Collins] quote about Alexandria, Alexandria has achieved the 3 outputs that define a great company: superior results, distinctive impact and lasting endurance. On superior results, we're very proud to say that we've had a very strong total shareholder return since IPO of over 1,500% beating all of the benchmark REIT indices and also every -- almost every other health care REIT. On distinctive impact, Alexandria's tenants whom we have supported are responsible for an astounding 50% of the novel FDA-approved therapies over the last decade, truly amazing. And our unique one-of-a-kind full continuum of care 115 project in Dayton, Ohio has treated more than 7,000 patients afflicted by opioid addiction and other substance abuses and has made a dramatic and positive impact on the lives of thousands of people, and we're very proud of that accomplishment. And then moving to lasting endurance I want to congratulate the Alexandria family team on this significant 30-year anniversary milestone of our founding on January 5, 1994 and who would or could have imagined in 1994 that this fledgling garage startup would have created an entirely new class of real estate at the Vanguard and the heart of the life science industry, combating many of the illnesses, which afflict our family and friends. So moving on to my take on fourth quarter and year-end 2023. I'd say we have witnessed the unprecedented 8-year bull run of the life science capital markets 2014 through 2021, the longest on record, coupled with the rocket ship funding during COVID. And the market in 2023 has clearly reflected the rationalization of the past decade. With respect to Alexandria in 2023, I would say I would characterize our 2023 overall operating and financial performance as highly resilient. Notable achievements include 11% plus NOI growth year-over-year, '23 to '22 very, very strong. We delivered a record $265 million of incremental NOI in 2023 with our development capabilities moving that to fruition, which are first-in-class. We've continued very solid leasing in 2023 with over 4 million plus rentable square feet leased with very respectable GAAP and cash numbers. Two key leases in Fourth Quarter, which are noted in the supplement, the lease to Novo Nordisk and the lease to CARGO Therapeutics. 2023, we had a remarkable 76% of leasing with existing tenants, and we look forward to a strong 2024 leasing effort and expect a handful of significant leases to mature soon. We expect to make significant progress on our lease expirations and filling vacant space, while achieving positive rent growth. 2023 we did a highly confident job of self-funding our growth and will continue to do so in 2024. Our balance sheet and liquidity are in the best shape in the company's history, and we're very proud of that accomplishment. We have given and reconfirmed very solid detailed guidance for 2024, and we believe that the life science industry will continue to benefit, most importantly, from some key macro tailwinds in 2024, including positive M&A activity, declining interest rates, increased innovation and some great key data readouts.And finally, before I turn it over to Peter to comment on a range of critical issues. I want to comment on the sale of our 42nd Street asset in New York City, leased to Pfizer through midyear 2024. They previously vacated and moved their headquarters to another site in New York City. We made a strategic decision not to go forward with the contemplated redevelopment of that building to in part to state and local to challenging state and local governmental policies.We also had a somewhat similar but not on the scale reaction back a number of years ago and our successful reduction in our footprint in the city of San Francisco. We have created and grown the commercial life science lab space market in New York City. When we delivered our East Tower and our ACLS mega campus back in 2010, there were only essentially 2 companies of any significance that we're doing commercial life science research in New York City, many academics but no -- virtually no commercial.Today, there are over 100, but New York City, the life science market there remains here 14 years later, still a small start-up market. And we believe that by focusing on our ACLS New York City mega campus. That's the best way for us to continue to be successful. And we have taken this disciplined action out of an abundance of prudence.And with that, let me turn the commentary over to Peter."", 'Peter M. Moglia', ""Thanks, Joel. In Flagship Pioneering 2024 Annual Letter, Founder and CEO, Noubar Afeyan, describe 2023 as a polycrisis, encompassing the confluence of economic turbulence, climate change deeply fractured politics, two global wars, threats to democracy, loss of trust in institutions, and continuing dislocations triggered by the COVID epidemic. Alexandria's solid 2023 performance within such a dismal backdrop is nothing less than extraordinary. I don't want to steal too much of Marc's thunder, but leasing close to our average volume since 2018 [ex] the rocket ship years and maintaining strong earnings growth while navigating through this polycrisis is a testament to Alexandria's competitive advantage and the power of our brand that Joel and Dan eloquently articulated at Investor Day. Heading into 2024, the polycrisis remains, but so does our resiliency. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever. And in 2023, we proved that we can self-fund our investments and still maintain our lowest leverage level in history. Thus, with our unique business model, highly skilled and experienced talent impeccable execution and a healthy underlying industry poised to advance human and planetary health. We've created the fertile industrial ecosystem, (inaudible) postulated can generate value while defending against any coming vulnerabilities, we aim to prove that thesis right. I'm going to discuss our development pipeline, leasing, supply and asset sales and hand it over to Hallie. In the fourth quarter, we delivered 1,228,604 square feet into our high barrier to entry submarkets bringing total deliveries for the year to 3,271,170 square feet covering 15 projects. The annual incremental NOI delivered during the year of approximately $265 million and the incremental NOI delivered during the quarter of $145 million are both the highest totals in company history. The initial weighted average stabilized deal for 2023 deliveries was 7%, supported by a strong stabilized yield on cost of 7.7% from our fourth quarter deliveries. Development and redevelopment leasing activity of approximately 234,000 square feet was higher quarter-over-quarter for the third reporting period in a row, and the positive momentum is expected to continue as we signed 270,000 square feet of LOIs during the quarter.At quarter end, our pipeline of current and near-term projects are 60% leased or under negotiations, which include executed LOIs. From the first quarter of 2024 through the end of 2027, we expect to deliver approximately 90% of the $495 million of stabilized NOI the current pipeline is expected to generate.Demand from our highly innovative credit tenant base, looking to leverage the place-making and scale of our mega campus model is expected to drive future opportunities, such as the Novo Nordisk lease executed during the quarter for 165,000 square feet at the Alexandria Center for Life Science Waltham, mega campus and Greater Boston. Transitioning to leasing and supply. We leased 4,306,072 square feet during the year and 889,737 square feet during the quarter. To put some context to that, it's roughly half of the average of the rocket ship years of 2021 and 2022, but very close to the average volume we leased in the 3 years prior from 2018 through 2020. We've returned to the fundamentals which were trending positively before 2021 and 2022. So we feel really good about the near- and long-term prospects for our business. We spoke a lot about the competitive advantages that our mega campus model affords us during Investor Day. 63% of the total leasing we did during the year was completed in our highly curated Class A mega campuses located in high barrier to entry life science clusters. And they are the key reason we continue to post strong cash and GAAP rent increases, which came in at 15.8% and 29.4%, respectively, for the year.We believe the beginning of 2023 was the low point for demand and are pleased to see that demand for Greater Boston, San Francisco Bay and San Diego are all up year-over-year. A good sign since this does not include a number of projects that are on hold as management teams and Boards remain cautious.However, that should change soon. As you will hear from Hallie, the trajectory of the industry has turned positive. In the meantime, we continue to win the majority of the current high-quality demand due to tenants prioritizing location, place-making experience, ability to scale, proven operational excellence, reliability and trustworthiness. Our teams continue to closely track supply building by building in our proprietary databases. As we turn the page on 2023, we expect 2024 to be the peak year for new deliveries then begin to dissipate in 2025. In Greater Boston, unleased competitive supply, estimated to be delivered in 2024 is set at 7% of market inventory, a 0.9% increase over last quarter, not due to new projects, but because of project deliveries being pushed from 2023 to 2024.In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by another 2.5%, an expected slowdown from 2024 levels. In San Francisco Bay, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 is 10.7% of market inventory, which is a 2.7% increase. Like Greater Boston, this increase is driven by projects that were expected to deliver in 2023, but are taking longer than expected. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by much less at 2.2%, a good sign, but still a 1% increase over last quarter due to a new project breaking ground in Menlo Park. In San Diego, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 is 6.8% of market inventory a slight decrease from last quarter due to an increase in supply from projects being pushed from 2023 to 2024, offset by leasing in those projects. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will decelerate to 2.7% of market inventory.A quick update on direct and sublease vacancy. Direct vacancy in Greater Boston is up 258 basis points to 7.05%, still mid-single digits despite a number of deliveries in late 2023. It has climbed 270 basis points to 12.36% in our San Francisco Bay markets due to unleased new deliveries. And in San Diego, the increase has been more modest, rising 121 basis points to 7.97% driven primarily by [Cereno] Therapeutics vacating all of their leases in the region. They are not an Alexandria tenant. Sublease vacancy has remained stable, ranging from 5.4% in San Diego to 5.9% in Boston. I'll conclude with an update on our value harvesting asset recycling program. Continued demand for our assets enabled us to self-fund our investments as we presented at Investor Day. Page 6 of the supplemental summarizes the material transaction closed during the year. What can be taken away from the partial interest sales at 15 Necco and 9625 Towne Center Drive and the sale of 11119 North Torrey Pines Road is that well-located and stabilized assets located in Alexandria's primary submarkets continue to command a premium valuation.Others in solid locations, but in need of material CapEx for repositioning such as the Second Avenue and Memorial portfolio in Greater Boston completed in the Second Quarter and the Memorial Drive Beaver Street and Roselle Street portfolio completed in the Fourth Quarter, delivered solid per square foot valuations due to their solid historical performance. Due to the unstabilized nature of these portfolio sales, the cap rates will not provide any meaningful insights to return expectations on stabilized properties. However, I can point you to Healthpeak's 65% sale of 3020 and 3030 Callan Ridge Road in Torrey Pines as a directional comp. The building is fully leased long term to a credit tenant but is not expected to be occupied by said tenant. The purchase price yielded a 5.3% cap rate despite that change or despite that challenge.As we presented at Investor Day, our strategies that continue to widen the moat with competitive advantages our mega campus model provides by recycling our noncampus assets into our current and future mega campuses. With that, I'll pass the call over to Hallie."", 'Hallie Kuhn', ""Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Science and Technology and Capital Markets. Today, I will provide a recap of the life science industry in 2023 and an overview of the health and demand drivers of each of our life science tenant segments as we kick off 2024. John Templeton wisely wrote that bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism and die of euphoria. While the rest of the life science industry from euphoric 2021 highs has been rocky, healthy pessimism is seeding renewed momentum, underscored by rational valuations and capital flowing to the strongest technologies and experienced management teams.Fundamentally, the staggering unmet medical need that drives the $5 trillion secularly growing life science industry has not debated, and the opportunity for companies and investors in the life science sector to positively impact human health and disease is massive. Through the ups and downs, the trajectory of the industry is positive, translating long term, into a healthy and expanding tenant base. This sentiment is reflected in the numbers. The XBI, a weighted index of small and mid-cap biotech ended 2023 up 8%. Large biopharma performance, which had an exceptional 2022, while the rest of the market generally languished, ended flat. Two notable exceptions were Alexandria tenants, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk both of which ended the year up over 50% as the market for their novel diabetes and obesity medicines accelerated. And as Peter mentioned, in December, we announced a significant lease with Novo Nordisk for their new U.S. R&D headquarters on our Waltham mega campus in Greater Boston. Another 2023 biopharma trend was M&A. Excluding mega mergers over $50 billion, 2023 set a new high watermark with $159 billion in acquisitions. These were largely sub-$10 billion deals driven by pharma's need to bolster pipelines as they face steep revenue loss due to patent expirations. As M&A dollars are recycled back into the industry, it creates a positive cycle of innovation as scientists and entrepreneurs start their next new venture. Altogether, the M&A life cycle is an important driver of demand across our regions. With respect to the FDA, 55 novel medicines were approved in 2023, the second highest year on record and double the average number of annual approvals 20 years ago. There were also 8 advanced cell and gene therapies approved. Tenant Vertex received FDA approval of Casgevy this December, a potentially curative therapy for severe sickle cell disease and the first approved treatment utilizing a novel genome editing technology known as CRISPR. The takeaway is that the industry's model is working, novel scientific discoveries, such as CRISPR, which was elucidated just over a decade ago are translating into impactful medicines for patients. Now let's take a closer look at the health and demand across each of our life science tenant segments. First, large pharma, which makes up 19% of our ARR continues to deploy substantial capital towards internal and external R&D, equating to over $270 billion in R&D spend. Commitment to R&D is an imperative for pharma.Over the next decade, the top 20 pharma are staring down approximately $200 billion of lost revenue as patents expire, new competitors enter the market and a subset of medicines become subject to potential price setting by Medicare through the recently enacted IRA legislation. And where does pharma look to offset gap in revenue to smaller and nimbler biotechs. Currently, $3 out of every $5 of top 20 pharma revenue stemmed from medicines acquired through M&A and partnerships. Fortunately, this segment is well positioned with strong balance sheets and an estimated $1 trillion in available firepower to leverage. All told, we expect healthy levels of internal research and M&A to continue through '24 and beyond.Importantly, innovation requires people and a critical component of the pharma equation is stellar talent. Recruiting and retaining scientists is more important than ever. Cancer can't be cured from the couch and expectations of a scientific workforce where working from home is not an option [or high]. Requiring amenities and community that the scale of Alexandria's mega campuses are uniquely positioned to provide. This need is driving several large pharma requirements across our clusters. Transitioning to public biotechnology. Our ARR from biotechs with marketed products increased to 17% compared to 14% in 3Q. This increase is due to the delivery of Moderna's new headquarters at 325 Binney Street on our One Kendall Square mega campus, as well as several clinical stage companies transitioning to commercial stage after receiving marketing approval for new therapies. This segment continues to mature, with tenants such as Vertex eclipsing a market cap of $100 billion in 2023. Next step are our pre-commercial public biotech companies, which represent 8% of our ARR. For this segment, data trumps all. Companies that meet expected milestones have executed significant follow-on financings and stock prices have responded positively. In total, nearly $20 billion in follow-on financing was raised on U.S. stock exchanges in '23, a 1/4 of which was raised by Alexandria tenants. Companies have also tapped alternative financing structures such as PIPEs and royalty deals providing additional access to liquidity.Our San Francisco-based tenant BridgeBio has raised over $900 million in the past 12 months from a combination of these sources, driven by clinical data for a novel medicine treating transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, a potential fatal disease of the heart muscle. As the IPO market cracks open in 2024, companies with the right clinical pedigree will be able to access additional liquidity. Last week, the first IPO of the year by asset-based CG Oncology priced above their target range and raised $380 million. On to private biotechnology, which encompasses 10% of our ARR, while life science venture investments slowed in '23 relative to the highs of '21 and '22, it still exceeds pre-COVID levels and came in at approximately $40 billion. Series A, B and C rounds are predominantly being led by outside investors. Speaking to healthy levels of new investments, with the caveat that valuations have come down and deals often take longer to close. Funds have been conservative deploying the capital raised in the past several years and have ample dry powder. As the market's warm, we expect venture activity to remain strong through '24. One counterbalance is that we may see less later-stage financings as a subset of companies go public instead of raising another round of private capital. Next, our life science product, service and device tenants, which represent 21% of our ARR. This segment includes contract manufacturers, diagnostic firms and research tool companies, all of which are critical and complementary to companies developing new medicines. For example, research tool companies are creating the next generation of advanced life science technologies such as super resolution microscopes and DNA sequencers that can process an entire genome in half a day. These technologies often require large specialized footprints, complex infrastructure and highly trained scientific talent. As the trusted brand for life science real estate, our tenants look to Alexandria to safeguard the billions of dollars of equipment, intellectual property and assets housed within their labs.Last, our institutional tenants totaling 11% ARR as well-funded often credit tenants, institutions continue to be an engine of innovation within our ecosystems. One pioneering institutional tenant that came out of stealth this month is Cambridge-based Arena BioWorks. With $500 million in funding, Arena hired scientific luminaries from around the country, with the goal to combine and accelerate academic research and venture-backed drug development under one roof. Returning to where we started, the life science industry is squarely in the realm of healthy skepticism, exceeding the very early innings of the next bull run. We are not completely out of the woods yet with question marks around interest rates and 2024 election looming. However, accelerating pace of scientific innovation access to significant capital from multiple sources and enormous unmet need for life-saving therapies will propel the industry forward and translate into healthy demand and increasing long-term revenue. With that, I will pass it over to Marc."", 'Marc E. Binda', ""Thank you, Hallie. This is Marc Binda here. Hello, and good afternoon, everyone. Congratulations to our entire team for outstanding execution this past year in a very challenging macroeconomic environment. I'll start with our solid financial results.Total revenues and NOI for 2023 were up 11.5% and 12.2%, respectively, over 22, primarily driven by solid same-property performance and record high development and redevelopment projects placed into service in '23 with an incremental annual NOI of $265 million. FFO per share diluted as adjusted was $8.97, up a solid 6.5% over 2022. We're very proud to report solid operating results for the year driven by disciplined execution of our mega campus strategy. Our tenants continue to appreciate our brand collaborative mega campuses and our operational excellence by our team. We have high-quality cash flows with 52% of our annual rental revenue as of 4Q '23 from investment-grade and publicly traded large-cap tenants, up 3% from the prior quarter and we have one of the highest quality client rosters in the REIT industry. 75% of our annual rental revenue comes from our collaborative mega campuses, collections remained very high at 99.9%, adjusted EBITDA margins remained strong at 69%, and 96% of our leases contain annual rent escalations approximating 3%. Now solid rental rate growth and leasing volume drove same-property NOI growth in 2023 of 3.4% and 4.6% on a cash basis. These results were in line with our previous guidance and very solid results, especially considering the macro environment. As expected, our Fourth Quarter same-property results took some pressure due to some temporary vacancy as 4 properties spread across Boston, San Francisco and San Diego, comprising about 330,000 square feet that is 64% leased or negotiating.We expect same property results to accelerate in the second half of 2024 driven by anticipated solid rental rate growth, occupancy growth in the second half of the year, coupled with the 4 properties I just mentioned, as well as contractual rent increases and the burn-off of contractual free rent from executed leases. We expect solid same property growth for 2024 consistent with what we provided at our Investor Day in December of 1.5% and 4% on a cash basis at the point of our guidance range. Leasing volume in the fourth quarter was solid at 890,000 square feet for the quarter and 4.3 million for the year which is in line with our general historical average from 2013 to 2020. We continue to benefit from our long-standing tenant relationships and brand loyalty with 76% of our leasing completed in 2023 from existing tenant relationships. Rental rate growth for lease renewals and re-leasing space in '23 was very strong at 29.4% and 15.8% on a cash basis. These are very solid results and are the third highest annual amounts compared to the 10 years preceding the rocket ship years of '21 and '22. 4Q '23 rental rate growth for lease renewals and re-leasing of space was 9.2% and 5.5% on a cash basis.Due to the incredible execution by our team, we were able to backfill the roughly 100,000 square foot former Atreca space in San Carlos with a very exciting clinical-stage biotech company called CARGO Therapeutics during the quarter at solid economics, including no TIs and limited downtime. The starting cash rent on that deal was slightly negative at about negative 4% compared to the most recent in-place rents from Atreca that was 3 years into a 10-year lease. Given the quarterly results are driven by a relatively small amount of square feet, the relatively flat results from this transaction had a meaningful impact on the quarterly rental rate increases. Excluding this transaction, rental rate increases for the quarter would have been 21.4% and 9.7% on a cash basis. We expect solid rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing of space for 2024 at a midpoint of 15% and 9% on a cash basis, with some variation from quarter-to-quarter.The overall mark-to-market for cash rental rates related to our in-place leases for the entire asset base remains solid at 14%. Our nonrevenue-enhancing expenditures, including TIs and leasing commissions on second-generation space have averaged 15% of NOI over the last 5 years and remained low during 2023 and in the 12% to 13% range. Year-end occupancy was solid at 94.6%, up 90 basis points from the prior quarter and the primary driver of the increase from the third quarter was space that was delivered in San Diego.The midpoint of our guidance range for occupancy for year-end 2024 is 95.1%, so we do expect some modest growth in occupancy through the year as well as growth in same-property occupancy in the second half of the year. Transitioning to the balance sheet. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the company's history as of 4Q '23. Our corporate credit rankings link in the top 10% of all publicly traded U.S. public REITs. We met our goal for year-end leverage of 5.1x for net debt to adjusted EBITDA on a quarterly annualized basis. And we ended the year with tremendous liquidity of $5.8 billion fixed rate debt comprising 98.1% of our total debt, a weighted average remaining term of debt of 12.8 years and no debt maturities until 2025.Only 20% of our debt matures in the next 5 years and 29% of our debt matures in 2049 and beyond with an attractive rate of 3.91%. We continue to focus on the enhancement of our overall asset base and the recycling of capital through outright dispositions of assets that are not integral to our mega campus strategy. We recognize that these types of assets will likely have a higher cost of capital than our core assets located in our mega campuses, but this will allow us to recycle these proceeds into our highly leased development and redevelopment pipeline and to continue to enhance our mega campus strategy. For 2023, we completed dispositions and partial interest sales of $1.3 billion, including $439 million of dispositions completed in the fourth quarter. Importantly, during '23, we did not issue any new common equity other than the settlement of our outstanding forward equity contracts from 2022, which raised $104 million and we're very proud of our strong execution capability.The team is laser focused on the execution of our capital plan headed into 2024, and we have pending dispositions subject to letters of intent or sales agreements for another $142 million that we expect to close in 2024. Based upon our current outlook, we expect our asset recycling program to be more heavily weighted towards outright dispositions of noncore assets rather than partial interest sales in 2024. In the fourth quarter, we recognized impairments aggregating $271.9 million, which included two significant items. First was the $94.8 million charge related to the sale of 380 and 420 East Street located in the Seaport, which had been announced last quarter and subsequently closed during the fourth quarter. And then second, as Joel mentioned, $93.5 million of a charge related to an office property located in Manhattan, which was classified as held for sale this quarter.The New York project Joel mentioned was acquired in 2018 as a covered land project with a leaseback and in-place cash flows. But in the fourth quarter, we elected not to proceed with the conversion project and this is now under contract and expected to be sold next year.Cash flows from operating activities after dividends for 2024 is expected to be very strong at $450 million at the midpoint of our guidance, and we'll continue to support growth in our annual common stock dividends per share. We had a low conservative FFO payout ratio of 56% for the quarter with a 6% average per share dividend increase over the last 5 years, and at this pace of retained cash flows over the next 3 years, cash flows from operating activities after dividends should generate close to $1.4 billion of efficient capital for reinvestment.Now I'll turn to a couple of important highlights on the external growth side. 2023 and 4Q '23 were both record years in terms of the amount of incremental annual NOI onboarded with $265 million and $145 million, respectively. Importantly, about 80% of the annual rental revenue delivered in the fourth quarter was the investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants, including Moderna and Eli Lilly. With a very large amount of deliveries around mid-quarter on average in the fourth quarter, we expect a significant earnings benefit headed into 1Q '24.We expect tremendous growth in incremental annual net operating income on a cash basis of $114 million upon the burn-off of initial free rent related to recently delivered projects with a weighted average burn-off period of about 10 months. And as Peter highlighted, we have 5.7 million rentable square feet of projects that are 60% leased or negotiating and projects that will generate $495 million of incremental annual net operating income over the next 4 years. A key item to highlight here is that we had strong leasing activity in the pipeline with over 500,000 square feet either leased or added to the negotiating bucket through signed LOIs during the quarter, which was the most we've had since 2Q '22.Next, on capitalized interest, our outlook for capitalized interest for '24 is consistent with our previous guidance. And as a reminder, we expect capitalized interest for 2024 to be impacted by the following: First, and overall decline in average real estate basis subject to capitalization compared to '23, which was driven in part by the large basis placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2023; and second, we expect an offsetting increase caused by an uptick in our weighted average interest rate on borrowings used in the calculation of capitalization of interest in 2024 compared to 2023. I'll turn next to venture investments. Realized gains from venture investments included in FFO per share as adjusted for the quarter was $12.3 million, which was below our recent run rate, in part due to a large realized loss on one of our investments that occurred late in the quarter. FFO per share as adjusted over the last 3 years has included on average 96 million of realized gains in each year from venture investments or approximately 24 million per quarter. Our outlook for quarterly realized gains from venture investments in 2024 is 95 million to 125 million, which is modestly above our 3-year annual average of 96 million. Gross unrealized gains in our venture investments as of the end of the quarter were 320 million on a cost basis of just under 1.2 billion.Turning to guidance. We have reaffirmed our solid guidance for 2024 that was initially provided in connection with our Annual Investor Day on November 29th, with a few minor changes as outlined in our supplemental package on Page 4. Our range for guidance for EPS is $3.49 to $3.69 and our range for FFO per share diluted as adjusted is $9.37 to $9.57, with no change in the midpoint of $9.47, which represents a solid 5.6% growth in FFO per share, following excellent growth last year of 6.5%.Lastly, our ATM program expired in early January of this year upon the expiration of our shelf registration, so we do expect to file a new program here in the near future. With that, let me turn it over to Joel."", 'Joel S. Marcus', 'So please open it up for questions, operator.', 'Operator', 'We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)And our first question will come from Josh Dennerlein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.', 'Joshua Dennerlein', ""I just wanted to explore the occupancy uplift that you're assuming in guide. Just how much of that occupancy uplift is just driven by leases you've already signed versus leasing that you're assuming that still has to get done?"", 'Joel S. Marcus', 'Yes. So Marc, comment?', 'Marc E. Binda', ""Yes, sure. Josh. So we do have about 300,000 square feet of leases that we've already signed that have not commenced that will commence next year. So we have a good head start headed into '24.I think to put things into perspective, we've got about 3.4 million of lease rolls next year. But after you back out the space that we've anticipated, we'll go dark into redevelopment or development that only leaves you with about 1 -- 1.8 million square feet that's not resolved. So I think that number feels pretty manageable relative to our historical run rate on leasing."", 'Joel S. Marcus', ""Yes. So when Marc says next year, we're in 2024, but the next year from '23, which we're reporting, just so we're clear."", 'Joshua Dennerlein', ""Appreciate that. And then it looks like supply is going to peak this year. Just kind of what's your latest thoughts on timing for net effective rents bottoming and any kind of variation across your 3 core markets?"", 'Joel S. Marcus', 'Yes. So Marc, Peter, you guys want to comment?', 'Peter M. Moglia', ""Yes, I'll take it, Josh. Hard to predict. But certainly, the effects of 2023 supply has been seen net effective rents. We've seen TIs increase remarkably, we've talked about that before. TIs aren't going to go any further up because they're already pretty high. I'd say there's some pricing power to the tenant if they've got a very large requirement. But outside of that, I think things have been holding relatively well."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan.', 'Anthony Paolone', ""Yes, thanks. First question is, it's early in the year, and it seems like you're approaching the midpoint of your acquisition guide. So just curious if these were transactions that were in process when you're setting up the guidance or if you just are seeing a lot of stuff that's attractive or you feel like it's a time to play more offense."", 'Joel S. Marcus', 'Yes, the former, Tony.', 'Anthony Paolone', ""Okay. So there's no like anticipation that you want to pick up...And then just on the disposition side, you talked about some of the noncore stuff like having New York under contract. But like when you look at the rest of the dispositions that you're thinking about for the rest of this year, do you think you'll have better execution on noncore sales? Or do you think selling stakes in more core higher-quality stuff is where you might get either more capital or better execution at this point?"", 'Joel S. Marcus', ""Yes. I think we're -- I think as Marc and Peter have indicated, we're focused on really noncore, noncampus assets. So we feel pretty good about that."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Vikram Malhotra of Mizuho.', 'Vikram L. Malhotra', ""Just wanted to get some maybe more color on the pipeline that you're kind of looking at today to deal with sort of expirations over the next 12 to 18 months, but also the developments, particularly what's delivering in sort of '25, '26, where maybe more lease-up is expected. So I don't know if you could give us some sort of wide range of like what is the pipeline square footage-wise of tenants you are at some stage of discussion with? Or if not that, at least give us a sense of the composition of these large, small, by market?And any color there would be helpful just to sort of bridge the lease-up that you have to do in terms of expirations and developments?"", 'Joel S. Marcus', ""Yes. So I don't think we would want to talk about pipeline that I think is pretty confidential stuff Vikram. But I think you can assume every lease is somewhat different, and every market is somewhat different. I mean, if you go back and look at the CARGO Therapeutics, that was a very unique lease in a very unique set of circumstances. So it isn't like -- this is not a commodity product. This is a generally a premium priced, noncommodity product. So it's not like you have the same bunch of folks waiting for the same amount of space in the same kind of market type place. It's just not that kind of a business."", 'Vikram L. Malhotra', ""Okay. And then just maybe one other topic. Biogen announced sort of rationalization of its office space. And I'm wondering if in your conversations with tenants across the portfolio, can you give us a sense of the latest thoughts on how they're thinking about office versus lab or office needs whether it's remote work or just they took on too much space. Just how are the tenants thinking about office space they may have in their lab portfolios?"", 'Joel S. Marcus', ""That's always asked. Hallie, do you want to kind of comment on that?"", 'Hallie Kuhn', ""Sure. And hi Vikram, this is Hallie. I think we need to separate out the component of nontechnical space adjacent to the labs. These are desks largely for the researchers that are moving in and out of the labs through the day. And -- just there's no rationalization of that space. That space is needed. You -- it's part of the workflow that scientists day in and day out are utilizing. Surely, there are larger office requirements that as companies grow, that they will lease up if it's for their clinical or sales and marketing. That's a different set of questions. That is not who we are catering by and large.So when it comes to the lab-based infrastructure that space is not going to go away. And we even have examples right now where that lab to nontechnical space ratio is shifting. We need more desk gain, right? Like we have more scientists going in and out, right? People don't like to share the same space. They like their own desks. So just to make that clear, you really have to distinguish the two."", 'Peter M. Moglia', 'This is Peter. Just to be clear, Biogen is rationalizing their pure office space, nothing to do with their lab space.', 'Joel S. Marcus', ""Yes. And remember, they're a big cap company. So like big pharma, they have kind of dedicated legions of people doing things in traditional office, if you will, so it's not a typical case."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Rich Anderson of Wedbush.', 'Richard Charles Anderson', ""I just wanted to ask about the impairment and specifically, it's behind you now, but as a function of taking on what may be called kind of a creative approach to development in a different macro environment. And I'm curious if you can -- we can expect to see more in the way of an impairment type of model in 2024 as you part ways with noncore assets? Is this something that we might see repeat itself as the year progresses?"", 'Joel S. Marcus', 'Yes. Marc, do you want to comment on that?', 'Marc E. Binda', ""Yes. Sure. Rich. Yes, so under the accounting rules, these -- you can -- the common way where you could have an impairment is at the point where you designate an asset as held for sale. So as we get closer to potentially committing to certain sales it's definitely possible that we could have additional impairments. But it's really hard to say at this point as we're still refining our approach and which assets to sell. So hard to say at this point."", 'Richard Charles Anderson', ""Okay. And then second question, on the $114 million of free rent burn that's good in the sense that you've got new cash flow coming in, but it's also free rent is what it is. It's not necessarily a good thing. Where does that compare? So if you can quantify it to the past and how much of it is a reflection of the current difficult headwinds that are facing you? And how do you expect that free rent sort of exposure to trend on a go-forward basis?"", 'Joel S. Marcus', 'Marc?', 'Marc E. Binda', ""Yes, so we did -- yes, we had $114 million of free rent that will be burning off. I guess just to put that into perspective, we delivered $265 million of NOI this year, that's annual NOI. And a lot of those leases are very long term in nature. So it's not a direct correlation one for one, but if you just do the simple math there, it's less than, less than half a year on what is generally on average, those types of leases are 10 years and longer. So I don't think it's something that we're super concerned with. But to be fair, free rent has trickled up a little bit as we've seen."", 'Richard Charles Anderson', 'But not glaringly higher or anything like that over the past few years. Is that correct?', 'Marc E. Binda', ""I mean we published our free rent statistics, Rich. And I think it was about 0.3 months per year of rent at the end of last year. And I think we're at 0.6, so it's ticked up a little bit this year, but still relatively modest compared to the length of leases."", 'Peter M. Moglia', ""Rich, it's Peter. The great financial crisis, it was more like 1. So we're -- it's still pretty healthy considering the market dynamics."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Michael Griffin of Citi.', 'Michael Anderson Griffin', 'I want to go back to the CARGO Therapeutics lease at 835 Industrial. Joel, I know you mentioned that it was something specific driving that, but was wondering if you can give any more color on what drove the decline in rents? Was it a function of CARGO willing to take occupancy pretty quickly? Or are there more worried about supply and where rental rates are going?', 'Joel S. Marcus', ""Well, I think the key is -- and it's a good question, it's one of those situations where you're trying to find the right key to fit the right lock. An exact amount of space that comes vacant that one would not have wanted to be vacant due to Atreca and finding the exact user of that space with literally very little downtime. And as I think Marc said, we had no TIs. So you don't want to just let that kind of a tenant go into the market and choose from some assorted number of spaces that might be available now or in the future. And so you try to make the deal because it's the perfect lock fitting -- the perfect key fitting the right lock. And so that's kind of the story."", 'Michael Anderson Griffin', ""Got you. That's helpful. And then I was wondering if you could provide any additional color on the recent asset sales, the ones in Greater Boston and San Diego. It seems like they're aggregated in the supplemental and given there -- it seems like they're kind of lowly occupied. I'd be curious if you can kind of give us pricing, particularly on the asset in Cambridge, maybe what a yield would be on a stabilized basis?"", 'Joel S. Marcus', 'Yes. So Peter, do you want to give some commentary?', 'Peter M. Moglia', ""Yes. I mean that speculating on what the Cambridge asset would be on a stabilized basis, I'd just kind of point to where we've seen stabilized things in Boston trade ourselves in the low to mid-5s. With the Necco transaction we had a couple of quarters ago. Boston Properties last quarter did something in the high 5s, but it's about 2 or 3 years from cash flowing.So I pointed to, in my commentary, a 5.3% cap rate in Torrey Pines for a building that's fully leased, long term to have a credit tenant but that tenant has decided not to move in. So I've said it before, we speculate that good, well-located assets with good credit and good lease term are going to be in the low 5s, the sub-5 cap rates are no longer with us due to rates. Hopefully, that's helpful."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Jim Kammert of Evercore ISI.', 'James Hall Kammert', ""Thematically, in Alexandria's experience, Hallie mentioned a lot of this positive M&A activity. Has that historically in your experience translated to a net incremental space demand across your portfolio? Meaning -- or is it more of a credit upgrade. I'm just trying to understand if the acquirers really tend to over time expand their lab footprint or they already have kind of underutilized space."", 'Joel S. Marcus', ""Yes. Jim, the way to think about that is every case is different. If it's a smaller company with a specific product, it's sometimes just bolted on and the space isn't necessarily utilized and maybe subleased or terminated. But oftentimes, you find a strategic acquisition, and they could be on the larger medium or even smaller side, where companies, I can think of the Bristol-Myers, Juno, in Seattle back a number of years ago, where BMS wanted really to get into the cell therapy issue and that led not only to the acquisition but a fairly big expansion.So if they're buying -- if it's a strategic technology platform with multiple product shots on goal, usually, those end up with very, very good expansion results. If it's a smaller bolt-on, sometimes those don't. But everyone is honestly different."", 'James Hall Kammert', ""All right. Fair enough. And then a technical question, I'm sorry. You note that the fourth quarter sort of same-store progression in the first half of this year will be a little depressed by the vacancy associated with 4 properties. What would have to happen at those properties from a leasing perspective from where they are today to get to 3% same-store NOI guide at the bottom end of your range. I mean, does anything have to happen? Or I'm just trying to understand the order of magnitude might in terms of incremental leasing for that portfolio to get you in your bench in your range?"", 'Joel S. Marcus', 'Yes. So Marc?', 'Marc E. Binda', ""Yes. So we gave the least negotiating stats. I think it was about half of that 64% was leased and the other half was negotiation. And that stuff is expected to benefit the last half of the year. We do need to continue to make progress on that. But then we do have a significant amount of free rent that's contractual that has already been leased. It will also contribute to the numbers in the back half of the year."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Tom Catherwood of BTIG.', 'William Thomas Catherwood', 'Peter, you commented in past quarters on tenant space planning trending towards more just-in-time leasing. Is that still a fair characterization across your portfolio? Or are you seeing some markets where tenants are getting ahead of their expirations to lock in space?', 'Peter M. Moglia', ""Decision-making has been slow. And I mean, I guess what I've talked about is that and tenants not wanting to invest in space. So their preference has been to go into available build space, things that are vacant or rolling or subleased rather than plan ahead and move in 12 months later into a development project. A lot of that has to do with -- a lot of the requirements over the past 1.5 years have been small, versus a larger requirement that you -- might not be easy to find and you need to put into a newer building.But that I don't think anybody is waiting to the last minute. It's really a function of the size of the company. If you're under 15,000 square feet or even under 20,000 square feet, you probably have options. If you're above that, you definitely need to plan ahead because there's a lot less inventory in those sizes."", 'Joel S. Marcus', ""Yes. I think the other way to think about that is the just-in-time inventory issue is really focused on primarily biotech companies clinical stage that hit a milestone, and they need to move pretty rapidly the scale because of that milestone, which also yields funding, and that's where you get probably the most kick on the just-in-time space."", 'William Thomas Catherwood', ""Appreciate that. And that actually kind of leads into the second question, which is, Peter, you had mentioned elevated concessions, and we hear about that kind of across the market, yet if we look at your second-generation leasing costs in '23, they were a good bit lower than in '22, especially if we do it on a kind of per year average basis.So can you speak maybe about how concessions are trending for new and renewal leases at existing properties as compared to leases at new developments and maybe where the economics are different on that side?"", 'Peter M. Moglia', ""Yes. I mean, the increase in -- the large increase in tenant improvement concessions has really been almost exclusively in new development space where you would traditionally give somebody $200 a foot plus or minus, depending on the market, with their rental rate and then expect them to invest into the rest of the space that, as we've talked about, has gone to $300 a square foot.If you look at the operating portfolio, and you pointed out that the numbers prove this, that concession isn't needed because that is already built out. And one of the beautiful things about our business is how the tenants or how the TIs are recyclable. So we build something out first generation. It's very rare that we have to put a material amount of money into it the next time around. And given that it's probably got a large investment from a tenant, the first-generation tenant. We don't have to bump the rents much to make up for that additional investment, right, because we didn't make it.So it becomes a very valuable thing to a tenant to be able to move into something that's already built out. And so they aren't seeking the type of concessions that they are for new space. Now it ties to what I said before, if you're in the -- a smaller set of space needs 25,000 square feet or less, you might have some options to find. But once you get above that, it becomes tougher to find existing space. So you might end up going more towards new development where you would see the concessions of higher TIs, but you're also paying higher rents."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Jamie Feldman of Wells Fargo.', 'James Colin Feldman', ""So if you look at your '24 expiration schedule, the amount of expirations moving into redevelopment declined 13% in the supplemental from 41% when you initially gave guidance? Do you think that's a number that's going to continue to trend lower as the year moves on? Or is that more driven by dispositions? Maybe just talk about what changed and what may change going forward?"", 'Joel S. Marcus', 'Yes. Marc, do you want to comment on that?', 'Marc E. Binda', ""Yes, sure. I think at last quarter we -- or at least as of Investor Day, we did have the 219 East 42nd Street asset in there as something that we thought that we would redevelop or develop turned out that we've decided to sell that asset. Aside from that, it's been pretty consistent from the last quarter. I think a lot of those redevelopment assets are in great locations in places that we'd like to be. But certainly, as we go through our process to look at noncore assets. It's always possible that we find things in there that could potentially be sold."", 'James Colin Feldman', ""Okay. And then the $95 million to $125 million of investment gains that you plan to include in earnings, you said you took an impairment recently. I mean what gives you conviction that you can hit those numbers? And do you think you'll see more impairments netting that out?"", 'Marc E. Binda', ""Yes. We did have some impairments during the quarter here, Jamie. But I think when we look back over 3 years, we've averaged like $96 million over the last 3 years per year. And so over a longer period, when we look back, the impairments have been pretty, pretty modest relative to the size of those gains. So I think -- we're thinking about the things that Hallie mentioned upfront, just with some renewed excitement around M&A that we feel pretty comfortable with that number headed into next year."", 'James Colin Feldman', ""So do you mean that you think you'll see some increase in values and take gains on that? Or based on where values are today, you still can deliver that $95 million to $125 million?"", 'Marc E. Binda', ""Yes. Hard to say where values go. Yes. No, I think we're talking about the values today. I think if you look on balance sheet, we've got something like north of $300 million of unrealized gains that we could tap.And part of it too, to be fair, Jamie, a lot of it is outside of our control, whether it's an M&A event or an acquisition by big pharma or so forth. So some of it, it's hard to predict because these things kind of happen when they happen."", 'Joel S. Marcus', ""But the fact that we've reiterated guidance here, I think Jamie should give you comfort that we think we can hit those numbers, pretty comfortably. Otherwise, we wouldn't stick with it."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets.', 'Michael Albert Carroll', 'I believe you touched on this earlier, but I wanted to see if I can ask it a different way just regarding overall leasing activity. I know that some tenants have been delaying decisions just given the uncertain environment. I mean are there any examples of this starting to loosen up just given the prospect of interest rates that could continue to drop? I mean, is that activity or urgency for tenants? Is that starting to pick up here?', 'Joel S. Marcus', ""Well, I think, again, if you go back to Hallie's comments and think about the different sectors, each sector is kind of driven by different issues when it comes to, say, big pharma or big cap bio, those are dependent upon their needs and not on the vicissitudes of the capital markets today or whatever.But then you contrast those to clinical stage biotech who are waiting to hit a clinical milestone or not, than those -- that's where -- and Peter has reemphasized this a number of times, boards want to be really careful not to get ahead of their skis. So it really depends on the sector that you're looking at. It's not a one-size shoe fits all, if you will."", 'Michael Albert Carroll', ""Okay. And then on the 5 projects that are scheduled to be stabilized in 2025, I mean, how are the leasing prospects on those specific buildings? And I know that we're still a year out from the expected stabilization. But when should we start to see leases getting signed and those projects that are going to be done here in the next few quarters? Is that a good way to think about it?"", 'Joel S. Marcus', ""Yes. So maybe let's do this since we're doing fourth quarter and year-end 2023, let us and Peter make a note of this, will specifically address that on our first quarter call, if you don't mind."", 'Operator', 'Our last question comes from Dylan Burzinski of Green Street.', 'Dylan Robert Burzinski', 'Peter, I just wanted to go back to one of the comments you made regarding one of the questions asked a little bit earlier on $200 a square foot for new development leases for TIs being the norm last year versus $300 a square foot today. Do you -- would you attribute that to solely the imbalance between supply and demand today? Or do you expect that to sort of be the new normal moving forward?', 'Peter M. Moglia', ""I think it's the new normal going forward. I mean it's driven certainly by more competition in the market, but it's also driven by the higher cost to build out space that's been a considerable increase in construction costs as you guys all know, and I used to comment on. So that alone, I mean, the availability numbers will eventually resolve themselves, but the costs are what they are and the tenants are willing to invest in the space, but only to a certain degree. So I think that, that number is here to stay."", 'Joel S. Marcus', ""Yes. And again, I think you have to distinguish different sectors have different tolerances for investing in space and they can be pretty dramatically different. And as Peter said, the structural inflation that we have brought on ourselves over the last number of years as a country and really as a world is pretty much here to stay. So -- and that's true across all real estate classes."", 'Dylan Robert Burzinski', ""Okay. I appreciate the details on that. And then one more on sort of the dispositions. You mentioned focusing on noncore, noncampus like assets. Can you just talk about sort of typical buyer profile on who's in bidding tenants when you go to market with those types of assets?"", 'Joel S. Marcus', ""Yes. I think we'd rather not get into that issue and just let it be at this moment. I don't think we want to discuss that on an earnings call. Sorry."", 'Operator', 'This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.', 'Joel S. Marcus', 'Thank you, everybody, and I look forward to our call for first quarter, and again, safe and healthy new year.', 'Operator', ""The conference has now concluded.

Aflac Incorporated AFL, Unum Group UNM, Employers Holdings EIG and Trupanion TRUP should continue to benefit from prudent underwriting standards. However, a rise in claims frequency could weigh on the positives.The industry has been witnessing soft pricing over the past several quarters, which is not expected to change any time soon. Nonetheless, a rise in claims, with business activities returning to normal levels, is likely to favor pricing for this industry. Also, the increasing adoption of technology in operations will help the industry to function smoothly.', 'About the Industry', ""The Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry comprises companies providing workers’ compensation insurance, mainly to employers operating in hazardous industries. These companies offer group, individual or voluntary supplemental insurance products. Workers' compensation is a form of accident insurance paid by employers without affecting employees’ pay. Claims are generally met by insurers or state-run workers’ compensation fund, benefiting both employers and employees. While it boosts employees’ morale and, in turn, productivity, employers stand to benefit from lower claim costs. As awareness about the benefits of having such coverage rises, the future of these insurers seems bright. Per reports published in IBISWorld, the size of U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry was $55 billion in 2023 based on revenues."", '3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Accident & Health Insurance Industry', 'Pricing Pressure to Continue: The worker compensation industry has been witnessing pricing pressure over the past several quarters. Efforts to retain market share will further increase pricing pressure, which might curb top-line growth. With commercial and industrial activities back on track, the demand for insurance coverage is likely to be on the rise. SpendEdge estimates workers’ compensation insurance pricing to increase at a five-year (2022-2026) CAGR of 5.3%. Also, per a CBIZ report, workers’ compensation pricing is expected to rise 2%.Claims Frequency to Improve: The accident and health insurance space has witnessed growth over the years, primarily driven by an increase in benefits offered by employers. The right kind of workers’ compensation policy translates into personal care for injured workers, increased productivity, higher employee morale, lower turnover, reduced claims costs and less financial worry amid rising medical costs. Increasing underwriting exposure, sustained decrease in claims frequency rates attributable to a better working environment and conservative reserve levels have been boosting the industry’s performance. Per U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data in an AmTrust Financial report, workers over the age of 55 will increase to about 25% in 2024 from 21.7% in 2014. Thus, claims could rise based on the degree of severity, the report states.Increasing Adoption of Technology: The industry is witnessing accelerated adoption of technology in operations, including artificial intelligence. Electronic applications, e-signatures, electronic policy delivery, cloud computing and blockchain should help insurers gain a competitive edge. Per a CBIZ report, industry data reveals that artificial intelligence could reduce workers’ compensation claim expense by about 45%. Nonetheless, higher spending on technological advancements will result in escalated expense ratios.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects', 'The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects.

However, the rate of growth is expected to have remained sluggish amid a challenging supply environment in limited geographies, particularly in Europe, through the months of the fourth quarter.

Company executives anticipate multibillion-dollar markets for these treatments, and they have key developments lined up for this year.', 'Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Johnson & Johnson and Abbott are tackling AFib with a new technique that uses pulsed field energy to ablate heart tissue and new approaches to prevent blood clots from escaping the heart’s left atrial appendage.', 'Medtronic is pushing ahead with the introduction of a novel procedure called renal denervation that aims to lower blood pressure. ', 'In the treatment of valve disease, a common heart problem that restricts blood flow, market leader Edwards Lifesciences is working to obtain new approvals and expanded indications.', '“It does feel like a time when medtech is getting a resurgence of innovation and a resurgence of new technology for doctors to use,” said BTIG analyst Marie Thibault.', 'Here are four trends in cardiac care setting the course for medtech companies this year:', 'Medtronic, Boston Scientific, J&J and Abbott all are pursuing the emerging market for pulsed field ablation (PFA), a treatment for AFib that is attracting strong interest from heart doctors.', 'AFib, an irregular heart rhythm that raises the risk for blood clots, is increasing in prevalence as the population ages. PFA, which applies short, high-voltage pulses of energy to cardiac tissue, is thought to be more precise than traditional ablation methods that use thermal energy to combat AFib.', '“This is being viewed as probably the best evolution within the electrophysiology space in 15 years,” said Mizuho analyst Anthony Petrone. “There is a lot of anticipation for these new PFA catheters.”', 'PFA systems from Medtronic and Boston Scientific are already in use in Europe.', ""“What we see from the data is that it's faster and safer. And so that's enough for doctors to get excited,” said BTIG’s Thibault."", 'In December, Medtronic secured the first U.S. approval for a PFA system, called PulseSelect. Soon after, Boston Scientific moved up the timeline for launching its Farapulse PFA device in the U.S. to the first quarter of this year.', 'Petrone said the device industry will have “basically a two-horse race” in PFA for now. ', 'J&J could be third to market in the U.S. The company plans to submit its Varipulse catheter for Food and Drug Administration review in 2024, CEO Joaquin Duato said last week on an earnings call.', '“This is being viewed as probably the best evolution within the electrophysiology space in 15 years. There is a lot of anticipation for these new PFA catheters.”', 'Anthony Petrone', 'Mizuho analyst', 'Abbott is now entering the competition as well. The company said this month it expects approval in the first half of the year for a U.S. clinical trial of its Volt PFA system.', 'Boston Scientific expects the global AFib ablation market to more than double to $11 billion by 2028, with PFA predicted to grow to more than 60% of procedures, from under 5% today.', 'Both Medtronic and J&J also have AFib devices in the works that integrate pulsed field and radiofrequency energy. Medtronic is working to bring its Affera system to the U.S., while J&J is evaluating a dual- energy approach.', 'Late 2023 saw both Medtronic and J&J announce the acquisition of devices designed to reduce the stroke risk associated with the heart’s left atrial appendage (LAA), a small sac in the upper left chamber. The devices aim to stop clots caused by AFib from entering the bloodstream.', 'Boston Scientific, whose Watchman implant is the leader in LAA closure, has predicted the market could quadruple to more than $6 billion by 2030. The company promotes the device, which fits into the LAA to permanently close it off, as an alternative to a lifetime of blood thinners for patients with AFib not caused by a valve condition.', 'Abbott introduced a competing LAA closure system, the Amplatzer Amulet, in 2021.', ""“What we've seen so far is that Boston’s business continues to withstand the competitive pressure quite well,” said Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang."", 'BTIG’s Thibault predicted the LAA market will grow by more than 20% this year.', ""“Boston Scientific's Watchman has been able to keep growing despite the competitive entry from Abbott, and Abbott’s entry has expanded the market for left atrial appendage closure,” she said."", 'Now, Medtronic has jumped in with the acquisition of the Penditure exclusion system. The device, currently rolling out in the U.S., is expected to compete directly with Atricure’s Atriclip.', 'J&J, through its acquisition of Laminar, is developing a separate approach that would eliminate the left atrial appendage.', '“Left atrial appendage closure and exclusion is a hot space,” said Thibault.', 'Nearly 93 million U.S. adults have uncontrolled high blood pressure, putting them at risk for heart attack or stroke.', 'Medtronic is bringing to market one of the first device-based treatments for those patients, after overcoming multiple setbacks during its 14 years in development. The renal denervation procedure aims to lower blood pressure with radiofrequency energy targeted at nerves leading to the kidneys.', '“I think that market is going to be smaller than everyone hoped for.”', 'Jeff Jonas', 'Gabelli Funds', 'CEO Geoff Martha in December called the market a multibillion-dollar opportunity.', 'The technology, however, has its skeptics in the medical community. Medtronic and smaller competitor Recor secured FDA approval in November for renal denervation devices despite heated debate among the agency’s expert advisers about the effectiveness of the treatment. Medtronic’s Symplicity Spyral device missed the primary endpoint in a pivotal trial.', 'The concerns could factor into payers’ reimbursement decisions, ultimately limiting the pool of patients likely to receive the treatment, according to analysts.', '“I think that market is going to be smaller than everyone hoped for,” said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. “There are dozens of blood pressure medicines that are all generic and low cost, and work well. For the most part, that market is pretty well served with drug therapy.”', 'Private insurers and Medicare could limit reimbursement for renal denervation to people who can’t comply with drug therapy, Jonas added.', ""“There are people who do have side effects or drug-drug interactions, or just don't take their medicine like they are supposed to. It's going to be a relatively small subset of those patients that get denervation surgery,” he said."", 'Medtronic is pursuing both local and national Medicare coverage determinations and has been in contact with the largest private payers, Sean Salmon, president of Medtronic’s cardiovascular portfolio, said on an earnings call in November.', '“Rest assured, we’re working hard on reimbursement,” he said. “It’s really critical for the ramp of this technology.”', 'Heart valve procedures have been slow to bounce back after the COVID-19 pandemic, when hospitals postponed non-urgent operations, creating backlogs that providers continued to work through in 2023.', ""“They haven't really gotten the same post-COVID rebound that we've seen with orthopedics or other surgeries,” said Gabelli’s Jonas."", 'Market leader Edwards has forecast sales growth of 8% to 10% for 2024, below pre-pandemic levels. Medtronic, which competes against Edwards in the $6 billion-plus transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) market, pegs the segment’s growth in the high-single- to low-double-digits.', ""“Everybody's wondering if we've run out of TAVR patients, because both Medtronic and Edwards have seen their TAVR products growing now somewhere in the low-double-digits, versus growing at 15 or 16%,” Morningstar’s Wang said. "", 'Edwards is still working to get patients “off the sidelines” after the COVID disruption, Larry Wood, group president of TAVR and surgical structural heart, told analysts on the company’s third-quarter earnings call.', 'Against this backdrop, the company is pushing ahead with efforts to expand the pool of patients eligible to receive a replacement aortic valve. Data from Edwards’ pivotal trial studying TAVR in patients with severe aortic stenosis without symptoms, expected to be presented at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics conference later this year, will be closely watched, analysts said.', '“Many patients are still undiagnosed and untreated,” CEO Bernard Zovighian said in a presentation this month at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference.', 'Interest in the company’s progress on devices to treat mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation is also high. Edwards’ Pascal mitral valve repair system was approved in the U.S. in late 2022 and competes against Abbott’s Mitraclip.', '“The big question in my mind for 2024 is what kind of headway is Edwards going to make in the U.S. with its Pascal product,” said Wang. “Now that they have approval in the U.S., how quickly can they train up the centers, and how quickly can they get practitioners who are used to using Mitraclip to try and switch over to Pascal?”', 'Edwards expects to gain FDA approval for the Evoque tricuspid valve in mid-2024.', 'This story was originally published on MedTech Dive.

In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company."", 'Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.', ""Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Nordstrom, beginning with the chart below."", ' See our latest analysis for Nordstrom ', 'Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.', ""We can see that Nordstrom does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Nordstrom's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters."", ""Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Nordstrom. Bruce Nordstrom is currently the company's largest shareholder with 16% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.7% and 9.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Furthermore, CEO Erik Nordstrom is the owner of 1.6% of the company's shares."", 'We did some more digging and found that 6 of the top shareholders account for roughly 52% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.', ""Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily."", 'While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.', 'Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.', ""It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Nordstrom, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$3.2b, and insiders have US$948m worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant.

The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Gartner?', ""For Gartner, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.81%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.', 'So, this combination indicates that Gartner will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Gartner would post earnings of $1.86 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.56, delivering a surprise of +37.63%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This advertising company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.4%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $4 billion, up 3.4% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Omnicom?', ""For Omnicom, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.08%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.', 'So, this combination indicates that Omnicom will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Omnicom would post earnings of $1.85 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.86, delivering a surprise of +0.54%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", 'Omnicom appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Marathon Oil's  ROE today."", ""Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders."", ' See our latest analysis for Marathon Oil ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Marathon Oil is:', '15% = US$1.7b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.15 in profit."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""To begin with, Marathon Oil seems to have a respectable ROE. Yet, the fact that the company's ROE is lower than the industry average of 23% does temper our expectations. Still, we can see that Marathon Oil has seen a remarkable net income growth of 35% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this certainly also provides some context to the high earnings growth seen by the company."", ""Next, on comparing Marathon Oil's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 33% over the last few years."", ""The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is MRO worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether MRO is currently mispriced by the market."", ""Marathon Oil's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 6.6% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (93%) of its profits. So it looks like Marathon Oil is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth."", ""Besides, Marathon Oil has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 13% over the next three years. Despite the higher expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much."", ""Overall, we are quite pleased with Marathon Oil's performance. Specifically, we like that it has been reinvesting a high portion of its profits at a moderate rate of return, resulting in earnings expansion. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya."", 'Satya Nadella', ""Thank you, Brett. It was a record quarter, driven by the continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $33 billion in revenue, up 24%. We have moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale. By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we are winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains. Now I'll highlight examples of our momentum and progress, starting with Azure. Azure again took share this quarter with our AI advantage. Azure offers the top performance for AI training and inference and the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from AMD and NVIDIA as well as our own first-party silicon, Azure Maia. And with Azure AI, we provide access to the best selection of foundation and open source models, including both LLMs and SLMs all integrated deeply with infrastructure, data and tools on Azure. We now have 53,000 Azure AI customers. Over 1/3 are new to Azure over the past 12 months. Our new models of service offering makes it easy for developers to use LLMs from our partners like Cohere, Meta and Mistral on Azure without having to manage underlying infrastructure. We have also built the world's most popular SLMs, which offer performance comparable to larger models but are small enough to run on a laptop or mobile device. Anchor, Ashley, AT&T, EY and Thomson Reuters, for example, are all already exploring how to use our SLM, Phi, for their applications. And we have great momentum with Azure OpenAI Service. This quarter, we added support for OpenAI's latest models, including GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4 with Vision, DALL-E 3 as well as fine-tuning. We are seeing increased usage from AI-first start-ups like Moveworks, Poplexity, Symphony AI as well as some of the world's largest companies. Over half of the Fortune 500 use Azure OpenAI today, including Ally Financial, Coca-Cola and Rockwell Automation. For example, at CES this month, Walmart shared how it's using Azure OpenAI Service along with its own proprietary data and models to streamline how more than 50,000 associates work and transform how its millions of customers shop. More broadly, customers continue to choose Azure to simplify and accelerate their cloud migration. Overall, we are seeing larger and more strategic Azure deals with an increase in the number of billion-dollar-plus Azure commitments. Vodafone, for example, will invest $1.5 billion in cloud and AI services over the next 10 years as it works to transform the digital experience of more than 300 million customers worldwide. Now on to data. We are integrating the power of AI across the entire data stack. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform brings together operational databases, analytics, governance and AI to help organizations simplify and consolidate their data estates. Cosmos DB is the go-to database to build AI-powered apps at any scale, powering workloads for companies in every industry from AXA and Kohl's to Mitsubushi and TomTom. KPMG, for example, has used Cosmos DB, including its built-in native vector search capabilities, along with Azure OpenAI Service to power an AI assistant, which it credits with driving an up to 50% increase in productivity for its consultants. All up, Cosmos DB data transactions increased 42% year-over-year. And for those organizations who want to go beyond in-database vector search, Azure AI Search offers the best hybrid search solution. OpenAI is using it for retrieval augmented generation as part of ChatGPT. And this quarter, we made Microsoft Fabric generally available, helping customers like Millman and PwC go from data to insights to action all within the same unified SaaS solution. Data stored in Fabric's multicloud data lake, OneLake, increased 46% quarter-over-quarter. Now on to developers. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most comprehensive and loved developer tools for the era of AI. GitHub revenue accelerated to over 40% year-over-year, driven by all our platform growth and adoption of GitHub Copilot, the world's most widely deployed AI developer tool. We now have over 1.3 million paid GitHub Copilot subscribers, up 30% quarter-over-quarter. And more than 50,000 organizations use GitHub Copilot Business to supercharge the productivity of their developers from digital natives like Etsy and HelloFresh to leading enterprises like Autodesk, Dell Technologies and Goldman Sachs. Accenture alone will roll out GitHub Copilot to 50,000 of its developers this year. And we're going further, making Copilot ubiquitous across the entire GitHub platform and new AI-powered security features as well as Copilot Enterprise, which tailors Copilot to organization's code bases and allows developers to converse with it in natural language. We're also the leader in low-code, no-code development, helping everyone create apps, automate workflows, analyze data and now build custom Copilots. More than 230,000 organizations have already used AI capabilities in Power Platform, up over 80% quarter-over-quarter. And with Copilot Studio, organizations can tailor Copilot for Microsoft 365 or create their own custom Copilots. It has already been used by over 10,000 organizations, including An Post, Holland America, PG&E. In just weeks, for example, both PayPal and Tata Digital build Copilots to answer common employee queries, increasing productivity and reducing support costs. We're also using this AI moment to redefine our role in business applications. Dynamics 365 once again took share as organizations use our AI-powered apps to transform their marketing, sales, service, finance and supply chain functions. And we are expanding our TAM by integrating Copilot into third-party systems too. In sales, our Copilot has helped sellers at more than 30,000 organizations, including Lumen Technologies and Schneider Electric, to enrich their customer interactions using data from Dynamics 365 or Salesforce. And with our new Copilot for Service, employees at companies like Northern Trust can resolve client queries faster. It includes out-of-the-box integrations to apps like Salesforce, ServiceNow and Zendesk. With our industry and cross-industry clouds, we are tailoring our solutions to meet the needs of specific industries. In health care, DAX Copilot is being used by more than 100 health care systems, including Lifespan, UNC Health and UPMC to increase physician productivity and reduce burnout. And our Cloud for Retail was front and center at NRF with retailers from Canadian Tire Corporation to Leatherman and Ralph Lauren sharing how they will use our solutions across the shopper journey to accelerate time to value. Now on to future of work. A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research as well as external studies show as much as 70% improvement in productivity using generative AI for specific work tasks. And overall, early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in a series of tasks like searching, writing and summarizing. Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer all deployed Copilot to their employees. And we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes. We are also seeing a Copilot ecosystem begin to emerge. ISVs like Atlassian, Mural and Trello as well as customers like Air India, Bayer and Siemens have all built plug-ins for specific lines of business that extend Copilot's capabilities. When it comes to Teams, we again saw record usage as organizations brought together collaboration, chat, meetings and calling on 1 platform. And Teams has also become a new entry point for us. More than 2/3 of our enterprise Teams customers buy Phone, Rooms, or Premium. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. We now have more than 400 million paid Office 365 seats, and organizations like BP, Elenco, ING Bank, Mediaset, WTW all chose E5 this quarter to empower their employees with our best-in-class productivity apps along with advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics. Now on to Windows. In 2024, AI will become first-class part of every PC. Windows PCs with built-in neural processing units were front and center at CES, unlocking new AI experiences to make what you do on your PC easier and faster, from searching for answers and summarizing e-mails to optimizing performance in battery efficiency. Copilot in Windows is already available on more than 75 million Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs. And with our new Copilot Key, the first significant change to the Windows Keyboard in 30 years, providing one-click access. We also continue to transform how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365, introducing new features that make it simpler for employees to access and IT teams to secure their cloud PCs. Usage of cloud-delivered Windows increased over 50% year-over-year. And all up, Windows 11 commercial deployments increased 2x year-over-year as companies like HPE and Petrobras rolled out operating systems to employees. Now on to security. The recent security attacks, including the nation-state attack on our corporate systems we reported 1.5 weeks ago have highlighted the urgent need for organizations to move even faster to protect themselves from cyber threats. It's why last fall, we announced a set of engineering priorities under our Secure Future initiative, bringing together every part of the company to advance cybersecurity protection across both new products and legacy infrastructure. And it's why we continue to innovate across our security portfolio as well as our operational security posture to help customers adopt a zero-trust security architecture. Our industry-first unified security operations platform brings together our SIEM, Microsoft Sentinel, our XDR, Microsoft Defender and Copilot for Security to help teams manage an increasingly complex security landscape. And with Copilot for Security, we are now helping hundreds of early access customers, including Cmax, Dow, LTI Mindtree, McAfee, Nucor Steel significantly increase their SecOp team's productivity. This quarter, we extended Copilot to Entra, InTune and Purview. All up, we have over 1 million customers, including more than 700,000 who use 4 or more of our security products like Arrow Electronics, DXC Technology, Freeport-McMoRan, Insight Enterprises, J.B. Hunt and The Mosaic Company. Now on to LinkedIn. LinkedIn is now helping over 1 billion members learn, sell, and get hired. We continue to see strong global membership growth driven by member sign-ups in key markets like Germany and India. In an ever-changing job market, members are staying competitive through skill-building and knowledge sharing. Over the last 12 months, members have added 680 million skills to their profiles, up 80% year-over-year. Our new AI-powered features are transforming the LinkedIn member experience, everything from how people learn new skills to how they search for jobs and engage with posts. New AI features, including more personalized in-mails also continue to increase business ROI on the platform, and our hiring business took share for the sixth consecutive quarter. And more broadly, AI is transforming our search and browser experience. We are encouraged by the momentum. Earlier this month, we achieved a new milestone with 5 billion images created and 5 billion chats conducted to date, both doubling quarter-over-quarter and both Bing and Edge took share this quarter. We also introduced Copilot as a stand-alone destination across all browsers and devices as well as a Copilot app on iOS and Android. And just 2 weeks ago, we introduced Copilot Pro, providing access to the latest models for quick answers and high-quality image creation and access to Copilot for Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscribers. Now on to gaming. This quarter, we set all-time records for monthly active users in Xbox PC as well as mobile, where we now have over 200 million monthly active users alone, inclusive of Activision Blizzard King. With our acquisition, we have added hundreds of millions of gamers to our ecosystem as we execute on our ambition to reach more gamers on more platforms. With cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love, where and when and how they want. Our stream increased 44% year-over-year. Great content is key to our growth and across our portfolio, I've never been more excited about our lineup of upcoming games. Earlier this month, we shared exciting new first-party titles coming this year to Xbox, PC and Game Pass, including Indiana Jones. And we've also announced launching significant updates this calendar year to many of our most durable franchises which brings in millions of players each month, including Call of Duty, Elder Scrolls Online and Starfield. In closing, we are looking forward to how AI-driven transformation will benefit people and organizations in 2024. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy."", 'Amy E. Hood', ""Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $62 billion, up 18% and 16% in constant currency. When adjusting for the prior year Q2 charge, operating income increased 25% and 23% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $2.93, which increased 26% and 23% in constant currency. Results exceeded expectations, and we delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth. Strong execution by our sales teams and partners drove share gains again this quarter across many of our businesses, as Satya referenced. In our commercial business, strong demand for our Microsoft Cloud offerings, including AI services, drove better-than-expected growth in large long-term Azure contracts. Microsoft 365 suite strength contributed to ARPU expansion for our Office Commercial business, while new business growth continued to be moderated for stand-alone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. Commercial bookings were ahead of expectations and increased 17% and 9% in constant currency on a low expiry base. The strength in long-term Azure contracts mentioned earlier, along with strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals, drove our results. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 17% and 16% in constant currency to $222 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 15% year-over-year. The remaining portion, recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 19%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 96%. In our consumer business, the PC and advertising markets were generally in line with our expectations. PC market volumes continued to stabilize at pre-pandemic levels. Gaming console market was a bit smaller. As a reminder, my Q2 commentary includes the net impact of Activision from the date of acquisition, inclusive of purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related expenses. The net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first-party. At a company level, Activision contributed approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2-point drag on adjusted operating income growth and a negative $0.05 impact to earnings per share. This impact includes $1.1 billion from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs, such as severance-related charges related to last week's announcement. FX was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $33.7 billion, ahead of expectations and grew 24% and 22% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 72%, relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimates for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Company gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, even with the impact of $581 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Growth was driven by improvement in devices as well as the improvement in Azure and Office 365 just mentioned. Operating expenses increased 3% with 11 points from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 7 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge. The Activision impact includes $550 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs. At a company level, headcount at the end of December was 2% lower than a year ago. Operating margins increased roughly 5 points year-over-year to 44%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 6 points driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier, a favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge and improved operating leverage through disciplined cost control. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $19.2 billion and grew 13% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by better-than-expected results in LinkedIn. Office Commercial revenue grew 15% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 17% and 16% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 9% year-over-year to over 400 million, with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, offset by the continued growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier. Office Commercial licensing declined 17% and 18% in constant currency, with continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office consumer revenue increased 5% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 16% to 78.4 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 9% and 8% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance across all businesses. In our Talent Solutions business, bookings growth was again impacted by weaker hiring environment in key verticals. Dynamics revenue grew 21% and 19% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 27% and 24% in constant currency, with continued growth across all workloads. Bookings growth was impacted by weaker new business primarily in Dynamics 365 ERP and CRM workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 12% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, primarily driven by improvement in Office 365. Operating expenses decreased 5% and 6% in constant currency with 5 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge. Operating income increased 26% and 24% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $25.9 billion, increasing 20% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue grew 22% and 20% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 30% and 28% in constant currency, including 6 points of growth from AI services. Both AI and non-AI Azure services drove our outperformance. In our per user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 11% to over 268 million seats, with continued impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 3% and 2% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven primarily by the better-than-expected demand related to Windows Server 2012 end of support. Enterprise and Partner Services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across enterprise support services and industry solutions. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Operating expenses decreased 8% and 9% in constant currency with 9 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge. Operating income grew 40% and 37% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $16.9 billion, increasing 19% and 18% in constant currency, in line with expectations overall. Growth included 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Windows OEM revenue increased 11% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better performance in higher monetizing consumer markets. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 9% and 7% in constant currency, below expectations from (inaudible) period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. Annuity billings growth remained healthy. Devices revenue decreased 9% and 10% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to stronger execution in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 8% and 7% in constant currency, relatively in line with expectations, driven by higher search volume, offset by negative impact from a third-party partnership. And in gaming, revenue increased 49% and 48% in constant currency with 44 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Total gaming revenue was in line with expectations as stronger-than-expected performance from Activision was offset by the weaker-than-expected console market noted earlier. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61% and 60% in constant currency, driven by 55 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox hardware revenue grew 3% and 1% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 34% and 32% in constant currency with 17 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 6 points year-over-year, driven by higher devices gross margin and sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 38% with 48 points of impact from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 6 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge. Operating income increased 29% and 26% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $11.5 billion, lower than expected due to delivery for a third-party capacity contract shifting from Q2 to Q3. Cash paid for PP&E was $9.7 billion. These data center investments support our cloud demand, inclusive of needs to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash flow from operations was $18.9 billion, up 69%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections on a prior year comparable that was impacted by lower operating income. Free cash flow was $9.1 billion, up 86% year-over-year, reflecting the timing of cash paid for property and equipment. This quarter, other income and expense was in line with expectations at negative $506 million, driven by interest expense and net losses on investments, partially offset by interest income. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. First, FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment-level revenue growth by less than 1 point, and we expect no impact to COGS and operating expense growth. In commercial bookings, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals, along with long-term Azure commitments, should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the accounting estimate change, Q3 cloud gross margin percentage will be relatively flat as improvement in Office 365 and Azure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure as well as the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis, driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure and the slip of a delivery date from Q2 to Q3 from a third-party provider noted earlier. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $19.3 billion to $19.6 billion or growth between 10% and 12%. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 15% in constant currency. While it's early days for Microsoft 365 Copilot, we're excited by the adoption we've seen to date and continue to expect revenue to grow over time. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 20s. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of $26 billion to $26.3 billion or growth between 18% and 19%. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth in constant currency to remain stable to our stronger-than-expected Q2 results. Growth will be driven by our Azure consumption business with continued strong contribution from AI. Our per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates, given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in Enterprise and Partner Services, revenue should decline approximately 10% on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of USD 14.7 billion to USD 15.1 billion or growth between 11% and 14%. Windows OEM revenue growth should be relatively flat as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-teens. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In devices, revenue should decline in the low double digits as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the mid- to high single digits, about 8 points higher than overall search and news advertising revenue driven by continued volume strength. And in gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low 40s, including approximately 45 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low to mid-50s driven by approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline year-over-year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between USD 18.6 billion to USD 18.8 billion, including approximately $700 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expense of USD 15.8 billion to USD 15.9 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $600 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and other losses. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be in line with our full year rate, which we now expect to be approximately 18%. Now some additional thoughts on the full fiscal year. First, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we now expect FX to increase Q4 and full year revenue growth by less than 1 point. We continue to expect no meaningful impact to full year COGS or operating expense growth. Second, Activision. For the full year FY '24, we expect Activision to be accretive to operating income when excluding purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs. At a total company level, we delivered strong results in H1, and demand for our Microsoft Cloud continues to drive the growth in our outlook for H2. Our commitment to scaling our cloud and AI investment is guided by customer demand and a substantial market opportunity. As we scale these investments, we remain focused on driving efficiencies across every layer of our tech stack and disciplined cost management across every team. Therefore, we expect full year operating margins to be up 1 to 2 points year-over-year even as AI capital investments drive COGS growth. This operating margin expansion includes the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year. In closing, we are focused on execution so our customers can realize the benefits of AI productivity gains as we invest to lead this AI platform wave. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett."", 'Brett Iversen', ""Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Joe, can you please repeat your instructions?"", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.', 'Mark L. Moerdler', ""Congratulations on the strong quarter. Amy, you've discussed Azure being stable and you delivered Azure growth stability. But if we drill in 1 layer, we see Azure AI continuing to become a bigger portion of the revenue. I understand that separating what is directly AI revenue and what is other IaaS/PaaS revenue that are leveraging while driven by AI is difficult, can you help me with 2 related questions? Optimization has been stabilizing, and at some point, it should be part of the revenue flow. How should we think about what happens then? Do we see nondirectly AI consumption being flattish? Or do we see a rebound as the cloud shift continues and the need for data inferencing grows?Second part, on AI, where are we in the journey from training driving most of the Azure AI usage to inferencing? When do you think we start to the pickup in non-Microsoft inferencing kicking in? When do you think we could hit the point where inferencing is the bigger part of the driver?"", 'Satya Nadella', 'You want me to go first?', 'Amy E. Hood', ""Why don't you go first and I'll take the technical..."", 'Satya Nadella', ""Yes, let me -- just on the inferencing and training, most -- what you've seen for most part is all inferencing. So none of the large model training stuff is in any of our either numbers at all. Small batch training, so somebody is doing fine-tuning or what have you, that will be there but that's sort of a minor part. So most of what you see in the Azure number is broadly inferencing. And Mark, I think it may be helpful to sort of think about like what is the new workload in AI. The new workload in AI obviously, in our case, it starts with 1 of the frontier -- I mean, starts with the frontier model, Azure OpenAI.But it's not just about just 1 model, right? So you -- first, you take that model, you do all that jazz, you may do some fine-tuning. You do retrieval, which means you're sort of either getting some storage meter or you're eating some compute meters. And so -- and by the way, there's still a large model to a small model and that would be a training perhaps, but that's a small batch training that uses essentially inference infrastructure. So I think that's what's happening. So you could even say these AI workloads themselves will have a life cycle, which is they'll get built, then they will be continuously optimized over time. So that's sort of 1 side.And I think if I understand your question, what's happening with the traditional optimization. And I think last quarter, we said, one, we are going to continue to have these cycles where people will build new workloads. They will optimize the workloads and they'll start new workloads. So I think that, that's what we continue to see. But that period of massive, I'll call it, optimization only and no new workload start, that, I think, has ended at this point. So what you're seeing is much more of that continuous cycles by customers, both whether it comes to AI or whether it comes to the traditional workloads."", 'Amy E. Hood', 'Maybe I\'ll just add just a few things to that. I think whether you use the word lapping these optimization comparables or the comparables easing, it\'s all sort of the same thing. That we\'re getting to that point in H2, that\'s absolutely true. We\'d like to talk about the contribution of AI, specifically for the reasons Satya talked about. These are -- this is starting to see the application of AI at scale and we want to be able to show people, this is how that\'s going to look.It\'s inferencing workloads where people are expecting productivity gains, other benefits that grow revenue. And so I do think about those as both related. And ultimately, the TAM that we go after is best thought of as across both of those, both AI workload and I guess, ""non-AI workload"", although to Satya\'s point, you need all of it.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.', 'Brent John Thill', ""Amy, the margin improvement is pretty shocking the most considering the investments that you and Satya are putting in AI. I'm curious if you could just walk through how this is possible and what you're seeing so far in some of the costs that you're trying to manage as you scale up AI."", 'Amy E. Hood', ""Thanks, Brent. First of all, thanks for the question. The teams are obviously been hard at work on this topic. We do point out that Q2, because of the impact of the charge a year ago, you're seeing larger margin improvement than I would say is sort of a run rate margin improvement. So let me first say that.Secondly, the absolute margin improvement has also been very good. And it speaks to, I think, one of the things Satya talked about and I reiterated a bit, which is that we want really to make sure that we're making investments, we're making them in consistency across the tech stack. The tech stack we're building, no matter what team is on, is inclusive of AI enablement. And so think about it as building that consistency without needing to add a lot of resources to do that. It's been a real pivot of our entire investment infrastructure to be working on this work.And I think that's important because it means you're shifting to an AI-first position, not just in the language we use but in what people are working on day to day. That does obviously create a leverage opportunity. There's also been really good work put in by many teams on improving the gross margin of the product. We talked about it with Office 365. We talked about it in Azure core. We even talked about it across our devices portfolio, where we've seen materially improvements over the course of the year. And so we need to kind of take improvements at the gross margin level plus this consistency of re-pivoting a workforce toward the AI-first work we're doing without adding a material number of people to the workforce, you end up with that type of leverage.And we still need to be investing. And so the important part, invest towards the thing that's going to shape the next decade and continue to stay focused on being able to deliver your day-to-day commitments. And so it's a great question, and hopefully, that helps piece apart a few of the components."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.', 'Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan', 'Superb quarter, great improvements. Just one question for you, Satya. Cloud computing changed the tech stack in ways that we could not imagine 10 years back. The nature of the database layer, the operating system, every layer just changed dramatically. How do you foresee generative AI changing the tech stack as we know it?', 'Satya Nadella', ""Yes, I think it's going to have a very, very foundational impact. In fact, you could say the core compute architecture itself changes, everything from power density to the data center design to what used to be the accelerator now is that sort of the main CPU, so to speak, or the main compute unit. And so I think -- and the network, the memory architecture, all of it. So the core computer architecture changes, I think every workload changes. And so yes, so there's a full -- like take our data layer.The most exciting thing for me in the last year has been to see how our data layer has evolved to be built for AI, right? If you think about Fabric, one of the genius of Fabric is to be able to say, let's separate out storage from the compute layer. In compute, we'll have traditional sequels, we'll have spark. And by the way, you can have an Azure AI drop on top of the same data lake, so to speak, or the lake house pattern. And then the business model, you can combine all of those different computes.So that's the type of compute architecture. So it's sort of a -- so that's just 1 example. The tool stuff is changing. Office. I mean, if you think about what -- if you look at Copilot, Copilot extensibility with GPT, Copilot apps to the Copilot stack, that's another sort of part of what's happening to the tech stack. So yes, I mean, it definitely builds. I mean, I do believe being in the cloud has been very helpful to build AI. But now AI is just redefining what it means to have -- what the cloud looks like, both at the infrastructure level and the app model."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS.', 'Karl Emil Keirstead', ""I wanted to return to AI. The 6-point AI lift to Azure is just extraordinary. But I wanted to ask you about your progress in standing up the infrastructure to meet that demand. If you feel like Microsoft is supply GPU-constrained, if the success you've had maybe working through some of the scaling bottlenecks that some of the other cloud infrastructure providers have talked about, a little bit maybe on the infrastructure scaling front might be interesting."", 'Amy E. Hood', ""Thanks, Karl. Maybe I'll start, and Satya, feel free to add on. Karl, I think we feel really good about where we have been in terms of adding capacity. You started to see the acceleration in our capital expense starting almost a year ago, and you've seen it scale through that process. And that is going toward, as we talked about, servers and also new data center footprints to be able to meet what we see as this demand and really changing demand as we look forward.And so I do feel like the teams have done a very good job. I feel like primarily, obviously, this is being built by us, but we've also used third-party capacity to help when we could have that help us in terms of meeting customer demand. And I tend to think looking forward, you'll tend to see and I guided toward it, accelerating capital expense to continue to be able to add capacity in the coming quarters, given what we see in terms of pipeline."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.', 'Brad Alan Zelnick', ""The early market feedback that we're all hearing on Microsoft 365 Copilot is very powerful. Can you provide more granularity on what you're seeing in terms of adoption trends versus perhaps other new product introductions in the past? What, if anything, is holding it back? And how much of a priority is it to get it in the hands of customers? How -- to what lengths might you go to incentivize just getting it out in the market?"", 'Satya Nadella', ""No. Thank you for the question, Brad. And so a couple of things. In my comments, I said increased in relation to our previous suites like, let's say, E3 or E5, whatever, 2 months in, it's definitely much faster than that. And so from that perspective, it's exciting to see, I'll say, the demand signal, the deployment signal. I was looking at by tenant, even usage, it's faster than anything else because it's easier, right? I mean, it's sort of -- it shows up in your app. You click on it like any ribbon thing and it becomes a daily habit.In fact, it reminds me a little bit of sort of the back in the day of PC adoption, right? It's kind of -- I think it first starts off with few people having access. There are many companies that are doing standard issue, right? So just like PCs became standard issue at some point after PCs being adopted by early adopters. I think that's the cycle that at least we expect.In terms of what we're seeing, it's actually interesting if you look at the data we have, summarization, that's what it's like, number one, like I'm doing summarizations of teams, meetings inside of teams during the meeting, after the meeting, Word documents, summarization. I get something in e-mail, I'm summarizing. So summarization has become a big deal. Drafts, right? You're drafting e-mails, drafting documents. So anytime you want to start something, the blank page thing goes away and you start by prompting and drafting.Chat. To me, the most powerful feature is now you have the most important database in your company, which happens to be the database of your documents and communications, is now query-able by natural language in a powerful way, right? I can go and say, what are all the things Amy said I should be watching out for next quarter? And it will come out with great detail. And so chat, summarization, draft.Also, by the way, actions, one of the most used things is, here's a Word document. Go complete -- I mean, create a PowerPoint for me. So those are the stuff that's also beginning. So I feel like these all become -- but fundamentally, what happens is you remember the PC adoption cycle. What it did was work, work artifact and work flow changed, right? You can imagine what forecasting was before Excel and e-mail and what it was after. So similarly, you'll see work and workflow change as people summarize faster, draft regulatory submissions faster, chat to get knowledge from your business. And so those are the things that we are seeing as overall patterns."", 'Amy E. Hood', ""And maybe just to add 2 points. One of the exciting things, as Satya said, for some companies, it's going to be standard issue like a PC. For other companies, they may want to do a land with a smaller group, see the productivity gains and then expand. And so being able to lift some of the seat requirements that we did earlier this month is really going to allow customers to be able to use that approach too.And the other thing I would add, we always talk about in enterprise software, you sell software, then you wait and then it gets deployed. And then after deployment, you want to see usage. And in particular, what we've seen and you would expect this in some ways with Copilot, even in the early stages, obviously, deployment happens very quickly. But really what we're seeing is engagement growth. To Satya's point on how you learn and your behavior changes, you see engagement grow with time. And so I think those are -- just to put a pin on that because it's an important dynamic when we think about the optimism you hear from us."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.', 'Mark Ronald Murphy', ""Is it possible to unpack the 6-point AI services tailwind just to help us understand which elements are ramped up by the 3 incremental points? For instance, is it more of the OpenAI inferencing, GitHub Copilot, other Copilots, the Azure OpenAI Service, third-party LLMs running on Azure? I'm just wondering where did you see the strongest step-up in that activity?"", 'Amy E. Hood', ""Mark, without getting into tons of line items, it's more simple to think of it as really, it's people adopting it for inferencing at the API generally. I mean, that's the easiest way to think about it. And we also saw growth in GitHub Copilot, which you talked -- which Satya talked about. And we saw a growing number of third parties using it in some smaller ways for training. But this is primarily an inferencing workload right now in terms of what's driving that number and how do you use to think about that."", 'Satya Nadella', ""Yes, Azure OpenAI and then OpenAI's own APIs on top of Azure would be the sort of the major drivers. But there's a lot of the small batch training that goes on, whether it's out of (inaudible) or fine-tuning. And then a lot of people who are starting to use models as a service with all the other new models. But it's predominantly Azure OpenAI today."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel.', 'Brad Robert Reback', ""Amy, for many, many years in commercial Office 365, seat growth has far outpaced ARPU. And over the last couple of quarters, we're getting a convergence, obviously, as the seat count gets really large. As we look forward, should they run even for a period of time or should we expect ARPU to outpace seat growth here in the short term?"", 'Amy E. Hood', ""That's a great question, Brad. And let me split apart the components and then we can come back to whether they should equalize or just go on sort of a bit, actually, believe it or not, somewhat independent trajectories and I'll explain why I say that. Seat growth, as we talk about, is primarily from, at this point, small and medium-sized businesses and really frontline worker scenarios. And to your point, on occasion, those are lower ARPU seats. But they are also -- they're new seats. And so you see that in the seat count number.And as we get through and we've seen that come down a little bit quarter-over-quarter, and we've guided for that really to happen again next quarter. But a very separate thing is being able to add ARPU. And traditionally, and again this quarter, right, that's come over time from E3 then from E5. And we're continuing to see very healthy sweet momentum and you heard very good renewals. So all of that, right, completely independent in some way from seat growth.Then the next thing that actually we just talked about, maybe in Brad's question, I'm trying to recall, is that you're going to see Copilot revenue will land there as ARPU, right? That won't show as seat growth. So you'll have E3, E5 transitions, Copilot all show up in ARPU over time. And then you'll have the seat growth be primarily still small business and frontline worker and maybe new industry scenarios. So I tend to not really, Brad, think about them as related lines, believe it or not. I think about them as sort of unique independent motions we run, and there's still room for seat growth. And obviously, with the levers we've talked about, there's room for ARPU growth as well."", 'Operator', 'Our last question will come from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi.', 'Tyler Maverick Radke', ""Satya, your enthusiasm about GitHub Copilot was noticeable on the conference call and at the AI Summit in New York last week. I'm wondering how you're thinking about pricing. Obviously, this is driving pretty incredible breakthroughs in productivity for developers. But how do you think about your ability to drive ARPU on the GitHub Copilot over time? And just talk us through how you're thinking about the next phase of new leases there."", 'Satya Nadella', ""Yes. I mean, it's -- I always go back to sort of my own conviction that this generation of AI is going to be different, started with the move from 2.5 to 3 of GPT and then its use inside of an Office scenario with GitHub Copilot. And so yes, I think this is the place where it's most evolved in terms of its economic benefits or productivity benefits. And you see it. We see it inside of Microsoft. We see it in all of the case studies we put out of customers.Everybody had talked it's become -- it is the 1 place where it's becoming standard issue for any developer. It's like if you take away spellcheck from Word, I'll be unemployable. And similarly, it will be like I think GitHub Copilot becomes core to anybody who is doing software development. The thing that you brought up is a little bit of a continuation to how Amy talked about, right? So you are going to start seeing people think of these tools as productivity enhancers, right?I mean, if I look at it, our ARPUs have been great but they're pretty low. But frankly, even though we've had a lot of success, it's not like we are a high-priced ARPU company. I think what you're going to start finding is, whether it's Sales Copilot or Service Copilot or GitHub Copilot or Security Copilot, they are going to fundamentally capture some of the value they drive in terms of the productivity of the OpEx, right? So it's like 2 points, 3 points of OpEx leverage would go to some software spend. I think that's a pretty straightforward value equation. And so that's the first time. I mean, this is not something we've been able to make the case for before, whereas now I think we have that case.Then even the horizontal Copilot is what Amy was talking about, which is at the Office 365 or Microsoft 365 level. Even there, you can make the same argument. Whatever ARPU we may have with E5, now you can say incrementally as a percentage of the OpEx, how much would you pay for a Copilot to give you more time savings, for example. And so yes, I think all up, I do see this as a new vector for us in what I'll call the next phase of knowledge work and frontline work even and their productivity and how we participate.And I think GitHub Copilot, I never thought of the tools business as fundamentally participating in the operating expenses of a company's spend on, let's say, development activity. And now you're seeing that transition. It's just not tools. It's about productivity of your dev team."", 'Brett Iversen', ""That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon."", 'Amy E. Hood', 'Thank you.', 'Satya Nadella', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference.

That is almost as much as the entire gross domestic product of Shanghai, one of China's largest cities."", ""Alibaba has the customer reach and technology to be a leader in China's booming AI economy. The company's Taobao marketplace had 895 million monthly active users through September 2023. Management credited the growth in its core marketplace business in the September-ending quarter to its wide offering of brands and merchants, in addition to AI-driven technology, such as virtual try-on features in the app."", 'Despite these advantages, revenue growth from Taobao and Tmall still decelerated last quarter to just 4% year over year. The competition from other marketplaces and macroeconomic challenges are taking their toll, but Alibaba has tools to fight back. The company has yet to fully flex its financial strength to more aggressively lower prices, which could put more pressure on smaller competitors.', ""All told, Alibaba's technology, wide customer reach, and profitability, where it generates $30 billion in trailing free cash flow, are worth betting on at these bargain-basement share prices. The stock could be a grand slam for investors if the stock eventually returns to the same price-to-earnings valuation as before the pandemic."", ""Investing in top jewelry brands can be a rewarding investment at the right price.

Improving sales in bridal, which generates half the company's merchandise sales, is a catalyst for growth."", ""Signet's sales were down 12% year over year last quarter, as the company's bridal business is expected to remain soft in the near term. But sales of engagement rings build long-term relationships with customers, and this fuels growth in services, which could be a source of expanding margins down the road."", ""Signet management projects annual adjusted earnings will reach at least $14 per share over the long term as bridal demand returns. That puts the stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio at just 7 -- a bargain, considering the company's record of profitable growth."", ""The stock rallied at the end of last year following healthy Black Friday sales in the holiday quarter.

The company, a global leader in coffee retail with over 38,500 stores, reported an 8% increase in consolidated net revenues, reaching $9.4 billion. This growth was primarily driven by the North America business and the International segment, with global comparable store sales growing by 5%. Operating margin also saw an improvement, increasing by 140 basis points to 15.8%, thanks to sales leverage and operational efficiencies. However, these positive developments were partially offset by increased investments in store partner wages and benefits, as well as higher general and administrative expenses. This SWOT analysis aims to provide investors with a data-driven perspective on Starbucks Corp's current position and future prospects."", ""Brand Equity and Market Presence: Starbucks Corp's (NASDAQ:SBUX) brand is one of its most significant assets. The company's logo and the experience it offers have become synonymous with premium coffee and customer service. This strong brand equity has enabled Starbucks to maintain a loyal customer base and command premium pricing. The recent financial data supports this, with an 8% increase in net revenues and a 5% growth in global comparable store sales, indicating the brand's continued appeal and market penetration."", ""Operational Efficiency: Starbucks has been focusing on operational efficiencies, which is evident from the 140 basis point increase in operating margin. These efficiencies are a result of the company's strategic initiatives, such as investments in technology and store partner training, which have improved service times and customer satisfaction. The company's ability to leverage its scale and operational expertise continues to be a key strength in driving profitability."", ""Increased Operating Costs: Despite its strong financial performance, Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) has experienced increased operating costs, particularly in investments related to partner wages and benefits. This increase in costs has put pressure on the company's profit margins, as reflected in the higher general and administrative expenses reported in the recent quarter. Managing these costs while maintaining competitive compensation packages will be a challenge for Starbucks moving forward."", ""Dependency on North American Market: While Starbucks has a significant international presence, its financial performance is still heavily reliant on the North American segment. Any economic downturn or market saturation in this region could adversely affect the company's overall performance. Diversifying revenue streams and reducing dependency on a single market will be crucial for long-term stability."", 'International Expansion: Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) has a significant opportunity to expand its international footprint, especially in emerging markets. With a 7% growth in international comparable store sales, the company can capitalize on the increasing demand for premium coffee experiences in these regions. Strategic market entry and partnerships can drive growth and diversify revenue sources.', ""Innovation in Product Offerings: The company's commitment to innovation is a major opportunity for growth. By continuously introducing new products and enhancing the customer experience through digital platforms, Starbucks can attract new customers and increase its market share. The success of such innovations is already evident in the company's recent financial performance."", 'Competitive Market: The coffee retail market is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) faces competition from both large chains and local coffee shops. Maintaining its competitive edge will require ongoing investment in product quality, marketing, and customer experience.', ""Macroeconomic Factors: Starbucks is susceptible to macroeconomic factors such as fluctuations in commodity prices, currency exchange rates, and changes in consumer spending behavior. The recent increase in operating costs due to higher wages and benefits highlights the impact of such economic factors on the company's financial health."", 'In conclusion, Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) continues to showcase its strength as a leading brand in the coffee industry, with a robust financial performance and significant market presence. However, the company must navigate increased operating costs and market competition while seizing opportunities for international expansion and product innovation. By addressing these challenges and leveraging its strengths, Starbucks is well-positioned to maintain its growth trajectory and deliver value to its shareholders.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

I will start by sharing an overview of our business performance in our first quarter of fiscal 2024. I will then turn it over to Rachel Ruggeri to walk through the detailed segment results. We saw strong momentum in a highly successful holiday in the quarter with record revenue and expanded margins.', 'We saw strong growth in our loyalty programs, sequentially increased frequency and record spend among our loyal customers, positive traction from new product innovations, exciting momentum in China with our focus on premium, and progress on the execution of our Triple Shot strategy. We also saw some unexpected headwinds, which impacted the rate of growth. We feel very confident about our robust plans to address these challenges. While we are already seeing traction, there was an impact in the quarter, and it will take some time to normalize.', 'Let me walk you through the details. Our performance in the quarter was fundamentally strong. Our Q1 total company revenue was a record $9.4 billion, up 8% year over year. Our global comparable store sales grew 5% year over year, supported by a 5% comp growth in North America, driven by 4% ticket growth and 10% comp growth in China.', 'Our global operating margins expanded by 130 basis points to 15.8% and our overall earnings per share grew 20% to $0.90. This speaks to the continued successful execution of our reinvention plan and the durable business we are building We are fortunate to have built one of the strongest brands in the world, and we continue to benefit from customer loyalty. Throughout the quarter, we saw our most loyal customers around the world coming into our stores more often. Specifically, in the US, we set new records with our 90-day active Rewards members growing 13% year over year to a record 34.3 million, with tender reaching an all-time high of 59% demonstrating increased engagement.', 'Importantly, the frequency of our most loyal customers increased sequentially, and spend per member reached a record in Q1 fueled by our holiday promotion, which significantly exceeded our expectations. Our cold and gingerbread platforms drove a record high ticket in the US in the quarter. We also had the highest sales of Starbucks gift cards in our history, making us No. 2 in gift cards sold.', 'In total, we have an incredible $3.6 billion preloaded onto our cards in the US in the quarter. In short, our growing Starbucks Rewards members are visiting our stores more frequently and increasing their spend each time that they come. We also saw great momentum in China. We aim to be the best in the premium market in China.', 'Our brand equity across Starbucks and Starbucks Reserve is second to none. Based on our latest brand tracker, Starbucks continues to be the first choice in away-from-home coffee, including among the Gen Z consumers. We continue to lead in brand affinity and have the highest awareness, brand familiarity, and purchase intent scores. We have the most outstanding partners in our stores with very strong customer connection and the highest retention rates in our industry.', ""We offer distinctive global and locally relevant product innovation anchored on superior coffee with food attachments and a morning daypart that now have surpassed pre-COVID levels. Our loyal customers, a major part of tender, are coming more often and our loyalty program is growing. We're doing all of this while offering premium physical and digital experiences delivered across our distinctive store portfolio across other physical channels and through our digital connection and doing so at a commensurate value. This ambition of being best in premium in China is in line with our long-term growth ambitions for China."", 'Let me now talk about the headwinds and our response. We entered the first quarter very strong globally. We had great momentum in August and September, and that continued into October, which exceeded our expectations across every measure. Beginning in mid-November, while our business continued to grow, the growth rate was impacted by three unexpected factors.', 'First, we saw a negative impact to our business in the Middle East. Second, events in the Middle East also had an impact in the US, driven by misperceptions about our position. Our most loyal customers remain loyal and in fact, increased their frequency and spend in the quarter. But we did see a softening of US traffic.', 'Specifically, our occasional US customers, who tend to visit the afternoon, came in less frequently. I will speak in a moment as to how we quickly responded with an effective action plan. Finally, we experienced a slower-than-expected recovery in China, driven by a more cautious consumer. While we had a relatively very strong Double 11 holiday, the overall market weakness led to significantly increased pricing competition.', ""We responded quickly to these headwinds. In the US, we implemented targeted offers aimed at bringing our occasional customers into our loyalty program. As we've seen over time, Starbucks Rewards members develop a routinized long-term relationship with our brand that increases both ticket and transactions. Additionally, we activated new capabilities within our proprietary Deep Brew data analytics and AI tool to identify and incentivize specific rewards members cohorts."", ""Finally, we are leaning further into our brand, marketing and factual narrative, and social media to engage these audiences where they are. We've already seen the positive impact of these new initiatives with our more occasional customers beginning to rebound in December. However, we continue to see further opportunity to welcome back our very occasional customers. We feel good about the trajectory over the course of the quarter, but it will take time for our plans to be fully realized."", 'In China, we remain very confident in the long term. The market is going through a transition as we see an increase in mass market competitors, which we believe will shake out over time, and the market will emerge looking fundamentally different than what we see today. We expect a much larger and tiered market as per capita consumption continues to increase and the market matures. There are three key elements in our China strategy.', ""First, we are offering more coffee forward, locally relevant product innovations and we're increasing engagement in social media channels through influencers and partnerships, which are highly effective in China. These actions are increasing awareness and have led to greater customer frequency. Second, we have made significant investments in technology, increasing our omnichannel capability, allowing us to serve more customers through new occasions. These investments have also led to a more digitized store environment, increasing efficiency of our supply chain and stores while enhancing the partner experience and strengthening our unit economics in both existing and new stores."", ""Finally, we're increasing the percentage of new stores opening in lower tier markets and new county cities where we see meaningfully stronger new store economics. As you can see, we moved quickly to respond and implement a plan to address these unexpected headwinds. It will take time for these action plans to be fully realized. That said, we remain confident in our Triple Shot strategy and our long-term growth."", 'So, let me share some of the progress in the quarter. Our first Triple Shot Reinvention priority is to elevate our brand by operating great stores and driving product innovation. The best lever for elevating our brand is our store experience. We continue to raise the bar on running great stores with a focus on enhancing both our partner and customer experience.', ""One example is the continued rollout of our Siren System cold and food stations. We remain on track to have approximately 10% of our stores equipped with a Siren System by the end of this year. We are a coffee company, and we will continue to lead with coffee innovation. We're continuing the installation of our Clover Vertica in nearly 10% of our US company-operated stores in the quarter."", 'We are on track to have on-demand single-cup brewers installed in nearly 60% of our US company-operated stores in fiscal year 2024. This will continue to elevate our coffee offering while also making partners more productive by reducing waste and creating efficiencies in store, allowing them to spend more time doing what they do best, connecting with our customers. Just imagine a perfectly brewed on-demand cup of coffee at any time throughout the day, even decaf. This quality and the offering are like no other in the industry.', 'We also continue to offer coffee blends, which are distinctive and remind people of the romance of coffee. Our Verona blend is anchored in the essence of Verona, Italy. It was our tribute to the city of romance in Italy. In celebration of our five years in Italy, we will introduce a new coffee, Starbucks Milano Roast inspired by the art and culture of Milan.', ""Milan's Me Art, an international modern and contemporary art fair, is the perfect backdrop to a launch in our Milan Roastery that will then scale globally. The moment will capture a love of coffee, the passion of our partners, and the dynamism of Milano. Today, we are excited to launch the Oleato platform with Oleato customizations across the US In the coming weeks. We will also launch a Chocolate-Covered Strawberry Creme Frappuccino and a chocolate hazelnut cookie, cold brew in time for Valentine's Day."", ""Starting this week, and continuing over the next few months, we will be introducing three new beverage platforms, each of which is squarely aimed at our Gen Z and millennial customers across the range of coffee and cold beverages and compelling for the afternoon. These product innovations are examples of how we continuously elevate the brand and welcome customers back with a unique Starbucks experience. We're also offering new and exciting options beyond coffee, including food that appeals to different dayparts, especially the afternoon. In January, we added new menu items, including the potato cheddar and chive bakes and the chicken maple butter and egg sandwich."", ""These are products that tide our customers over between lunch and dinner. Importantly, our digital experience makes attaching food to afternoon drink orders easy and convenient. We've seen a very positive customer response to these new items, and we are expanding inventory to meet the strong demand. We're also pleased with the pace of our new store openings and strong unit economics."", 'Our most recent age of class of company-operated new stores in the US is average unit volumes of approximately $2 million with ROIs of approximately 50%. And as we continue to open more stores, growing by approximately 4% this year in the US on a base of over 16,000, including licensed stores, we will further invest in purpose-built stores to meet our customers where they need and want us to be. This includes drive-throughs, which have grown by over 500 stores since Q1 of last year. Even in the US, we see abundant greenfield opportunity ahead.', ""Our second strategic priority is further strengthening and differentiating our leadership position in digital. We saw our mobile order and pay surpass a record high 30% of all transactions in the quarter, and we reduced downtime of mobile order and pay by half as we continue to find ways to deliver better customer experience. We'll continue to make the Starbucks app even better, including adding the ability to use a personal cup in ordering through the app and the rollout of more accurate order wait times. We're also laser-focused on ensuring our customers can personalize their orders in whatever way they want."", 'One example is helping customers find products based on dietary needs. We saw record results in our US delivery business with growth of nearly 80% year over year, aided by our expanded partnership with DoorDash. We see significant growth for continued incremental growth as delivery represents only 2% of our transactions. Our purpose-built stores optimized for delivery and fulfillment help seize this opportunity.', ""Additionally, we are conducting a pilot with Gopuff targeting a fully incremental opportunity for overnight orders between 5:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. In this pilot, Starbucks-trained baristas prepare handcrafted Starbucks drinks and food inside Gopuff micro fulfillment centers, delivering to the customer's door in about 30 minutes. To further expand the reach and impact of mobile ordering and rewards, we now offer Starbucks connecting over 40% of our more than 6,700 US-licensed stores, with further expansion planned for this year."", ""We're also pleased to share that Bank of America will be our next Starbucks Rewards partner, delivering even more value to our most loyal customers. This opportunity builds the great success of our partnership with Delta Airlines that has deepened connection and engagement with our members and is one of two new Starbucks Awards partnerships we told you we would roll out this year. Our third strategic priority is becoming truly global. Our international business represents an important growth opportunity for us over the long term."", 'If you look at our business, excluding the headwinds, we had a strong quarter, demonstrating the momentum and resiliency across the portfolio. We opened over 420 net new stores in the quarter, a growth of 10% year over year, bringing total store count to over 20,600 stores with nearly 14,000 of those stores outside of China and the US. In Japan, we reached a milestone of 1,900 stores across the market with much opportunity ahead. Let me address our business in the Middle East.', 'I am deeply distressed by the violence shaking the region. As I have shared, Starbucks condemns violence against the innocent, hate and weaponized speech. We are intensely focused on supporting our partners and the many other stakeholders affected by what is taking place. We have seen a significant impact on traffic and sales in the region and we are working with our licensees during this time to ensure the safety and well-being of our partners and our customers.', 'I shared earlier in my remarks how we are addressing the near-term situation in China. Overall, our business and brand in China remain strong. Our revenue in the quarter grew 20% in constant currency underpinned by a 10% increase in comparable store sales growth as the market lapped prior-year mobility restructurings. As we strengthen our position in the premium market in China, let me point to a few accomplishments of the quarter.', 'We launched 12 new coffee-forward beverages in the quarter, including Intenso, which was incredibly popular with our customers, including Gen Z, fueling the morning daypart, which is now larger than pre-COVID levels. Our digital channels accounted for a record 52% of sales, up 4 percentage points quarter over quarter. Our Starbucks Rewards gold member frequency increased by nearly 10% over the prior quarter, with total member engagement setting a record 73% of tender, demonstrating the stability of our most loyal customers. Our new stores continue to deliver attractive returns on both the top line and profitability with further strengthened unit economics in stores opened in new county cities.', 'And our turnover among full-time store partners reached a record low in the quarter, coupled with an all-time high partner satisfaction score. Early this month, we celebrated our 25th anniversary in China. With nearly 7,000 stores, we have built a durable business. We have built a terrific brand, and we are well on track to hit our 9,000-store target by 2025 and continue to have full confidence in the market opportunity.', ""We continue to see enormous potential in China's premium market, and no one is better positioned to lead in this space. Even as we navigate a dynamic environment, we remain confident in our long-term growth in our international segment. As part of elevating our brand across the international segment, along with a second reserve store in India, we will open two additional Starbucks Roasteries that celebrate coffee, art and design in markets outside the US and China. We will announce these locations and opening timings in due course."", ""Turning to our fourth priority. We're focused on unlocking $3 billion in efficiencies, and I'm pleased to say that we're making steady progress. Our Triple Shot Reinvention efforts delivered 130 basis points of margin expansion in the first quarter of the fiscal year. As you hear me say often, the key to our success is the experience that our partners create for our customers."", ""We're investing in a better experience for our partners to advance our business through a more balanced growth model as we unlock efficiency. In the quarter, we have seen the effectiveness of the Reinvention-driven investments we have made in in-store operational efficiencies such as standards, equipment innovation, and scheduling improvements, leading to a more stable environment for our partners. Turnover has decreased by 5% year over year and is now well below pre-COVID levels. Average partner hours increased 10% leading to a 14-percentage point increase in partner sentiment related to scheduling, specifically preferred hours, which we know is important to partners."", ""We are listening to our partners and investing to make their experience better. Of course, we have more work to do, but we are proud of the progress we have made today. Outside of our stores, we're working to drive efficiencies across our supply chain and expenses. I am pleased with the progress, and we remain on track to unlock $3 billion of efficiencies over the next three years."", ""Our final priority is reinvigorating our partner culture. In addition to the investments in partner experience, we're focused on partner culture. Our leadership team and board of directors have been deeply engaged in putting the partner experience at the heart of the business. An independent assessment found that our strategic investments, greater on-the-ground support, a dedicated labor relations team, and more bespoke management training are having a tangible impact on the commitments we have made to our partners."", 'The assessment was also clear that there has been no union-busting playbook at Starbucks. I want to be clear in my view on the matter of unionization at Starbucks. We believe in a direct relationship with our partners and in the 4% of our stores in the US where our partners have chosen to be represented by a union, we are committed to finding a constructive path forward with those unions. I care deeply about our partners, their experiences and safety at Starbucks and their futures.', ""Our partners remain core to the success of our business, and I am proud to be restitching the fabric of the green apron for all partners. Going forward, we plan to continue to focus deeply on reinvigorating our partner culture. It's a priority for me, and I'll continue spending time each month working up close shoulder to shoulder with partners in stores. I did this during my visit to India earlier this month, and I will continue doing it to stay grounded in the realities of the business, good and not so good."", ""I'm also proud to have earned my Coffee Master black apron along with my executive leadership team. A deep connection to partners and to coffee is a top priority for me and for every leader at Starbucks. As we look ahead to what is brewing for Starbucks in 2024, I have great optimism. We have a strong strategy, our refreshed mission, values, and promises are underpinning everything we do."", 'We have many strengths to build on and a clear plan to navigate this dynamic environment. While it will take time, we are confident we have significant headroom to further grow top line and bottom line in the long term and invest in our partners and the business by delivering strong shareholder returns. Finally, before I turn this over to Rachel, I want to remind everyone that Starbucks is focused on human connection. We stand for belonging.', 'We stand for joy. We stand for humanity. That is what differentiates our brand and our business and has for the last 52 years. We believe this has never been more important in the world.', 'And with that, Rachel?', 'Rachel Ruggeri -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Thank you, Laxman, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by saying that I am so proud of the significant margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth we delivered in our first quarter despite the top-line headwinds we experienced. Our strong focus on reinvention continued to unlock efficiencies driving a balanced outcome where both revenue growth and margin expansion drove our earnings growth. As we have shared, we are unlocking multiple paths to support our earnings growth over the long term, creating a more durable business, and this quarter proves testament to that durability.', 'Our Q1 consolidated revenue reached a record $9.4 billion, up over 8% from the prior year even with the confluence of factors adversely impacting our business as Laxman discussed in detail at the top of our call. The revenue increase was driven by 5% comparable store sales growth, 8% net new company-operated store growth, as well as a 6% increase in our global licensed store revenue over the prior year, underscoring the strength of our broader portfolio and our execution. Q1 consolidated operating margin expanded 130 basis points from the prior year to 15.8%, primarily driven by sales leverage and Reinvention-related in-store operational efficiencies, partially offset by our continued investments in our partners. Our Reinvention has successfully driven resiliency in our business with our North America margin expanding a notable 280 basis points in the quarter, which I will discuss in further detail in a moment.', ""Q1 EPS was $0.90, up 20% from the prior year. Our strong double-digit EPS growth in the quarter demonstrates multiple paths to drive growth and profitability. I'll now provide segment highlights for Q1. North America delivered another quarter of record revenue in Q1 was $7.1 billion, up 9% from the prior year, driven by a combination of a 5% increase in comparable store sales inclusive of a 4% and 1% increase in average ticket and transactions, respectively, as well as net new company-operated growth of 4% over the prior year."", ""Our US-licensed store business also contributed to the segment's growth from increased travel and further rollout of our Starbucks Connect program. Our US company-operated business delivered 5% comparable store sales growth in Q1 driven by 4% ticket growing from pricing, mix, and customization. This led us to having our highest average ticket in our 50-plus-year history as our successful holiday innovation and complementary product offerings, including our new Chai Tea Latte and Sugar Plum Cheese Danish resonated with customers. Comparable transactions for the quarter increased 1% as traffic was pressured to negative single digits in November before it started to rebound in December."", ""In light of the pressured traffic, and as Laxman mentioned earlier, customers showed strong loyalty through our Starbucks Rewards program with record engagement and the highest ever spend per member. North America's operating margin was 21.4% in Q1, expanding 280 basis points from the prior year, driven by 240 basis points from Reinvention-related in-store operational efficiencies, as well as sales leverage and pricing, partially offset by continued investment in our partners. This substantial margin expansion in the quarter reflected the meaningful labor staffing and scheduling improvements we made as part of our reinvention. We unlocked significant stability by focusing on staffing and scheduling hours based on partners' preferred shifts, which enhanced both our partners' experience and subsequent store performance."", ""We saw store efficiency increase as items per labor hour reached its highest level in the quarter. Outside of stores, we reaped the benefits of enhanced sourcing and waste reductions in the first quarter, as seen by improvement in the segment's product and distribution costs. When you think about the operational efficiencies that continue to manifest both in and out of stores, we expect to continue delivering progressive margin expansion. Moving to international."", 'The segment delivered $1.8 billion in revenue in the quarter, up 12% from the prior year. The revenue growth was driven by a 12% increase in net new company-operated stores year over year, as well as a 7% increase in comparable store sales driven by 11% transaction growth, partially offset by a 3% decline in average ticket. As Laxman mentioned, the pace of recovery in China was slower than expected. That, coupled with a negative impact to our business in the Middle East, pressured our international segment as a whole.', ""However, we continue to see these headwinds as transitory and remain committed to our long-term growth ambitions in the segment. In Q1, China's revenue grew 20% driven by 15% new store growth, as well as a 10% increase in comparable store sales growth, including 21% transaction growth, largely related to the market lapping prior-year COVID impact. Comparable ticket, however, declined 9% due to mix shift, including lower sales of merchandise and increased promotional environment. The market opened 169 net new stores and entered 28 new county cities in the quarter, serving as a proof point that our commitment to expanding our premium position in the market has not wavered."", ""Total international segment operating margin was 13.1% in Q1, contracting 110 basis points from the prior year. The contraction was primarily driven by investments in partner wages and benefits, business mix shift as a greater portion of the segment's revenue was generated in our company-operated markets versus the prior year and strategic investments, partially offset by sales leverage. Shifting to channel development. The segment's revenue of $448 million in Q1 declined 7% from the prior year, largely in line with our expectations given the sale of Seattle's Best Coffee."", ""Our business continues to resonate with customers as Starbucks maintained the No. 1 share position in both US at-home coffee and US ready-to-drink in the first quarter as our holiday offerings such as peppermint mocha and gingerbread were among customer favorites. The segment's operating margin was 46.8% in Q1, down 60 basis points from prior year, driven by product cost and Global Coffee Alliance, partially offset by business mix shift. Although there was contraction in the first quarter, we continue to expect the segment's full year operating margin to expand to the high 40% to low 50% range and be accretive to our total company margin."", 'Now moving on to our guidance for fiscal year 2024. We are confident that the business pressures we experienced in the first quarter are transitory. With that, our guidance shared at our Reinvention update in November remains unchanged related to our global store growth, operating margin, and EPS. However, given the collective magnitude of headwinds on our first quarter revenue and the time it will take for our action plans to be realized, we are revising our full year outlook for revenue and comp to reflect our Q1 results, as well as account for recent trends, including a softer-than-planned January, which we expect will impact our Q2 performance.', 'With that, we now expect our full year global revenue growth in the range of 7% to 10%, revised from our previous range of the low end of 10% to 12%. Full year global and US comp growth in the range of 4% to 6%, both revised from the previous range of 5% to 7%. China comp growth of low single digits for the balance of the year, revised from the previous range of 4% to 6% in Q2 through Q4 with higher comp in Q1. Just to be clear, we continue to expect to deliver full year global store growth at approximately 7%, progressive operating margin expansion on a full year basis, full year EPS, and non-GAAP EPS growth in the range of 15% to 20% as we have multiple paths to such earnings growth as we demonstrated in the first quarter.', ""As an additional insight, here are a few clarification items related to guidance. As a reminder, our guidance does not include any impact from foreign currency translation and assumes constant currency. In terms of quarterly shape, we expect growth rates for our global revenue comp, operating margin, as well as GAAP and non-GAAP EPS to be the lowest in Q2 and meaningfully below our full fiscal year guidance ranges due to the pressures we discussed in today's call. These metrics are then expected to rebound and stabilize in the second half of our fiscal year."", 'While we continue to expect our effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in the mid-20% range, they are expected to be meaningfully higher than our fiscal year 2023 tax rate of 23.6%, which benefited from certain discrete nonrecurring tax items. Finally, our disciplined capital allocation approach continues to deliver significant results. The combination of revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working capital, underpinned by the disciplined capital allocation, increased our Q1 cash from operations to a record 2.4 billion. Our strong cash generation, together with our leverage and investment grade rating, creates exceptional shareholder returns while maintaining balance sheet flexibility to fund our critical investments, creating a competitive advantage.', 'In summary, here are key takeaways from my discussion today. First, our Triple Shot Reinvention is continuing to unlock our greatest potential, evidenced by the strong operating margin performance and balanced earnings growth in the first quarter in spite of the pressured environment. Next, our revenue and comp guidance has been revised to reflect our Q1 results and expected near-term and transitory headwinds. But importantly, despite these headwinds, we remain committed to our full year fiscal 2024 EPS growth in the range of 15% to 20%.', 'Further, we have robust plans to navigate through the complex and dynamic environment and recognize our plans will take time to materialize, but remain confident in our long-term growth. And finally, our focused and disciplined approach to capital allocation drives our financial fortitude and balance sheet optionality, keeping us in a position of strength. Before I close, I want to thank all the partners across the globe who consistently find ways to create joy and foster connection to and with our customers. You give me the confidence that our best days are yet to come.', ""So, thank you, partners. With that, I'll turn it back to Tiffany."", 'Tiffany Willis -- Vice President, Investor Relations', ""Thank you, Rachel. Before we open the call to Q&A, we request that your questions today be focused on the quarterly performance that we just discussed, as this call is not to address questions related to recent proxy filings. With that, Diego, let's take the first question."", '', 'Operator', ""Thank you. [Operator instructions] In order to allow as many questions as possible, we ask you to please limit yourself to one question at a time. We will come back for follow-up questions as time allows. We'll pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster."", 'Your first question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein, Barclays. Please go ahead.', 'Jeffrey Bernstein -- Barclays -- Analyst', ""Great. Thank you very much. Just a question on the fiscal '24 guidance. I appreciate that you tempered the comp growth for both the US and China."", ""For the US, it looks like it's only a point and China, it's only a few points, but we would define that, I guess, as modestly. And you mentioned that fiscal 2Q is expected well below the targets before accelerating the rest of the year. So, with that as a backdrop, I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about -- I think you mentioned January has been softer than expected. Any color you could provide there."", ""And otherwise, your confidence in that new guidance, it does seem like it implies a rather sharp acceleration in the back half of the year. I'm just wondering how you think about the guidance relative to maybe tempering it further and not having that risk if perhaps the recovery doesn't play out as fast as you might be expecting. Thank you."", 'Rachel Ruggeri -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. Thank you, Jeffrey. This is Rachel. As it relates to our guidance, when we look at our revised revenue guidance, it's based on the performance we saw in Q1, as well as the near-term and transitory headwinds that we've spoken about."", ""With that, we expect Q2 will be below the full year guidance ranges, largely due to the fact that it's going to take some time for our plans to materialize, as well as we'll continue to see impacts to our business in the Middle East. But what gives us confidence in that revenue range is the fact that we still have a very strong and growing loyal customer base. We're having increased capability as it relates to our digital programs around the world. And we've also seen that our Reinvention has been very successful in helping us to meet increasing demand."", ""Most specifically in this quarter, we saw really strong demand supported in our morning daypart, our busiest day part in our US business. And we actually exceeded both prior year, the year before, and we're very right on line with pre-COVID level. So, we're encouraged by that overall just in terms of transactions. And in addition to that, as we talked about in the call, we're confident that we have multiple levers to be able to drive our earnings growth."", ""Revenue growth is one factor, and we believe we've got growth in that guidance range, that will help drive margin expansion through flow-through. But in addition to that, we have in-store and out-of-store efficiencies that we're seeing great success with. And so, that gives us some confidence that we have a balanced path and multiple levers to be able to drive that earnings growth of 15% to 20% on a full year basis."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.', 'Brian Harbour -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', 'Yeah, thank you. Good afternoon. Could you talk more about kind of the specific plans to drive sort of the occasional customer and it sounds like you would expect some pretty solid improvement in US sales as we go through the year. It sounds like what was new was some new product platforms -- could you just elaborate on how quickly you think those will work? What might be coming on the product side that drives your confidence in US sales?', 'Laxman Narasimhan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. Let me start, and I'll call on Brady a bit to provide some more color. As we said earlier, what we saw in the US was a quarter that was actually very strong until about the middle of November. And what you see in the results, very strong performance of the loyal customers, very strong holiday performance, very strong brand equity, and very strong performance in gift card sales."", ""And we mentioned as well that we've got about $3.6 billion loaded on our card, so manifestation of the overall brand being very strong. And so, there is, of course, what we do have the isolated impact with the occasional customers, particularly those that visit in the afternoon. So, if you look at some of the actions that we have in place, first, there is actually more demand than we're currently meeting in the US Second, our loyalty program is already performing exceptionally well, as Rachel mentioned, but we have a combination of things that we're doing to address the traffic slowdown, particularly in the afternoon. The first area is innovation."", ""We mentioned a couple of new products coming in time for Valentine's Day. But we're going to have three new beverage platforms coming in the next six months, and you will see how important that is for us over time. The second action is really we're opening up our app ecosystem to bring more people into the app because we know that our members develop a routinized long-term relationship with our brand that increases both traffic and transactions. And third, we are implementing targeted offers aimed at some of these very occasional customers to bring them back into the stores."", 'And all that, of course, is foundational to, we continue to execute in our stores in order to elevate partner pride, bring a great deal of passion back into the business and ensure that we can meet more of the demand that we know exists. Brady, do you want to give a bit more flavor around some of the activations, particularly on the innovation side?', 'Brady Brewer -- Executive Vice President, Chief Marketing Officer', ""Sure. Thank you, Brian. Thank you, Laxman. As Laxman said, there's a calendar of compelling product innovation."", ""Laxman spoke about the new beverage platforms that are coming over the next few months. On food, we're seeing a lot of momentum on this health-conscious all-day breakfast and all-day snacking that I spoke about on the Investor Day. As we've released new products in that space, we've seen great resonance with customers and we'll continue to mine that space. Then we look at digital, Laxman referenced the 30% of US transactions coming through MLP."", ""We're seeing high demand for that service even among occasional customers, so increasing the reach of the app, number one, increasing personalized communication in the app, both to drive ticket for those routinized customers, but also frequency for the less frequent customers is a capability that we continue to build. We talk a lot about our personalization capabilities at Starbucks, but truly, that job is never done because as new technologies and capabilities come online, we are grabbing those and integrating them into our system to use that as a business accelerator. And then lastly, I'd say just making Starbucks more accessible, expanding, as you heard from Laxman, the delivery options you have with Starbucks is a very fast-growing part of our business. And then looking at ways to capture more Starbucks Rewards members who are currently not members through big partnerships like the one we've just announced with Bank of America."", ""So, between compelling products, really accelerating SR member acquisition efforts, and then building our brand, as Laxman said, to address the fact-based narrative in social media and win our customers and win every visit back, that's where we're focused."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG.', 'Peter Saleh -- BTIG -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks for taking the question. I did want to ask about the check dynamics going on in China. Looks like down, call it, 9%.', ""It's a pretty steep decline. Can you just talk about the promotional environment that you're seeing there? And what exactly you guys are doing to combat that? And just more specifically, should we expect this check impact to really continue for the balance of the year? Or how do we think about that going forward? Thank you."", 'Laxman Narasimhan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, we have Belinda on the line here. So, maybe I'll turn this over to Belinda. Do you want to answer that question, please?"", 'Belinda Wong -- Chairwoman, Starbucks China', 'OK. Thank you for the question. Let me just address the AT decline first, the average tech decline. First of all, our beverage and food sales were strong and contributed majority of our comp growth in Q1 and our AT zero decline, the 9% decline mainly came from two areas.', ""One is lower sales of our higher-priced merchandise as our consumers now more cautious in their spending. But the merchandise category constitutes a relatively small portion of our sales mix. Second is the targeted promotional investments that we are making to personalize offers and reward customers' behaviors in order to drive trial vacancies. Now this enables us to optimize our sales and margin."", ""And this is powered by China Deep Brew that helps us to design the right offers to the right cohorts of customers at the right time. So, that's mainly the reasons for decline. And you asked about the promotional environment. Let me just say this."", ""The coffee market is evolving as Laxman said, and going through a transition. It's still early days, and it has not yet fully tiered, right? You see influx of mass market competitors focus on fast store expansion and low-price tactics to drive trial. This will shake out over time. And yes, we are operating under an increased promotional environment."", ""We're not interested in entering the price war. We're focusing on capturing high-quality but profitable, sustainable growth, OK? And it is our aim to be the best and lead in the premium market as Lax has said, which Starbucks has pioneered in China 25 years ago. And we will continue to focus on premium experience that is high-quality coffee and human connection. And we have clear strategies to fuel our comp and total growth."", ""And Lax shared the three points, well, the three strategies, I'll add a little bit more color. We're going to dial up our beverage and food innovation with robust marketing activations on social media and in-store. We're going to accelerate our digitalization efforts to drive innovations, sales, and productivity. We're going to continue our new store expansion infill in existing cities and accelerate new county city entry, as Lax has said."", ""We're going to dial up our omnichannel expansion, scale up our membership program, and continue to invest in our partners. So, we have all these strategies to drive our comp growth and total growth in traffic and ticket. So, we are very confident in our ability to deliver our growth in the short and long term. Thank you."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank.', 'Lauren Silberman -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', ""Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about the US business, and I appreciate all the color I guess, two related questions. One, I understand you're seeing a more significant slowdown with the occasional customer. Have you also seen a slowdown in traffic with rewards customers? Or are the challenges really just isolated to occasional trying to understand some of the breadth of the social media challenges? And then second, you ramped up the level of promotional activities for rewards."", ""Is this effectively hitting the occasional customer? Just trying to understand how you're thinking about promotional activity ahead."", 'Laxman Narasimhan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, let me take this on. First of all, we are seeing no slowdown in our loyal SR customers. In fact, we're seeing an increase in frequency. They're buying more, they're customizing more."", ""That part of the business is extremely strong. We did see, as you rightfully said, a slowdown in the very occasional customers, which we're still working to get back. But the folks in the middle who were occasional, some of the tactics that we used, which, of course, you're seeing essentially help bring them back into the fray in terms of the traffic we've seen. It bounced back toward December."", ""So, we're focused on ensuring that we do the right thing in terms of welcoming back our very occasional customers with the right offer with the right innovation and with the right experience in stores."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer and Company.', 'Brian Bittner -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst', 'Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. Rachel, I wanted to ask about the operating margin expansion in the Americas segment. Obviously, it was very impressive.', ""And it was driven by leverage on your store operating expense line. In fact, when we break it down on a dollar basis, on a same-store basis, those operating expenses were actually flattish or even slightly down year over year. Can you just unpack what's going on in that line item? How sustainable is this performance on the operating expense line?"", 'Rachel Ruggeri -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure. As you look at the store operating expense, it's largely driven by the activities we've taken around our Reinvention in in-store operational efficiencies. So, that's a combination of a number of factors, including we've focused on operational execution, leveraging standards to be able to manage performance across over 9,700 stores and growing. So, that's been one driver."", ""In addition to that, we've had continued improvement in our equipment. And the investments we made in equipment a year ago, as well as the investments we currently make, that's all annualizing and helping to support the favorability that we're seeing in the margin expansion. And then third is, more recently, we focused on improving our overall scheduling. So, providing more hours for our partners per store."", ""We have a ways to go, but we know that that's a high driver of engagement. All of those efforts together have led to lower turnover in a more stable environment. And it's that stability that really allows us to create a better efficiency in serving our customers. So, as an example, I already spoke about our morning daypart this quarter in the US was the strongest that we've seen."", ""And that's a function of all of those efforts and activities that I just spoke about being realized in supporting our demand. So, creating a better experience for our partners leads to the better experience for our customers. Now some of that was annualization from the efforts that we made last year, but we continue to see quite a bit of opportunity ahead when we think about continuing to focus on scheduling, continual focus on improvements in staffing. We have more work ahead of us there, as well as out-of-store efficiencies."", ""The way we scrutinize our sourcing, the way we distribute to our stores, we've seen some benefits from that this quarter. That won't show up in-store operating expense. That will be in our product and distribution cost. But between those two lines, that's where we see potential opportunity going forward."", 'So, it gives us confidence in the progressive margin expansion -- but importantly, our ability to continue to meet that 15% to 20% earnings growth.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.', 'David Palmer -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', ""A big-picture question. I don't know if this is maybe one for Brady, but by our math, just looking back to 2016, just because you gave some percentages on what was cold and what was hot of your beverages. It looks like, your US cold beverage sales have grown by roughly 750,000 per store, while hot beverage sales have declined by 150,000 per store. And since pre-COVID your Rewards membership has more than doubled, but traffic is down since that time."", ""And we don't see your customer like you do. So, this is a bit of a question. But it looks like you maybe have less of that everyday hot coffee and latte consumer and more of a new type of consumer that comes less frequently and probably has opts for cold beverage. I'm envisioning them being my daughter and three of her friends coming in some afternoon."", ""So, it's more of an episodic visit, big orders, cold beverage led. So, with this happening, if this is what's happening, how does that inform your strategy for growth going forward? I know you're doing some things to increase capacity on cold beverage and maybe that helps fuel summer months a little bit more. But I'm just wondering like what -- do you share that perspective? And how does that fuel your strategy? Thank you."", 'Brady Brewer -- Executive Vice President, Chief Marketing Officer', ""Yeah. Thank you, David. It's a great question. My perspective is a little different in that we don't see a trade-off in frequency between cold beverage customers and hot beverage customers."", ""It's really a shift in generational taste preferences where that highly frequent millennial Gen Z customer is drinking cold coffee every day. Just as people have different generations, we're drinking hot coffee to start their day every day. So, we've seen a continued increase in our cold beverage in our portfolio, as you noted, but what I found with the cold beverages is there are infinite customizations possible on the cold beverage platform. And what that means is that it's increasingly a beverage, you can't get anywhere else."", ""And so, it has staying power to it. So, we don't see a trade-off in frequency from hot to cold. Cold is a great business for us. And we don't see a threat there, we see a great opportunity."", ""You mentioned about the capacity that we can put in place with Siren System and other aspects of the things we're doing in Reinvention, which is really about accelerating our capacity to create and craft cold beverages at pace with our customers, both in drive-through, mobile order and delivery, in particular. So, that is a huge opportunity for the company. And on hot beverage, I would say we're not leaving that customer behind. We're continuing to innovate on hot beverages just as we did today with the launch of our Oleato beverages."", ""We're launching Clover Vertica store across our portfolio. We're in 10% of stores now, and that is the best cup of brewed coffee you've ever been able to get at Starbucks, rolling out on a proprietary machine. And then lastly, you mentioned or Lax mentioned our Milano Roast, which is really our passion for coffee coming to fruition. So, whether you're a cold coffee customer or a hot coffee customer, we're increasingly creating a reason for you to visit, and we see no trade-off there."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.', 'Sara Senatore -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Thank you very much. I just like to ask about unit growth. I know in both the US and China. I know you mentioned new -- the most recent vintage is high volumes and strong ROIs in the US But I was curious if you are seeing anything that might suggest that the acceleration in unit growth may be translating into slower same-store transaction growth.', 'I know this is a very kind of idiosyncratic quarter. But in the past, I think when we have seen faster growth, it is sometimes corresponded with lower same-store transactions. I wanted to see if you had any color on any variation in markets or infill versus greenfield? And then if you could just maybe address that same question in China. Thank you.', 'Laxman Narasimhan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Rach, do you want to take on the US, and Belinda, I'd like you to take on China."", 'Rachel Ruggeri -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Thanks, Sara, for the question. In the US, what we see is we continue to see that our unit volumes, as we shared in Laxman's prepared remarks are continuing to grow. And importantly, when you look at the growth in North America and in the US business this quarter, our revenue grew 9%. So, you've got a 5% comp in there."", ""And we've already spoken to, though we were pleased with the performance and the strength we saw, particularly in our most loyal customers, we talked about some of the headwinds that related to some of the impact we saw there. But when you look broadly and you look at the combination of comp and new store growth driving to that 9%, it shows you that we still have a lot of, I'd call it, opportunity even in the US in terms of continuing to open more new stores. And when we do it through purpose designed, we're able to look at the market and determine how do we drive the overall trade area higher with a variety of different types of stores to meet customers where they are. So, we see a lot of opportunity there."", ""And with that, I'll turn it over to Belinda."", 'Laxman Narasimhan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Can I just add one thing here? We've gone through a look MSA by MSA and what is interesting is as you start looking at where the population has shifted and you look at how the US is so different from what it was even five years ago, I think what you see is white space for us. And particularly as you look at purpose defined stores and our plans to build in the US, we have a lot more headroom in the US With that, let me call on Belinda to talk a little bit on China, both around how our business has been reset, but also the kind of growth options we see. Belinda, go ahead."", 'Belinda Wong -- Chairwoman, Starbucks China', 'OK. Thank you. So, despite the short-term headwinds the long-term opportunity in China is clear. I think everyone will agree to that.', 'So, I talked extensively at the investor forum about the huge greenfield opportunities to both increase penetration in existing cities and entering new county cities. So, as of end Q1, we are only in 857 cities out of nearly 3,000 in China. The opportunities are abundant. And new stores continue to deliver best-in-class store profitability and returns.', 'And when you look at new county city stores that we have entered recently and in the past couple of years, it consistently outperformed top-tier cities, new stores, and profitability, too. So, as Laxman has pointed to, we will accelerate our entry into new county cities. So, we are on track to reach 9,000 stores, so many opportunities out there. We we have a very sophisticated system visualize and to help our team to identify the right areas to open, to optimize the cannibalization impact and where we should be going.', ""So, with our experience, our team, our operating muscle and track record, I have full confidence in our store expansion plan, and we're on target to achieving 13% store growth in FY '24."", 'Laxman Narasimhan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""I've been to China three times in the last nine months. And one of the things that's fundamentally impressed me with the business is really how we've used COVID and the time that the business has actually taken to reset the business. If you look at the end-to-end costs from a supply chain perspective with the digitization of what has happened end to end in China, it is frankly incredibly strong. I'd love to have some of that back in the US If I look at the ability to deliver the value that we have end to end in China, coupled with the premium experience with the wonderful stores we designed at a very low investment cost because that has also been fine-tuned, what you realize is that as we expand the kind of economics we're seeing are very strong."", ""And so, I think that is foundational to what Belinda talked about, big headroom in terms of cities to go to, but also what I compliment the team on is the work that has gone in to build the business end to end, that is extremely strong. This doesn't happen overnight. This happens because of 25 years of history and the muscle and the capability that the business has built in China. The team is ready, obviously, as the market turns, and we see things come back, you're going to see the kind of economics get even better."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Andrew Charles, TD Cowen.', 'Andrew Charles -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', 'Great. Thank you. Rachel, how did you arrive at the new low single-digit China same-store sales guidance from the 4% to 6% previously? Perhaps you can help us understand the typical quarter-to-quarter changes in seasonal WS that you typically see in China and how that factors into the new 2024 guidance. Thanks.', 'Rachel Ruggeri -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure. Thank you, Andrew. When we looked at the guidance for China, it's largely based around, I wouldn't say the seasonality is maybe as distinct as what we see in the US business with Q2 being so much lower than any of our other quarters and strengthening as we go through Q3, Q4, particularly because we're lapping quite a bit of compares from the prior year. If you recall, last year in Q3, we were lapping the COVID impacts from the prior year."", ""So, we have a pretty big lap when you look at that comp and that compare in Q3. So, it's more around the progression we expect in the business, less about the compare or about seasonality and more about the progression in the business. And what we're looking to is Chinese New Year, as an example, is a good indicator of what we expect to see around the consumer environment, and that's factored into our assumptions. So, a lot of it depends on mainly the recovery, the time it's going to take as Belinda and team work on the action plans, which are in some ways, I'd say, adapted to what we're saying."", ""We've already led in the premium market, but we're adapting some of our strategies as it relates to the awareness of the customer and how we go after the customer through the innovation and new channels of social media. So, we expect that that's going to take some time, and that's reflected in the guidance range. But I would think about it that way, it's more about the recovery and the progression from where we are with the plans today, which we're expecting we'll see a rebound closer to a stabilization in the back half of the year."", 'Laxman Narasimhan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""I think it's fair to say that the Chinese consumer is very cautious. And so, the recovery is going to be choppy. But as Rachel has said, we think we factored that into the guidance that we see, the long-term opportunity in China is tremendous."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.', 'Sharon Zackfia -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst', 'Hi. Good afternoon. On the customer that lapsed in the first quarter, was there any particular demographic that you saw more of an impact with? And then on the conversation around the new beverage platforms, I think you said three upcoming new beverage platforms. Can you talk about the potential trade-offs there with speed as you talk about untapped demand?', 'Laxman Narasimhan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""So I think what I heard you say was, were there any demographic, specific demographics that had impacted? And the second question was on the three beverage platforms, is there something that is a trade-off between speed? Is that correct? We couldn't hear you properly actually. Maybe you could repeat that question."", 'Sharon Zackfia -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst', ""I think my sound is -- just when I think about you introducing new beverage platforms and introducing complexity potentially into the system, I naturally worry about the outputs and you talk about untapped demand and the opportunity to tap into that part of the buffer into the back half of the year, and I'm just thinking about that. With the new beverage platforms, I'm hoping you can talk about if there is a trade-off with speed or if the new beverage platforms have been designed to help facilitate through the present."", 'Laxman Narasimhan -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Brady, do you want to take it on?', 'Brady Brewer -- Executive Vice President, Chief Marketing Officer', ""Sure. So, in terms of beverage platforms, specifically, I'll start there. We put every product we offer through a very rigorous set of tests and measures to make sure that it's conducive to operations. That it's easier for our partners to deliver in the stores and make sure that it's accretive to the business."", ""A lot of times, what we'll do is we'll bring in a new product and we'll take a lower volume product out just to maintain the total complexity of the system. Rather than just add, add, add. We have a very disciplined approach about how we do that. And so, the three beverage platforms, which we won't reveal yet have gone through that."", ""And so, it's really about how to do these products in a way that's accretive to the business, and specifically targeted. And so, in these cases, this is about looking at that occasional customer and frequent customer, but particularly appealing for the afternoon where we want to continue to build our business. We've really laser-targeted these products for those occasions. And so, we're excited to bring those to customers."", ""And then with regards to the demographics, Starbucks attracts a very wide range of customers around the world, and particularly in the US, again, a very wide range of customers. So, the way I would characterize it is occasional. And I know we've spoken about the very occasional. That's really what we would say is the audience with whom we saw that impact in November and started rebounding in December."", ""So, that's where I would leave it and say we've got plans to bring them back."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Andrew Strelzik with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Andrew Strelzik -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to just make sure that we understand the bridge from the revised or lowered revenue growth guidance to the maintained EPS growth guidance. Obviously, the first quarter operating margin was very strong, particularly in North America. So, is something changing there in your expectations for the year? Are the cost savings coming through faster or greater? Is there a change in how you're thinking about buyback contribution there? Just any more texture on that bridge would be helpful."", 'Thanks.', 'Rachel Ruggeri -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure. Thank you for the question. As it relates to our guidance and how we're thinking about maintaining the earnings growth range of 15% to 20%, though, our revenue has been revised, I think what's important to think about that is what we're pointing to is that Q2 will be below our full year guidance ranges on all of our metrics. And then we'll expect to see a rebound and a stabilization in the back half of the year."", ""And that rebound and stabilization will come to from the revenue growth that we're guiding to. So, the 7% to 10%. And in that revenue growth range, there is an assumption, even though we've got these plans in place and we expect it will take some time to materialize, there is the impact we have from a strong growing loyal customer base, as well as what we've talked to around the strength in digital and some of the success we're seeing in reinvention. So, that's factored in there to give us the confidence to be able to expect that we'll see the flow-through from the revenue growth in the back half of the year."", ""But in addition to that, what we're expecting is that we'll continue to see the strength in our in-store and out-of-store operational efficiencies. So, we had good success this quarter. We'll expect some of that to continue into Q2, and it will further into Q3 and Q4. That's how we'll be able to drive to the 15% to 20% on a full year basis."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. The last question comes from John Ivankoe with J.P. Morgan. You may ask your question.', 'John Ivankoe -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Hi, thank you. It's maybe a related one to the previous. But normally, operating companies, when they do reduce revenue, it's pretty customary for earnings to come down along with that. Now you guys have communicated, I think, $3 billion of cost savings on a three-year basis."", ""I think that's $1 billion on a gross basis, on a one-year basis. Can you talk about if there were any cost savings that were pulled forward into fiscal '24? Were there any meaningful expenses, maybe discretionary expenses in '24 that were perhaps pushed out into '25 and '26? And maybe I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself at this point or getting ahead of you at this point, as we kind of think about you're getting more margin on that lower revenue than maybe we would have thought earlier. Does it actually lead to a more difficult comparison that you'll have to face '25 over '24? Is there just some shifts in expenses between the two years?"", 'Rachel Ruggeri -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""The way I would look at it, John, is, as we showed in the first quarter, we were able to demonstrate that margin expansion of 130 basis points at the total company level, given a combination of sales leverage. So, we still had strong sales growth, right? That sales leverage, as well as the flow-through from that sales leverage and the in-store operational efficiencies that we spoke to. And when we think about the back half of the year, we'll expect to continue to see benefit from the revenue growth and the sales leverage that comes from that. But we'll also see benefit from the in-store and out-of-store operational efficiencies, which we do have ability to increase our focus on some of those areas, which will help to ensure our 15% to 20% earnings growth commitment on a full year basis."", ""Outside of that, we also have investments as it relates to G&A, investments as it relates to our Reinvention. And we'll continue to make the investments because those investments drive a meaningful impact, and they're a driver of our competitive advantage. But we do have an ability to also dial up and dial down some of those investments to help support the commitments we're making. As it relates to the years ahead, it's probably best to just focus on the year-end we're in right now."", ""But that's how I would expect the guidance to come together and how I think about Q2 relative to the balance of the year."", 'Laxman Narasimhan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""John, if I could just add one more thing. I think we've systematized our approach to how we think about innovation, how we think about productivity, how we think about growth overall, it's a very sort of systematic approach that we have in place of pipelines around how we're looking at different things. So, we have visibility, clearly, in terms of things that we can do, for example, about the store and they go multiple years. And so, even if we did bring something forward because we can, it does not at all mean that we don't have more that we go after."", ""So, I feel very confident about that, that we'll continue to invest in the business. There's no impact from a buyback. I think that was a question asked earlier, none whatsoever. And we're investing in the business, but we also know that we have opportunities for us to make ourselves more efficient."", 'At the same time, get the throughput that we think we need in order to meet the demand that exists out there.', 'Rachel Ruggeri -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. I do think it's just worth noting is that our buybacks are expected to be nearly 1% of our earnings growth, net of interest, so small in the scheme of things."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. That was our last question. I will now turn the call over to Laxman Narasimhan for closing remarks.', 'Laxman Narasimhan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you so much, Diego. I will close by reiterating our strong momentum from the quarter and our overall confidence in our long-term growth. While we continue to navigate some headwinds, we're encouraged by the strength of our brand, particularly with our loyal customers around the world, and the plans that we have in place to address the challenges we have identified. On a broader level, I've come to learn that we truly are a different kind of company here at Starbucks, but we are now operating in a different kind of world."", ""We recognize that no one can solve the many difficult problems in the world alone. Starbucks is, however, and will continue to be the world's third place, providing people with places to come together, to connect, to find common ground, to feel they belong, and to bring a little joy in their every day.

We hope you can join these events in person or virtually.At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican."", 'Kevin P. Hourican', ""Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. I'm very pleased with Sysco's performance for the quarter. Our company is the market leader in a growing industry where size and scale matter. This past quarter, we demonstrated that important position of strength by delivering another quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth.Sysco delivered bottom line growth through a combination of volume growth, disciplined margin management, and expense control. Our positive momentum from the first half of our fiscal year is expected to continue into the second half, and we remain confident in our full year growth expectations for sales and EPS. This includes 2024 adjusted EPS growth of 7% at the midpoint of our guidance range.Sysco has improved how we leverage our scale through the Recipe for Growth strategy, and we continue to deliver industry-leading profitability metrics as well as leverage our industry-leading strong balance sheet. Our confidence in the year has enabled us to increase our capital allocation to shareholders for the year. We are announcing today an increase of our stock buyback target for fiscal year 2024.We now expect to buy back approximately $1.25 billion of our stock this year up from our previously communicated $750 million. With the increased stock buyback and our industry-leading dividend yield, we will contribute more than $2.25 billion directly to our shareholders. Sysco's strong balance sheet and free cash flow enable us to make these types of shareholder-friendly decisions while providing ample liquidity to fund the long-term growth of our business. We are, as we say, play from a position of strength. So let's get started with a brief highlight of the quarter on Slide #5. Beginning with the top line, we delivered sales growth of 3.7%, a sequential improvement from Q1, driven by a combination of positive case volume growth and positive product cost inflation. Importantly, this included a sequential improvement in local case volume growth quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. We will share more on that later.Turning to the bottom line, we posted over 11% growth in adjusted EPS, generating strong operating leverage. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage and the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Kenny will provide more details in his financial section.Today, I would like to update you on two topics I highlighted as priorities on our Q1 earnings call: Local case volume and supply chain productivity. During the quarter, we sequentially increased our case volume performance, growing our U.S. Foodservice segment 3.4% and delivering local case volume growth of 2.9%. We grew our market share profitably through our improvement efforts.Notably, this growth comes with the industry-leading profit margin rates you can expect from Sysco. The rate of volume growth does not include the benefit of Edward Don, which closed in late November, and we remain solidly on track to deliver our growth ambition versus the market this year. Importantly, the initiatives we outlined to drive local case performance earlier this year began to bear fruit this past quarter.We are focused on improving sales execution. Our efforts are centered around properly serving our local customers in improving our local sales growth. A reminder of our local sales focus areas for fiscal '24. First, we started adding incremental sales headcount in the second quarter and expect to continue hiring in the second half of fiscal year '24 and in the coming years. The incremental headcount is targeted to optimize territory sizes and enhanced sales consultant effectiveness, demonstrating focused actions to deliver higher returns.The benefits from increasing our local salesforce will accrue over time as new colleagues complete their training, move up the productivity curve, and settle into their territories. As previously indeed, we continue to expect to see the vast majority of the positive impact from our fiscal year '24 hires impact fiscal year '25 performance.Second, we recently refined our compensation model to further motivate our sales consultants on win, win, win behaviors for Sysco, our customers, and our salesforce. We can already see the impact of the compensation change, and we expect the impact of these recent changes to grow over time. We will continue to optimize our compensation program over time to ensure we are properly rewarding and motivating our sales team.Third, our focus on performance management continues with a hyper focus on customer visit frequency and sales consultant visit quality. These efforts are improving outcomes of our sales visits and can be closely tracked in our CRM tool. Leveraging technology to maximize the effectiveness of each customer visit remains a top priority, and I am pleased with the impact of our sales leadership team in the past quarter.Lastly, total team selling continues to gain traction. Our sales teams across Broadline and Specialty are working more collaboratively and we are leveraging our data to maximize the time allocation of our selling specialists in produce, protein and ethnic cuisine segments like Italian. All told, these interconnected actions increased our local case performance from Q1 to Q2 by 300 basis points. Importantly, the exit velocity of the quarter was even stronger as our performance improved each month of the quarter. We are confident in our ability to continue to grow local sales while maintaining the positive momentum we have displayed in national sales.Next, I would like to provide an update on the progress we've been making within our supply chain. We continue to improve the performance of our supply chain by focusing on operational excellence. Chart 9 displays our year-over-year operating profit improvement, driven by positive operating leverage, with gross profits growing at a faster rate than operating expenses. Our supply chain employees continue to move up the productivity curve due to improved colleague training and significantly improved levels of retention, especially within the driver position. With improved retention comes improved outputs across the supply chain, lowering hiring expenses, lower training expenses, improved productivity, lower levels of product shrink, improved safety metrics, and improved service levels to our customers.Each of these elements positively impact our P&L and the improvement drops straight to the bottom line. We are extremely focused on continuing to improve colleague retention and productivity within our supply chain. Lastly, we continue to improve the rigor and discipline in our colleague staffing efforts. This includes better matching our hours worked to the volume of cases shipped and the difficult work of flexing down our staffing during lower volume periods. We will continue to refine our engineered labor standards that drive our staffing models, and we will increase the agility with which we match our staffing to our volume.Our Q2 results display a continuation of quarter-over-quarter progress in productivity gains, and we remain disciplined and focused on continuing that rate of improvement. These efforts will benefit the P&L in fiscal '24 and will carry into 2025 and beyond. We are bullish on our ability to continue to lower our cost to serve while simultaneously improving customer service levels. As I lift up from these two topics, improving sales effectiveness and improving our supply chain productivity, I would also like to communicate that we remain on track with our Recipe for Growth business transformation.Our digital efforts continue to advance. Our merchant teams continue to improve our product assortment, especially in Sysco brand. We are excited about the integration with Edward Don and how we can profitably grow our equipment and supplies business. We remain very pleased with the performance of our Greco Italian platform, and I am proud of our international business leaders for the compelling performance produced year-to-date from our International segment. At our Investor Day in May, we will dive deeper into each of our Recipe for Growth pillars.Foodservice distribution is a space for size and scale matters, logistics scale, cold storage scale in both warehousing and transportation, technology scale, and sales force expertise and scale. We believe that no one is better positioned than Sysco to leverage global scale advantages in order to better serve customers and profitably grow the business. I am very pleased that fiscal '24 is off to a strong start, as we are profitably growing our market share and continuing a track record of delivering compelling top and bottom line growth.For the remainder of fiscal '24, we remain hyper focused on the execution elements I highlighted today as well as advancing our Recipe for Growth strategy. We are confident that these efforts will enable Sysco to deliver our financial plan. I'll now turn it over to Kenny, who will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. Kenny, over to you."", 'Kenny K. Cheung', ""Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to build upon Kevin's commentary with a couple of points. First, we have positive momentum as Q2 marked another milestone with record top line and bottom line performance. Future results included sales and volume growth, along with strong cost of goods sold performance, resulting in adjusted gross profit dollar growth and margin expansion. Positive operating leverage was also driven by gross profit growing at a faster rate than operating expenses, demonstrating our disciplined margin management, which rendered adjusted EPS growth of over 11%.Second, we are excited about our first half performance and confidence in our positive momentum for the remainder of the year. Therefore, we are increasing our share repurchases expectations from $750 million to $1.25 billion for FY'24 versus the prior guidance. This will increase expected total shareholder returns, including dividends and share repurchases to approximately $2.25 billion for FY'24.This is in addition to our continued reinvestment into the business, including M&A, such as the addition of BIX and Edward Don earlier this year. Capital allocation is a competitive advantage for Sysco as the strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow generation allows us to invest for growth and reward our shareholders at the same time.Now turning to a summary of our reported results for the quarter, starting on Slide 13. For the second quarter, our enterprise sales grew 3.7%, with U.S. Foodservice growing 3.2%, International growing 9.6%, and SYGMA decreasing 1%, driven by planned exit of customers that did not meet our disciplined profit thresholds. This planned exit along with strong supply chain productivity improvement, helped more than double our SYGMA profits this quarter, another prime example of our ROIC focus in action.Enterprise inflation was 1.1%. Additionally, U.S. Broadline inflation was slightly positive and our International segment was up 6.6%, all aligned with our expectations. Total U.S. Foodservice volume increased 3.4% and local volume was up 2.9%, a 300 bps sequential improvement from Q1. Please note, volume reporting includes slight benefits from the acquisition of BIX Produce. Our volume reporting does not include our Edward Don or Specialty Meat business based on their unique product attributes.We produced $3.5 billion in gross profit, up 4.9%. Adjusted gross margin improved to 18.2%, an increase of 21 bps. Our gross profit dollar and margin percentage improvement reflected our ability to effectively manage product cost fluctuations driven by incremental progress from our strategic sourcing efforts and disciplined pricing. Penetration rates of Sysco brand products increased 22 bps to 46.9% in U.S. Local and was essentially flat at 36.8% in U.S. Broadline.Overall, adjusted operating expense were $2.8 billion for the quarter or 14.4% of sales as we achieved another quarter of positive operating leverage. The strong management of expenses during the quarter was due to the positive impact of the variable labor planning tool and supply chain efficiencies that Kevin mentioned, and benefits from our previously announced $100 million of cost-out commitments. We are on track to achieve this commitment for FY'24 and the planning process for delivering incremental costs for future periods has already begun.Additionally, with the successful closure of our BIX and Edward Don acquisition, we are on pace to realize both top and bottom line synergies. Adjusted operating income growth of 7.6% in USFS, coupled with outsized profit contributions from our International and SYGMA segments, contributed to bottom line performance. Positive momentum continued in our International segment with adjusted operating income growing 30.1% during the quarter.Our International results are a continuation of the robust growth and positive momentum in this segment over the past 3 years. The Recipe for Growth playbook is yielding dividends in the U.S. and internationally. In total, Q2 adjusted operating income was $745 million, up 9.2%, and adjusted EBITDA was $927 million, up 11.6%.Turning to the balance sheet, which remains strong. We ended the quarter at 2.75x net debt leverage ratio. This is in line with our target range of 2.5 to 2.75x net debt leverage ratio. Our planned increase to the share repurchase program is already in action with an accelerated share repurchase program that was executed in early January. We ended the quarter with $11.2 billion in net debt that is well laddered and over $3.4 billion in total liquidity. Approximately 96% of our debt is fixed with the floating component offset by our cash reserves. Our strong investment-grade credit rating is a competitive advantage as evidenced by our team successfully issuing approximately $1 billion of new debt in November. We are committed to our capital allocation strategy as seen on Slide 19, which includes a balanced approach with 3 elements: First, investing in the business for profitable and consistent growth; second, maintaining our investment-grade credit rating; and third, returning cash to shareholders, dividends and share repurchases.Turning to our first half cash flow. We generated $856 million in operating cash flow and $527 million in free cash flow, growing 70% and 141%, respectively. This growth includes continued strong conversion rates from EBITDA to operating cash and free cash flow, and we remain on track to grow free cash flow for full year FY'24. Our strong financial position enabled us to return $353 million to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends this quarter.Looking forward to fiscal year 2024 guidance, we are reiterating net sales growth of mid-single digits to approximately $80 billion. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow to $4.20 to $4.40. This represents a 7% growth at the midpoint. Additionally, we expect positive operating leverage with gross profit growing at a faster rate than OpEx for the year.We continue to expect slightly positive rates of industry volume growth and inflation. This includes Sysco's U.S. Broadline remaining inflationary in the second half of the fiscal year. Our planned top line also includes benefits from M&A activity consistent with previous disclosures for an average annual contribution of 50 to 100 basis points of growth. We will continue to opportunistically evaluate accretive acquisitions, but the remainder of FY'24 will focus on integration efforts, capturing synergies for accretive acquisitions like Don and returning excess cash back to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.For the second half and over the long term, we expect to win market share, profitably and consistently. Our efforts will also focus on strong cash generation with conversion rates, ultimately feeding our plans to grow and reward our shareholders. Thank you for your time today. With that, operator, we are now ready for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.', 'Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein', ""Great. I had one question and then one follow-up. The question on the U.S. local case volume, the 2.9%. It's nice return to growth on a 1-year basis and like you said, a sequential acceleration on a 2-year basis. Just wondering if you could talk about your level of confidence in sustaining that accelerating growth, maybe prioritize the most important drivers of that momentum. I think you mentioned that momentum actually built each month of the fiscal second quarter and therefore, a strong exit rate. So I'm just wondering if you could provide some context, especially as someone was talking about maybe a slowdown that has been seen across much of the industry in January. Any thoughts there would be great."", 'Kevin P. Hourican', ""Thank you for the question. This is Kevin. We're confident in our ability to continue to improve in local sales. As you just said, the 2.9 is an average -- weighted average, obviously, across the 3 months. And sequentially, the quarter improved each and every ones of those months. So we are confident in our ability to continue to make progress in local case volume growth. And at the historic profitability metrics that Sysco industry-leading will continue to produce. So it's profitable local case growth. The biggest drivers, I'd say the performance management on the sales consultant side is the most immediate lever. The compensation change would be the second most impactful measure and total team selling followed up by the increased SC headcount would be the third and the fourth of the four things I said on the call, if I ranked them from an impact perspective. As it relates to the second half of your question on January, there has been a slowdown in January. I would describe it more as a blip, a bump in the road, if you will. There's a couple of factors driving the January. Week 1 of January had a calendar unfavorability tied to a holiday and where it fell historically cold weather. I hate the W word. I never used the W word, but there was some extraordinary weather in January, which made it awfully difficult to make deliveries to customers in large swaths of the United States. That's backed up by the credit card data from the major banks that consumption that food-away-from-home was down in January. Jeff, I'm not overly concerned about that. It's the lowest volume month of the year that there's going to be a blip or a bump you'd want it to be in that month. So goes March, so goes the quarter. And we've got levers that we can pull on the year to go, and I toss to Kenny for any additional comment in that regard."", 'Kenny K. Cheung', ""On January, I agree with Kevin, what we're seeing right now. While volume has been slightly impacted. We have the ability to flex labor and mitigate the impact of lower volume with our labor planning tool that we talked about, and that is in conjunction with the disciplined engineering labor standards that we've implemented. However, weather also impacts over time, productivity, customer returns, delivery costs, which we will mitigate throughout the fiscal year with levers in our P&L. Therefore, the full year guidance remains intact. In terms -- Kevin talked a bit about local in the U.S., one comment is local international. As we know, international is roughly 20% of our business. And we've replicated some of the RFG, Recipe for Growth playbook there. And we are seeing nice growth from our Canadian business and our European business, which is both up roughly 80%, and it's really driven by new customers, penetration, and customer retention. So we are excited and we continue to invest and capture growth with pace and discipline."", 'Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein', ""Got it. And just my follow-up on the fiscal '24 guidance. I know from a very high level, you reiterated the mid-single-digit top line and the 5% to 10% EPS growth, I think you called out 7% at the midpoint. I'm wondering if you could share anything that might have surprised you on the positive or negative side in the first half of the year, especially because I think you said 7% at the midpoint. You've also talked about in the first half of the year, double digit and 11 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. So what potential incremental challenges are you seeing in the second half, especially as you've got an incremental $500 million bump in share repurchase to come. So just wondering your thoughts on the back half of the year EPS growth relative to the recent momentum you've had."", 'Kevin P. Hourican', ""Okay. So let me unpack to questions, what surprised me and what are some takeaways in the first half of the year. I think the biggest thing is Sysco has proven we can manage the business under various different environments. If you remember, Q1 was slightly deflationary in the U.S. Q2 was slightly positive in -- for the U.S. And in both quarters in the first half, we delivered operating margin expansion of roughly 26 bps and also GP margin dollar expansion and GP margin expansion of 28 bps. So again, I think first half was a really good proof point that under any circumstance, Sysco has the levers on the P&L to drive positive and consistent growth and being able to drive quality of earnings on the cash flow side. So that's about more in the first half. In terms of the full year guidance, let me just provide a bit more color. So we do expect overall this year, lower overall market volume growth versus 2023. However, continued market share gains from our company, profitable growth at Sysco. Inflation, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, Q2 came in slightly positive aligned with our expectation. In the back half, we are still -- remain consistent with what we said on both the first earnings call that we had at the end of last year and the previous 90 days ago. We expect the back half to be slightly positive on inflation. We still have 2 quarters ago, but I believe that Q2 slight positive inflation provides us comfort around our original assumptions. In terms of -- on the expense side of the house, disciplined expense management, our team has already directed an effort to reduce the structural expense by $100 million. We are on a pace and we've begun building additional pipeline for future periods. In terms of working your way down to the P&L on the tax rate side, it's 24.5%, no change. There's a slight step up on interest expense of roughly $20 million attached to the $500 million of additional share repurchase. If you net it to impact together, so Jeff, I think your question is what is the accretion on EPS? There is a net accretion of roughly $0.05 or so net of the interest expense increase coupled with the retirement of the shares. So that is the $0.05 impact that you can expect for the fiscal year. With that said, with all the intra-working variables, we are reiterating and reconfirming our full year guide of $4.20 to $4.40 with the midpoint of 7% growth versus last year."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Mark Carden with UBS.', 'Mark David Carden', ""So I wanted to dig into your sales force additions to date. I know you said it's going to be a bit of a ramp, but how is the initial progress going relative to your expectations? And then how are competitor hires having? Are they having much of an impact on your ability to really find enough high-quality salespeople?"", 'Kevin P. Hourican', ""We're really pleased with the progress that we're making. And those efforts began in Q2, I want to be clear about this. So in the early innings, we haven't quoted publicly the exact number of people we're hiring, but it's a significant number. We are not having a challenge with hiring and filling our classes. They are roster classes that we fill, and we put them through a very, very robust industry-leading training program. As it relates to competitive forces and the impact on our ability to hire, we're not having challenges filling the positions. That's my answer. We don't just go to a competitor, if you will. That is a source of talent. We also go to restaurants. We go to culinary schools. We're looking for people that are food eccentric that are good at selling have a passion for this industry. We can train them on our tools. We can train them on our selling systems and process, and we can train them to scale them up to be what they are, which is the best in the industry, and that's from our Net Promoter Score. So we're not having a difficult time filling our classes. We're really pleased with the first cohorts. We are on track to be able to hit the targeted hiring rate. And as I said before, that positively impacts 2025 from a growth perspective. Mark, back to you if you have any follow-up."", 'Mark David Carden', 'Great. And then my follow-up is going to be related to M&A. You guys closed on Edward Don about 2 months ago. How is that early integration gone relative to your expectations? And then in December, you guys announced a small acquisition with Ready Chef in Ireland. Was that one simply a situation where the economics were just too good to pass up? Or does it signal a shift in strategy that you guys might be more open to international bolt-on or even larger scale M&A there?', 'Kevin P. Hourican', ""Mark, I appreciate the question. Let me just start with Edward Don, which is the significant transaction that we've done this fiscal year. I want to be really clear on the numbers that we quoted today. So one month of sales and profit are in the numbers that we described, but from a volume perspective because I know that's a question some may have, we have not included Edward Don volume in our case growth figures at this time. So the growth in cases of 3.4% in total and 2.9% in local is pure Sysco, not including Don. I just want to be really clear about that. As it relates to the early innings, I was just up in Chicago last week. We had a great day with Steve Don and his leadership team and our leaders talking about the synergy capabilities between the two companies, we can purchase better together, buying product at a better and more affordable cost. We can target joint customers more effectively. So we have large national sales, restaurant customers or hospitality customers of Sysco that aren't currently customers have Don and vice versa. Don has some really big customers that Sysco's not the food service distributor, so we can sell together in a joint proposition. And then there's this huge opportunity longer term to take that equipment and sales product category and have it shoppable on Sysco's digital platforms, deliverable on either a Don truck or perhaps some day to a local small mom-and-pop customer on a Sysco truck. We're really excited, not just about the $1.3 billion in profitable top line we acquired through Don, we're very excited about how we can grow that business meaningfully for years to come. And I know Steve Don and his team are equally as excited. As it relates to Ready Chef in Ireland, just keep in context, it's a much smaller countries. So the size of that acquisition is actually compelling for the country that it's in. And what it was, was a FreshPoint like entity. So to be crystal clear, in Ireland, we did not have a fresh cut bespoke produce business and purchasing Ready Chef gives us what I'll call from our U.S. perspective, that FreshPoint capability. We're running the Sysco play. That's the headline. It's not a change in strategy. Our strategy is in each of the major countries that we compete within, we will run the Sysco play, which is to be the leader in Broadline into bolt-on specialty capabilities over time so we can sell around the room for the customers that we serve and do so profitably. So we're excited about that acquisition in Ireland. Our leadership team in Ireland is top-notch, and I am very confident in their ability to profitably grow the business, better serve customers and increase penetration with existing customers within Ireland."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.', 'John Edward Heinbockel', ""So Kevin, can you talk about visit frequency and quality of visit, right? Those two, how you think about KPIs on each of those? And when you think about how that will move the sales needle, what are you looking? You're looking for a certain amount of year-over-year growth in frequency how do you quantify quality?"", 'Kevin P. Hourican', ""John, great question. And for the quarter that we just completed, this is the biggest reason for our improvement from what was flat in Q1 to up 2.9 in Q2 is from what I call performance management, which is visit frequency, visit quality. The comp change poorly helped, but it was early innings and that will have a bigger impact in a year to go and the incremental SEs will impact 2025. We've not gone public with the numbers, the targets, John. But we have a very specific target of the number of visits that need to happen per week per SE, and we can track it. We can track it through this year end. And we were not where we needed to be. COVID had a disruption in a lot of things in life, and one of them was SE's doing more of that work from a home office than we would have liked. We kind of ripped that band-aid off and made it really clear on what our expectations are of visit frequency. That's the wheel side of the job. Get out there, pound the street be in front of our customers. This is a relationship business. We're being in front of the customer every week matters, and we have moved the needle meaningfully in the last quarter on the number of visits being completed per week for our SEs. Point two, though, that you brought up is that's only worthwhile if it's a quality visit. So how do we measure quality. We have visited a purpose. And in our CRM tool, it will prompt our SEs with jobs to be done that day, introduce the Sysco brand case, win back the case that was lost over the last x period of time. Sell a category you've not sold before. Those are just three examples of jobs to be done. The CRM data rich understands what's being purchased, what should be purchased. And it essentially prompts the SEs with things to sell. And how do I measure quality? I measure quality by close rate against those jobs to be done and we can track it. We have a scorecard that ranks every one of our sales people from top to bottom, and then we do performance managing against the quality side of the visit. Recognize the top performers, coach the move the middle and hold accountable those that aren't getting the job done and everything in between. John, back to you for any follow-up."", 'John Edward Heinbockel', ""The follow-up would be, right, so you talked about growing GP dollars above SG&A. So if you take the U.S., right, the delta was 200 basis points this quarter. I mean what's your thought as to the right general level? And lately, it was gross margin-driven, right, gross profit driven as opposed to SG&A. We now shifted back, right, to an environment where it's more SG&A-driven than gross profit."", 'Kevin P. Hourican', ""So here's my -- how we think about it. It's both, right? It is the gross profit line and the operating income line. If you look at Q2, you can see that our top line growth was 4%. If you just do the math, the cost of goods, if you will, between sales and gross profit was up 3%. So you had a nice leverage driven by strategic sourcing, our partnership with suppliers driven by mix of business, growth in specialty, local brand penetration. And as a result, GP actually grew 5%. So we had a nice leverage between sales and GP. Now to Europe on SG&A, we're working extremely hard, driving productivity out. The good news is, is the $100 million of cost out that we talked about at the beginning of the year, that is being seen through the P&L and we're working through a pipeline that's going to render success for us in outer period. And that is -- and you can see GP growing, call it, 5%, and then net earnings growing close to double digit for the prior year. So you're getting the leverage, John, on both the cost of good line and the OpEx line. And we have initiatives back to both sides of the house."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.', 'Edward Joseph Kelly', ""Nice quarter. I wanted to just follow up on the case line growth. I mean the Q2 result was clearly an inflection around what's the last quarter and the last couple of quarters. Can you maybe just help us understand how we should be thinking about the back half of the year from here? So you talked about January off to a slower start. I don't think industry growth is all that spectacular at the moment. I'm just trying to make sure that we're in the right place from an expectation standpoint, just given how strong Q2 was? And then just a clarification on Edward Don, I know it's not in the case volume numbers currently. Does that mean it will not be going forward as well?"", 'Kevin P. Hourican', ""We're confident in our ability to profitably grow the local business and not kind of regress back to the mean on where we were in Q1. That's one of the main messages from today's call. We've built momentum local performance, very strong. Exit velocity was strong. Unfortunately, the industry as I did a speed bump, I talked about the W word, which I hate talking about. There's also a 2-year stack thing going on in January where because of very, very strong growth a year ago tied to the prior year being Omicron. There's a 2-year stack phenomenon on January that normalizes itself by mid-February, which we'll get through. And as you know, March is the most important month. We're not going to quote a number on today's call vis-a-vis what you should expect from a local case volume growth other than -- what we are seeing and what we predict is built into the guidance for the year, and we're confident in our ability to deliver the midpoint of the guidance that we point out today. Kenny, touched you for any additional comments."", 'Kenny K. Cheung', ""Yes. On local growth, as Kevin said, our assumptions are baked into the guidance. We are always focused on profitable growth. That's really important for our company. And you can see that's the reason why that the cash conversion and not leverage was so strong in Q2. In terms of Edward Don, so in our volume number, just to clarify, BIX is in our volume year-over-year, it's immaterial. From a Don side, it is in our total number, just not in the volume number given the different product attributes."", 'Edward Joseph Kelly', ""And that's going to be the case going forward. And I'm just curious as to why Edward Don does not included in volume?"", 'Kevin P. Hourican', ""I mean -- this is Kevin. We don't include SSMG in our volumes because the business is measured through pounds. And just getting to a common denominator is difficult. The way Don measures their business is today not the same as how we measure the business cases versus pallets versus eaches. And we want to make sure that we get that right before we include it in our metrics, and that's something that we're working on as a part of our integration planning."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Joshua Long with Stephens.', 'Joshua C. Long', ""Was curious if you could further contextualize the strength of the local case growth in terms of the opportunity to further penetrate kind of existing consumers and then also execute against new customer wins, which I know has been a target and a goal over the last couple of calls that we've talked about."", 'Kevin P. Hourican', ""On the existing customers, I'll bridge back. I didn't talk a lot today on the prepared remarks about our Recipe for Growth. I was trying to really keep it narrow and focused on drive local performance through selling effectiveness and supply chain. We're really pleased with our Recipe for Growth strategy and the impact of our growth programs on our business. And I'd point you to Sysco Your Way and Perks as two very, very important programs that are increasing penetration with existing customers. They're continuing to do well at our Investor Day in May. We're going to talk about the longer-term plans for those two growth programs. And then the third is our total team selling effort, which is we over-index in Broadline. We have meaningful share in Broadline, and our share is below industry average in specialty. That's why we are as focused on produce and protein and the ethnic cuisines as we are, we're moving the needle with existing customers on total team selling. As I've mentioned before, what that program is, is each account has a sales consultant generalist, who is the relationship manager, who's there every week, but they are not going to be an expert in [Specialty/ Bespoke] protein. They're not going to be an expert in Specialty organic produce, as an example. And we're doing a better job of identifying which customers have the propensity to buy those categories, linking up that specialist with the sales consultant generalist in doing a joint visit and then compensating them in such a way that they win together when those cases are added to a Sysco truck regardless if that's a FreshPoint truck or a Sysco Broadline truck. And we're moving the needle with existing customers as measured by penetration. We're pleased with our performance in that regard. But the lifeblood, we call it the oxygen of the business is constantly bringing in new customers. You need that oxygen to breathe. We're very focused on new. We're very focused on making that a priority of the sales force. It's embedded within our updated compensation model as a priority. If they win new business, that's profitable and sufficiently large to make it worth our while to be going to those customers. There's a minimum threshold that they get rewarded as a sales force. That works hard. Prospecting is hard work. We need to make it a priority. We need to manage it, and I'm really pleased with the progress that's been made this last quarter on increasing the portion of our business that's new business one."", 'Joshua C. Long', ""Great. And then Kevin, in your prepared comments, you mentioned just the overall improvement in supply chain. It seems like things are perhaps continuing to get back to normal. Your results highlight that. Could you talk about the overall health of the supply chain just broadly as an industry and kind of where some of the pushes and pulls are now that we're a little bit further removed from some of the disruptions that occurred over the last couple of years?"", 'Kevin P. Hourican', ""We're really pleased with our progress of improvement in supply chain. Retention is up overall market, as you just indicated, fewer people are leaving their jobs. There are fewer jobs that are open. So therefore, just general staffing health in the industry is better. And then specifically at Sysco, we're fully staffed. It doesn't mean we don't have a job opening in a specific site today. But in aggregate across our network, we are fully staffed that bring down, as Kenny said, our hiring costs, our training costs, shrink improves, damages improved, accidents on the road improved. Everything about the ecosystem improves when we have a more tenured population. We're really pleased with that. The productivity levers that we have are moving up into the right as a result of that. Oftentimes, I get asked the question, what inning are we in? I think we're up to inning 7 now on supply chain kind of recovering to pre-COVID, which means we still have some gas in the tank. And I want to be clear, when we get to inning 9, the game is not over. What happens in inning 9 is then we introduce new technology, we introduced productivity improvement programs, et cetera. We can get beyond, meaning better than 2019 levels of productivity. But I'd say we're in inning 7, we still have room to improve, and we're focused on delivering."", 'Kenny K. Cheung', ""Yes. One point for me is, as I mentioned earlier, we have the labor planning tool, and we're really matching -- being very agile here on the expense side, matching labor with volume and making sure that's with the backdrop of the Sysco work standards that I talked about earlier in my question in January, the driver academy, our training programs, our engineering labor standards keep getting better and stronger. We improve processes through leveraging, as Kevin said technology. The next wave of productivity improvement is the better have discipline to the standard work that we're doing. So still room for improvement, but we are pleased with the improvement we made in the supply chain, and that's factored into the '24 guidance."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Kendall Toscano with Bank of America.', 'Kendall Belinda Toscano', 'So I was wondering if, as you saw a pretty significant rebound in your local customer business in the second quarter, just kind of what the implications are on gross margin performance given that the local customers are a higher-margin customer segment? And then, I guess, as you enter the back half, as my follow-up, how you would expect the local customer growth to look versus the total company?', 'Kenny K. Cheung', ""Yes. So I can start. So you are correct. The local customer does come with an attachment rate with a higher GP dollars per case, and there was a margin accretion as well with the local customer, and we are seeing that flow through the P&L, and that's one of the reasons why you're seeing a nice mix between your leverage on GP as well as the leverage down to EBITDA and net earnings. With that said, though, I think we shouldn't overlook the CMU success that we've had in our business. We are also seeing margin expansion. We are also seeing cost of goods leverage across the portfolio of our CMU business. Again, one may think it's just restaurant, but it's not. There's other specialty growth segments that we're winning in the marketplace, that's driving accretion on the margin side. When we talk about strategic sourcing, it is not just for a local customer. It is the size and scale of Sysco, and that benefit skills across both our local customers and CMU. We are renewing, we are winning businesses at a higher margin clip at the current moment."", 'Kevin P. Hourican', ""Just to plus up the last point that Kenny made, I've tried to be very clear about this point over the last several quarters. Our success in national sales, and we are clearly succeeding in national sales, growing new customer wins and the profitability of that business, as Kenny just said. There's nothing about the growth in national that hinders our ability to grow local. We do not have supply chain capacity constraints, we do not have hiring constraints. What I said on the last call is we want to keep the play running and working in national, and we want to make meaningful progress in local, and we displayed that this past quarter with a 300 basis point improvement and our intention is to continue to make improvement in local."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.', 'John William Ivankoe', ""The question is on inflation. And I'm wondering what kind of indicators you were looking at to sustain inflation through the back half of '24. I mean some PPI food, for example, metrics might suggest a little bit more deflation than what you're talking about is kind of the first question. And secondly, there's been at least some chatter -- some grocery stores actually sequentially lowering their pricing as their own commodity costs have you been easing. I mean have you seen anywhere in the marketplace in terms of your competitors, maybe on the nationals, but on the local or regionals, of different operators that are lowering their price per case to their customers of something that could potentially be influencing the market over time?"", 'Kenny K. Cheung', ""John, it's Kenny. I'll start. So on the topic of inflation, you are correct. We are informed by data. We actually have a traffic (inaudible) data. We partnered directly with suppliers, third-party strategic partners, institutions, and the like. And so we have a rich data set of our own as well, given how much volume goes through our supply chain each and every day across various segments and industries. So we're all that modeling in right now. Number two, we watch our basket very closely. Now I've talked about this in the past. But if you think about our commodity basket, we have 12 main commodities. And we don't really over index on anyone in particular. No one come out more than 15%. So each and every day, we're managing inflation and deflation, right? For example, you could have beef, for example, which is growing close to double digit, but you can have another commodity that's in a different space. So Sysco has historically and today managed deflation, inflation day in and day out. And the third point, as I mentioned earlier, Q1 deflation in the U.S.; Q2, slightly positive inflation. On both quarters, we were able to effectively drive positive, consistent and operating leverage to our P&L."", 'Kevin P. Hourican', ""It's Kevin, I'll just add. You asked about prices to the consumer in the local business, in particular. It's a very efficient market, John. So as our COGS come down, yes, the way it works is we then are able to pass through value to our customers. So unlike a retail store, we're publishing prices in a circular and putting signs on a shelf. For us, it's a dynamic business. The book gets priced weekly, as do our competitors. And as prices come down, it's an efficient market. And that gets passed through to customers. As Kenny said, though, we didn't maintain profitability ratios on the way up. We can maintain profitability ratios on the way down. That's the value of our pricing tool that we are leveraging extensively to make sure that we are where we need to be. As it relates to just general confidence in the year-to-go inflation figures, we've got a lot of data at Sysco. We have global data. We have access to a large amount, as Kenny said, across the 12-plus categories. Some are moving up, some are moving down. The one that's going to be the biggest tailwind in the year to go is Produce. Produce was substantially deflationary in Q2 because of wild markets the year before due to major flooding in California. Produce is going to return to more normal, like low levels of inflation, 1% to 2% versus down substantially in Q2. So that's one of the bigger drivers of giving confidence in the year to go. And we said muted inflation, but certainly muted inflation is up from where we were in the first half of the year."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Alex Slagle with Jefferies.', 'Alexander Russell Slagle', 'I just want to see if you could provide any color on the broader growth rates and health of the various categories you participate in. There are certain specialty categories that are growing particularly well or certain customer types in the industry if the growth has either carried off or accelerated lately?', 'Kevin P. Hourican', ""Alex, it's Kevin. I'll start and then if Kenny has anything to add, he can jump in. Let me first just talk about like where is the business growing, where is success happening, and then I'll flip back to the customer. But it's okay, I'm going to actually answer it in reverse. Right now, Broadline is winning. And what I mean by that is distributors. So Broadline distributors are winning. People ask us all the time, Kevin, how can it be true that you plus the other big 2 are all saying you're taking share? Answer is scale matters in this industry. Size and scale matter, our purchasing scale, our delivery scale, our technology scale. And frankly, all 3 of the big 3 are growing faster than the market. Our growth for the quarter was plus 3.4 and the overall market was very nominal growth. So we meaningfully outgrew versus the market and my suspicion will be as well the other big players in the space. So what does that mean? It means the growth is coming from smaller regional distributors and specialty distributors. Point two for the Sysco specific thesis is our specialty business is meaningfully performing. So we're winning in Broadline in total versus the 60-plus percent of the business that's not done through the Big 3, that's a very clear point that should be understood. 60% of the business does not happen from the Big 3, where the big players are winning meaningfully in Broadline versus that 60%. And then within specialty, Sysco's specialty is outperforming versus specialty. So that's kind of the thesis or the story of why we're outperforming versus the market. As it relates to the customer side, we're seeing no discernible moves trade up, trade down, trade left, trade right. The best operators are winning. People who have interesting concepts or interesting culinary trends are winning, but we're not seeing trade up or trade down. Since the January blip that I mentioned, it was a robust food-away-from-home market in Q2. And then specifically, December was a robust month as consumers were frequenting food-away-from-home establishments."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities.', 'Jake Rowland Bartlett', ""Mine was on the chain business and the growth there has been strong. And maybe if you can just confirm my math on that case growth among the chain business accelerated in the second quarter, maybe kind of what you're doing to drive that acceleration? And then if you can maybe provide an update on the relative profitability. I know the gap between independents and chains has narrowed, but if you can give us just maybe a better sense as to how much that's narrowed at this point?"", 'Kevin P. Hourican', ""Okay. So I'll start, and I'll toss it to Kenny for any additional comment he may have. It's -- our CMU business, it's half of our business. We're winning meaningfully in that space. And yes, we did accelerate in Q2 versus Q1, and we have confidence in our ability to continue to be very successful in CMU. When people hear chain, they think national restaurants. I want to be very clear that is just one portion of that business. Travel and hospitality is in that space. Healthcare is in that space, education is in that space. And we've had notable and meaningful wins in each of those nonnational restaurant sectors. In fact, our focus is in nonnational restaurant sectors. The low profit portion of CMU is the national chain restaurant space, mostly in the QSR space. That's the lowest profit business. We're really focused on within national sales, which customer types we create a win-win contract relationship with our customers where we can help them achieve their objectives. We can do it at a cost to serve that meets their objectives. And they're willing and want to partner with Sysco on things that are profitable and helpful for Sysco. Like, for example, Sysco brand penetration. With local customers, we have more than 50% of our cases on that truck that are Sysco brand. And one of the reasons why the profit profile is lower in national is a lower penetration of Sysco brand. So we're looking for partners who want to grow together, who want to win together. And our national sales team has been doing a really good job in that regard, and we expect that momentum to continue. Kenny any additional comments you'd like to make?"", 'Kenny K. Cheung', ""Yes, I'll say a few things here. So if you think about any business, right, I'll say ROIC is a lens, how we look at all businesses, including chain. On the CMU side, as Kevin mentioned, we did accelerate. You are correct. The math is correct, but we accelerated profitably. That's a really important point here. Many of the things that we're doing across technology, strategic sourcing, all of our initiatives does impact both the local and the CMU side. So it is scaling and I know we say this a time scale and size really matters in the industry. So that's really important. Sometimes, we'll say this -- we all think the compensation plan ties only local. We have many, many things that scales across both local and driving possibility for both sides of the house. That's my first point. The second point is, again, ROIC cuts both ways. In SYGMA, which is mostly the bigger customers, we -- they were down on volume year-on-year. However, give the supply chain efficiencies and productivity that we're driving and pruning the customers side of the house, we were able to double -- more than double the business on profit, 140% increase there. So that gives you a little bit of color on how we think about productivity as well as some of the other side of ROIC."", 'Jake Rowland Bartlett', ""Great. And I just had a quick follow-up on the comments on the local business on the independent side. Kevin, you mentioned that the industry was robust. Are you seeing generally positive traffic in your -- at your local customers? I'm wondering whether just local traffic has improved in this latest quarter versus the prior quarters?"", 'Kevin P. Hourican', ""Yes. Independent traffic, especially in December, was robust. That's my most concise way of describing it. Really healthy, strong I'd tell you we're strong across food away from home, but independents, in particular, very strong in December."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.', 'Brian James Harbour', ""You've discussed this, but maybe I'll ask it in a slightly different way. On operating leverage, you expect it for the full year. Do you expect a little bit less in the second half, maybe as a consequence of ramping up hiring? Or are some of the cost out sort of an offset to that? How do you think about that in the second half versus the first half?"", 'Kenny K. Cheung', ""Yes. So you are correct in terms of the second half dynamic and let me explain what that means. So in the first half of fiscal year 2023, if you recall, we had snapback and excess overtime in the first half of last year. But also recall, throughout the back half of last year, fiscal year '23, those costs subsided, it became 0 towards the back half. Also supply chain, productivity, turnover, retention, labor standards, all of those things that we're driving the value that we're seeing today, that started really towards the back half of last year. So said differently, Brian, we are lapping a more challenging comparison from a comp standpoint. With that said, we are also investing in our business and our stride is operating leverage here for the full year."", 'Brian James Harbour', ""Okay. That makes sense. Maybe just on International. I know that's not as big for you, but it is pretty material, right?. I think we've seen sort of some varying performance in international markets just restaurant companies have said. Could you comment on how you see that in the second half also kind of how you see the inflationary trend over the next couple of quarters in that business?"", 'Kevin P. Hourican', ""Yes, this is Kevin. I'll start, Brian. I appreciate the question on international. I'll talk about just what we're seeing in international, and Kenny can address the inflation part of the question at the end. Yes, the headline here is we're very pleased with international performance. Rewind tape, I've been here 4 plus years now. COVID had a very negative impact on International. The shutdowns were earlier. They were deeper, they were longer. They were more punitive, and it was a rough go, especially in Europe. We're out of that now. We are clear of that, and we are very pleased with our performance. International is a tailwind for Sysco from a growth perspective and from a profitability improvement contribution perspective. I'll just call out three examples from a color commentary to give it some texture. Canada is doing incredibly well. Local performance in Canada, greater than 6% case growth. Local performance Canada, greater than 6% case growth, and that's our largest international business. Why is that happening? We're deploying the Sysco play in an even greater way, bringing advanced digital tools to the country, bringing the Recipe for Growth to the country and leveraging an extremely talented team north of the border. So Canada is doing extremely well. Great Britain, our second largest international country. We've always had a very good robust and mature CMU business, and we were underpenetrated in local. We are meaningfully focused on winning local from a leadership perspective in country, and we are revamping our supply chain and our systems capabilities in Great Britain to be able to better serve local customers in that country, and we're moving them up the profitability curve as a result of increasing penetration with local. And last but not least, let me talk about France. France has been a problem child for my tenure at Sysco, mostly self-inflicted. I have been very transparent about that over time. And we have turned the corner in France, upward, onward and better. We're off to a really good start in the first half of the year in France. We have a strong leadership team in place in France, and they're really beginning to -- like I've said a second ago, run the Sysco play. We've deployed strategic sourcing, AKA PJM, which is our strategic sourcing capability. We're working on introducing Sysco brand product in France, and we're working to increase the product range available and each of those things is working and France is contributing positively this year to our P&L in a way that is beneficial to the overall company. So those are just some color commentary points and I toss to Kenny for any comments on inflation."", 'Kenny K. Cheung', ""Yes. Brian. So if you think about the -- earlier in the year, the inflation for International was roughly over 10% and this very quarter that we just had was roughly 6.5%. So we are seeing inflation subsiding a bit throughout the quarter. With that said though, we are excited given the One global operating model that we're operating in right now, and that is driving dividends. It extends our size, extends our scale, leverage capabilities, tools, and best practices. So as Kevin talked about, a lot of that playbook under the one umbrella of global operating model is really creating dividend. So yes, while inflation is pressured, we are seeing the ops us through future sourcing, local case growth, technology play overall, One global operating model. So yes, we are still very optimistic and bullish about the international market as a growth engine for us. As you can see in Q2, we were up 10% on upline and 30% on operating income."", 'Operator', ""This does conclude today's question-and-answer session and today's program.

That run has culminated in Synopsys' recently announcement intension to acquire design and physics simulation software leader Ansys (NASDAQ: ANSS) in an industry mega-merger."", ""But there's another company that also plays in this chip and computing system design space: Keysight Technologies (NYSE: KEYS). Its performance has been downright pedestrian the last few years. Does it stand a chance as peers merge and get bigger?"", 'Keysight is best known for its electronic and computing system testing and emulation equipment (emulation meaning a system that can imitate how a designed component or a new system will behave, an important step in the design process as it can save money before anything moves on to mass manufacturing).', ""It's a highly competitive space. Besides Synopsys and Cadence, both of which offer some test and emulation solutions (including hardware) with their software design suites, Keysight competes with the likes of Teradyne and National Instruments -- which itself was just acquired by Emerson Electric."", ""All on its own, electronic test equipment isn't exactly a high-growth industry. This shows up in Keysight's general financial performance over the last decade or so, which hasn't equated to much in the way of blistering financial performance -- but the market sure is expecting great things. Keysight has massively outperformed the S&P 500 index, thanks in no small part to investors running up the company's valuation (basically, share price rising far faster than earnings and free-cash-flow-per-share growth)."", ""But electronic and computing system test and emulation is getting more complex, and software is pushing the boundaries of what's possible before a physical piece of hardware is ever actually made. That's why Synopsys made its big move for Ansys. And in fact, Keysight struck first. In September 2023, it completed its acquisition of a majority stake in a very small Ansys peer called ESI Group, based in France, for just over €900 million (approximately $977 million USD). ESI provides software-based prototyping (again, simulation of an object before it's ever manufactured) for the aerospace and automotive markets."", 'Indeed, it would seem the software simulation market is a hot commodity right now, as lots of test instrumentation businesses want in on the game to help industrial customers accelerate the move into the digital era.', ""It all sounds like an exciting story building around Keysight, but I have my doubts. Testing equipment and related software is a growing need, but it isn't exactly lighting the world on fire. Not in the same way that semiconductor and computing system design software providers like Synopsys and Cadence are, anyway."", ""Final electronics system testing doesn't carry quite the same level of extreme complexity that semiconductor design does. As a result, Keysight has more competition in its core competencies than the semiconductor design software near-duopoly shared between Synopsys and Cadence."", 'This again shows up in the financial numbers. Synopsys and Cadence continued to grow at a low-teens percentage clip even during the bear market and chip industry slump of the last year-and-a-half. Keysight, on the other hand, reported revenue growth of just 2% (when excluding a small divestiture) in its recently wrapped fiscal 2023.', 'Of course, Keysight is the value stock here. It trades for just under 20 times expected one-year forward earnings, compared to a high premium of 43 and 35 times forward expected earnings for Cadence and Synopsys, respectively.', 'Nevertheless, I personally am happy to hold on to my shares of the industry leaders Synopsys and Cadence, rather than Keysight. Though it\'s ""cheaper,"" it appears to be that way for good reason, as its average revenue growth prospects in the coming years are just a mere mid- to high-single-digit percentage, versus much faster growth for the semiconductor industry specifically. Keysight might be a solid long-term investment, but the current price just doesn\'t look good enough to me right now.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Keysight Technologies right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Keysight Technologies, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Keysight Technologies wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions). At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir."", 'Frank George Morgan', ""Good morning and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks and then we will take questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings.On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare Inc. is included in today's release. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today.With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam."", 'Samuel N. Hazen', ""All right. Good morning to everybody and thank you for joining the call. We finished 2023 better than expected across most dimensions of our business. In the quarter, we experienced strong demand for services across our diversified portfolio of markets, facilities and service lines. This growth coupled with improved cost trends drove solid financial performance in the fourth quarter.Diluted earnings per share excluding gains on sales were $5.90, which represented a 27% increase over prior year. We are encouraged by these results and believe the operational momentum we have created should position us well for 2024.As mentioned at our recent Investor Day, the staying power of HCA Healthcare was on display again throughout the year. Diluted earnings per share, excluding gains and losses on sales and debt retirement for the year grew almost 13% as compared to 2022. As a management team, we pride ourselves on the following: first, owning our realities, whatever they are. Next, making a big company small so we can adjust timely; and third, being disciplined in thought, resource allocation and execution, helping us to accomplish our mission.Once again, I believe our people have impressively demonstrated these traits in the face of new challenges and delivered positive outcomes for our patients, the communities we serve and our other stakeholders. Often refer to them as can do people and again, this past year, I think they proved it. I want to thank them for their hard work and everything they do for our company.Same-facility volumes across the company were strong in the fourth quarter. Admissions grew 3% year-over-year. Equivalent admissions were up 4%, emergency room visits grew 2%, inpatient and outpatient surgery volumes increased approximately 1%. Most of our other volume categories including cardiac procedures and rehab admissions had solid growth metrics in the quarter also.All domestic divisions had equivalent admissions growth in the quarter. Additionally, payer mix and acuity levels in the quarter improved year-over-year. These factors along with certain enhancements in a couple of states Medicaid supplemental programs helped produce same facilities revenue growth of 11% in the quarter. Bill will provide more detail on revenue in his comments.Operating margins improved in the quarter as we were able to generate solid operating leverage across the company on the increased revenue we produced as compared to the prior year. But even more impressively when compared sequentially to the third quarter, we executed well over the year on our people agenda. In the quarter, we saw further progress on key metrics as evidenced by solid employee engagement results, stable turnover trends and reductions in contract labor utilization.As we have detailed in the past, we have implemented a comprehensive human resources plan. We expect to make further progress on it as we move into 2024. Our plan will remain a top organizational priority with significant investments in workforce development and training, which includes expansions in both Galen College of Nursing and our centers for clinical advancement.With respect to hospital-based physician costs in the quarter, we slowed the rate of growth. As it pertains to Valesco, our physician staffing joint venture, we reduced the operating loss in the fourth quarter, more in line with our expectations. As indicated at our Investor Day, we expect to invest significantly this year in our long-term plans, which we designed to take our company from strength to strength and achieve the growth potential we see in our core business.These investments revolve around 3 distinct opportunities. The first one includes continued network expansion in facilities, services and workforce to meet the demand growth that we expect in our markets while also supporting our efforts to increase market share. In 2024, we have over $2 billion of new capital projects scheduled to come online that will increase capacity. Additionally, we expect to integrate a number of newly acquired hospitals and outpatient facilities that should complement our networks.The second opportunity includes a robust agenda designed to advance digital capabilities across the company and unlock the embedded value we see in our operations. As high performing as we are today, we believe there is more operational potential inside our company. With evolving technological tools, we are investing to unlock this value. We believe this initiative, together with our care transformation and innovation program will enhance quality, drive further efficiencies through our financial resiliency program and improve overall operational management capabilities, including integrating our revenue cycle and case management functions better.The third area of opportunity pertains to the flexibility we have to use our balance sheet position and strong cash flow production to invest heavily in our business and our people while also allocating capital to our shareholders. In 2024, we plan to increase capital spending to over $5 billion and enhance our share repurchase program to around $5 billion. We continue to believe this strategic plan will produce more winning play for our organization, allowing us to deliver better services for patients while also creating value for other stakeholders.Let me close with this, the constituency in our organization consists of 3 principles: giving our patients what they deserve whenever they need services, partnering with our physicians to deliver high-quality outcomes and leveraging the distinct elements of HCA Healthcare to improve performance. Our approach to delivering on these core values comes from what we term the HCA way. That is supporting our local provider systems with value-added enterprise-level capabilities coupled with disciplined and detailed oriented management teams that relentlessly focus on execution. This operating philosophy has helped us navigate different economic cycles, adapt to changes in the industry and address challenges such as the COVID pandemic.As we look to the future, we have designed our next-generation growth plan to build upon the strengths we have developed over the years and take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. I am proud of HCA Healthcare. I'm even more proud of our people. We will move into 2024 in the years ahead with greater purpose with a renewed agenda to drive sustained growth and with a confidence in our ability to deliver value and positive outcomes for our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call to Bill and he will discuss in more detail the quarter's results and 2024 guidance."", 'William B. Rutherford', 'Okay. Great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter and year and then discuss our 2024 guidance.We highlighted at our recent Investor Day that our formula of combining strong operational performance with a disciplined and balanced allocation of capital has a long track record of generating value over time. Our results for 2023 and our guidance for 2024 reflect a continuation of this formula. Sam provided many of our fourth quarter indicators in his comments. So let me take a moment to review some of our results for the full year 2023.We have strong top line growth. For the year, our same facility admissions grew 3.3% over prior year. Equivalent admissions grew 4.8%. Emergency room business grew 4.7% and total surgical cases were up 2.3%. We maintained our strong acuity trends with case mix index increasing and payer mix improved with managed care and other admissions growing 6% for the full year on a same-facility basis. Revenue per equivalent admission grew 2.7% on a same facility basis. This contributed to same-facility revenue growing 7.6% and 7.9% on a consolidated basis for the full year 2023.We couple top line strength with strong management of operating costs. Salaries, wages and benefits as a percentage of revenue improved 60 basis points on a consolidated basis compared to prior year. Contract labor declined 20% for the year and equated to 5.3% of SWB in the fourth quarter. Our teams continue to do a great job managing the supply costs, which improved 40 basis points as a percentage of revenue for the full year.As we have mentioned throughout the year, we are managing through pressures on professional fees and hospital-based physician costs. But we saw an improvement in the sequential rate of growth in both the third and fourth quarter. Sam mentioned, we also saw an improvement in our Valesco joint venture, which was in line with our expectations. We are confident in our plans to continue working through what we believe are industry-wide pressures in this area.The result of this is we produced solid margins of 19.6% in line with our range of expectations on a consolidated basis and adjusted EBITDA growth of 5.5% on an as-reported basis for the full year 2023. So as a management team, we are very pleased with the operational performance of the company during the year.Let me briefly discuss our results in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew just under 14% in the quarter as compared to the prior year. This is primarily due to strong revenue growth and solid expense management during the quarter. In addition to our strong core business trends, we recognized a year-over-year adjusted EBITDA increase of approximately $250 million related to our supplemental payment programs. This includes the new North Carolina program and certain favorable adjustments within the Texas program.Additionally, based on our experience with the program to date, we began accruing the Florida program in the quarter whereas previously, we had recognized this program on an annual lump sum basis. Our recently acquired entities as well as facilities divested in the prior year resulted in about $90 million less adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, with roughly half of this decline from the Valesco joint venture.In summary, the quarter was the strongest operational performance of the year. And with the additional benefit from the supplemental programs and impact of new and divested facilities, we are very pleased with the year-over-year growth we were able to produce.So next, let me speak to capital allocation. We deployed a balanced allocation of capital in 2023. For the full year, our cash flow from operations was $9.4 billion compared to $8.5 billion in the prior year or just under 11% growth. Capital expenditures were just above $4.7 billion for the year, which was in line with our expectations. We purchased approximately $3.8 billion of our outstanding shares and paid approximately $660 million of dividends during the year.Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage remains near the low end of our stated guidance range of 3x to 4x. So we believe we are well positioned going into 2024. And with that, let me speak to our 2024 guidance for a moment.As noted in our release this morning, we are providing full year 2024 guidance as follows. We expect revenues to range between $67.75 billion and $70.25 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare range between $5.2 billion and $5.6 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.85 billion and $13.55 billion and expect diluted earnings per share to range between $19.70 and $21.20. And finally, we expect capital spending to range between $5.1 billion and $5.3 billion.So let me provide a little additional commentary on our guidance. First, let me note the $145 million payer settlement we reported in the first quarter of 2023. Our guidance assumes a growth in equivalent admissions between 3% and 4% and revenue per equivalent admission between 2% and 3%.Regarding state supplemental programs. I want to highlight that these programs are complex and most have multiple activities that impact the timing and amounts we receive. So this results in some variability of the timing of recognizing the impact of these programs during the year. For 2024, we are anticipating benefit from a new program in Nevada. But based on current assumptions, we expect some modest headwinds when we aggregate the impact of all of these supplemental programs and we believe this could range between $100 million and $200 million for the year.We expect full year margins to be within our historical trends and cash flow from operations to range between $9.5 billion and $10 billion. Depreciation estimated to be about $3.2 billion and interest expense is projected to be around $2 billion. Finally, our fully diluted shares are expected to be around $264 million for the year.It was also noted in our release this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $6 billion share repurchase program. This will be in addition to the approximately $300 million remaining on our prior authorization. In addition, our Board declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.60 to $0.66 per share. With that, let me turn the call back over to Sam.', 'Samuel N. Hazen', ""All right. Thank you, Bill. As you saw in our press release, Bill Rutherford has decided to retire after 34 years with the company, 10 years as CFO and Bill had a tremendous career with HCA and then -- and my communication to our colleagues throughout the company I indicated that is impressive as the results work financially with the company during his tenure. Bill's legacy with the company will be remembered by the many people in the company has positively impacted with his leadership, mentorship in the way he embraced our mission and culture. And so Bill, congratulations on your retirement, and thank you very much on behalf of the Board and the senior team for everything you've done for the organization.Now part of Bill's legacy is creating a really deep financial team inside our organization. We pride ourselves on having the capabilities to build talent and then replace talent and we're fortunate to have Mike Marks as our next CFO. Mike has been with the company for 28 years. He has had various roles most of which were in the National Group at the Group for the National Group for 10 years, and then he's been in the Senior Vice President and Financial Operations role for the last few years. He is approved an HCA executive. He understands and appreciates our culture. He knows how to execute and get results. And I know he's going to be an exceptional CFO for HCA and I'm eager for many of you to get to meet him. And so Mike, congratulations.So with that Frank, we will go to questions."", 'Frank George Morgan', 'Thank you, Sam, and thank you, Bill. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question so we might give as many as possible in the queue, an opportunity to ask a question. Greg, you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Okay. It looks like our first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS.', 'Albert J. William Rice', ""Best wishes Bill, on the retirement and congratulations to Mike. I just want to ask about volumes because there's obviously some different chatter out there about what's going on. I think coming into the fourth quarter, you guys had said you expected to see a return to normal seasonality. I wonder whether that's what you described, what you saw there? Do you have any updated thoughts on whether we are seeing a sicker population post-COVID, maybe just some pent-up demand for people going back to see the doctors. And then specifically as well on utilization review management, we've talked about that from time to time that health plans are getting more aggressive post-pandemic now about utilization review. There's also a chatter in the last week about maybe there's actually easing observation status. I wonder if you could tell us a little bit of what you're seeing in that category as well."", 'Samuel N. Hazen', ""Well, let's see, A.J., this is Sam. I have about 4 questions there. Let me see if I can sort of emphasize them. I will tell you from our judgment, we had normal seasonality with respect to most categories of our business. And we had indicated last year that we thought seasonality trends have returned in the latter half of 2022 and they continued in our estimation into the latter half of 2023 with the natural seasonality that we see in our outpatient areas as well as some of our other surgical areas for the most part, from the third quarter of this year to the fourth quarter.How that was influenced by new policies and pent-up demand, we can't really determine that, and we don't believe it had a material impact. So from our standpoint, we've been optimistic that our strategy around our network development, our execution on our quality and patient safety agendas and then our partnerships with our physicians was going to allow us to continue to grow. We mentioned that at our Investor Day and we think that's part and parcel to what's happening with our business as we push through the latter part of the year.I mean there's always utilization of policies and procedures coming from the payers. There's like I said, some changes in certain policies. It's way too early to judge the effect of those and we are really judging our business and thinking about 2024 optimistically around where the demand for healthcare is at least in our markets."", 'Operator', 'Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.', 'Philip Chickering', ""Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. And Bill, it is a real pleasure working with you over the years. So thank you very much for all that.On supplemental payments, so a lot of unpack there I guess. Can you bridge actually what the supplemental payments were in '22, '23 versus '24 in absolute dollars? And also on the OpEx side, how much the payment taxes were again for '22, '23 and '24?"", 'William B. Rutherford', ""Yes. Pito, let me put it this way, I can't give you all that detail right now. As we've talked about -- we view supplemental payments is really just part of our overall Medicaid revenue portfolio. I think we're up to 17 or 18 states with supplemental payment programs right now. As I mentioned in my comments, each of these programs have a level of complexity, multiple attributes to it that affect the timing when we recognize those.In the quarter, as I mentioned, we did recognize the benefit of the new North Carolina program that was anticipated. We had settlement in Texas and we began accruing Florida accounts for it. So we can maybe offline give you a quarter-by-quarter breakdown. But those were the main things that affected us during the fourth quarter. But I will mention even with the supplemental payment programs, the core operations of the business remains strong. When we look at core revenue growth as well as our revenue per admit growth, we believe the supplemental payments were just added to what was already a strong quarter."", 'Operator', 'Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.', 'Justin Lake', ""And I'll start off by adding my thanks to Bill to appreciate all the help over the years and you'll be missed and congrats to Mike. My question was around Medicare specifically and a couple of things. One, you talked about commercial being strong. We've been hearing Medicare and Medicare Advantage trends have been specifically really strong in the quarter. Can you give us some color on Medicare revenue growth and Medicare volume growth in the quarter? And then specifically, I think in reference to A.J.'s question, I think we just tried to touch on was the impact of the 2 midnight rule. Can you talk about what's going on there for 2024? And would you think the impact might be? And did you see any early benefits in 2023 as you started ramping up into this?"", 'William B. Rutherford', ""Yes, Justin, thanks for that. I will start with the Medicare volume, as I know that's been the topic. We have seen some growth in our Medicare Advantage admissions, which were roughly up 10% in the quarter, which is pretty consistent for what we've seen throughout the year. And we think this probably a combination of conversion from traditional Medicare fee-for-service. So all of some of our volume gains and maybe a bit utilization, it's hard for us to break that down in its entirety on there.In terms of our revenue per admit between Medicare Advantage and Medicare has been very consistent through the year as well. So we didn't see any really step change in the fourth quarter of that material amount. When I think about the 2 midnight rule, Sam alluded, it's too early for us to judge the impact of this rule. We know it's got a period to be implemented, we believe ultimately it's going to benefit our patients. And we think over time could be some moderate positive results for us. But we've seen no impact yet, but we believe over time, as we go through '24, there could be some modest benefit as we go through that."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from the line of Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets. Ben, go ahead.', 'Benjamin Hendrix', ""Thank you very much and congratulations to Bill and Mike. Just wanted to follow up on your comment about the $5 billion of capital spending you expect. I just wanted to get an idea of how you're thinking about allocating that into your inpatient capabilities and higher acuity. And where do you think how should we think about that evolving through the year? And the impact on case mix as we look into your 2024 guidance?"", 'Samuel N. Hazen', ""This is Sam. We have been pretty consistent with our allocation over the years between inpatient, outpatient and technology. And I think 2024 will be somewhat consistent with that. I will tell you we do have a large development pipeline of new outpatient facilities that are connected to our capital project in 2024 and 2025, we'll have quite a few come online a little bit more than we had in '23 and '22. We do have some new hospitals in a few markets that will come online and we're starting to invest in other markets. So I think when we look at the volume of beds and so forth coming on in '24, it's about the same as '23, if I remember correctly and then our ER capacity is growing consistently. So we're pretty consistent in our allocation of capital. It's not disproportionately oriented to any one category of our business. And we think, again, that approach has yielded really strong returns. It's allowed us to meet the demand expectations that exist in the market and it's also responded to our physicians in the way that created the capacity or allowed for the clinical technology that they need to practice their medicine.So we're stepping it up because we have a growing occupancy on the inpatient side. And then we have opportunities in the outpatient side to expand our networks further in these fast-growing communities. That's pretty much the snapshot of it but it's generally consistent from an allocation standpoint to prior years."", 'Operator', 'Great. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with TD Cowen. Gary, please go ahead.', 'Gary Paul Taylor', ""One clarification and then I'll ask my real question. I just want to make sure I understood what Bill said and congrats to Bill, by the way. You're walking through the net Medicaid DPP EBITDA outlook for '24. And I think you said, overall, you're expecting that dollars to come down $100 million to $200 million. I want to make sure I had that correct. And then my real question was just you talked about stemming the Valesco operating losses sequentially to more in line with what you originally thought, which I think means maybe brings that down to sort of breakeven in the quarter. And I was just hoping you'd share what us a little bit about how operational you pulled that off."", 'William B. Rutherford', ""Yes, Gary, this is Bill. Thanks for those comments. I'll start with DPP, you are correct in my comments. We are expecting overall, when we aggregate all the programs to potentially be a headwind anywhere between $100 million and $200 million, largely due to settlements that we received this year, we don't expect to reoccur and then the Florida beginning accrual had an impact to that. So that's what's mostly driving that across our multiple programs.On Valesco, as we mentioned, it came in line with our expectations, which think last quarter, we sized just under $50 million or so a quarter. As we continue to work on multiple improvement initiatives, including further integrating that joint venture into HCA. We expect to see continued improvement going forward. Next year, I think Valesco for the full year will equate with about the same amount we recorded this year, but we had 9 months this year versus 12 months obviously in 2024. So we do believe over time there will be continued improvement and we're working diligently towards those efforts."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.', 'Brian Gil Tanquilut', ""Bill, congrats on a very successful career at HCA. I guess my question to follow up on Gary's. Maybe expanding a bit further to the broader labor outlook. How are you thinking about the opportunity to further reduce spending on both nursing and obviously at Valesco? Or maybe another way to ask it is, how are you viewing inflation at the wage level?"", 'William B. Rutherford', ""Well, I think we've proven the teams have managed through that very well during the inflationary period we experienced. I think going forward, we expect to move back into kind of normal trends, which is generally 2.5% to 3% of wage inflation going forward. And then we believe there is continued improvement in contract labor to be achieved. And we have plans to execute that throughout 2024.On the professional fees in Valesco, we have a number of initiatives with teams working on that only further integrate into our operations, but to continue to figure out adjustments to those programs. Our professional fees I've talked to, we have seen a decline in the sequential rate of growth. So we're a bit encouraged with that as we go into '24, we would expect those sequential declines to continue. And we're working hard through multiple initiatives, whether it be revenue enhancements, program adjustments or are looking at opportunities to internalize some of those programs."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho.', 'Ann Kathleen Hynes', 'I also want to congratulate Bill on his retirement. I just have a couple of follow-ups just on the managed care pricing yield assumptions for 2024, which is up 2% to 3%, which looks a little conservative given the 2 midnight rule and when you look at Medicaid redeterminations, the growth in the health exchange and your states are very strong. So in your guidance, do you embed any benefit from the 2 midnight rule or kind of the shift from Medicaid potentially to commercial?And then secondly, if you can just maybe give us some more detail about how the 2 midnight rule could impact you, maybe a percent of our emissions or maybe kind of a differential between revenue per admit would be great.', 'William B. Rutherford', ""Yes, this is Bill. Let me first clarify, our 2% to 3% we mentioned earlier, it is our aggregated revenue per equivalent admission and then obviously, there's categories underneath it. I would tell you, regarding Medicaid redetermination is still early. We believe there's some modest benefit that we've seen as patients have migrated from Medicaid into HICS and other employer sponsors. I don't believe that's material yet. We'll see how that continues to trend throughout 2024. And I would say we don't have a material, in fact, material not factored into our guidance on that.On the 2 midnight rule, as we said earlier, it is really early in that progression. It should be positive for us if it's implemented as expected. I think it will be positive for patients over time as well. And we'll just have to see how that plays out. But we don't have, I'd say, a material adjustment factored into our '24 number for that as well. Our range of guidance, I think it accommodates for various outcomes on both of those programs and we'll see how that plays out as we go through the first part of the year."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from Whit Mayo with Leerink Partners.', 'Benjamin Whitman Mayo', ""Thanks. And congrats to Bill. I think this might be the second time you've retired. So I hope it sticks. But my question really, Sam, is I'm curious on any new expense initiatives that you guys have elevated internally as a new strategic focus, anything, maybe more creative or imaginative that you're bringing forth this year to challenge the organization."", 'Samuel N. Hazen', ""Well, at our Investor Day, Mike Marks presented our financial resiliency program and it's got different components to it. There's more sophisticated integration of our revenue cycle that includes our case management initiative, which I will highlight here. Our case management initiative is to make sure that our patients get into the right setting in the right time line and free up capacity where appropriate. And so for this past year, we had early-stage success with that. Our length of stay was down and our case mix was modestly up. So when you put the 2 together, it's a good start for us with respect to our case management initiative. That is important on multiple fronts. It allows us to allocate our nurse staffing more effectively to more acute patients and so forth. We will continue to invest in that initiative as we bring on more technology, more structure to our teams and better process in benchmarking.The second thing I would highlight is with respect to what we're calling our internal benchmarking initiative. We have incredible opportunities to compare more deeply into our organization, whether it's on the variable cost side with respect to what we allocate and distribute to our facilities or on fixed costs. And both of those categories are getting a lot more benchmarking under Mike's leadership, and we're finding opportunities to rethink how we organize our cost structure, how we leverage process improvement, how we use technology and automation in those areas to improve processes and variable costs. So I'm excited about the prospects there.As I mentioned in my commentary, we had a very successful transition from the third quarter to the fourth quarter with respect to what we call clearance operating leverage and our operating leverage from the third quarter to the fourth quarter was the best I've seen in my experiences with the company. And I think part of that, not all of that is due to some of these initiatives and the transparency we have around our efforts to improve efficiencies, improve clinical outcomes for our patients and so forth.So those are 2 things I would highlight. Obviously, our technology agenda and our care transformation is a longer-run effort with respect to improved outcomes across different dimensions of our business. And we had some modest success there in the short run. We're really banking on those programs giving us long-term value. So those are just a couple of highlights, Whit.I will tell you, our teams culturally are disciplined. And as I mentioned, that discipline creates opportunities for us to find better ways to do things for all of our stakeholders. And that mindset is something that we carry forward from 1 year to the next, then we'll carry that on into '24 and into '25 and so forth. And we think it's an essential ingredient for a health system success. And I'm pretty proud of our teams and how they embrace that and how they execute on the initiatives to make that happen."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.', 'Kevin Mark Fischbeck', ""Great. And I'll just add my thanks to Bill for your help over the years. I guess I wanted to know -- get a little more color from you guys about the volume expectation for 2024 because it's -- you guys want talk about 2% to 3% you're looking for faster growth in '24. So I just wanted to better understand where that extra growth is coming from. So any color on the service lines or procedures that you think still have room to grow above average? And if there's anything that you'd expect from a payer mix perspective in '24? Is there one type of payer where you think there's a big opportunity for volumes to snap back?"", 'William B. Rutherford', ""Kevin, let me start and then Sam can add in. So we're going off our experience we've seen throughout '23. As we said earlier in the comments, we thought there was very strong demand for services in our markets. We think our capital programs and our program initiatives are paying off. Our adjusted admissions this year were 4.8%. You're right in our guidance next year, caused us for 3% to 4% expectation on adjusted admissions that may be a little higher than our 2% to 3% historical. But I think we're reading continued strong demand. We saw really strong enrollment in the health insurance exchanges across our states. And that continues to be a favorable development for us. We believe we continue to see strong economic indicators and employments and our access to contracted lives remaining wells. So I think all of those factors go into play with our expectations for '24 and is based on kind of our current experience."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.', 'Stephen C. Baxter', ""Congrats to Bill as well. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about surgical growth in the quarter, whether there's any notable puts or takes there by service line or inpatient versus outpatient? And then I guess, the overall growth slowed down a little bit as we got through the back half of the year. I guess, how are you thinking about surgical growth in 2024, especially coming up against maybe some of the tougher comparisons that you'll have in the first half of the year."", 'Samuel N. Hazen', ""So overall, the fourth quarter surgery was a little slower than the year-to-date, and we were talking about that earlier this morning. We did have a more difficult December calendar, even though we had the same surgical days in total, the way they were allocated, created some challenges in our outpatient settings that we saw outpatient activity not as strong as in the previous 2 months of the quarter. But at a structural level, there's nothing to suggest that our surgical volume trends are going to change for the year, we had really solid volume growth in surgery. And we continue to invest heavily in our programs, both on the outpatient side and supporting our inpatient activity with more acute in complex program offerings.And for the year, our inpatient surgeries were up 2%, and our outpatient surgeries were up 2.5% so a slight migration, if you will, into the outpatient setting. And we think that will be generally consistent as we push into 2024. We do have a number of ambulatory surgery centers that have opened or will open in 2024. We've made a few acquisitions in certain markets with ambulatory surgery centers, and we continue to invest in our hospital operating suite as well as improve our processes just as we are improving our emergency room process with our revitalization program, and we think that will continue to be a value-add for our patients and for our physicians and help us with our volume pursuits.So that's how we're judging the surgical space. If you look at cardiac underneath that, our cardiac volumes continue to grow very robust and are actually growing in the mid-single digits and we think, again, that's reflective of our overall program development, expansion into new service lines underneath cardiac in responding again to our patient needs and physician needs and ways and we believe are productive for our organization."", 'Operator', 'Excellent. Our next caller -- or excuse me, our next question comes from the line of Jason Cassorla with Citigroup. Jason, please go ahead.', 'Jason Paul Cassorla', ""Best of luck in your retirement, Bill. I just wanted to follow up on the professional fee environment. You noted there was some deceleration in professional fee spend growth, if I heard that correctly. But maybe what is your expectation for physician costs or professional fees growth embedded within '24 guidance? And then on Valesco, it sounds like in your comments, Bill, that Valesco would generate $150 million of negative EBITDA next year versus the $200 million or so headwind for '23? Is that a fair way to look at it? Or any other color there would be great."", 'William B. Rutherford', ""Yes. Let me add in, and thanks. I think Valesco is a little lower. We're about $150 million in both years. But obviously, in '23, we had 9 months versus full month 12 months next year. So we see a kind of a run rate improvement as we go through the quarters during the year. On pro fees, we, as we said, have seen a decline in the sequential rate of growth. We have multiple initiatives underway. Embedded in our guidance next year is holding that professional fee growth perhaps to 8% to 10% versus this year, where it's been closer to 15% to 20%. So we are looking for a step changing. We're confident in our initiatives and the activities we have to be able to begin to bend that trend line."", 'Operator', 'Great. And our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Scott, please go ahead.', 'Scott J. Fidel', ""I'll echo my congrats to Bill. And then my question is would be curious in terms of how you're thinking about the whole broader debate on just the pent-up demand recovery in the seniors population. And based on all your data and analysis, sort of where you think the Medicare utilization trends are now at this point relative to sort of pre-pandemic levels and returning to the baseline, certainly felt like there was some, quite a bit of that recovery played out in '23. But interested in sort of what inning you think we may be in that process at this point."", 'Samuel N. Hazen', ""This is Sam. It's interesting, I'm just looking at a trend line here. I don't have it beyond this time period. But in 2019, this is a composite view of Medicare. So it has both Medicare and Medicare Advantage. It's our Medicare admissions grew 2.6%. You throw out 2020 and 2021 grew 2.1%. 2022 grew 3.4% and 2023 grew 4%. So is there acceleration on our trend? Yes. Obviously, there's aging baby boomers in the mix there, number one. Number two, we think we're taking out market share. So to judge overall utilization patterns around that is really difficult for us. There's population growth in our markets. When you look at adjusted admissions, on the same combination payer class. Again, 3.7% in 2019, 5.3% at '21, 4.7% in '22 and 5.7% in '23.So a slight acceleration, but a function, we believe of aging baby boomers and a number of beneficiaries moving in the program, population growth for us in market share gains. So it's hard for us to judge underneath that, whether or not there's some structural change in utilization, that's almost impossible for us to discern with the data that we have."", 'Operator', 'Great. Thank you, Scott. And our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald.', 'Sarah Elizabeth James', 'Congratulations on the retirement Bill. You guys said that the impact of the 2 midnight rule ramps through the year. So ramp as opposed to flipping a switch. What are the mechanics of that stage implementation? Is it retaining your staff? Or is it assuming some delay in benefit from claims denials and getting the payers on board? And then when would it be fully ramped? Are you talking midyear exiting 2024? And is there anything that HCA can do to pull that forward?', 'William B. Rutherford', ""Well, I mean, the rule goes in effect in January. So I think the impact may ramp over time. It's a notable change for the payers. So we're working them very closely on the administration of those plans and making sure it's operating as described on there. And if it does, we should see it equally throughout the year. And so we're working closely on it, but it's a pretty big change for the payers. And so there might be some administrative differences as it gets implemented through the year. But we hope very quickly, we'll be able to work our way through that and begin to see some benefit as we go through 2024."", 'Operator', 'Thanks, Sarah. And our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.', 'Lance Arthur Wilkes', ""Congratulations to both Bill and Mike. Can you talk a little bit about labor supply that you're seeing? First, in the past, a couple of quarters ago, I talked about like demand that have been turned away at the hospitals. If you could just note if there's still any of that. And then how kind of hiring pipelines and are there particular areas that are more plentiful or areas that might be bottlenecks?"", 'Samuel N. Hazen', ""This is Sam again. Thank you for the question. We finished the year roughly, I don't have the exact average here at 90% acceptance rate. In other words, we weren't able to take roughly 10% of the patients who were referred to us through our transfer centers and such. That improved throughout the year as we went from maybe the mid-to-high in the first part of the year, to a little better than that in the second half of the year. We're still below where we were in 2019. But what we have seen is more patients coming through our transfer centers and other patient navigation program that we did in 2019. So we feel good about the inflow, if you will.We are still at times in situations where all of our capacity is not open and available, and that's what generates these situations where we can't receive the patients that are coming through these navigation programs and transfer centers. We think that will continue to get better in '24 as we have capital coming online as our hiring patterns continue to improve. Our turnover, as I mentioned in my commentary, has also improved. We've been very intentional in trying to create a great environment for our people with good leadership, resource capabilities and just overall trading to support the efforts so that they can be successful in what they do. And we think that will help us push through '24 and hopefully have more capacity available and be able to receive the patients that want to get into our system."", 'Operator', 'Great. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.', 'Joshua Richard Raskin', ""Bill, and congratulate on him on the retirement, and congrats to Mike as well. Could you speak to the increase in CapEx guidance again, this has been a multiyear trend for you guys? And maybe how returns on CapEx have trended? I'm just curious if there's more mix to outpatient, is that actually improving returns or are you getting to a point where the returns are coming in a little bit lower for the incremental project as you sort of continue to go down the list?"", 'William B. Rutherford', ""Josh, this is Bill. I'll start on the returns. Our returns remain very solid. I mean, we're in the upper teens returns. We have a very disciplined process where we evaluate these projects and we actually do look backs to validate some of our assumptions. And to me, the growth in the capital spending is a reflection of the growth of the opportunities we see to deploy capital to continue that growth. So we're very pleased with the returns on those.I think as Sam mentioned earlier in the Q&A, the mix between inpatient and outpatient, it varies from time to time, but mostly similar. We do have some newer outpatient facilities coming on. They generally have very good returns and quick returns when they do come online. So I think the capital program we're pleased with. It's an important component to our growth formula, as we've talked about and we're pleased with the overall returns in the interview."", 'Samuel N. Hazen', ""Yes. And the only thing I would say, and Bill alluded to this, our outpatient platform tends to be short cycle returns. We get a real efficient sort of capital allocation with outpatient facilities. And then on the hospital side, we are a hospital-centric health system. And as we invest in our hospitals, those are long-lived assets and they have a longer cycle to them with respect to returns, but they're critically important to the overall value that our outpatient facilities can generate for our system in the sense that we're able to navigate the patient further into the healthcare system if they need more acute care offerings. So we have to look at it in both manners.I think to Bill's point, we have had strong returns, a pattern of strong returns, we have occupancy on our inpatient hospital side in the low 70%, which is a pretty high occupancy level up over where it was pre-pandemic even with the additional beds that we've added. So we think the network model that we highlighted for you all at the Investor Day is working and is complemented by the outpatient facilities integrated with the hospital system in a manner that produces really positive enterprise returns for our company."", 'Operator', 'Great. And our final question comes from the line of Cal Sternick with JPMorgan.', 'Calvin Alexander Sternick', ""I'll add my congratulations to Bill as well. So 2 follow-ups. First, on the redeterminations. It sounds like that's a slight benefit to the 2024 guide, but not really material yet. Just wanted to clarify if this does develop better than you're anticipating? Is it something you think could be material to 2024? Or is the upside more annualized in 2025 after the redeterminations are completed. And then my other question was on the quarter itself. So one of the payers called out higher COVID inpatient costs per case. Can you talk about the COVID acuity levels that you saw in the quarter and whether that developed consistently with what you've seen in the past?"", 'William B. Rutherford', ""Yes. This is Bill. Let me start with the Medicaid redetermination. I think you're characteristic is right we do, see some modest benefit in 2024. We haven't adjusted to be material yet, but our range of guidance allows for some outcomes on there. We started to see some of the effects of those redeterminations late in 2023. We're tracking those very closely. We're seeing roughly 30% to 35% of those individuals that were potentially lost Medicaid seem to show up with either HICS or employer-sponsored coverage so that there's some benefit in that. We're seeing a decently large number being able to be reapplied in the Medicaid because some were redetermined off for technical reasons. So we've been able to manage through that. And I think with the conversion into either HICS or employer-sponsored, there is some modest benefit as we go through the year. And potentially, that will continue as we go through 2024 but don't judge that to be material at this stage.Regarding COVID, to be honest with you, COVID has really been stable for us over the past year. In total, our COVID admissions are roughly 2% of our total admissions. I don't really have any data on acuity, but I think it's very, very stable and hasn't really been a material factor in our overall operating results of late."", 'Operator', 'Great. Thanks, all. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it over to Frank for closing remarks. Frank, the floor is yours.', 'Frank George Morgan', ""Sure. Great. Thank you for your help today, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call. Hope you have a wonderful week, and we'll be around this afternoon and the balance of the week if we can answer any additional questions you might have. Have a good day."", 'Operator', ""And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect.""]"

We finished 2023 better than expected across most dimensions of our business. In the quarter, we experienced strong demand for services across our diversified portfolio of markets, facilities, and service lines. This growth, coupled with improved cost trends, drove solid financial performance in the fourth quarter.', 'Diluted earnings per share, excluding gains on sales, were $5.90, which represented a 27% increase over prior year. We are encouraged by these results and believe the operational momentum we have created should position us well for 2024. As mentioned at our recent investor day, the staying power of HCA Healthcare was on display again throughout the year. Diluted earnings per share, excluding gains and losses on sales and debt retirement, for the year grew almost 13% as compared to 2022.', 'As a management team, we pride ourselves on the following: first, owning our realities, whatever they are; next, making a big company small so we can adjust timely; and third, being disciplined in thought, resource allocation, and execution, helping us to accomplish our mission. Once again, I believe our people have impressively demonstrated these traits in the face of new challenges and delivered positive outcomes for our patients, the communities we serve, and our other stakeholders. I often refer to them as can-do people and again, this past year, I think they proved it. I want to thank them for their hard work and everything they do for our company.', 'Same facility volumes across the company were strong in the fourth quarter, admissions grew 3% year over year, equivalent admissions were up 4%, emergency room visits grew 2%, inpatient and outpatient surgery volumes increased approximately 1%. Most of our other volume categories, including cardiac procedures and rehab admissions, had solid growth metrics in the quarter also. All domestic divisions had equivalent admissions growth in the quarter. Additionally, payer mix and acuity levels in the quarter improved year over year.', ""These factors, along with certain enhancements in a couple of state's Medicaid supplemental programs, help produce same facilities revenue growth of 11% in the quarter. Bill will provide more detail on revenue in his comments. Operating margins improved in the quarter as we were able to generate solid operating leverage across the company on the increased revenue we produced as compared to the prior year, but even more impressively when compared sequentially to the third quarter. We executed well over the year on our people agenda."", 'In the quarter, we saw further progress on key metrics as evidenced by solid employee engagement results, stable turnover trends, and reductions in contract labor utilization. As we have detailed in the past, we have implemented a comprehensive human resources plan. We expect to make further progress on it as we move into 2024. Our plan will remain a top organizational priority with significant investments in workforce development and training, which includes expansions in both Galen College of Nursing and our centers for clinical advancement.', 'With respect to hospital-based physician costs to the quarter, we slowed the rate growth. As it pertains to Valesco, our physician staffing joint venture, we reduce the operating loss in the fourth quarter more in line with our expectations. As indicated in our investor day, we expect to invest significantly this year in our long-term plans, which we designed to take our company from strength to strength and achieve the growth potential we see in our core business. These investments revolve around three distinct opportunities.', 'The first one includes continued network expansion in facilities, services, and workforce to meet the demand growth that we expect in our markets while also supporting our efforts to increase market share. In 2024, we have over $2 billion of new capital projects scheduled to come online that will increase capacity. Additionally, we expect to integrate a number of newly acquired hospitals and outpatient facilities that should complement our networks. The second opportunity includes a robust agenda designed to advance digital capabilities across the company and unlock the embedded value we see in our operations.', ""As high performing as we are today, we believe there's more operational potential inside our company. With evolving technological tools, we are investing to unlock this value. We believe this initiative, together with our care transformation and innovation program, will enhance quality, drive further efficiencies through our financial resiliency program, and improve overall operational management capabilities, including integrating our revenue cycle in case management functions better. The third area of opportunity pertains to the flexibility we have to use our balance sheet position and strong cash flow production to invest heavily in our business and our people while also allocating capital to our shareholders."", 'In 2024, we plan to increase capital spending to over $5 billion and enhance our share repurchase program to around $5 billion. We continue to believe this strategic plan will produce more winning plays for our organization, allowing us to deliver better services for patients while also creating value for other stakeholders. Let me close with this. The constants in our organization consist of three principles, giving our patients what they deserve whenever they need services, partnering with our physicians to deliver high-quality outcomes, and leveraging the distinct elements of HCA Healthcare to improve performance.', 'Our approach to delivering on these core values comes from what we term the HCA Way. That is supporting our local provider systems with value-added enterprise-level capabilities, coupled with disciplined and detail-oriented management teams that relentlessly focus on execution. This operating philosophy has helped us navigate different economic cycles, adapt to changes in the industry, and address challenges such as the COVID pandemic. As we look to the future, we have designed our next-generation growth plan to build upon the strengths we have developed over the years and take advantage of the opportunities in front of us.', ""I am proud of HCA Healthcare, and I'm even more proud of our people. We will move into 2024 and the years ahead with greater purpose, with a renewed agenda to drive sustained growth, and with confidence in our abilities to deliver value and positive outcomes for our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call to Bill, and he will discuss in more detail the quarter's results and 2024 guidance."", 'Bill Rutherford -- Chief Financial Officer', 'OK, great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter and year and then discuss our 2024 guidance. We highlighted at our recent investor day that our formula of combining strong operational performance with a disciplined and balanced allocation of capital has a long track record of generating value over time.', 'Our results for 2023 and our guidance for 2024 reflect a continuation of this formula. Sam provided many of our fourth quarter indicators in his comments, so let me take a moment to review some of our results for the full year 2023. We have strong top-line growth. For the year, our same facility emissions grew 3.3% over prior year, equivalent admissions grew 4.8%, emergency room visits grew 4.7%, and total surgical cases were up 2.3%.', 'We maintained our strong acuity trends with case mix index increasing. And payer mix improved with managed care and other admissions, growing 6% for the full year on the same facility basis. Revenue per equivalent emission grew 2.7% on the same facility basis. This contributed to same facility revenue growing 7.6% and 7.9% on a consolidated basis for the full year 2023.', 'We coupled top-line strength with strong management of operating costs. Salaries, wages, and benefits as a percentage of revenue improved 60 basis points on a consolidated basis compared to prior year. Contract labor declined 20% for the year and equated to 5.3% of SWB in the fourth quarter. Our teams continued to do a great job managing supply costs, which improved 40 basis points as a percentage of revenue for the full year.', 'As we have mentioned throughout the year, we are managing through pressures on professional fees and hospital-based physician costs. But we saw an improvement in the sequential rate of growth in both the third and fourth quarter. Sam mentioned, we also saw an improvement in our Valesco joint venture, which was in line with our expectations. We are confident in our plans to continue working through what we believe are industrywide pressures in this area.', 'The result of this is we produce solid margins of 19.6%, in line with a range of expectations on a consolidated basis and adjusted EBITDA growth of 5.5% on an as-reported basis for the full year 2023. So, as a management team, we are very pleased with the operational performance of the company during the year. Let me briefly discuss our results in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew just under 14% in the quarter as compared to the prior year.', 'This is primarily due to strong revenue growth and solid expense management during the quarter. In addition to a strong core business trends, we recognized a year -over-year adjusted EBITDA increase of approximately 250 million related to our supplemental payment programs. This includes the new North Carolina program and certain favorable adjustments within the Texas program. Additionally, based on our experience with the program today, we began exploring the Florida program in the quarter, whereas, previously, we would recognize this program on an annual lump sum basis.', 'Our recently acquired entities, as well as facilities divested in the prior year, resulted in about 90 million less adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, with roughly half of this decline from the Valesco joint venture. In summary, the quarter was the strongest operational performance of the year. And with the additional benefit from the supplemental programs and impact of new divested facilities, we are very pleased with the year-over-year growth we were able to produce. So, next, let me speak to capital allocation.', 'We deployed a balanced allocation of capital in 2023. For the full year, our cash flow from operations was 9.4 billion compared to 8.5 billion in the prior year, or just under 11% growth. Capital expenditures were just above 4.7 billion for the year which was in line with our expectations. We purchased approximately 3.8 billion of our outstanding shares and paid approximately 660 million of dividends during the year.', 'Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage remains near the low end of our stated guidance range of three to four times, so we believe we are well positioned going into 2024. And with that, let me speak to our 2024 guidance for a moment. As noted in a release this morning, we are providing full year 2024 guidance as follows. We expect revenues to range between 67.75 billion and 70.25 billion.', 'We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between 5.2 billion and 5.6 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to range between 12.85 billion and 13.55 billion and expect diluted earnings per share to range between $19.70 and $21.20. And finally, we expect capital spending to range between 5.1 billion and 5.3 billion. So, let me provide a little additional commentary on our guidance.', 'First, let me note that 145 million payer settlement we recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Our guidance assumes a growth in equivalent emissions between 3% and 4%, and revenue per equivalent emission between 2% and 3%. Regarding state supplemental programs, I want to highlight that these programs are complex. And most have multiple attributes that impact the timing and amounts we receive.', 'So, this results in some variability of the timing of recognizing the impact of these programs during the year. For 2024, we are anticipating benefit from a new program in Nevada. But based on current assumptions, we expect some modest headwinds when we aggregate the impact of all of these supplemental programs. And we believe this could range between 100 million and 200 million for the year.', 'We expect full year margins to be within our historical trends and cash flow from operations to range between 9.5 billion and 10 billion. Depreciation is estimated to be about 3.2 billion, and interest expense is projected to be around 2 billion. Finally, our fully diluted shares are expected to be around 264 million for the year. As also noted in our release this morning, our board of directors has authorized a new $6 billion share repurchase program.', 'This will be in addition to the approximately 300 million remaining on our prior authorization. In addition, our board declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.60 to $0.66 per share. With that, let me turn the call back over to Sam.', 'Sam Hazen -- Chief Executive Officer', ""All right, thank you, Bill. As you saw in our press release, Bill Rutherford has decided to retire after 34 years with the company, 10 years as CFO. And Bill has had a tremendous career with HCA. And then, in my communication to our colleagues throughout the company, I indicated that as impressive as the results were financially with the company during his tenure, Bill's legacy with the company will be remembered by the many people in the company is positively impacted with his leadership, mentorship, and the way he embraced our mission and culture."", ""And so, Bill, congratulations on your retirement, and thank you very much, on behalf of the board and the senior team, for everything you've done for the organization. Now, part of Bill's legacy is creating a really deep financial team inside our organization. We pride ourselves on having the capabilities to build talent and then replace talent. And we're fortunate to have Mike Marks as our next CFO."", ""Mike has been with the company for 28 years. He has had various roles, most of which were in the national group as the group CFO for the national group for 10 years. And then, he's been in the senior vice president in financial operations role for the last few years. He is a proven HCA executive."", ""He understands and appreciates our culture. He knows how to execute and get results, and I know he's going to be an exceptional CFO for HCA. And I'm eager for many of you to get to meet him. So, Mike, congratulations."", 'So, with that, Frank, we will go into questions.', 'Frank Morgan -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'Thank you, Sam, and thank you, Bill. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question so we might give as many as possible in the queue an opportunity to ask a question. Greg, you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question.', '', 'Operator', 'All right. Thank you so much. [Operator instructions] OK, it looks like our first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS.', 'Caller, please go ahead.', 'A.J. Rice -- UBS -- Analyst', ""Thanks. Hi, everybody. Best wishes, Bill, on the retirement and congratulations to Mike. I just want to ask about volumes because there's obviously some different chatter out there about what's going on."", ""I think coming into the fourth quarter, you guys had said you expected to see a return to normal seasonality. I wonder whether that's what you described, what you saw there. Do you have any updated thoughts on whether we're seeing a sicker population post-COVID, maybe just some pent-up demand from people going back to see the doctors? And then, specifically as well on utilization review management, you know, we've talked about that from time to time that health plans are getting more aggressive post-pandemic now about utilization review. There's also chatter in the last week about maybe there's actually easing around observation status."", ""I wonder if you could tell us a little bit of what you're seeing in that category as well."", 'Sam Hazen -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Let's see, A.J. This is Sam. There's about four questions there. Let me see if I can sort of synthesize them."", ""I will tell you, from our judgment, we had normal seasonality with respect to most categories of our business. And we had indicated last year that we thought seasonality trends had returned in the latter half of 2022. And they continued, in our estimation, into the latter half of 2023 with the natural seasonality that we see in our outpatient areas, as well as some of our other surgical areas for the most part from the third quarter of this year to the fourth quarter. How that was influenced by new policies and pent-up demand, we can't really determine that."", ""And we don't believe it had a material impact. So, from our standpoint, we've been optimistic that our strategy around our network development, our execution on our quality and patient safety agendas, and then our partnerships with our physicians was going to allow us to continue to grow. We mentioned that at our investor day, and we think that's part and parcel to what's happening with our business as we push through the latter part of the year. I mean, there's always utilization policies and procedures coming from the payers."", ""There's, like I said, some changes in certain policies. Way too early to judge the effect of those. And we are, you know, really judging our business and thinking about 2024 optimistically around where the demand for healthcare is, at least in our markets."", 'Operator', 'OK, thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Caller, please go ahead.', 'Pito Chickering -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', ""Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. And, Bill, it's a real pleasure working with you over the year, so thank you very much for all that. On supplemental payments, you know, a lot to unpack there."", ""I guess can you bridge actually what supplemental payments were in '22, '23 versus '24, absolute dollars, and also, on the opex side, how much the supplemental payment taxes were again for '22, '23, and 24? Thanks so much."", 'Bill Rutherford -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, let me put it this way, I can't give you all that detail right now. As we've talked about, you know, we've used supplemental payments is really just part of our overall Medicaid revenue portfolio. I think we're up to 17 or 18 states with supplemental payments programs right now. As I mentioned in my comments, each of these programs have a level of complexity and multiple attributes to it that affect the timing when we recognize those."", 'In the quarter, as I mentioned, we did recognize some benefit of the new North Carolina program. That was anticipated. We had a settlement in Texas, and we began accruing Florida accounts for it. So, you know, we can maybe offline give you a quarter-by-quarter breakdown, but those were the main things that affected us during the fourth quarter.', 'But I will mention, even with the supplemental payment programs, the core operations of the business remained strong. When we look at core revenue growth, as well as our revenue per unit growth, we believe the supplemental payments were just additive to what was already a strong quarter.', 'Operator', 'OK, thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin, go ahead.', 'Justin Lake -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', ""Thanks, guys, and I'll start off by adding my thanks to Bill. Appreciate all the help over the years, and you'll be missed. And congrats to Mike. My question was around Medicare specifically and a couple of things."", ""One, you talked about commercial being strong. We've been hearing Medicare and Medicare Advantage trends have been specifically really strong in the quarter. Can you give us some color on Medicare revenue growth and Medicare volume growth in the quarter? And then, specifically, I think, you know, in reference to A.J.'s question, I think what we're just trying to touch on was, you know, the impact of the two-midnight rule. Can you talk about what's going on there for 2024 and what you think the impact might be? And did you see any early benefits in 2023 as you started ramping up into this? Thanks a lot."", 'Bill Rutherford -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, Justin, thanks. Thanks for that. Let's start with the Medicare volume as I know that's been a topic we have seen some growth in our Medicare Advantage admissions, which were roughly up 10% in the quarter, which is pretty consistent for what we've seen throughout the year. And we think, you know, probably a combination of conversion from traditional Medicare fee-for-service, as well as some of our volume gains and maybe a bit utilization."", ""It's hard for us to break that down in its entirety on there. In terms of our revenue per unit between Medicare Advantage and Medicare, it's been very consistent through the year as well. So, we didn't see any really step change in the fourth quarter of that material amount. When I think about the two-midnight rule Sam alluded, it's too early for us to judge the impact of this rule."", ""We know, you know, it's got a period to be implemented. We believe ultimately it's going to benefit our patients and we think, over time, could be some moderate positive results for us. But we've seen no impact yet, but we believe, over time, as we go through '24, there could be some modest benefit as we go through that."", 'Operator', 'Great, thank you. [Operator instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets. Ben, go ahead.', 'Ben Hendrix -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""Hey, thank you very much, and congratulations to Bill and Mike. Just wanted to follow up on your comment about the $5 billion of capital spending you expect. I just wanted to get an idea of how you're thinking about allocating that, you know, into your inpatient capabilities and higher acuity and where you think -- you know, where do you think -- how should we think about that evolving through the year and the impact on case mix as we look into your 2024 guidance? Thank you."", 'Sam Hazen -- Chief Executive Officer', ""This is Sam. We have been pretty consistent with our allocation over the years between inpatient, outpatient, and technology, and I think 2024 will be somewhat consistent with that. I will tell you, we do have, you know, a large development pipeline of new outpatient facilities that are connected to our capital project. In 2024 and 2025, we'll have quite a few come online, a little bit more than we had in '23 and '22."", ""We do have some new hospitals in a few markets that will come online, and we're starting to invest in other markets. So, I think when we look at the volume of beds and so forth coming on in '24, it's about the same as '23, if I remember correctly. And then, our ER capacity is growing consistently. So, we're pretty consistent in our allocation of capital."", ""It's not disproportionately oriented to any one category of our business. And we think, again, that approach has yielded really strong returns. It's allowed us to meet the demand expectations that exist in the market. And it's also responded to our physicians in a way that created the capacity or allowed for the clinical technology that they need to practice their medicine."", ""So, we're stepping it up because we have a growing occupancy on the inpatient side, and then we have opportunities in the outpatient side to expand our networks further in these fast-growing communities. That's pretty much the snapshot of it. But it's generally consistent from an allocation standpoint to prior years."", 'Operator', 'Great, thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with TD Cowen. Gary, please go ahead.', 'Gary Taylor -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', ""Hi, good morning. One clarification, and then I'll ask my real question. I just want to make sure I understood what Bill said -- and congrats to Bill by the way. You were walking through the net Medicaid DPP EBITDA outlook for '24."", ""And I think you said, overall, you're expecting that dollars to come down 100 million to 200 million. I want to make sure I had that correct. And then, my real question was just, you talked about stemming the Valesco operating losses sequentially to more in line with what you originally thought, which I think means maybe brings that down to sort of breakeven in the quarter. And I was just hoping you'd share with us a little bit about how operationally you pulled that off."", 'Bill Rutherford -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, Gary, this is Bill. Thanks for those comments. Let's start with DPP. You are correct in my comments."", ""We are expecting, overall, when we aggregate all the programs to potentially be a headwind, anywhere between 100 million and 200 million, largely due to settlements that we received this year, we don't expect to reoccur. And then, the Florida beginning accrual had an impact to that. So, that's what's mostly driving that across our multiple programs. On Valesco, as we mentioned, it came in line with our expectations, which I think last quarter, we sized just under 50 million or so a quarter."", ""As we continue to work on multiple improvement initiatives, including further integrating that joint venture into HCA, we expect to see continued improvement going forward. Next year, I think Valesco, for the full year, we equate with about the same amount we recorded this year, but we had nine months this year versus 12 months obviously in 2024. So, we do believe, over time, there will be continued improvement, and we're working diligently toward those efforts."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian, please go ahead.', 'Brian Tanquilut -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""Hey, good morning, and, Bill, congrats on a very successful career at HCA. I guess my question to follow up on Gary's, you know, maybe expanding it further to the broader labor outlook, how are you thinking about, you know, the opportunity to further reduce spending on both nursing and, obviously, Valesco? Or maybe another way to ask it is how are you viewing inflation at the wage level? Thank you."", 'Bill Rutherford -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Well, I think we've proven that teams have managed through that very well during the inflationary period we experienced. I think, going forward, we expect to move back into kind of normal trends, which is generally 2.5% to 3% of wage inflation going forward. And then, we believe there's continued improvement in contract labor to be achieved, and we have plans to execute that throughout 2024. On the professional fees, in Valesco, we have a number of initiatives with teams working on that to not only further integrate into our operations, but to continue to figure out, you know, adjustments to those programs."", ""Our professional fees, I've talked to, we have seen a decline in the sequential rate of growth, so we're a bit encouraged with that. As we go into '24, we would expect those sequential declines to continue. And we're working hard through multiple initiatives, whether it be revenue enhancements, program adjustments, or looking at opportunities to internalize some of those programs."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho. Ann, please go ahead.', 'Ann Hynes -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst', 'Good morning. Thank you. And I also want to congratulate Bill on his retirement. I just have a couple of follow-ups, just on the managed care pricing yield assumptions for 2024, which is up 2% to 3%, which looks a little conservative, given the two-midnight rule and when you look at Medicaid determinations.', 'The growth in the health exchange in your states are very strong. So, in your guidance, do you embed any benefit from the two-midnight rule or kind of the shift from Medicaid potentially to commercial? And then, secondly, if you can just maybe give us some more detail about how the two-midnight rule could impact you, maybe a percent of our emissions, or maybe kind of a differential between revenue per minute would be great. Thanks.', 'Bill Rutherford -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, and this is Bill. Let me first clarify, the 2% to 3% mentioned is our aggregated revenue per equivalent emission. And then, obviously, there's categories underneath it. I would tell you, regarding Medicaid redetermination, still early."", ""We believe there's some modest benefit that we've seen as patients have migrated from Medicaid into HICS and other employer-sponsored. I don't believe that's material yet. We'll see how that continues to trend throughout 2024. And I would say, we don't have a material amount factored into our guidance on that."", ""On the two-midnight rule, you know, as we said earlier, it is really early in that progression. It should be positive for us if it's implemented as expected. I think it will be positive for patients over time as well, and we'll just have to see how that plays out. But we don't have, I'd say, a material adjustment factored into our '24 numbers for that as well."", ""Our range of guidance, I think, accommodates for, you know, various outcomes on both of those programs, and we'll see how that plays out as we go through the first part of the year."", 'Operator', 'Great, thank you. [Operator instructions] And our next question comes from Whit Mayo with Leerink Partners. Whit, please go ahead.', 'Whit Mayo -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst', ""Thanks, and congrats to Bill. I think this might be the second time you've retired. So, I hope it sticks. But my question really, Sam, is I'm curious on any new expense initiatives that you guys have elevated internally as a new strategic focus."", ""Anything maybe more creative or imaginative that you're bringing forth this year to challenge the organization? Thanks."", 'Sam Hazen -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, at our investor day, Mike Marks presented our financial resiliency program, and it's got different components to it. There's, you know, more sophisticated integration of our revenue cycle that includes our case management initiative, which I will highlight here. Our case management initiative is to make sure that our patients get into the right setting in the right timeline and free up capacity where appropriate and so forth. This past year, we had early stage success with that."", ""Our length of stay was down and our case mix was modestly up. So, when you put the two together, it's a good start for us with respect to our case management initiative. That is important on multiple fronts. It allows us to allocate our nurse staffing more effectively to more acute patients and so forth."", ""We will continue to invest in that initiative as we bring on more technology, more structure to our teams, and better process and benchmarking. The second thing I would highlight is with respect to what we're calling our internal benchmarking initiative, we have incredible opportunities to compare more deeply into our organization, whether it's on the variable cost side with respect to what we allocate and distribute to our facilities, or on fixed costs. And both of those categories are getting a lot more benchmarking under Mike's leadership. And we're finding opportunities to rethink how we organize our cost structure, how we leverage process improvement, how we use technology and automation in those areas to improve processes and variable costs."", ""So, I'm excited about the prospects there. As I mentioned in my commentary, we had a very successful transition from the third quarter to the fourth quarter with respect to what we call clearance operating leverage. And our operating leverage from the third quarter to the fourth quarter was the best I'd seen in my experiences with the company. And I think part of that, not all of that, is due to some of these initiatives and the transparency we have around our efforts to, you know, improve efficiencies, improve clinical outcomes for our patients, and so forth."", ""So, those are two things I would highlight. Obviously, our technology agenda and our care transformation is a longer-run effort with respect to improved outcomes across different dimensions of our business, and we've had some modest success there in the short run. But we're really banking on those programs giving us long-term value. So, those are just a couple of highlights with."", ""I will tell you our teams culturally are disciplined. And as I mentioned, that discipline creates opportunities for us to find better ways to do things for all of our stakeholders. And that mindset is something that we carry forward from one year to the next, and we'll carry that on into '24 on into '25 and so forth. And we think it's an essential ingredient for a health system's success."", ""And I'm pretty proud of our teams and how they embrace that and how they execute on the initiatives to make that happen."", 'Operator', 'Thanks, Whit. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin, please go ahead.', 'Kevin Fischbeck -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Great, thanks. And I'll just add my thanks to Bill for your help over the years. I guess I wanted to know -- get a little more color from you guys about the volume expectation for 2024 because it's -- you guys normally talk about 2% to 3% if you're looking for faster growth in '24. So, I just wanted to better understand, you know, where that extra growth is coming from."", ""So, any color on the service lines or procedures that you think still have room to grow above average and if there's anything that you expect from a payer mix perspective in '24? Is there one type of payer where you think there's a big opportunity for volumes to snap back? Thanks."", 'Bill Rutherford -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, Kevin, let me start and then Sam can add in. So, you know, we're going off our experience we've seen throughout '23. And as we said earlier in the comments, we thought there was very strong demand for services in our markets. We think our capital programs and our program initiatives are paying off."", ""Our adjusted admissions this year were 4.8%. You're right, our guidance next year, you know, called us for 3% to 4% expectation on adjusted admissions that may be a little higher than our 2% to 3% historical. But I think we're reading continued strong demand. We saw really strong enrollment in the health insurance exchanges across our states, and that continues to be a favorable development for us."", ""We believe we continue to see strong economic indicators and employments and our access to contracted lives remain well. So, I think all of those factors go into play with our expectations for '24 and is based on kind of our current experience."", 'Operator', 'Great. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Stephen, please go ahead.', 'Stephen Baxter -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""Yeah, hi. Thanks. And congrats to Bill as well. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about surgical growth in the quarter, whether there's any notable puts or takes there by service line or inpatient versus outpatient."", ""And then, I guess the overall growth slowed down a little bit as we got to the back half of the year. I guess, how are you thinking about surgical growth in 2024 and especially coming up against maybe some of the tougher comparisons that you'll have in the first half of the year? Thank you."", 'Sam Hazen -- Chief Executive Officer', 'So, you know, overall, the fourth quarter surgery was a little slower than the year-to-date, and we were talking about that earlier this morning. We did have a more difficult December calendar, even though, we had the same surgical days in total. The way they were allocated created some challenges in our outpatient settings. And we saw, you know, outpatient activity not as strong as in the previous two months of the quarter.', ""But at a structural level, there's nothing to suggest that our surgical volume trends are going to change. For the year, we had really solid volume growth in surgeries. And we continue to invest heavily in our programs, both on the outpatient side and supporting our inpatient activity with more acute and complex program offerings. And for the year, our inpatient surgeries were up two and our outpatient surgeries were up 2.5."", ""So, a slight migration, if you will, into the outpatient setting. And we think that will be, you know, generally consistent as we push into 2024. We do have a number of ambulatory surgery centers that have opened or will open in 2024. We've made a few acquisitions in certain markets with ambulatory surgery centers."", ""And we continue to invest in our hospital operating suites, as well as improve our processes just as we are improving our emergency room processes with our revitalization program. And we think that will continue to be a value add for our patients and for our physicians and help us with our volume pursuits. So, that's how we're judging the surgical space. If you look at cardiac underneath that, our cardiac volumes continue to grow very robust and are actually growing in the mid single digits."", ""And we think, again, that's reflective of our overall program development, expansion into new service lines underneath cardiac and responding again to our patient needs and physician needs in ways that we believe are productive for our organization."", 'Operator', 'Excellent. Our next caller -- excuse me. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Cassorla with Citi Group. Jason, please go ahead.', 'Jason Cassorla -- Citi -- Analyst', 'Yeah, great. Thanks for taking my question, and best of luck in your retirement, Bill. I just wanted to follow up on the professional fee environment. You noted there was some deceleration in professional fee spent growth, if I heard that correctly.', 'But maybe what is your expectation for physician costs or professional fees growth embedded within 2024 guidance? And then, on Valesco, it sounds like from your comments, Bill, that Valesco would generate 150 million of negative EBITDA next year versus the 200 million or so headwind for 2023. Is that a fair way to look at it? Or, you know, any other color that would be great. Thanks.', 'Bill Rutherford -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. Let me add in and thanks for that. I think Valesco is a little lower. We're about 150 million on both years."", 'But obviously, in 2023, we add a nine months versus 12 months next year. So, we see a kind of run rate improvement as we go through the quarters during the year. On pro fees, we, as we said, have seen, you know, a decline in the sequential rate of growth. We have multiple initiatives underway.', ""Embedded in our guidance next year is, you know, holding that professional fee growth, perhaps, to 8% to 10% versus this year where it's been closer to 15% to 20%. So, we are looking for a step change, and we're confident in our initiatives and the activities we have to be able to begin to bend that trend line."", 'Operator', 'Great. Thanks, Jason. And our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Scott, please go ahead.', 'Scott Fidel -- Stephens, Inc. -- Analyst', ""Hi, thanks, and I'll echo my congrats to Bill. And then, my question is, would be curious in terms of how you're thinking about the whole broader debate on just the pent-up demand recovery in the seniors population. And based on all your data and analysis, sort of where you think, you know, the Medicare utilization trends are now at this point relative to sort of pre-pandemic levels and returning to the baseline. I certainly felt like there was, you know, some quite a bit of that recovery played out in 2023, but interested in sort of what inning you think we may be in that process at this point."", 'Thanks.', 'Sam Hazen -- Chief Executive Officer', ""This is Sam. It's interesting. I'm just looking at a trend line here, and I don't have it beyond this time period. But in 2019, this is a composite view of Medicare."", 'So, it has both Medicare and Medicare Advantage. Our Medicare admissions grew 2.6%. You throw out 2020. And 2021 grew 2.1%, 2022 grew 3.4%, and 2023 grew 4%.', ""So, you know, is there acceleration on our trend? Yes. Obviously, there's aging baby boomers in the mix there, number one. Number two, we think we're taking out market share. So, to judge overall utilization patterns around that is really difficult for us."", ""There's population growth in our markets. When you look at adjusted admissions on the same combination payer class, again, 3.7% in 2019, 5.3% in 2021, 4.7% in 2022, and 5.7% in 2023. So, a slight acceleration, but a function, we believe, you know, aging baby boomers and a number of beneficiaries moving in the program, population growth for us in market share gains. So, it's hard for us to judge underneath that whether or not there's some structural change in utilization."", ""That's almost impossible for us to discern with the data that we have."", 'Operator', 'Great.

Sarah, please go ahead.', 'Sarah James -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- Analyst', 'Congratulations on the retirement, Bill.', 'Bill Rutherford -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks.', 'Sarah James -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- Analyst', 'You guys said that the impact of the two-midnight rule ramps through the year, so it ramped as opposed to flipping a switch. What are the mechanics of that stage implementation? Is it retaining your staff? Or is it assuming some delay in benefit from claims denials and getting the payers on board? And then, when would it be fully ramped? Are you talking midyear exiting 2024? And is there anything that HCA can do to pull that forward?', 'Bill Rutherford -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Well, I mean, the rule goes in effect in January. So, I think the impact may ramp over time. It's a notable change for the payers. So, we're working them very closely on the administration of those plans and making sure it's operating as described on there."", ""And if it does, we should see it, you know, equally throughout the year. And so, we're working closely on it, but it's a pretty big change for the payers. And so, there might be some administrative differences as it gets implemented through the year. But we hope, very quickly, we'll be able to work our way through that and begin to see some benefit as we go through 2024."", 'Operator', 'Thanks, Sarah. And our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Lance, please go ahead.', 'Lance Wilkes -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', ""Great, and congratulations to both Bill and Mike. Can you talk a little bit about labor supply that you're seeing? First, in the past a couple of quarters ago, I talked about like demand that have been turned away at the hospitals, if you could just note if there's still any of that. And then, how kind of hiring pipelines and are there particular areas that are more plentiful or areas that might be bottlenecks? Thanks."", 'Sam Hazen -- Chief Executive Officer', ""This is Sam again. Thank you for the question. We finished the year roughly, I don't have the exact average here, at 90% acceptance rate. In other words, we weren't able to take roughly 10% of the patients who were referred to us through our transfer centers and such."", ""That improved throughout the year as we went from maybe the mid to high in the first part of the year, to a little better than that in the second half of the year. We're still below where we were in 2019. But what we have seen is more patients coming through our transfer centers and other patient navigation program that we did in 2019. So, we feel good about the inflow, if you will."", ""We are still, at times, in situations where all of our capacity is not open and available, and that's what generates these situations where we can't receive the patients that are coming through these navigation programs and transfer centers. We think that will continue to get better in '24 as we have capital coming online, as our hiring patterns continue to improve. Our turnover, as I mentioned in my commentary, has also improved. We've been very intentional in trying to create a great environment for our people with good leadership, resource capabilities, and just overall trading to support the efforts so that they can be successful in what they do."", 'And we think that will help us push through 2024 and hopefully have more capacity available and be able to receive the patients that want to get into our system.', 'Operator', 'Great.

Or are you getting to a point where the returns are coming in a little bit lower for the incremental project as you sort of continue to go down the list? Thanks."", 'Bill Rutherford -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Josh, this is Bill. I'll start on the returns. Our returns remain very solid. I mean, we're in the upper-teens returns."", ""We have a very disciplined process where we evaluate these projects, and we actually do look backs to validate some of our assumptions. And to me, the growth in the capital spending is a reflection of the growth of the opportunities we see to deploy capital to continue that growth. So, we're very pleased with the returns on those. I think as Sam mentioned earlier in the Q&A, the mix between inpatient and outpatient, you know, it varies from time to time, but mostly similar."", ""We do have some newer outpatient facilities coming on. They generally have very good returns and quick returns when they do come online. So, I think the capital program, we're pleased with. It's an important component to our growth formula, as we've talked about, and we're pleased with the overall returns in the interview."", 'Sam Hazen -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. And the only thing I would say, and Bill alluded to this, you know, our outpatient platform tends to be short-cycle returns. We get a real efficient sort of capital allocation with outpatient facilities. And then, on the hospital side, we are a hospital-centric health system.', ""And as we invest in our hospitals, those are long-lived assets, and they have a longer cycle to them with respect to returns, but they're critically important to the overall value that our outpatient facilities can generate for our system in the sense that we're able to navigate the patient further into the healthcare system if they need more acute care offerings. So, we have to look at it in both manners. I think to Bill's point, we have had strong returns, a pattern of strong returns. We have occupancy on our inpatient hospital side in the low-70%, which is a pretty high occupancy level, up over where it was pre-pandemic even with the additional beds that we've added."", 'So, we think the network model that we highlighted for you all at the investor day is working and is complemented by the outpatient facilities integrated with the hospital system in a manner that produces really positive enterprise returns for our company.', 'Operator', 'Great. Thanks, Josh. And our final question comes from the line of Cal Sternick with JPMorgan. Cal, please go ahead.', 'Calvin Sternick -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in, and I'll add my congratulations to Bill as well. So, two follow-ups. First, on the redeterminations, it sounds like that's a slight benefit to the 2024 guide but not really material yet. Just wanted to clarify if this does develop better than you're anticipating."", ""Is it something you think could be material to 2024? Or is the upside, you know, more annualized in 2025 by -- after the redeterminations are completed? And then my other question was on the quarter itself. So, one of the payers called out higher COVID inpatient costs per case. Can you talk about the COVID acuity levels that you saw in the quarter and whether that developed consistently with what you've seen in the past?"", 'Bill Rutherford -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah. This is Bill. Let me start with the Medicaid redetermination. I think your characteristic is right.', ""We do see some modest benefit in 2024. We haven't adjusted to be material yet, but our range of guidance allows for some outcomes on there. We started to see some of the effects of those redeterminations late in 2023. We're tracking those very closely."", ""We're seeing roughly 30% to 35% of those individuals that were potentially on Medicaid seem to show up with either HICS or employer-sponsored coverage, so that there's some benefit in that. We're seeing a decently large number being able to be reapplied into Medicaid because some were redetermined off for technical reasons. So, we've been able to manage through that. And I think with the conversion into either HICS or employer-sponsored, there is some modest benefit as we go through the year."", ""And potentially, that will continue as we go through 2024. But don't judge it yet to be material at this stage. You know, regarding COVID, to be honest with you, we haven't -- COVID is really been stable for us over the past year. In total, our COVID admissions are roughly 2% of our total admissions."", ""I don't really have any data on acuity, but I think it's very, very stable and hasn't really been a material factor in our overall operating results of late."", 'Operator', 'Great. Thanks all. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it over to Frank for closing remarks.', 'Frank, the floor is yours.', 'Frank Morgan -- Vice President, Investor Relations', ""Sure. Great. Thank you for your help today, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call. Hope you have a wonderful week, and we'll be around this afternoon and the balance of the week if we can answer any additional questions you might have."", 'Have a good day.', 'Operator', ""And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call.

We're gonna start off with PayPal rising higher as the company-- well, now we're ticking lower by about 2/10 of a percent. Headlines, that's going to reduce its workforce by about 9% this year, as chief executive officer, Alex Chriss, looks to cut costs and improve profits."", ""So that's the headline we're seeing here, Julie. PayPal will reduce its workforce by about 9% in a letter to staff on Tuesday. This per Bloomberg, Chriss saying the decision was made to rightsize the company. Affected staff apparently are going to be notified by the end of the week. We saw a similar round of cuts last year in this time, last January. And [INAUDIBLE] is going to affect about 2,500 workers."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and we've been talking a lot about cuts recently, haven't we? You said the shares rose because they did rise, initially, after this headline came out, and then they kind of dipped back down again, maybe because PayPal has a lot of issues before it in the eyes of investors."", ""We also learned today that Block was cutting jobs, the artist formerly known as Square. It has a goal to cap its workforce at 12,000 people. And so that's why it was doing its cuts. We talked earlier about UPS, which announced cuts of 12,000 workers. So in other words, it's cutting the same number of workers that Block wants to cap its workforce at, which just shows you the size of UPS."", ""What struck me in the UPS announcement is, CEO Carol Tomé said, those workers are never coming back. This is not a temporary reduction. It's sort of a secular permanent change in the way they do business, that they want to be more efficient and use technology more. But it's just interesting in the context of all of these other cuts, all of these companies just really focusing on efficiency, and not in the case of UBS, but in a lot of these cases, being rewarded by investors."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, and PayPal specifically was interesting. We always talk about the kind of idiosyncratic puts and takes. I mean, PayPal is an interesting one. And we've talked a lot about this name because you do have a new CEO, Alex Chriss, named CEO over the summer. And we've talked about how the Street has actually become gradually more cautious on this name. You have seen a number of recent downgrades for different reasons, whether it's competition or pressure on profitability. But the stock, it's up about 4% or 5% this year, but still down about 20% over the last 12 months."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, definitely. Let's move to the oil patch, shall we? Shares of Schlumberger slipping today after Aramco, the Saudi Arabian oil company, said the Saudi government has ordered it to not ramp up its oil production capacity. Aramco said it had been working to increase its production capacity to 13 million barrels a day. Schlumberger and the other oil field services providers falling on the news. Now, why is this a big deal? Well, first of all, Saudi Aramco is huge."", 'JOSH LIPTON: It is the largest oil company on the planet.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Exactly. Secondly, this is a big reversal for the company. It had been planning to boost capacity. Now it's planning to draw back. So there are lots of implications. Obviously, there are implications for these companies and demand for their products, and there are implications for what the Saudi Kingdom believes is the long-term demand for oil, which is quite interesting."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, I mean, I thought it was a [INAUDIBLE] because, one, as you put it, Julie, the first question is, OK, that's really interesting, how the Kingdom is thinking about what global oil demand looks like in the future. Also, where the Kingdom is putting money to work. You know, I mean, crude is, of course, listen, it's still foundational, obviously, to the Saudi economy."", ""But we know they've been expanding natural gas, chemicals, right, renewables. Bloomberg, by the way, citing sources. It says it's those businesses I just named likely get a share of the money saved from the oil capacity expansion. So there are a lot of different, interesting threads. I would say, listen, Schlumberger got hit on this news, but a number of names did, too. Halliburton, I saw down. Baker Hughes as well."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, Weatherford as well. Yeah, really interesting story.', ""JOSH LIPTON: One to watch for sure. All right, let's finish it out here. Super Micro Computer shares surging today. Look at that pop. That's after earnings beat on the top and bottom lines. Company also raising guidance for the full year."", 'A couple interesting-- so obviously, the server maker here, they reported investors liked what they saw. Q2 net sales, 3.66 billion, Julie. That was a beat. They raised their revenue estimate for the year. They now, it looks like, see fiscal year revenue between $14.3 and $14.7 billion. Big move already this year. I mean, this stock jumped not only this year, but this follows a jump of about 235% in 2023.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Wow. This comment from the analysts at Barclays stood out to me. They said, one of the takeaways from the call with management is that AI demand is still outstripping supply, which, obviously, has potential takeaways for AMD, which reports after the close today, NVIDIA, and many of the other server and semiconductor companies that are servicing this booming AI universe, if you will. So we'll see if, indeed, there's the followthrough."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, and other analysts were saying, Julie-- I saw some notes-- yes, very strong demand with this name. No doubt you're seeing the reaction. How much is already priced in, they were asking, is worth noting after the kind of ramp you saw here."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Always a good question.']"

The company originally announced the plan in September, saying that \u200b\u200bit was needed, “to continue investing in compelling content and keep increasing that investment.”', 'Amazon claimed in its original announcement that Prime Video will show fewer ads than regular TV or other streaming services, but those who want to avoid them altogether will have to pay an additional $2.99 per month on top of the $14.99 monthly fee that already exists.', ""The change comes as the company has increased the amount it spends on content to fill out its Prime offerings. In 2022, the company finalized founder Jeff Bezos's $8.5 billion purchase of MGM, in what was its second-most expensive acquisition at the time. Since then, Amazon has beefed up spending, including a $16 billion splurge on content in 2022, $7 billion of which went to original programming."", 'In the third quarter of 2023, the company’s most recent earnings report, Amazon made just over $10 billion from its subscription services unit, which includes Prime and other non-Amazon Web Services subscription services in digital video, audiobooks, digital music, and e-books. Experts predict that the new changes to Prime Video could provide an added boost.', 'Analysts at Morgan Stanley predict that the company’s changes could bring in an extra $3.3 billion in advertising revenue in 2024. Meanwhile, New York–based media investment firm MoffettNathanson had lower predictions but still said Amazon will bring in $1.3 billion from advertisers in 2024 and another $2.3 billion next year.', 'The company is predicting that 159 million of its subscribers will immediately be exposed to ads on the platform, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an internal presentation Amazon made for potential advertisers. That number may be enticing to companies looking to reach more eyeballs, as it beats out the 23 million monthly active users that are exposed to ads on market leader Netflix’s platform.', 'Still, Prime customers are mostly unhappy about the change and have taken to social media to complain about the new ads on the platform. Many have chalked up Prime’s ads rollout to corporate greed.', 'Prime video now has ads???@amazon @PrimeVideo why are you so greedy? #cancelprime pic.twitter.com/FjtKDGwnTS', '— Ray Meyer (@rmeyer1126) January 30, 2024', ""I'm disappointed to hear that Amazon Prime Video is introducing ads. It's a paid subscription service, and I expect an ad-free experience. This move may push users to explore other platforms."", '— mariana velaz (@maribella343) January 26, 2024', 'Although customers are not happy with the new change, Wall Street’s push for profitability in streaming has caused companies to adapt their earlier business models. In December 2022, Disney+ introduced an ad-supported tier at the same time that it announced a $3 monthly price hike for its ad-free plan. It then hiked prices another $3 per month in August.', ""Netflix, which at 260 million subscribers worldwide has more than double the customers of any other streaming service, cracked down on password sharing, along with debuting its own advertising tier, in a bid to improve profitability. These helped Netflix, which is emerging as the undisputed winner of the streaming wars, crush its last earnings with the biggest boost of new subscribers since the pandemic. Of course, Netflix kicked off streaming's pivot from growth to profitability by reporting a subscriber drop in 2022, contributing to the flood of advertising into streaming, now including Amazon Prime."", 'While the percentage of U.S. households that subscribe to streaming services had stayed between 80% and 83% each quarter for the past two years, the end of 2023 saw that number jump to 85%, exceeding expectations and spurring hopes that there is still more room to grow in the streaming sector.', 'Amazon did not respond to a request for comment from Fortune.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

These statements are not guarantees of future performance and you should not unduly rely on them as they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements include: fluctuations in NGL, crude oil, refined petroleum product and natural gas prices, and refining, marketing and petrochemical margins; changes in governmental policies or laws that relate to NGL, crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products, or renewable fuels that regulate profits, pricing, or taxation, or other regulations that limit or restrict refining, marketing and midstream operations or restrict exports; the effects of any widespread public health crisis and its negative impact on commercial activity and demand for refined petroleum products; our ability to timely obtain or maintain permits necessary for capital projects; changes to worldwide government policies relating to renewable fuels and greenhouse gas emissions that adversely affect programs including the renewable fuel standards program, low carbon fuel standards and tax credits for biofuels; our ability to achieve the expected benefits of the integration of DCP Midstream, LP (DCP), including the realization of synergies; the success of the company’s business transformation initiatives and the realization of savings and cost reductions from actions taken in connection therewith; unexpected changes in costs for constructing, modifying or operating our facilities; our ability to successfully complete, or any material delay in the completion of, asset dispositions or acquisitions that we may pursue; unexpected difficulties in manufacturing, refining or transporting our products; the level and success of drilling and production volumes around our midstream assets; risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions of actual or potential competitive suppliers and transporters of refined petroleum products, renewable fuels or specialty products; lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our NGL, crude oil, natural gas, and refined products; potential liability from litigation or for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations under environmental regulations; failure to complete construction of capital projects on time and within budget; our ability to comply with governmental regulations or make capital expenditures to maintain compliance with laws; limited access to capital or significantly higher cost of capital related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets, which may also impact our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends; potential disruption of our operations due to accidents, weather events, including as a result of climate change, acts of terrorism or cyberattacks; general domestic and international economic and political developments including armed hostilities (including the Russia-Ukraine war), expropriation of assets, and other political, economic or diplomatic developments; international monetary conditions and exchange controls; changes in estimates or projections used to assess fair value of intangible assets, goodwill and property and equipment and/or strategic decisions with respect to our asset portfolio that cause impairment charges; investments required, or reduced demand for products, as a result of environmental rules and regulations; changes in tax, environmental and other laws and regulations (including alternative energy mandates); political and societal concerns about climate change that could result in changes to our business or increase expenditures, including litigation-related expenses; the operation, financing and distribution decisions of equity affiliates we do not control; and other economic, business, competitive and/or regulatory factors affecting Phillips 66’s businesses generally as set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as estimated EBITDA plus the proportional share of selected equity affiliates’ estimated net interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization less the portion of estimated adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', ""This world's largest biotech drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.69 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.7%."", 'Revenues are expected to be $8.13 billion, up 18.9% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.05% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.

The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.10 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +121.3%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $3.89 billion, down 9.7% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS)."", ""ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' View our latest analysis for Zoetis ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Zoetis is:', '45% = US$2.3b ÷ US$5.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.45 in profit."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Zoetis has a higher ROE than the average (11%) in the Pharmaceuticals industry.', ""That is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk."", ""Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used."", ""Zoetis clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.30. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it."", 'Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.', 'But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

This surge in EV sales is poised to drive significant growth in the Zacks Automotive – Foreign industry as cities and nations worldwide push for green energy transitions and deadlines to phase out fossil fuel vehicles. Notably, India, China, Japan and Europe experienced year-over-year growth in vehicle sales in 2023. The momentum is expected to continue in 2024, albeit at a possibly slower pace. The attractive valuation of the industry, trading at a discount compared to the S&P 500 and broader automotive sector, further bolsters its appeal. Prominent industry players such as BYD Co Ltd. BYDDY, BMW AG BMWYY and Honda HMC present compelling investment opportunities.', 'Industry Overview', 'Companies in the Zacks Automotive – Foreign industry are involved in designing, manufacturing and selling vehicles, components as well as production systems. The foreign automotive industry is highly dependent on business cycles and economic conditions. China, Japan, Germany and India are some of the key foreign automotive manufacturing countries. The widespread usage of technology is resulting in a fundamental restructuring of the market. Stricter emission and fuel-economy targets, the ramp-up of charging infrastructure as well as supportive government policies are boosting sales of green vehicles. With almost all firms intensifying their electrification game, competition is getting tougher with each passing day. Foreign automakers are now actively engaged in the R&D of electric and autonomous vehicles, fuel efficiency and low-emission technologies.', 'Things to Consider', 'EU Car Market Navigating Challenges Amid Growth Prospects: The European car market displays a cautiously optimistic outlook for 2024. New car registrations in the European Union (EU) rose 13.9% in 2023, reaching 10.5 million units. Although sales are anticipated to continue their upward trajectory this year, the pace of growth is projected to moderate compared to the previous year. According to GlobalData, sedan and SUV sales in Western Europe are forecast to rise 5.5% in 2024. S&P Global Mobility predicts a 2.9% year-over-year increase in auto sales in the Western and Central European markets. Despite the expected growth, factors that may contribute to a slower pace include the looming risks of economic recession, tighter credit conditions, the gradual release of pent-up demand, persistent high car prices and the gradual reduction of electric vehicle (EV) subsidies. So, looking ahead, while the European car market is poised for further expansion, the momentum is likely to be tempered by various economic and industry-specific challenges.', ""India's Continued Car Market Growth: In 2023, India maintained its position as the world's third-largest automotive market, staying ahead of Japan for the second consecutive year. India's growing population, economic growth, and rising motorization have propelled its passenger vehicle industry to secure the third position globally in volumes, trailing only China and the United States. India’s burgeoning middle class, increasing disposable incomes, improved road infrastructure and accessible financing are escalating demand for automobiles.\xa0 Amid robust demand and supply chain enhancements, India's passenger vehicle market achieved a significant milestone in 2023 by surpassing 4 million units for the first time. The SUV segment dominated with a 48.7% share in 2023 and is projected to maintain strength, potentially increasing to 52-53% this year. Industry executives anticipate growth in the domestic car market in 2024, albeit subdued to single digit growth rate."", ""China's EV-Driven Auto Market Momentum: In 2023, China's vehicle sales rose 12% year on year to reach 30.1 million units, per the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. In 2024, the market is expected to maintain momentum, buoyed by pent-up demand and a gradual restoration of consumer confidence, which is yet to fully return to pre-pandemic levels. S&P Mobility forecasts a 4.2% increase in demand for the year. Specifically, the EV sector in China is experiencing robust activity. The affordability of new energy vehicles (NEVs) in China is anticipated to improve further in 2024, with local battery cell prices already witnessing significant declines throughout 2023. Combined with the extension of NEV tax exemptions into 2024-2025, the penetration of NEVs as a percentage of passenger vehicles is projected to rise to 44% in 2024, up from 36% in 2023."", ""Japan’s Auto Market Recovery Amid EV Transition Hurdles: In 2023, total passenger car sales in Japan reached 3.99 million vehicles, marking a significant 15.6% year-over-year increase. This signals a promising turnaround following four consecutive years of contraction. The easing of the global semiconductor shortage played a pivotal role in Japan's car sales recovery, with the Honda N-Box retaining its position as the most popular passenger car. Additionally, EV sales surged 50% in 2023. While government subsidies for EVs and charging stations will serve as incentives for buyers, sales growth of zero-emission vehicles is expected to be gradual compared to regions like the United States and Europe, where government regulations actively drive EV adoption to support the automotive industry. Also, stimulating EV sales in Japan is a little challenging due to the dominance of hybrid cars, which effectively meet consumer demand, diverting potential interest away from EVs."", 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Rosy Prospects', 'The Zacks Automotive – Foreign industry within the broader Zacks\xa0Auto-Tires-Trucks\xa0sector currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #63, which places it in the top 25% of around 250 Zacks industries.', 'The group’s\xa0Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates decent near-term prospects.

Some products offered include frozen whole chicken, primary pork cuts, salads, sandwiches and meatballs.', 'Major Trends Shaping the Future of the Meat Food Industry', ""Protein Demand Rises, Plant-Based Meat Gains Traction: Increased inclination toward protein-rich sustenance has been proving advantageous for meat companies, which have continuously enhanced their product lines through innovative approaches. In recent years, the popularity of meatless alternatives and plant-based meat substitutes has been steadily increasing, driven by consumers' preference for fresh, healthier options over traditional meat products. Most plant-based food alternatives are well-regarded for their reduced reliance on artificial ingredients and additives, making them a wholesome choice. These alternatives also serve as valuable sources of protein for those following vegan dietary practices. Industry experts believe that plant-based protein could lead to significant disruptions in the traditional meat market.Robust Expansion Strategies: Companies in the industry are actively engaged in initiatives aimed at diversifying their product portfolios and fortifying their position in the market through strategic collaborations, acquisitions and capacity expansion efforts. As part of these endeavors, businesses are looking for opportunities to bolster their manufacturing capabilities, such as establishing new production facilities, enlarging existing plants and entering into partnerships with co-manufacturers. Concurrently, select companies are making investments in automation technology, with a keen focus on accelerating the digitalization process. Additionally, some players are directing their efforts toward entering international markets, a strategy that is yielding favorable results.Challenges in the Beef Segment: The beef segment is battling numerous challenges in 2024, including consumer caution, economic uncertainties, shifting preferences and reduced production. The segment is likely to continue witnessing consumer caution on account of the sluggish global economic recovery post the pandemic. Consumers, particularly, are shifting toward value-for-money products over premium ones due to heightened caution. This is likely to dampen demand for more expensive cuts of beef, leading to soft sales and revenues for producers. Additionally, the beef segment is undergoing a significant decline in production, which is resulting in elevated retail prices for consumers. The reduced production is likely to put pressure on beef processors, leading to challenges in maintaining profitability throughout the supply chain.Ongoing Cost Concerns: High input costs have been a persistent issue for numerous participants in the meat food space, though the trend is moderating. Companies have been incurring elevated costs associated with raw materials, packaging, supplies, freight and logistics and labor. The continuation of inflationary pressures, along with increased operating expenditure, may strain margins."", 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid Prospects', 'The Zacks Food – Meat Products industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.', 'Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.', 'Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.', ""One stock to keep an eye on is Synchrony Financial (SYF). SYF is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 6.99. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 12.96. Over the past 52 weeks, SYF's Forward P/E has been as high as 7.45 and as low as 5.20, with a median of 6.30."", ""We also note that SYF holds a PEG ratio of 0.95. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. SYF's industry has an average PEG of 1.41 right now. Over the last 12 months, SYF's PEG has been as high as 1.78 and as low as 0.29, with a median of 1.41."", ""Another valuation metric that we should highlight is SYF's P/B ratio of 1.24. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.20. SYF's P/B has been as high as 1.40 and as low as 0.87, with a median of 1.09, over the past year."", ""Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. SYF has a P/S ratio of 0.78. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.8."", ""Finally, our model also underscores that SYF has a P/CF ratio of 6.14. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. SYF's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 14.49. Within the past 12 months, SYF's P/CF has been as high as 6.14 and as low as 3.66, with a median of 4.67."", ""These are just a handful of the figures considered in Synchrony Financial's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that SYF is an impressive value stock right now."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:MA) trades at approximately 31 times consensus 2024 earnings per share.

Based on current market prices, this position is worth roughly $1.6 billion.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with MA.', 'I agree with Buffett and believe that Mastercard is worth its premium valuation due to its wide moat and strong growth prospects.', 'Mastercard is the third-largest payments processing company globally with an estimated total market share of 24%. The global payments market is highly concentrated with the leading player, Visa (NYSE:V), having an estimated 39% market share. China-based UnionPay is the second-largest player globally with an estimated 34% market share. Outside of China, the payments network business is dominated by Visa and Mastercard as the vast majority of UnionPay volume is inside China.', ""In the U.S., Mastercard competes with smaller players such as American Express (NYSE:AXP), Capital One (NYSE:COF) and Discover (NYSE:DFS). However, the marketplace is dominated by Mastercard, Visa and American Express. For these reasons, the payment network business can be characterized as an oligopoly. This market structure results in a low degree of competition and high profit margins. The company's consistently high profit margins, which have averaged over 40% over the past 10 years, serve as evidence of the wide moat that Mastercard enjoys."", 'Barriers to entry for new players are very high in the card network business as it would require massive adoption among merchets to be competitive with the coverage of Visa or Mastercard networks.', 'The result of a low degree of existing competition and high barriers to entry is that Mastercard is a wide-moat business.', 'MA Data by GuruFocus', 'Mastercard has several key growth drivers, including annual increases in card spending due to economic growth and a continued transition toward spending on credit cards versus cash. Historically, nominal U.S. gross domestic product has grown at around 6%. Thus, assuming no increase in the proportion of transactions executed on cards versus cash, Mastercard should be able to grow revenue at 6%. Research conducted the Pew Research Center suggests that roughly 41% of Americans do not use cash for any of their purchases, while 44% of Americans still use cash for some of their purchases. This is a significant change from 2015, when it was estimated that roughly 24% of Americans did not use cash for any of their purchases while 51% of Americans did. Thus, while the trend away from cash has been growing, there is significant room for a further shift in spending volumes away from cash and toward cards.', ""Current consensus estimates call for Mastercard to report revenue growth of 12.20% in 2024, 13% in 2025 and 10.90% in 2026. I view these estimates as fairly reasonable given the company has grown revenue at an annual rate of roughly 11% over the past five years. Consensus estimates call for the company to report earnings per share growth of 16.90% for 2024, 18% for 2025 and 18.20% for 2026. I view these estimates as reasonable since the company has grown earnings per share over the past five years at an annual rate of roughly 18%. Earnings are likely to grow faster than revenue due to the impact of share repurchases and modest margin expansion. I view modest margin expansion as likely given that the company's cost base is unlikely to rise at the same pace as revenues since Mastercard has very little marginal costs for additional spend on its network."", 'Mastercard is currently trading at approximately 31 times forward earnings per share. This compares to its larger peer Visa, which trades at approximately 28 times forward earnings. I view this relative premium valuation as reasonable given that the company has historically experienced slightly better growth prospects due to a higher percentage of its volume being outside the U.S. compared to Visa. Mastercard is also expected to experience modestly better revenue and earnings per share growth than Visa over the next few years, which further supports the case that it should trade at a premium. For context, consensus estimates for 2024 to 2026 call for Visa to grow earnings per share at rates of 12.60%, 12.90% and 14.60%.', ""I also find Mastercard's premium valuation to the broader market as reasonable as it has better near-term growth prospects than the broader market. While consensus estimates call for the S&P 500 to grow earnings by roughly 12% for fiscal year 2024, I expect growth to moderate back toward historical norms of high single digits in the years that follow. I view 10% as a reasonable five-year earnings growth estimate for the S&P 500. Comparably, over the next five years, I believe Mastercard can grow earnings at a annual rate of 16%, which represents a small discount to the growth rate over the past five years. Thus, based on these growth estimates, the stock is trading at a forward PEG ratio of 1.90 while the broader market is trading at a PEG ratio of 2.10."", ""Mastercard's forward price-earnings ratio of 31 is also fairly attractive versus historical norms. Over the past few years, the stock has traded at an average forward price-earnings ratio of approximately 35. Over the past 10 years, it has traded at an average trailing price-earnings ratio of approximately 37. Thus, based on these metrics, I view the company's current valuation as attractive versus historical norms."", 'MA Data by GuruFocus', 'I believe the biggest risk to the Mastercard bull case is the potential for regulatory reform, which might limit how much card network operators can change or increase competition. For example, the proposed Credit Card Competition Act would require banks to give merchants a choice of two different network to process credit card transactions on. In response to this proposed legislation, Mastercard released a public letter to a number of U.S. Senators noting the proposed legislation would remove customer choice, erode security, eliminate rewards and prevent small businesses from investing in their future.', 'I view near-term passage of the Credit Card Competition Act unlikely given the other events, including wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, competing for time on the congressional agenda. That said, investors should continue to actively monitor the regulatory environment as it poses a key risk to the business over the longer term.', ""Mastercard trades at a premium valuation to the broader market and its closest peer. I view the premium as warranted given the company's wide-moat business and solid growth potential. Additionally, I view the modest valuation premium relative to Visa as appropriate given the fact Mastercard has modestly better growth prospects. The stock is trading at a discount to its historical valuation norms, which suggests it is undervalued relative to its own historical valuation norm."", 'The biggest risk facing the company is potential regulatory reform. However, I view this as unlikely given the current political climate.', 'For these reasons, I believe Mastercard is worthy of its premium valuation and view the shares as attractive currently.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

In fact, it's a common theme across the defense industry. For example, RTX's defense business, Raytheon, reported an adjusted operating profit margin of 9.2% in 2023, down from 9.9%, and its adjusted operating profit declined by $64 million in 2023.

Marshall', ""Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'm excited to speak with you today about PulteGroup's outstanding fourth quarter and full year financial results. Over the past few years, we have faced macro challenges ranging from COVID to supply chain disruptions to skyrocketing mortgage rates. Through it all, we remain disciplined and consistent in running our operations. But when needed, have quickly adjusted key business practices to position PulteGroup for ongoing success.The benefits of this approach can be seen in the strength of our reported results. Bob will detail our Q4 performance, so let me highlight several of our key operating and financial achievements for the full year of 2023. By strategically increasing our spec production, we had more inventory available to meet the demand of first-time homebuyers and those consumers worried about mortgage rate volatility. Increased house inventory was a critical support to PulteGroup delivering 28,600 homes in 2023 and record home sale revenues of $15.6 billion.In the face of increased cost for land, labor and materials, we carefully manage product offerings, pricing, incentives and absorption paces to maintain high profitability while ensuring we continue to turn our assets. The result, we reported outstanding full year gross margins of 29.3%, which helped drive a 6% increase in earnings per share to a record $11.72 per share and a 27% return on equity.We also continue to efficiently increase our land pipeline as we completed transactions to put approximately 40,000 new lots under control. Inclusive of these lots, 53% of our total land pipeline is under option, either with the land sellers or through our expanding land banking structures.Since making the decision to expand our use of land banking starting 15 months ago, we have placed approximately 25 communities, representing $1.5 billion worth of future land and development spend into such structures. And finally, consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities, we invested $4.3 billion in the business through land acquisition and development spend in 2023 and returned $1.2 billion to investors through share repurchases, dividends and debt paydown.Inclusive of our 2023 spend, we have repurchased almost half of the 2013 shares outstanding since initiating the program over a decade ago. By remaining consistent in our business practices and making market responsive adjustments where needed, we reported another year of exceptional financial results. I want to thank the entire PulteGroup team for their tireless efforts in support of delivering superior homes and experiences to our homebuyers while providing outstanding financial returns to our investors.Consistent with the broader housing market, we saw home buying demand being negatively impacted during the early part of the fourth quarter as 30-year mortgage rates increased toward their 2023 peak of 8%. We then saw a buyer sentiment and demand improved as mortgage rates finally rolled over, ultimately dropping more than 100 basis points as we move through November and December. The decline in rates helped drive our December net new orders and absorption pace to be the highest month in the quarter.The increased home buying activity in December was an important driver of the 57% increase in our Q4 net new orders and demonstrates the desire for homeownership remains high across all buyer groups. It remains our view that the long-term outlook for new home construction is extremely positive. A structural shortage of housing caused by years of underbuilding has only been exacerbated by a lack of supply -- lack of resale inventory as the owners are financially and/or emotionally locked into their low-rate mortgages.While the lack of existing home inventory will resolve itself over time, we believe that land entitlement and labor availability challenges mean it will be difficult to correct for the many years of underbuilding in this country. Given our constructive views on the outlook for housing demand, we are investing in our operations with the goal of growing unit volumes by 5% to 10% annually. Our decision to walk away from option lots as interest rates increased in 2022 will impact our community openings in 2024, leading to our growth this year being closer to the lower end of this range as we expect closings of approximately 30,000 homes in 2024.For those of you who have followed PulteGroup's story for the past few years, you know it's never been about growth for growth's sake. Our focus is always on investing in our business to build shareholder value so our objective is to grow our volumes while maintaining high returns on equity. To accomplish this, we must continue to intelligently invest in high-quality and high-returning projects while continuing to invest in our own assets through the ongoing repurchase of our stock.As we have demonstrated for much of the past decade, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flows that will allow us to fund our business investment, pay our dividend and return excess capital to our shareholders, all while maintaining our balance sheet strength and flexibility. Our expectation of continued financial success is reflected in this morning's announcement that our Board approved a $1.5 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization.With many forecasting interest rates to fall, the economy to stay relatively healthy and conditions in the job market to remain favorable, there are certainly reasons to be optimistic about housing demand in the coming years. Let me now turn over the call to Bob for a review of our fourth quarter results. Bob?"", 'Robert T. O’Shaughnessy', ""Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. As Ryan mentioned in his comments, market conditions changed meaningfully as the fourth quarter progressed and as mortgage rates begin to fall. Our reported financial results for the period were influenced by these evolving market dynamics, so I'll note any important areas of impact in my prepared remarks.Wholesale revenues in the fourth quarter were $4.2 billion compared with $5 billion in the prior year. Our lower home sale revenues for the period primarily reflects a 14% decrease in closings to 7,615 homes, along with a 2% decrease in our average sales price to $547,000. I would highlight that our fourth quarter closings came in about 5% below our previous guide as sales early in the quarter were negatively impacted by higher mortgage rates and the general softening in overall buyer demand.As Ryan noted, online demand accelerated in the back half of the quarter, but sales, particularly sales of finished spec homes that would close in the quarter finished below our assumptions. We could have captured incremental sales and closing value by offering higher incentives and we didn't see that as a worthwhile trade-off. Given that buyer trends have remained positive in January, I think we made the right choices as we have inventory available to meet the stronger demand.Our mix of closings in the quarter were comprised of 40% first-time, 36% move-up and 24% active-adult which is in alignment with our stated goal for the buyer mix for our business. In the fourth quarter of '22, closings were 36% first-time, 39% move-up and 25% active-adult. Our average community count for the fourth quarter was 919, which represents an 8% increase over last year's fourth quarter average of 850 communities and was in line with our prior guidance.Looking at order activity in the quarter, our net new orders increased 57% over last year to 6,214 homes. The large increase over last year reflects both improved demand in 2023, as well as the extremely difficult operating environment in the fourth quarter of 2022. As discussed previously, demand conditions grew increasingly difficult early in the fourth quarter this year as mortgage rates climbed to 8%. But we experienced a notable improvement in buying activity as rates decreased over the back half of the quarter. On a sequential basis, our absorption pace improved from November to December, and we would attribute much of this improvement to the decline in interest rates.Along with stronger demand conditions, the year-over-year increase in fourth quarter net new orders benefited from a decrease in cancellation rate. In the most recent quarter, cancellations as a percentage of beginning period backlog fell to 9%, down from 11% in the comparable prior year period.Looking at our order activity by buyer groups, fourth quarter net new orders increased 70% for first-time buyers, 78% for move-up buyers and 15% for active-adult buyers. Our order numbers indicate that demand improved across all buyer groups, which is a very positive dynamic when assessing potential housing demand in 2024.As a result of our sales and closings activity, our quarter end backlog was 12,146 homes, which is effectively flat with last year. Reflective of the increased mix of first-time buyers and their lower average sales prices, our ending backlog value declined slightly to $7.3 billion.Inclusive of the 7,128 homes we started in the fourth quarter, we ended the year with 16,889 homes in production. 44% of our production is spec, including 1,263 finished specs which puts us in a strong position to meet buyer demand as we head into the spring selling season. By the end of the fourth quarter, our construction cycle time was down to 130 days which is a sequential improvement of about 2 weeks from the end of the third quarter. Going forward, we continue to target getting our cycle time down to 100 days or below by the end of the year.Based on our production pipeline, we expect closings in the first quarter of 2024 to be between 6,200 and 6,600 homes. And given our units under production, we expect full year deliveries to grow by 5% to 30,000 homes. We currently expect the average sales price of closings to remain in the range of $540,000 to $550,000 for the first quarter and the full year of 2024 which is consistent with our fourth quarter pricing. At the midpoint, this would imply price stability over the course of the year.Our fourth quarter gross margin was 28.9%, which is down approximately 50 basis points from both the fourth quarter of last year and the third quarter of this year but likely remains the industry leader among the big builders. As with the entire year, our fourth quarter margins reflect higher incentive and input costs. Incentives, which primarily impact revenues, increased 50 basis points sequentially from the third quarter to 6.5%.On the cost side, lower lumber prices offset inflation and other material and labor, but higher land and land development costs impacted margins in the period. Given my prior comments that we expect pricing to be flat in 2024, we anticipate that land and house cost inflation will result in gross margins to be in the range of 28% to 28.5% for each quarter during the year.We reported fourth quarter SG&A expense of $308 million or 7.4% of home sale revenues compared with prior year SG&A expense of $351 million or 7.1%. The 30 basis point drop in overhead leverage can be attributed to the lower closings and revenues realized in the quarter versus the prior year. It should be noted that we reported $65 million of pretax insurance benefits in the fourth quarters of both 2023 and 2022.Based on anticipated closing volumes, we expect SG&A expense for the full year of 2024 to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues. Given our typical seasonality of closings, we expect SG&A expense in the first quarter to be approximately 10% of home sale revenues, with overhead leverage improving as we move through the remaining quarters of the year.For the fourth quarter, our financial services operations reported pretax income of $44 million, which is up from $24 million last year. The improvement in pretax income reflects more favorable market conditions across our financial services platform, coupled with higher capture rates, including an increase to 85%, up from 75% last year in our mortgage operations.Our reported pretax income for the most recent quarter was [$947 million] compared with prior year pretax income of [$1.2 billion] In the period, we recorded a tax expense of $236 million or an effective tax rate of 24.9%. Projecting ahead to 2024 we expect our full year tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%. Looking at the bottom line, our reported fourth quarter results showed net income of $711 million or $3.28 per share. In the comparable prior year period, we reported net income of $882 million or $3.85 per share. For the full year of 2023, we reported net income of $2.6 billion and a record earnings of $11.72 per share. Reflective of our strong operating results, in 2023, we generated cash flows from operations of $2.2 billion.Given our current expectations for operating and financial results, along with our plans to increase land investments of $5 billion in the coming year, we expect 2024 cash flows from operations to be approximately $1.8 billion.Turning to our investment and capital allocation activities. We invested $1.3 billion in land acquisition and development in the fourth quarter, of which 59% was for development of our existing land assets. For the year, our land investment totaled $4.3 billion, of which 59% was for development. Given our constructive views on near and longer-term housing dynamics, as noted, our plan is to increase our land spend to approximately $5 billion in 2024. We would again anticipate a roughly 60-40 split between development and land acquisition. This increase in investment is consistent with Ryan's earlier comments regarding positioning the business to routinely grow future delivery volumes by 5% to 10% per year.Inclusive of our fourth quarter investments, we ended 2023 with 223,000 lots under control, which is an increase of 5% over the prior year. I would highlight that on a year-over-year basis, we lowered our owned lot count by 4,000 lots, while increasing our lots under option by roughly 16,000 lots. As a result, our percentage of lots under option increased to 53%, up from 48% last year. There's still a lot of runway ahead of us to achieve our goal of 70% optioned lots, but we're moving in the right direction.Based on the investments we've made and our anticipated community openings and closings of 2024, we expect our average community count in 2024 to be up 3% to 5% in each quarter as compared to the comparable prior year period. Consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities, we continue to return capital to shareholders in 2023.To that end, we paid out $142 million in dividends and have increased our dividend per share by 25% starting in the first quarter of 2024. We also repurchased 13.8 million common shares at a cost of $1 billion or an average price of $72.50 per share, which included $300 million of repurchases at an average price of $83.03 per share in the fourth quarter. With the 13.8 million shares acquired in '23, we have repurchased approximately half of the shares outstanding at the time we initiated the program back in 2013. As we repurchased these shares at an average cost of $32.16 per share, we believe it's been a great investment for our shareholders.In addition to buying our stock in the fourth quarter, we took advantage of market conditions by using $35 million of cash on hand to pay down a portion of our debt. For all of 2023, we retired $101 million of our 2026 and 2027 senior notes through open market transactions, helping to lower our quarter end debt to capital ratio to 15.9%, down 280 basis points from last year. Adjusting for the $1.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet, we ended the year with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 1.1%. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments."", 'Ryan R. Marshall', ""Thanks, Bob. Successfully navigating our business through the past 12 months of rising interest rates has been challenging. The same could be said about the past 24, 36 and 48 month periods as we battle through COVID and the global collapse in supply chains. I am extremely proud of how our entire team responded to these events and the exceptional operating and financial results PulteGroup has delivered over an unprecedented period.Looking back over the 5-year period of 2019 to the just recently completed 2023, we grew volumes 5% annually and delivered just under 135,000 homes. To support our growth during this period and for future years, we invested almost $19 billion in cumulative land acquisition and development spend.Through our disciplined land investment, operational focus and organizational expertise, we capitalized on market conditions to grow earnings per share over this period at a compounded annual growth rate of 34%, while delivering an average annual return on equity of just over 26%. It's this type of strong financial performance during an extended period of market volatility that has prompted increased discussion about the need to reconsider how the large homebuilders are valued. I think that if you want to be valued differently, you must demonstrate a fundamental change in how you operate the business and the results you deliver. Not just for a year or 2, but over an extended period of time.What's different about the past 5 years is that while investing $19 billion into our operation, we also generated almost $7 billion in net cash flow from operations during the sustained period of growth. In fact, we recorded only 1 year of negative cash flow from operations since shifting our focus in 2012 from just top line growth to driving high returns over the housing cycle. We paid off $1.1 billion of debt, while cutting our leverage by more than half to end 2023 with a debt-to-capital ratio of 15.9% and a net debt-to-capital ratio of 1.1%. And we returned $4 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. I'd add that the reality is we've been operating our business in just this way for really the past 10 years.I know stocks reflect performance. So I believe that if we can continue to both grow our business and deliver ROE that remains among the industry leaders, while generating positive cash flow and maintaining a low-risk profile that our stock price and shareholders will ultimately be rewarded. Let me now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer."", 'James P. Zeumer', ""Great. Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. So [Mandeep], if you would explain the process, we'll get started."", 'Operator', ""The floor is now open for your questions. (Operator Instructions). We'll now take a moment to compile our roster. Our first question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt with BTIG."", 'Carl Edwin Reichardt', ""I wanted to ask a little bit more about January. Could you maybe expand on how business has been and what I'm really interested in is, have you seen enough traffic or sales rates to start to think about more broadly pulling incentives down or even starting to raise base across the footprint?"", 'Ryan R. Marshall', ""Carl, so Bob highlighted in the prepared remarks that -- specifically the Q4, October, November were really below expectations, and it was driven by high rates. We had a great December, highest month in the quarter in terms of absolute sales and absorption per community. So that was certainly an anomaly for typical December seasonal patterns. And the strength has really continued into January, Carl.So we're feeling pretty good about how the year is starting. In terms of kind of where it sets us up for reduced discounts, increased prices, we're going to watch it closely. And I think we've demonstrated through past behavior that we're always looking to find the sweet spot between pace and price. It won't come as a surprise to you, Carl, that affordability with the buyers remains a challenge. And so I think we're going to have to be thoughtful about what we do on both the incentive and the price increase front. But we're feeling pretty good about how the year started."", 'Carl Edwin Reichardt', ""All right. And then let me ask a couple of questions just on move-up. Obviously, the entry-level business has been strong for volumes. Move-up a number of your peers have kind of shifted some of their investments more towards the low end that's been going on for quite some time. Can you talk a little bit about how that -- how you look at that business this year? Is there any alteration in mix in terms of communities and whether or not maybe your can rate in that business is improving faster than the other businesses? We're trying to see if the existing housing markets unlocking enough that you can start to see even more strength in that particular segment."", 'Ryan R. Marshall', ""Yes. Carl, our move-up store business performed incredibly well in the quarter. We had -- on a year-over-year basis, the growth was north of 70%. So I think that segment performed very well. The margins out of our move-up as well as our Del Webb business continue to be some of our best gross margins. So we're seeing real financial strength there also. And then in terms of kind of community mix for Carl, we're kind of right in line with where our long-term strategic targets are in terms of kind of that part of our business being about 35% of our overall mix. So we feel pretty good about where that business is positioned."", 'Robert T. O’Shaughnessy', ""Yes. Just maybe another point of clarification that they not only were the sales strong. It was our strongest absorptions on a same-store basis. So that consumer actually has performed well to Ryan's point, strong margins and absorption."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays.', 'Matthew Adrien Bouley', ""Question on the high-level growth algorithm that you gave, Ryan, around the kind of 5% to 10% growth annually. You're talking to the low end of that this year because you walked away from some deals in 2022. So my question is, is this kind of sort of a 1-year whole, so to speak, and do you have the lands that you need today to kind of get back to your algorithm by 2025? Or how should we think about getting to that level of growth going forward?"", 'Ryan R. Marshall', ""Matt, thanks for the question. We feel really good about how we position the land pipeline. We've been investing for growth for a number of years. And we've been trying to do it in a very responsible way specific to having less owned and more optioned land. The fact that over the last 15 months, we've made significant headway with our land banking platform has helped with that.So we really like the number of lots that we have under control at 225,000 plus or minus, and we like the ownership structure or the way that we've controlled those lands. We think it's a really capital-efficient structure. Specific to your growth target number, yes, we're going to be at the lower end for 2024. Beyond that, we feel that we've got -- we've got the right structure to kind of be in that range for future periods."", 'Robert T. O’Shaughnessy', ""Yes. Maybe I'd add to that. The land for '25 is under contract and probably in development right now. And so we have line of sight to '24, '25. You get out to '26, we're still working through some of that. But we've -- you can see from the approvals that we did in this most recent quarter or for the year, 40,000 lots. No issues from our perspective in terms of lining up that type of growth rate."", 'Matthew Adrien Bouley', ""Got it. Okay. That's super helpful. Second one, back to the gross margin question. I think you're guiding '24 margins to be down roughly 70 basis points from where you exited the fourth quarter? I think I heard you say, Bob, that it's kind of flat pricing and then you've got some headwinds in land, labor and materials. I'm just curious if you can kind of unpack that a little bit and maybe specifically focus on the land side. How are you kind of thinking about those headwinds to the margin? And how does that kind of play into that guide in '24?"", 'Robert T. O’Shaughnessy', ""Yes. Fair question. And I think we laid it out this way to try and answer that question, I'll give you a little more color. We see pricing flat during the year. Now you might see different pricing at different consumer groups. The first time is the most affordability challenge. That's where we saw actually the biggest decline in the current quarter, but we think pricing is relatively flat through '24. We see modest, call it, 2% to 4% house construction cost increases, kind of mid- to upper single-digit land increases, which is what we've experienced this year.And so when you kind of mix that all together, we -- the one other point I guess I'd offer to clarify is, we're assuming incentive loads stay about the same at the 6.5% that we saw in this quarter. So when you marry that all up together, a little bit of a decline year-over-year, but still 28% to 28.5%, pretty strong margin."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with UBS.', 'John Lovallo', 'The first one, just maybe talking about January again, curious how orders looked versus normal seasonality, if you will. I think first quarter absorptions typically rise, call it, 40% to 45% sequentially. Is there anything that would preclude that from happening in your opinion, outside of rates maybe in the first quarter of this year?', 'Ryan R. Marshall', ""Yes, John, we didn't give a specific increase out of December. We kept more of our commentary around the qualitative side of things, which I'd reiterate, we're very pleased with how things are performing in January, and we'd expect that strength to continue. So we continue to be in a situation where there's low supply, affordability has definitely gotten better. You heard Bob's comment about kind of what we've assumed with our incentive load.So yes, I'd expect us to have a strong Q1. The one thing -- other thing I'd offer that's probably of note is we're starting to see some real signs of [lift] in our Western markets. Those have been -- that's been a part of the country that was slow for the majority of kind of 2022 and most all of 2023. But in the last 30 to 45 days, we're really starting to see those markets pick up, which is a welcomed outcome."", 'John Lovallo', 'Makes sense. And then on the share buyback, that was encouraging to see, I think, could be a good driver of returns as we move forward here. Over the past few years, I think you guys have done about $1 billion per year, the authorization now is closer to $1.8 billion. How are you thinking about 2024 buybacks relative to the past few years? I mean, should we expect north of $1 billion?', 'Robert T. O’Shaughnessy', ""Honestly, I'm going to defer. We typically do -- we'll report the news on that. I think you highlight -- we've done about $1 billion a year in the last couple of years. We have $1.8 billion in cash. We have offered that we project about $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations in the current year. So our capital allocation priorities don't change. We've said we're going to increase our land investment to $5 billion. That's up about 16% year-over-year. We increased our dividend, 25%. That's not a huge cash element, but still, I think, reflective of our confidence in the business. We do have $1.8 billion of authorization. And like I said, we'll report the news. You saw this year we bought back $100 million of our notes because it was attractive. The rate environment has made that a little less attractive, but we always look at liability management as part of the equation. So really no change to our capital allocation priorities."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.', 'Stephen Kim', ""First question relates to your land on the balance sheet. I think that cash flow guide seems to suggest, at least for my modeling, a modest rise in your own lot count while you keep a years supply of owned lots fairly stable. I was wondering if that's right and if there's any opportunity or desire to actually reduce your land holdings in years further."", 'Ryan R. Marshall', ""Yes, Stephen. So a couple of things there. We are increasing our land spend in 2024 from $4.3 billion to $5 billion. Our mix of developed spend versus land acquisition spend will continue to probably be about 60% development, 40% land acq. And then our long-term desire is to have 70% of our land controlled via option. We highlighted in the prepared remarks this year, we moved that 48% option to 53% controlled via option.So we're -- I think both in -- we demonstrated through results over the past number of years as well as kind of articulated long-term goals. We want to be land lighter. We're going to continue to do it the right way all with an eye toward delivering a lower risk model that's very capital efficient as well."", 'Stephen Kim', 'Well, I guess, Ryan, I mean, you gave most of that information in your opening remarks, so I appreciate that. But I guess the gist of my question, trying to incrementally understand what your plans are a little bit more is to try to understand the actual amount of owned lots. Are you looking to get to your 70% option versus owned mix by keeping your owned lot count kind of flat or your supply flat with where you are? Or are you actually looking to reduce that in addition to increasing your option lot exposure to kind of get to that 70% eventually?', 'Ryan R. Marshall', ""Yes, Stephen. In terms of years owned, we'd expect to probably keep that right around the level that we're at, maybe a slight decrease. And then ultimately, we would start to flip from years owned to years optioned. You'll see a little bit of a trade in that mix."", 'Stephen Kim', ""Okay. That helps. And then when you talk about land banking and continuing to increase that, could you describe for us the -- when you think generally about what you're seeing in the market in terms of pricing, in terms of the way these negotiations are going with your land bankers, what kind of anticipated haircut to gross margin do you typically get when you go from just sort of buying versus doing a land option? And what's the benefit to your inventory turns that you typically think about? So what's the trade-off basically in your mind? Some rules of thumb for us?"", 'Ryan R. Marshall', ""Yes. I don't know that there's a kind of a hard and fast answer to that, Stephen. It depends on the mix of the business that we've got. In terms of margin, it can be a couple of hundred basis points on a relative basis. And in terms of inventory turns, certainly, it's going to be more efficient than a bulk raw transaction, but it depends on the life of the asset. So in Del Webb, it's going to be very different than it is in the Centex business for us. So I wouldn't want to paint that with too broader brush."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank.', 'Joseph David Ahlersmeyer', ""Just a question on the assumption on the incentive load in the gross margin guidance. I'm wondering if that represents more just a state of conservatism right now waiting to see what happens with rates further. Or if it's more about your philosophy as rates fall that you might allow that to flow through to affordability and drive volume versus letting it be a big margin benefit. If you could just talk about that trade-off?"", 'Ryan R. Marshall', ""Yes, Joe, we've -- I think the reason we've assumed that the incentive load stays about where it is, it's just because affordability continues to be challenged. So we've got low supply, but interest rates are relatively higher. And because of low supply, I think there's still some pressure on prices being elevated historically. So we've talked a lot in 2023 about how successful we were in helping to solve some of the affordability challenges with the incentive dollars that we put toward the forward mortgage commitments, we'll continue to use that as a tool in 2024.Now as rates fall, we think the cost of those forward mortgage rate commitments will become less. We've made an assumption that we reallocate some of those incentive dollars to other things that help to solve the affordability challenge and get a buyer into their home.So is it conservative? Time will tell. I think what you've seen from us historically is we're not afraid to raise price, we're not afraid to cut discounts. And we're always looking to optimize pace and price. You've also heard me talk the last several quarters. We're not going to be margin proud. So we're doing things to be responsive to what the market is, to drive an outcome that yields the best return for our shareholders. And you'll see us actively managing all things, pace, price incentives forward mortgage commitments, et cetera."", 'Joseph David Ahlersmeyer', ""Understood. And I appreciate your comments about the valuation. It sounds like you think that cash flow is a bigger part of that potentially even than just percentage of optioned lots or any metric on the land side. It's about the cash flow, I tend to agree. And so just wondering if you are internally starting to think about your leverage in the context of cash flow or profits and not so much on what it makes up relative to your inventory balances kind of thinking almost more like a manufacturer or distributor because right now, you're not debt at about 13 days of operating profit, just thinking about the potential for using more debt going forward."", 'Robert T. O’Shaughnessy', ""Yes. It's an interesting question. I'm not sure we can think like a manufacturing company completely. The risk profiles are different. But having said that, I think there -- based on the strength of the operation, based on the cash flow that we've consistently shown despite growth, which historically is not the way this industry has behaved, we believe there is an opportunity for people to think a little bit differently about the equity in terms of how we manage the leverage on the balance sheet. A lot of that has to do with our opportunities to invest in the business and what we do on the share repurchases.But even you look at the rating agencies, they've been slow, but they've been responsive to kind of, I think, seeing the value in the business model and also the way the debt gets looked at. So will we use more debt for something? Without question, if it were for the right thing."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.', 'Michael Jason Rehaut', ""I wanted to circle back just on incentives and where we are today and to the extent that there's the potential for those to decline, how we should think about the impact on '24. So when you talked about, I think, assuming in 2024 6.5%, of a low rate for incentives. And I believe you said that was similar to the fourth quarter.If you could just remind us where you were in the fourth quarter versus the third and earlier in the year, and to the extent that perhaps incentives ticked down a little bit in the first quarter of '24. Should we be thinking that there would be a 3Q or a 4Q impact? Just trying to get the sense there of the lag?"", 'Ryan R. Marshall', ""Yes, Mike, I'll take the first part of that, and then I'll have Bob do the last piece. So we're up 50 basis points from Q3. We were 6% in Q3, 6.5% in Q4. In terms of what that means for 2024, I think I addressed it on a prior call, we're going to actively be managing our incentive load, but we've shared with you what our assumption is in current form.If there's an opportunity to peel those back, we'll do it, and we'll certainly share that with you. In terms of kind of the quarter that it would impact right now, about 50% -- somewhere around 50% of our sales are spec. So those are closing in kind of the following quarter. Spec sales now would either be late Q1 closings or early Q2 closings. If it's a dirt sale, Q1 closings typically end up being Q3 or early Q4 closing. So we've factored all of those assumptions into the margin guide that we gave for the year which is 28% to 28.5% to repeat that. And then, Bob, I don't know if you have the incentive load for Q1, Q2. I think that was the only thing that I haven't answered."", 'Robert T. O’Shaughnessy', 'It was about 6% in each of the first, second and third quarters. And it was 4.3% in the fourth quarter of last year.', 'Michael Jason Rehaut', ""Great. No, that's helpful. I guess, secondly, I'd love to kind of shift a little bit to the SG&A side. I think you gave guidance for the first quarter, but you've been running the last couple of years, plus or minus around 9%, low 9%. Obviously, we've heard a little bit about higher commission rates coming back maybe in a more choppy market at points in the past year or so. Overall solid market, but still, we've heard a little bit of acquisitions maybe coming up a little bit. How should we think about SG&A and the potential for further leverage over the next couple of years against the growth algorithm that you talked about? And if commissions, let's say, are stable from here, could we see an 8% at some point or getting closer to an 8% number? Just love your thoughts on that."", 'Ryan R. Marshall', ""Yes, Mike, we've -- I think we've always been thoughtful in how we spend SG&A dollars. We have historically made some extra investments in the quality of the homes that we build and deliver and the customer experience that we provide for our homeowners and we invest incremental dollars in the culture of our workforce.So we've tried to maintain balance within the SG&A structure as well. We're not trying to run kind of the leanest and on the lean end, we're also not trying to overspend. I think we're trying to be very balanced. In terms of the leverage for 2024 specifically, we've kind of given the guide, which will put us kind of in the low 9s. And that's really reflective of kind of what Bob guided to on the average sales price, which we're expecting to be flat. And against that, you've still got wage inflation for kind of our internal employees running close to 3.5%, 4%.So -- there's some pressure -- there's pressure on the SG&A front that we're not necessarily getting the benefit of on the ASP increase side. So in terms of kind of where it goes into the future, time will tell, but we've given the best visibility that we can for 2024. Bob, I don't know if you -- anything you'd add on the SG&A. Bob keeps us on. I still tell you that we're not overspending anywhere, at least not under Bobs' watch."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Sam Reid with Wells Fargo.', 'Richard Samuel Reid', 'I wanted to drill down a little bit on the first-time buyer. You guys have given a lot of good color on pricing. It does sound like price did move lower for this buyer group a bit again during the quarter. Maybe help us unpack the relative split perhaps between higher incentives for this buyer group as you try to make these homes more affordable versus perhaps some of the other affordability levers that you might be calling like smaller floor plans, et cetera. Kind of any color here would be appreciated.', 'Robert T. O’Shaughnessy', 'Yes. I would tell you, if you look year-over-year pricing at 4.22% to that buyer is down 6% year-over-year, it was down about 1% versus the trailing quarter, so the third quarter of this year. And I would tell you, it is largely incentive related. And so we\'re not -- we haven\'t in the last 3 months or the last 12 months, had a radical redesign of the product that we\'re offering to people.Communities when they get entitled, you have product approvals. So to a degree, you can see people saying, ""I want the smaller floor plan."" I would tell you that\'s not the driver of the price change. It is the incentive load that we\'ve introduced. So it\'s that 220 basis points which for that buyer is about, call it, $8,000. That\'s the price decline.', 'Richard Samuel Reid', ""No, that's helpful. And maybe one more on pricing here just from a slightly different vantage point. You guys have given good color in the past on option and lot premiums and the impact on ASP. I want to say it's been around $100,000 or north of $100,000 across your entire mix throughout 2023. Curious as to where that trended in Q4? And maybe give us a sense as to your outlook for that piece of the price component into 2024?"", 'Robert T. O’Shaughnessy', ""Yes. In the fourth quarter, it was $105,000 per unit, so it's down about $4,000 versus the prior year. And so I think that speaks to the sales team, and I give them a lot of credit. Where we've needed incentive has been less around options and lot premiums and more oriented towards financing. So we didn't see a big change there, which I think is a real positive.It also is interestingly, for that move-up and active-adult buyer, and we've highlighted the relative strength from them in this quarter and the relative pricing strength there. So just like our first time was down about 6%. Our move-up pricing was actually flat quarter-over-quarter, and our active adult was actually up 3%.And I think it's reflective of the way we go to market, the way we sell the lots that we've got, the options that people put in houses. So our teams are still doing a really good job of providing value for that, which people desire."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with Seaport Research Partners.', 'Kenneth Robinson Zener', ""I've got 2 very simple questions. First is on land banking. What percent of closings do you expect to be from finished lots once you reach your 70% option-owned scenario?"", 'Robert T. O’Shaughnessy', ""Ken, it's an interesting question. Certainly, the land banking would be finished lots, but for the optionality that we have with individual sellers, many of those were self-developing. And so I don't -- have added much..."", 'Ryan R. Marshall', ""Yes, My -- and this is a little bit of a guess, Ken, roughly 20% to 25% of our total closings. Once we get to 70%-30% will be finished lots. The rest will -- there'll be a lot of optionality in there. But to Bob's point, a lot of our options, we take down as raw land chunks and then we self-develop those. They're still highly efficient. It's just a different form of an option structure."", 'Kenneth Robinson Zener', ""Right. I assume that's kind of reflecting your entry-level exposure as well? Second question is talking about options, again, could you update us what percent of your ASP is coming from options? And then comment on the margin benefit you get from that, if you could. So we could discern your operating construction costs versus your strategy of forging in these options?"", 'Ryan R. Marshall', 'Sorry, I want to make sure I understand the $4,000 to $105, 000 a huge scale. How much of it is options?', 'Kenneth Robinson Zener', 'No, I think -- right. Your total ASP, you have a certain option exposure more move-up and active-adult. But could you talk to the margin impact of that as well?', 'Robert T. O’Shaughnessy', ""Yes. So of the $105,000 of option and lot premium $80,000 is options. $25, 000, that's lot premium. I could say, for instance, lot premiums are pure margin. I'm not sure that, that's fair, right? Pricing doesn't really work that way. But in terms of the option spend, typically, it's going to have a relatively rich margin mix, call it, 50%. And so it will -- it is accretive to the overall margin.And the way we try and go to market, Ken, and I don't know if this answers it better, we put a base price house that we think is kind of market standard and what people can and should expect to pay for that house, then we start talking about, okay, which lot do you want? What are you willing to pay for that lot, that's what generates $25,000. And then, okay, now in the house if we're offering optionality. And we don't, for everyone, right? So for the Centex buyer, we may have curated packages or no choices at all. But for the folks that can do structural options for fit and finish, that's what's driving that $80,000 of incremental revenue."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates.', 'Alan S. Ratner', ""Thanks for all the details so far. A question on cycle times. So congrats on the improvement there. It sounds like you're gonna see -- you expect to see further improvement in '24. Curious to get to the 100-day target from 130 where you're at right now, you guys are targeting 5% growth. We've heard some other builders may be a little bit higher than that. Is there a level from a labor perspective where builders try to push starts more significantly that you think cycle time improvement might stall a bit? Are there any constraints that you could foresee? Or is the unleashing of kind of the normalization of the supply chain just kind of independent of whatever the start pace might look like in '24."", 'Ryan R. Marshall', ""Yes. It's a fair question. Based on the total amount of production that's happening, I don't see the industry stressing the labor availability. I'm not suggesting there's a whole bunch of excess labor on it around out there. But at least for the big builders, I think we've got great trade relationships. And I think we'll continue to get not only schedule performance, but the labor on our job sites.I think the pressure likely comes on dollars or more so than time. If we're running into labor pitches because of a volume increase. I think it's probably dollars more than time. A lot of the decrease that we'll take, it will be because we're getting things on a predictable schedule, like we used to pre-COVID. So that's working better, which allows us to take some kind of dead days out of our schedule that we had -- we built in for things to go wrong or for time and we were just literally waiting for material to show up.So it's a little bit of that, a little bit of we're just getting back to the cycle times that we had pre-COVID. So we trimmed out about 30 or so days in 2024. We'll get over in 2023 rather. We think we can get another 30 or so days by the end of 2024, and we'll be back largely in line with pre-COVID cycle times."", 'Alan S. Ratner', ""Great. I appreciate those added thoughts, Ryan. And then I guess in the similar vein, I was curious if you could just give an update on the ICG growth plans there and kind of how that's been trending and what your current thinking is as far as additional market expansion, if there is any?"", 'Ryan R. Marshall', ""Yes, Alan, it continues to go well. We have 2 plants today. Both are focused in the Southeast part of the U.S. Our growth plans are still largely on target to have approximately 8 factories. So we haven't announced anything new. We'll -- similar to our share buybacks, we'll probably report the news on that as opposed to give forward-looking forecasts."", 'Alan S. Ratner', ""And I guess, if I could sneak one in on that. I mean it's hard for us to conceptualize what impact that has on your business. And obviously, it's concentrated in a handful of markets right now. But are there certain kind of metrics that you can share with us, whether it's cycle times or costs, margin, et cetera, that you can kind of demonstrate on a case study basis how that's contributing to your business right now?"", 'Ryan R. Marshall', ""Yes, Alan. So that's -- we haven't given a bunch of guidance on that just because it is concentrated into a couple of markets, and we don't feel it's appropriate to extrapolate the entire enterprise yet. As we get further down the path, we'll share more. Conceptually, it's exactly what you highlighted. We're getting cycle time improvements. We're getting better quality, and there are some raw material cost savings that we believe we're getting as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.', 'Susan Marie Maklari', ""My first question is just around the specs. You mentioned that you had about 44%, I think, of your production that's in spec. As you think about the year and the way that the demand may come together, any thoughts on where that may move or how you're thinking about it longer term?"", 'Ryan R. Marshall', ""Yes. Susan, I want to anticipate a massive change from the percentage. We're probably on the higher end of the range that we'll have in spec right now. Specific to the fourth quarter, we put more spec starts in the ground than what we sold, and that was intentional. We wanted to have some additional inventory going into the spring selling season, which we have. So as we move throughout the year, probably right in line with where we're at or a tad lower."", 'Susan Marie Maklari', ""Okay. That's helpful. And then when we think generally about the potential for rates to come down this year? And that possibly driving some increase on the existing home side of the market. Any thoughts on what the implications of that could be, especially perhaps on the move-up and the active-adult parts of the businesses? And any initiatives you have relative to that?"", 'Ryan R. Marshall', ""Yes. Susan, I -- with the rate cuts that are forecasted, I don't see it being at a level that's going to unleash a tidal wave of resale inventory. So is it better than where we're at today? Certainly. Will that start to free up some resale inventory? I think so. And I think that's probably helpful against the backdrop of we continue to be undersupplied in the country. So on balance, I don't think it has much impact at all on what we're projecting for our business in 2024."", 'Operator', ""Our final question comes from the line of Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America, where we've reached the time allotment for this morning's call. Please go ahead."", 'Rafe Jason Jadrosich', ""Can you -- in terms of the additional 30 days of bill cycle improvement you're expecting for 2024. Can you talk about what the build cycles are in homes that you're starting today? Like are you already at that 100-day level? And is that improvement embedded in your cash flow guidance?"", 'Ryan R. Marshall', ""Yes, Rafe. It's a fair question. Homes that we're starting today we'll deliver in kind of late -- you know, homes were starting today will deliver in Q2, basically. So no, we're not at the 100 days yet. Now that being said, there are some markets and some communities where we're -- we are at the 100 days. And in fact, we were at 100 days last year. When you blend it all together, we think it will be Q4 before we're at the 100 days that we've highlighted as our goal."", 'Robert T. O’Shaughnessy', 'Then, Rafe, our guide does factor in what we see in terms of cycle times during the year, the cash flow guidance to your question.', 'Rafe Jason Jadrosich', ""Got it. That's helpful. And then really helpful color in terms of the land inflation you're expecting in your gross margin for 2024. And you have the land that you need through 2025. On the land that you're contracting today, what are you seeing in terms of inflation? Is it at a similar level? Or are you actually seeing that come down? And then can you kind of help us understand the difference between development cost inflation relative to what you're seeing for raw land?"", 'Robert T. O’Shaughnessy', 'Yes. So -- sorry, I forgot the first part of the question.', 'Rafe Jason Jadrosich', 'You spoke about the land inflation in the...', 'Robert T. O’Shaughnessy', ""I'm sorry. We -- listen, it's interesting land prices don't come down very often. They're sticky. And we've seen and we've highlighted sort of sequential increases in lot costs. I would tell you that the land we're seeing today is consistent with that. Prices are pretty robust, and it's a pretty competitive landscape out there. We underwrite to return. And so it's -- we look to see can we get return out of that.So I think no change, honestly, in the land market. In terms of the inflationary aspect, what we are seeing is that, that labor constraint influences the development of land, just like it does building of houses. And with general cost inflation that we were seeing last year in particular, it was influencing the stance of [pipe], everything that we do to do the development of the communities was running pretty hot too.So again, we've highlighted we think it's going to be a little bit more expensive in terms of our lot increase this year for '24. And again, I think that just reflects all the activity that was going on and some of the cost inflation that we saw in '23 feeding into our lots this year in '24. Good news is the vertical, we're seeing a pretty benign in land market where that has been running pretty hot last year, obviously. So the slowdown in inflation, we feel it now in the house, hopefully, we'll feel that a little bit later in land. It would be an opportunity for us for sure."", 'Operator', 'I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Zeumer for closing remarks.', 'James P. Zeumer', ""I appreciate everybody's time this morning. We'll certainly be available over the rest of the day. If you have any additional questions.

While the Federal Reserve can take longer to reduce interest rates, as investors have likely understood during the past couple of weeks, the economy continues to grow and inflation is nowhere near the levels that were in play in late 2022. 2023 has seen a stock market compete with high interest and get some help from the economy along the way as global oil supply chains stabilized and prices at the pump dropped as a result.', ""However, the war in Palestine and the resulting destabilization in the Middle East threatens a vulnerable global economy that has finally started to find some footing after 2022's oil price shocks and high interest rates aimed at culling inflation. In the Middle East, three U.S. service members were killed and dozens were injured due to an unmanned drone attack on a base in northeast Jordan. With the political temperature already high domestically, and conflict rife in Gaza, Lebanon, and Ukraine, the U.S.'s response has everyone on the edge of their seats even though the attack took place on a weekend. The Federal Reserve is also a key body to watch as the year starts, as the tone set by its officials during their January announcements will dictate how well growth and high technology sectors can grow."", ""The start of the year is also the time for recollection, and for some investors, the time to adjust portfolios. The S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite gained 24% and 43% respectively last year, allowing the passive investor following index tracking funds a nice gain to cash out on as the year ended. Now, the question on everyone's mind is whether the markets will sustain their 2023 performance or become even bolder to set new highs."", ""Amidst these considerations, there are a multitude of stocks that an investor can choose from. The market is often divided across several categories and sectors, and one of these picks out stocks based on their market capitalization. A market cap sets the tone for a firm in the public's mind, as more valuable companies see both retail and professional investors place a higher premium on a firm's shares. This premium is mostly reflected through fortress income statements that reflect billions (if not hundreds or tens of billions) of dollars in revenue and substantial assets that assure investors that the ability of a company to remain a going concern is not threatened even during some of the most troubling economic environments."", ""On the flip side, other stocks such as small cap stocks often do well when the economy is growing since it provides them with the potential to expand operations and increase sales.

It represents the annual contract value of all active recurring revenue contracts at any point in time. Recurring revenue is defined as a revenue stream that is contractual, typically for a period of 12 months or more, and has a high probability of renewal. The probability of renewal is based on historical renewal experience of the individual revenue streams, or management's best estimates if historical renewal experience is not available. Organic ARR growth is calculated as the dollar change in ARR, adjusted to exclude the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, divided by ARR as of the prior period. The effects of currency translation are excluded by calculating Organic ARR on a constant currency basis. When we acquire businesses, we exclude the effect of ARR in the current period for which there was no comparable ARR in the prior period. We believe that Organic ARR provides useful information to investors because it reflects our recurring revenue performance period over period without the effect of acquisitions and changes in currency exchange rates. Organic ARR growth is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation. Our measure of ARR may be different from measures used by other companies. Because ARR is based on annual contract value, it does not represent revenue recognized during a particular reporting period or revenue to be recognized in future reporting periods and is not intended to be a substitute for revenue, contract liabilities, or backlog."", 'Total ARR - Total ARR growth is calculated as the dollar change in ARR, adjusted to exclude the effects of currency.

We use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current period for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period.

The non-GAAP financial information presented excludes certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into the company's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following definitions are provided:"", 'Core Operating Earnings/(loss), Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings/(loss) Per Share ', 'Core operating earnings/(loss) is defined as GAAP Earnings/(loss) from operations excluding the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core operating margin is defined as Core operating earnings/(loss) expressed as a percentage of revenue. Core earnings/(loss) per share is defined as GAAP Diluted earnings/(loss) per share excluding the net earnings/(loss) per share impact of the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. Management uses core operating earnings/(loss), core operating margin and core earnings/(loss) per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as they exclude non-service pension and post-retirement costs, which primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to government contracts. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided on page 12 and page 13.', 'Free Cash Flow', 'Free cash flow is GAAP\xa0operating cash flow reduced by capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders, debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses free cash flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. See Table 2 on page 2 for reconciliation of free cash flow to GAAP operating cash flow.', 'Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements', 'This press release contains ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Adjusted income (loss) from operations is a principal financial measure of profitability used by The Cigna Group's management because it presents the underlying results of operations of The Cigna Group's businesses and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue, expenses and shareholders' net income. Adjusted income from operations is defined as shareholders' net income (or income before income taxes less pre-tax income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the segment metric) excluding net realized investment results, amortization of acquired intangible assets and special items. The Cigna Group's share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the Cigna Healthcare segment using the equity method of accounting are also excluded. Special items are matters that management believes are not representative of the underlying results of operations due to their nature or size. Adjusted income (loss) from operations is measured on an after-tax basis for consolidated results and on a pre-tax basis for segment results. Consolidated adjusted income (loss) from operations is not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders' net income. See Exhibit 1 for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted income from operations to shareholders' net income."", ""Management is not able to provide a reconciliation of adjusted income from operations to shareholders' net income (loss) or adjusted revenues to total revenues on a forward-looking basis because it is unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, certain components thereof including (i) future net realized investment results (from equity method investments with respect to adjusted revenues) and (ii) future special items. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond The Cigna Group's control. As such, any associated estimate and its impact on shareholders' net income could vary materially."", 'Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information', 'This press release, and oral statements made in connection with this release, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The top reasons propelling a growing number of American boomers to seek retirement havens beyond the borders of the United States are the triad of quality of life, cost of living, and healthcare accessibility.', 'From a financial perspective, the statistics paint a compelling picture. A healthy 65-year-old couple contemplating retirement in the United States may find themselves requiring a hefty sum of $300,000 in savings. This figure does not even factor in the high costs associated with assisted living, averaging around $4,500 per month as reported\xa0 by the Cost of Care survey by Genworth. Moreover, the United States consistently ranks among the most expensive places to live globally. Despite the median retirement savings for boomers standing at $152,000, a concerning one in five retirees claims they have yet to recover from the economic downturn of the recession.', ""The allure of retiring abroad gains further momentum when examining the healthcare landscape in the United States. Unquestionably, the U.S. leads in healthcare costs globally, creating a significant financial burden for retirees. In contrast to many industrialized nations boasting near-universal coverage, the U.S. relies on a non-universal, private insurance system. For this reason, many boomers are now preferring to retire outside the U.S. Moreover, even though 91.4% of Americans are covered by private healthcare insurance, a notable portion of the population remains without any coverage at all. The lucrative nature of the private healthcare insurance industry in the U.S. is underscored by its flourishing business within the country's 'dysfunctional' healthcare system, as outlined by The Economist. This dysfunctionality has contributed to the growth of several private insurance companies, perpetuating a situation where a substantial segment of the population is left grappling with inadequate or no coverage."", 'The situation gets even more concerning when the stark contrast between the financial gains of such private insurance companies and the struggles of the American people emerges. Major players such as UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV), and The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) are proudly reporting billions in profits. Specifically, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) achieved an astounding $22 billion in profits in the year 2023. Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV), a prominent player in the US private insurance sector, has not only exceeded its target growth range of 12-15% but has achieved a remarkable compound annual growth rate of nearly 16% since 2018. Their operating revenue also surpassed $170 billion in 2023, which reflects substantial financial success within the private health insurance sector.', 'Additionally, the way these companies operate, especially in denying or underpaying for care, raises ethical questions about their commitment to the well-being of patients. In 2021, a staggering 53% of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield’s medical bills for the second quarter went unpaid, totaling $2.5 billion. The tactic of requiring pre-authorization for routine and lifesaving care introduced in early 2023 by UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is another illustration of how health insurers navigate the delicate balance between profits and patient well-being.

Griffin', ""Thanks, Raji, and welcome, everyone. Skyworks continued to execute well during the first fiscal quarter of 2024 despite a volatile macroeconomic environment. We delivered revenue of $1.202 billion. We posted earnings per share of $1.97 and generated $775 million of operating cash flow. Free cash flow was also a record at $753 million or 63% free cash flow margin, which reflects strong working capital management and moderating CapEx intensity. Let's review both near- and long-term secular trends in our end markets. After two challenging years across Android ecosystems, we see signs that the industry is stabilizing. Excess supply conditions are abating and inventory levels in the distribution channel and at the OEM level are normalizing. Customers are starting to restock inventory, albeit gradually as supply and demand dynamics improve and new phones are introduced into the market. Moreover, we've made strategic investments in product development, positioning us to compete for design wins and share gains focusing on highly integrated platforms for the leading mobile OEMs. We are pleased with our competitive positioning and technology road map and are poised to return to growth when the markets recover. Within broad markets, we see (inaudible) but many factors are moving in the right direction. In consumer IoT, we believe that we are past the bottom as inventory levels in the channel have normalized and demand signals are improving. Furthermore, we are executing on the upgrade cycle to WiFi 6E and 7. We see significant design win momentum across our retail, carrier and enterprise channels. These systems carry substantially higher dollar content. Because of the addition of the new 6 gigahertz band and the inclusion of BAW filtering technology, we expect wireless infrastructure and traditional data center will remain a headwind throughout 2024, as OEMs continue to digest excess inventory. Despite this, we remain bullish on several new product cycles, including major design wins in Ethernet for high bandwidth networks and 400-gig and 800-gig optical module upgrades. Lastly, automotive and industrial markets are experiencing a near-term inventory correction. However, we see opportunities for growth in our automotive business, driven by higher adoption rates of connectivity in the vehicle, along with growing EV penetration, driving demand for our power isolation products. Taken together, we anticipate December quarter represents the bottom in the broad markets business. There are several long-term secular growth dynamics that leverage our differentiated technology, including the proliferation of intelligent edge connected IoT devices, automotive electrification and advanced safety systems and AI-enabled workloads, driving cloud and data center upgrades. Each of these trends require intricate connectivity engines underlying the need for speed, ultra-reliable low latency performance. In addition, 5G technology is expanding beyond the smartphone into more use cases in broad markets, including private cellular networks in factories and stadiums, customer premise equipment supporting Verizon and T-Mobile and multiband automotive telematics and wearables to name a few. We also remain bullish on the long-term RF content stored in smartphones, coupled with growing 5G penetration. We see increasing levels of complexity and content with each new generation. For example, 5G advanced is driving higher RF content, including the addition of satellite bands, 4x4 MIMO on the downlink and uplink, higher bandwidth, more carrier aggregation, upgrades to WiFi and GPS and other innovations. Lastly, we are energized about the prospect of generative AI migrating to the smartphone, sparking a potential major upgrade cycle. As the performance bar rises every year to support AI-enabled phones, the complexity requirements of RF will continue to increase, driving the need for more integration, lower power consumption, smaller footprint and spectral efficiency. 5G is the ideal standard for on-device AI applications as it takes advantage of lower latency, faster transmission speeds and higher frequency ranges. In addition, AI-enabled workloads are driving demand for high-speed connectivity for data-intensive infrastructure and cloud upgrades, accelerating the demand for our high precision timing products. Turning to our quarterly business highlights. We secured several design wins in infrastructure, including optical transport products with a major operator in India and timing devices for 5G small cells for private networks. We expanded the WiFi design pipeline with Cisco's enterprise access points, Linksys Tri-Band Mesh Router and TP-Link's Tri-Band Gaming Router. We increased design win momentum in automotive including telematics, infotainment systems and onboard chargers across the leading OEMs. Lastly, in emerging IoT, we delivered next-generation smart energy solutions with Google's Nest Temperature Sensors and Itron's residential gas meters. In summary, Skyworks delivered solid financial results despite a challenging macro environment. Our strong balance sheet, record cash flow and profitability reflect our resilient business model, diverse customer base and technology scale. With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for a discussion of last quarter's performance and our outlook for Q2 of fiscal 2024."", 'Kris Sennesael', ""Thanks, Liam. Skyworks' revenue for the first fiscal quarter of 2024 was $1.202 billion, slightly above the midpoint of our outlook. Mobile was approximately 71% of total revenue, an increase of 7% sequentially as we supported the ramp of new high-performance solutions at our largest customer. Android-related revenue with Google, Samsung and the Chinese OEMs grew modestly sequentially. Broad markets were approximately 29% of total revenue, down 18% sequentially, mostly driven by some specific inventory corrections in wireless infrastructure, automotive and industrial. Gross profit was $557 million with gross margin at 46.4% in line with expectations. Gross margin was down 70 basis points sequentially, driven by an unfavorable mix shift resulting from lower broad markets revenue. Also, during Q1, we reduced our internal inventory by $193 million to $927 million, well below our target of $1 billion. Operating expenses were $191 million, below the low end of the guidance range, given our ongoing focus on managing discretionary expenses while continuing to invest in our technology and product road maps. We generated $366 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 30.4%. We incurred $7 million of other expense and our effective tax rate was 11.7%, driving net income of $317 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.97, which is $0.02 above the guidance that we provided during the last earnings call. Skyworks' business model continues to generate very strong cash flow. First fiscal quarter cash flow from operations increased to an all-time record of $775 million. Capital expenditures were reduced to $22 million or less than 2% of revenue, resulting in an all-time record free cash flow of $753 million or 63% free cash flow margin. Strong profitability combined with great working capital management and lowering the CapEx intensity of the business drove the record cash flow numbers. Also, during fiscal Q1, we paid $109 million in dividends and repaid the remaining $300 million on our term loan. We ended the quarter with over $1 billion in cash and investments and $1 billion in debt, creating a net positive cash position and an optimal capital structure, providing us with superior flexibility and optionality. Now let's move on to our outlook for Q2 of fiscal 2024. We anticipate revenue between $1.02 billion and $1.07 billion. We expect our mobile business to be seasonally down consistent with historical patterns, while in broad markets, we anticipate modest growth of the December bottom as inventory levels are normalizing in certain end markets. Gross margin is projected to be in the range of 45% to 46%, reflecting our seasonally weakest period of the year. We anticipate margin expansion during the remainder of 2024, benefiting from our disciplined management of our manufacturing and operational cost structure, both internal and external, along with higher factory utilization rates. We will also benefit from a favorable mix shift as our broad markets business recovers and accelerates. We expect operating expenses in the range of $193 million to $197 million, as we continue to make strategic investments in mobile and broad markets to drive share gains and increased diversification. Below the line, we anticipate roughly $4 million in other expense and an effective tax rate of 11.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 161 million shares. Accordingly, at the midpoint of the revenue range of $1.045 billion we intend to deliver diluted earnings per share of $1.52. Operator, let's open the line for questions."", 'Operator', 'Ladies and gentlemen. (Operator Instructions) And our first question coming from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen.', 'Matthew D. Ramsay', ""Liam, I wanted to ask a bit about the broad market trends and it's obviously as the name implies, a diverse business. I was pleasantly, but I was a little bit surprised at the commentary that you had visibility for that business to be up so quickly, I guess, in March, it's been an inventory correction that's lasted a bit longer. And some of your peers and in other companies, and we've seen industrial maybe get a little bit worse. So I mean, if you could maybe expand -- I know you did some in the prepared script, but if you could expand a little bit on maybe some of the individual end market trends you're seeing in broad markets. And maybe what the pace of this potential recovery starting from March and through the rest of the year could look like coming off the bottom?"", 'Liam K. Griffin', ""Sure. Sure. Absolutely. One of the interesting things here with our broad markets business is that there's so many opportunities that we haven't yet scaled. So if we look at the business unlike some of the other mobile markets that are well defined and there's still great opportunities. We look at the broad markets as more of an open-ended play for us. We're leveraging the technologies that we know how to work with. We have a great set of customers and that continues to grow and expand. But yes, I mean, the team has done a really good job. This has been a tough year across the landscape across semis. We're happy to deliver some positive results here today, and we do think there's a turn. Again, in that portfolio, it's very diverse. And mobile is a part of it, but the lion's share is really diversified products with some really great names as well. And most of those broad market companies, we have low share. There's still a tremendous amount of room to grow within those accounts. So I think those are some of the themes. We've been working on this for quite a while. And finally putting up some meaningful top line, leveraging that broad markets business. The other thing, we continue to remind our customers and even the investors, a lot of the stuff we do in-house. So we're able to craft and curate specialty products. We have our own fabs. We do things a little bit differently, and I think that helps our outcome."", 'Matthew D. Ramsay', ""Got it. I guess, as my follow-up, and this is going to be a thematic that we talk about in the PC market maybe this year and then into next year in the smartphone market, as you alluded to, sort of AI making its way into these products and potentially catalyzing a bit of an upgrade cycle. So I guess my question is, I mean, it's pretty straightforward for us to envision if you get air interface upgrades from 4G to 5G to what comes next, that can expand the RF TAM pretty meaningfully for your smartphone business. Are you anticipating the growth potential from AI and smartphones to be primarily a unit driver for the market and therefore, for your company? Or are there things that you guys can do in AI-enabled phones that could meaningfully change the content? Or are we sort of waiting for the next air interface before the content could possibly inflect for the TAM again?"", 'Liam K. Griffin', ""Yes, I think it's a secular opportunity. This is a really unique period for us and in the industry. The way we look at it, you look at AI and a lot of that is really intense servers data center, and that's extremely important. Then you take it down kind of to the middle ground and then you're kind of in a different position. But getting that to mobile is going to be a challenge. It's going to be a challenge, but it will happen. The consumer wants that. The consumer wants to have that compute power in their hand. And it's not there yet, but we really believe that it will come. And I think it's going to set up the industry for a whole range of new opportunities still carrying radio frequency. So really excited about it. And again, we have the building blocks and the know-how to do really interesting things and do it account by account as well. Not everybody wants the same solution. But we really do believe that heavy compute power has got to get matched up with something in your hand. That handheld device has got to step up. It's got to grow, it's going to be more -- it's going to need to be faster, lower latency. And that's all good because those are problems that we can solve."", 'Operator', 'And our next question coming from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research.', 'Christopher Caso', ""First question is about the Android market right now. It sounds like that market has finally grown for you after several quarters of inventory correction. Can you speak to what your expectations are for that as you go through the year? I suppose at this point, the inventory correction is behind us. What's your level of optimism of getting back to more normal growth rates in that part of the business?"", 'Liam K. Griffin', ""Yes, Chris. Yes, you're right. It's been a little bit bumpy through the ecosystem here, but we see green shoots here popping up in Android. We know how to make these products. I think there was a little bit of a soft spot there in the industry. The newer phones are coming up with a little bit more technology. We like that. And we can broaden that base. So we are going to -- in the prepared remarks, we commented on that, and you should expect more growth in the Android ecosystem as we go forward. These are products that we can execute to in the pipeline right now and give us continuing strength getting in -- going through '24 and '25."", 'Christopher Caso', ""Okay. As a follow-up on gross margins, if you speak to your expectations as we proceed through the year. One thing you mentioned is it sounds like you're internal inventory was below target. Should we read that to mean utilization starts going higher? And what the effect on that will be on gross margins as we go through the year."", 'Kris Sennesael', ""Yes, Chris. So I'm really -- when you look at gross margins, we did 46.4% in Q1. We're still impacted there by underutilization, a little bit of a headwind from a mix point of view as well, that continues somewhat in the March quarter that we guided. But then when I look beyond the March quarter, we will see some really nice gross margin uplift in the remainder of the fiscal and the calendar year. Part of that is higher utilization because we will no longer have to focus on a reduction of inventory. That is behind us. We reduced the inventory by almost $200 million in the December quarter. There is maybe still a little bit of opportunity there, but we feel good about the inventory levels where they are right now. In addition to that, our broad markets business is going to grow faster than the mobile business. And so that gives us a little bit of a mix tailwind as well. And then in addition to that, we will really benefit from all the cost reductions that we've done over the last 12 months. We really focused on taking out structural parts of the cost structure. We focused on operational efficiencies, driving yield improvements and test time reductions. And in addition to internal cost, we also start seeing some benefit from external cost. And so when you put it all together, we will see some nice gradual gross margin improvement after the March quarter."", 'Operator', 'And our next question coming from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna.', 'Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland', ""I guess, first of all, in broad markets, if you can -- you had some great color as to how you break those out into kind of subsegments. I would love to know kind of what those look like, how they're trending. And then also, you alluded to the gross margin benefits as we move through the year. I don't know if you can talk to the broad markets effect on gross margin as we move through the year."", 'Kris Sennesael', ""Yes. So as it relates to broad markets, roughly 40%, 45% is IoT, more consumer IoT where we provide connectivity solutions in tablets, in wearables and PCs, your home connectivity with routers and all the access points that tap into that. There has been an inventory correction for multiple quarters, but we are getting towards the end of the inventory correction there. In addition to that, we see strong growth in that part of the market due to an uplift in content as we transition from WiFi 6 into WiFi 6E and 7 type of solutions that have a substantially higher RF content of Skyworks inside. The next 30%, 35% is infrastructure, cloud, data center, enterprise networking. There is definitely an inventory correction going on in that part of the business that has started in the December quarter and will continue for a couple of quarters here. Nevertheless, that as well, I think in that market, we're very well positioned with some key customers, including our timing solutions for data centers. And then the last part is 20%, 25% is automotive and industrial. There as well, I think we're well positioned. But you've heard it from many of our peers, there is an inventory correction going on. I don't think it will be a long drag-out inventory correction. It's probably December, March, two quarters of an inventory correction. And then again, we are very well positioned in that market (inaudible) that eventually become an autonomous car as well as EV, where we play with our power resolution solutions. And so again, when you put it all together, December is the bottom for our broad markets. We start seeing some sequential growth in March and beyond. And as you know, yes, those markets typically have a higher gross margin compared to broad markets and that will help us to lift the gross margin."", 'Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland', ""You guys already talked about AI smartphones, but also you called out AI-enabled workloads driving cloud and data center upgrades. You also talked about 800 gig and this being an opportunity for you. Is that all related to your timing business from your acquisition? Or are there other ways that you're leveraging infrastructure around AI as well?"", 'Liam K. Griffin', ""Yes, largely through the infrastructure business that we have and some of the technology that we brought forth in our Silicon Labs deal, that's driving new vectors for us at Skyworks in the industrial markets and the data center markets, and it's a really vibrant growth source for us, and there's a lot of room to grow there as well. So lots more to do, but we've been making some great progress in that area."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is coming from the line of Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.', 'Edward Francis Snyder', ""I'd like to touch on, if we could, later this year, especially in mobile, it seems pretty clear at this point, given your largest customer scrambled to get their thing done by 2025 (inaudible) attention is on that and that we're going to have kind of a -- I don't know the best way to put it, but basically, kind of on hold -- not on hold, but a repeat of what we've seen before, nothing -- not much new in the new one and the competition (inaudible). So basically, I would expect in the fall, you're going to see more competition or you already (inaudible) talk about a lot on Wednesday. So I'm trying to get a feel for the profile of your mobile business in the second half of the year. It sounds like it might be weaker than we have normally seen since Qualcomm share got to come out of somebody. If you could maybe characterize or just without getting into too much detail about what should we look at in terms of the mix in the second half, you're already talking about broad markets being much stronger. The mobile by implication is going to be a little bit weaker. And is that mostly just organic growth? Or is there going to be some share loss? Or how do we think about that? And then I have a follow-up, please."", 'Liam K. Griffin', ""Yes. Well, of course, we're deeply engaged with mobile in all angles, right? So we have a broad set of technologies that are applicable to multiple customers, including the largest. And that's our craft. That's the largest part of our portfolio. We're growing across other markets, but certainly the know-how that we have in RF, the ability to do things in-house, as you know, and the vectors that we put forth to drive this company. So we're all over it at every angle, and we're continuing to work on market share and new innovations. Delighting our customers, over current consumption, expanding the reach, doing a little bit more in the Android markets that we've kind of hinted around that. We're going to continue to execute there and still drive the best performance solutions that we can."", 'Edward Francis Snyder', ""Okay. Maybe I could follow up with a different angle here. You're going to grow in Android, you've kind of been under-earning there for several years, I think on purpose because you've done very well outside of that market. R&D is going up in order to address the products yet because it's a different product market. But margins typically are lower in that whole market. Competition is a lot more intense, one, should we expect to see revenue growth in the second half? It's a little early, but revenue growth in the second half of the year, whether it's on an inventory snapback or new product wins and Android try to take up some of that slack. And then, Kris, maybe you could articulate how that -- how you're going to offset the margin, the natural margin dilution of Android over, say, the U.S. customer and then, of course, all mobile dilution against broad markets in the second half, if you could, please."", 'Liam K. Griffin', ""Yes. So yes, we're working on that. So there's a lot of opportunity for us to be more aggressive across the Android ecosystem. It's not just China. You get names like Google and Samsung, they are tremendous opportunities that we can drive. We're built for this kind of stuff. And we have an end-to-end process that we continue to improve and refine at every turn. It helps our customers. It helps our gross margin and our utilization. We have incredible factories, homegrown stuff that we have here in Irvine that really, really is the solution of choice as far as I know, with our technology know-how and the ability to be flexible and customizable to each account. And I think that's an asset for us, and I think we'll continue to drive that portfolio."", 'Kris Sennesael', ""Yes, as it relates to gross margin, the gross margin profile of our mobile customers is on or about the same. And part of that is because you know, we are somewhat selective. We are not sliding down in the mid or low end of the market. We stay at the high end. We stay at the high-performance part. And in that part of the market, you compete based on performance. It's not a price competition. You compete based on performance. And again, that's why gross margins are somewhat the same in -- with all the customers in that segment."", 'Operator', 'And our next question coming from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo.', 'Gary Wade Mobley', 'I want to start with a quick housekeeping question. What was the mix of revenue from your largest customer in the quarter?', 'Kris Sennesael', 'The largest customer was approximately 73% of total revenue which is high, obviously, because the December quarter is the top quarter with the largest customer. And given that the broad markets was bottoming out in December, you get to on or about 73%. Obviously, when you look forward on a full year basis or even in March, it will be well below the 73%.', 'Gary Wade Mobley', ""I want to ask Ed's previous question in perhaps a more direct way. Doing the math, it would indicate that your Android-related mobile customers are trending now at about a $400 million annualized rate or at least that was the case for the December quarter. But in the past, fiscal year '22, I believe that level is closer to $800 million. And so my question is, if we see a rebound in the Android market and based on your design win footprint that you currently have today, can we expect that segment of your business to bounce back to the previous level?"", 'Liam K. Griffin', ""Yes, absolutely. We've got, as I said, a lot of opportunity to go harder and stronger and more direct on the Android ecosystem. We absolutely have the technology to make it work. We have the manufacturing scale and know-how to get it done. So yes, I mean, it's certainly a play for us there, and I think we'll take advantage."", 'Operator', 'And our next question coming from the line Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas.', 'Karl Ackerman', 'Two questions, if I may. On mobile, your largest customer is down on a seasonal basis in March. But at the same time, given your improving execution within Android, does Android grow sequentially in March? How do we think about that within mobile, please? And I have a follow-up.', 'Kris Sennesael', 'Yes. Android is kind of flattish, slightly up into March.', 'Karl Ackerman', ""Got it. At the same time, I do want to touch on mobile one more time. It's been asked in several different ways, but I guess I'll try it again. You are less tied to China (inaudible) but are you seeing any changes to the competitive landscape in China? I ask because there are anecdotes supporting China RF suppliers winning content in low band SAW and TC-SAW. But at the same time, as you indicated earlier, Kris, you're not necessarily competing in that particular on the market. So if you can just highlight the committed landscape and what you're seeing in China, that would be very helpful."", 'Liam K. Griffin', ""Yes. I mean the OVX players, we do some reasonable business there. We could probably do a little bit more on the Android side, but we really don't step down much further there. We're not in the low end at all. We could be, but I think we generate a better outcome for our customers and our shareholders to drive that mid and high end. So it's something we can do. But I think the way our business runs, I think, we're more accretive as a company going down the playbook that we have today."", 'Operator', 'And our next question coming from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.', 'Blake Edward Friedman', 'This is Blake Friedman on for Vivek. I just wanted to focus on OpEx, it seems spending has returned to levels seen prior to the industry downturn. So I was curious how we should think about the trajectory of OpEx for the remainder of the year?', 'Kris Sennesael', ""Yes. So as it relates to OpEx, I think we did a good job in the December quarter at $191 million. We are guiding with a little step-up in March to $195 million. Keep in mind that this is the start of a new calendar year. And so you get a reset of the social charges and some of that, that kicks in. In addition to that, we are going to continue to invest in our technology and product road maps. We feel good about our position with our mobile players. As Liam articulated, we have plenty of opportunity in our broad markets. And we're going to continue to invest. Now we're going to do it the Skyworks way. We focus on efficiency, effectiveness. We're not wasting any dollars here. And so -- but yes, we're going to continue to invest. And so OpEx will continue to gradually move up in the remainder of the fiscal and calendar year."", 'Blake Edward Friedman', 'Got it. And then kind of quickly circling back on some of your comments. I know the broad markets business is a key initiative for Skyworks. And just with the business kind of returning to this cash positive level and generating pretty strong cash flow from here. Just curious how you think about M&A and anything in particular you guys would look to add to the broad markets assets?', 'Kris Sennesael', ""Yes. First of all, the cash flow is outstanding, and it's definitely something that we focus on. And so we generate a ton of cash. As you have seen in the last couple of quarters, we have used that cash flow. Of course, to continue to invest in the business. We pay our dividends every quarter. And we have been paying off the term loan that, as you probably know, had a variable interest rate and was getting a little expensive there. But we are done with that. And so now, again, looking forward, we have -- we will continue to drive a very strong free cash flow. It's not going to be every quarter 63%. We feel we have a sustainable plus 30% free cash flow margin on a fiscal or calendar year basis. But that's generating a lot of cash. And of course, we want to put that cash to work. We have optionality. We can switch on the buybacks or we can be active from an M&A point of view. And as you know, we -- yes, we focus on becoming a more diverse company despite the fact that we like the mobile business, but we focus on becoming a more diverse company in part through organic investments in that business but we have the optionality to accelerate through M&A, and we're working that."", 'Operator', ""And our next question coming from the line Thomas O'Malley with Barclays."", ""Thomas James O'Malley"", ""I just wanted to understand the underutilization charges into the March quarter. Obviously, gross margin being guided down slightly but you're seeing broad market step-up. So that mix should help you. Where are you seeing more of those underutilization charges? Are those as a percentage basis coming more on the mobile side or more on the broad market side?"", 'Kris Sennesael', ""So no, it's not really tied to one of the businesses. But we have been bringing down the utilization of our factories in part because the revenue is down year-over-year, but also because we have been focusing on driving down the inventory, right? We are taking our medicine now. We're not just building inventory to protect the gross margin. Now it takes a little bit of time for those underutilization charges to hit the P&L. It goes through an inventory cycle, right? That's why you continue to see slightly down gross margins on a sequential basis into the March quarter. But again, we have confidence that March is the bottom in terms of gross margin, and you will start seeing gradual improvements after the March quarter."", ""Thomas James O'Malley"", ""Helpful. And then just on the moving pieces for the back half of the fiscal year. It sounds like Android is getting better typical seasonality on the -- on your largest customer side in mobile. But I just want to get a feel for what you guys kind of are looking at in terms of the reacceleration of broad markets. If you look at March for your guidance, up slightly, you're still down 20% year-over-year. Do you think that kind of exiting your fiscal year, are you looking to kind of be growing year-over-year? Or just can you give us any kind of color on the pace of recovery there just because I know things are improving, but just how quickly is something that I think is a little more difficult to wrap our heads around."", 'Liam K. Griffin', ""Yes, sure. There's a lot there, but I think I get your point. So we definitely believe there's going to be more acceleration in revenue in the broad markets. We have a roster of incredible companies that we're serving right now from Cisco to Ford, Daimler, Nest, we talked about before and Google company. It's a very diverse set of products and customers in the broad markets portfolio, and that's what we like. Each one has their own vector. And we're continuing to nurture that and grow into that. And it also have a great opportunity on the sales side because we do have quite a bit of revenue in mobile. But the number of accounts that we haven't served yet is still very, very high, and that's a great opportunity for us to go after."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our last question in queue is coming from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham.', 'Nathaniel Quinn Bolton', ""Its been a couple of questions on the call that seem to be alluding to perhaps you guys may be losing content at your largest customer in the second half of the year. And I haven't heard you guys specifically address that. Can you give us any thoughts as you look into the second half, how you're feeling content-wise for that largest customer? And then I've got a follow-up for Kris on the gross margins."", 'Liam K. Griffin', 'Yes. I think we have a great position with our largest customer. Nothing really is concerning on that point. I mean we know exactly who we are and who they are, and we have great partnerships and will continue to drive success.', 'Nathaniel Quinn Bolton', ""Okay. And then for Kris, you've kind of talked about the gross margin drivers. Potentially pretty quick recovery post the March bottom. I'm just kind of curious. Is there -- can you give us any sense how quickly can you get back to 50%? Is that something you think you can do in the calendar year '24. And does it require you to get to a certain revenue level to get rid of some of those underutilization charges or are things like product mix, a much bigger factor as well as the cost reductions you've taken to getting back to that 50%, so it tends to be maybe a little bit less driven by a certain revenue level? Just what's the best way to think about getting back to 50%?"", 'Kris Sennesael', ""Yes. I mean, we guide only one quarter at a time, and there's a reason for it, right? There's a lot of puts and takes that go into the equation. But again, we have confidence that March, 45%, 46% guide is the bottom and we'll start seeing gradual improvement from there. We obviously want to get as fast as we can back to the 50%, right? And then once we get back to the 50%, we're not going to stop there. Our long-term target model calls for 53% gross margin, and we believe we can do that. There is no structural impairments in the business that will prevent us that. But obviously, yes, we need revenue growth and we need to get better factory utilization and that in combination with all the cost efficiencies internally and externally that we have been working on and will continue to work on, right? It gives us the conviction that we will get back to the 50% in a reasonable amount of time. And then we're going to keep driving it towards our target normal of 53%, but we'll provide an update on a quarter-by-quarter basis."", 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Griffin for any closing comments."", 'Liam K. Griffin', 'Thank you all for joining. Look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences.

Skyworks continued to execute well during the first fiscal quarter of 2024 despite a volatile macroeconomic environment. We delivered revenue of $1.202 billion. We posted earnings per share of $1.97 and generated $775 million of operating cash flow.', ""Free cash flow was also a record at $753 million or 63% free cash flow margin, which reflects strong working capital management and moderating capex intensity. Let's review both near- and long-term secular trends in our end markets. After two challenging years across Android ecosystems, we see signs that the industry is stabilizing. Excess supply conditions are abating and inventory levels in the distribution channel and at the OEM level are normalizing."", ""Customers are starting to restock inventory, albeit gradually as supply and demand dynamics improve and new phones are introduced into the market. Moreover, we've made strategic investments in product development, positioning us to compete for design wins and share gains focusing on highly integrated platforms for the leading mobile OEMs. We are pleased with our competitive positioning and technology road map and are poised to return to growth when the markets recover. Within broad markets, we see crosscurrents, but many factors are moving in the right direction."", 'In consumer IoT, we believe that we are past the bottom as inventory levels in the channel have normalized and demand signals are improving. Furthermore, we are executing on the upgrade cycle to Wi-Fi 6E and 7. We see significant design win momentum across our retail, carrier, and enterprise channels. These systems carry substantially higher dollar content.', 'Because of the addition of the new 6 gigahertz band and the inclusion of BAW filtering technology, we expect wireless infrastructure and traditional data center will remain a headwind throughout 2024, as OEMs continue to digest excess inventory. Despite this, we remain bullish on several new product cycles, including major design wins in Ethernet for high bandwidth networks and 400-gig and 800-gig optical module upgrades. Lastly, automotive and industrial markets are experiencing a near-term inventory correction. However, we see opportunities for growth in our automotive business, driven by higher adoption rates of connectivity in the vehicle, along with growing EV penetration, driving demand for our power isolation products.', 'Taken together, we anticipate December quarter represents the bottom in the broad markets business. There are several long-term secular growth dynamics that leverage our differentiated technology, including the proliferation of intelligent edge-connected IoT devices, automotive electrification and advanced safety systems and AI-enabled workloads, driving cloud and data center upgrades. Each of these trends require intricate connectivity engines underlying the need for speed, ultra-reliable low latency performance. In addition, 5G technology is expanding beyond the smartphone into more use cases in broad markets, including private cellular networks in factories and stadiums, customer premise equipment supporting Verizon and T-Mobile, and multiband automotive telematics and wearables to name a few.', 'We also remain bullish on the long-term RF content stored in smartphones, coupled with growing 5G penetration. We see increasing levels of complexity and content with each new generation. For example, 5G advanced is driving higher RF content, including the addition of satellite bands, 4x4 MIMO on the downlink and uplink, higher bandwidth, more carrier aggregation, upgrades to Wi-Fi and GPS and other innovations. Lastly, we are energized about the prospect of generative AI migrating to the smartphone, sparking a potential major upgrade cycle.', 'As the performance bar rises every year to support AI-enabled phones, the complexity requirements of RF will continue to increase, driving the need for more integration, lower power consumption, smaller footprint, and spectral efficiency. 5G is the ideal standard for on-device AI applications as it takes advantage of lower latency, faster transmission speeds, and higher frequency ranges. In addition, AI-enabled workloads are driving demand for high-speed connectivity for data-intensive infrastructure and cloud upgrades, accelerating the demand for our high-precision timing products. Turning to our quarterly business highlights.', ""We secured several design wins in infrastructure, including optical transport products with a major operator in India and timing devices for 5G small cells for private networks. We expanded the Wi-Fi design pipeline with Cisco's enterprise access points, Linksys tri-band mesh router, and TP-Link's Tri-Band Gaming Router. We increased design win momentum in automotive including telematics, infotainment systems, and onboard chargers across the leading OEMs. Lastly, in emerging IoT, we delivered next-generation smart energy solutions with Google's Nest Temperature Sensors and Itron's residential gas meters."", ""In summary, Skyworks delivered solid financial results despite a challenging macro environment. Our strong balance sheet, record cash flow, and profitability reflect our resilient business model, diverse customer base, and technology scale. With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for a discussion of last quarter's performance and our outlook for Q2 of fiscal 2024."", 'Kris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thanks, Liam. Skyworks' revenue for the first fiscal quarter of 2024 was $1.202 billion, slightly above the midpoint of our outlook. Mobile was approximately 71% of total revenue, an increase of 7% sequentially as we supported the ramp of new high-performance solutions at our largest customer. Android-related revenue with Google, Samsung, and the Chinese OEMs grew modestly sequentially."", 'Broad markets were approximately 29% of total revenue, down 18% sequentially, mostly driven by some specific inventory corrections in wireless infrastructure, automotive, and industrial. Gross profit was $557 million with gross margin at 46.4% in line with expectations. Gross margin was down 70 basis points sequentially, driven by an unfavorable mix shift resulting from lower broad markets revenue. Also, during Q1, we reduced our internal inventory by $193 million to $927 million, well below our target of $1 billion.', ""Operating expenses were $191 million, below the low end of the guidance range, given our ongoing focus on managing discretionary expenses while continuing to invest in our technology and product road maps. We generated $366 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 30.4%. We incurred $7 million of other expense and our effective tax rate was 11.7%, driving net income of $317 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.97, which is $0.02 above the guidance that we provided during the last earnings call. Skyworks' business model continues to generate very strong cash flow."", 'First fiscal quarter cash flow from operations increased to an all-time record of $775 million. Capital expenditures were reduced to $22 million or less than 2% of revenue, resulting in an all-time record free cash flow of $753 million or 63% free cash flow margin. Strong profitability combined with great working capital management and lowering the capex intensity of the business drove the record cash flow numbers. Also, during fiscal Q1, we paid $109 million in dividends and repaid the remaining $300 million on our term loan.', ""We ended the quarter with over $1 billion in cash and investments and $1 billion in debt, creating a net positive cash position and an optimal capital structure, providing us with superior flexibility and optionality. Now let's move on to our outlook for Q2 of fiscal 2024. We anticipate revenue between $1.02 billion and $1.07 billion. We expect our mobile business to be seasonally down consistent with historical patterns, while in broad markets, we anticipate modest growth of the December bottom as inventory levels are normalizing in certain end markets."", 'Gross margin is projected to be in the range of 45% to 46%, reflecting our seasonally weakest period of the year. We anticipate margin expansion during the remainder of 2024, benefiting from our disciplined management of our manufacturing and operational cost structure, both internal and external, along with higher factory utilization rates. We will also benefit from a favorable mix shift as our broad markets business recovers and accelerates. We expect operating expenses in the range of $193 million to $197 million, as we continue to make strategic investments in mobile and broad markets to drive share gains and increased diversification.', ""Below the line, we anticipate roughly $4 million in other expense and an effective tax rate of 11.5%, and a diluted share count of approximately 161 million shares. Accordingly, at the midpoint of the revenue range of $1.045 billion, we intend to deliver diluted earnings per share of $1.52. Operator, let's open the line for questions."", '', 'Operator', 'Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. [Operator instructions] Again, given time constraints, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. And our first question coming from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen.', 'Your line is open.', 'Matt Ramsay -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', ""Thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. Liam, I wanted to ask a bit about the broad market trends and it's obviously as the name implies, a diverse business. I was pleasantly, but I was a little bit surprised at the commentary that you had visibility for that business to be up so quickly, I guess, in March, it's been an inventory correction that's lasted a bit longer."", ""And some of your peers and in other companies, and we've seen industrial maybe get a little bit worse. So I mean, if you could maybe expand -- I know you did some in the prepared script, but if you could expand a little bit on maybe some of the individual end market trends you're seeing in broad markets. And maybe what the pace of this potential recovery starting from March and through the rest of the year could look like coming off the bottom? Thanks."", 'Liam Griffin -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. Sure. Absolutely. One of the interesting things here with our broad markets business is that there's so many opportunities that we haven't yet scaled."", ""So if we look at the business unlike some of the other mobile markets that are well-defined and there's still great opportunities. We look at the broad markets as more of an open-ended play for us. We're leveraging the technologies that we know how to work with. We have a great set of customers and that continues to grow and expand."", ""But yes, I mean, the team has done a really good job. This has been a tough year across the landscape across semis. We're happy to deliver some positive results here today, and we do think there's a turn. Again, in that portfolio, it's very diverse."", ""And mobile is a part of it, but the lion's share is really diversified products with some really great names as well. And most of those broad market companies, we have low share. There's still a tremendous amount of room to grow within those accounts. So I think those are some of the themes."", ""We've been working on this for quite a while. And finally putting up some meaningful top line, leveraging that broad markets business. The other thing, we continue to remind our customers and even the investors, a lot of the stuff we do in-house. So we're able to craft and curate specialty products."", 'We have our own fabs. We do things a little bit differently, and I think that helps our outcome.', 'Matt Ramsay -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', ""Got it. Thank you for that. I guess, as my follow-up, and this is going to be a thematic that we talk about in the PC market maybe this year and then into next year in the smartphone market, as you alluded to, sort of AI making its way into these products and potentially catalyzing a bit of an upgrade cycle. So I guess my question is, I mean, it's pretty straightforward for us to envision if you get air interface upgrades from 4G to 5G to what comes next, that can expand the RF TAM pretty meaningfully for your smartphone business."", 'Are you anticipating the growth potential from AI and smartphones to be primarily a unit driver for the market and therefore, for your company? Or are there things that you guys can do in AI-enabled phones that could meaningfully change the content? Or are we sort of waiting for the next air interface before the content could possibly inflect for the TAM again? Thanks.', 'Liam Griffin -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, I think it's a secular opportunity. This is a really unique period for us and in the industry. The way we look at it, you look at AI and a lot of that is really intense servers data center, and that's extremely important. Then you take it down kind of to the middle ground and then you're kind of in a different position."", ""But getting that to mobile is going to be a challenge. It's going to be a challenge, but it will happen. The consumer wants that. The consumer wants to have that compute power in their hand."", ""And it's not there yet, but we really believe that it will come. And I think it's going to set up the industry for a whole range of new opportunities still carrying radio frequency. So really excited about it. And again, we have the building blocks and the know-how to do really interesting things and do it account by account as well."", ""Not everybody wants the same solution. But we really do believe that heavy compute power has got to get matched up with something in your hand. That handheld device has got to step up. It's got to grow, it needs to be faster, lower latency."", ""And that's all good because those are problems that we can solve."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.', 'Chris Caso -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', 'Yes, thank you. Good evening. First question is about the Android market right now. It sounds like that market has finally grown for you after several quarters of inventory correction.', ""Can you speak to what your expectations are for that as you go through the year? I suppose at this point, the inventory correction is behind us. What's your level of optimism of getting back to more normal growth rates in that part of the business?"", 'Liam Griffin -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, Chris. Yes, you're right. It's been a little bit bumpy through the ecosystem here, but we see green shoots here popping up in Android. We know how to make these products."", 'I think there was a little bit of a soft spot there in the industry. The newer phones are coming up with a little bit more technology. We like that. And we can broaden that base.', ""So we are going to -- in the prepared remarks, we commented on that, and you should expect more growth in the Android ecosystem as we go forward. These are products that we can execute in the pipeline right now and give us continuing strength getting in -- going through '24 and '25."", 'Chris Caso -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', 'OK. As a follow-up on gross margins, if you speak to your expectations as we proceed through the year. One thing you mentioned is, it sounds like, your internal inventory was below target. Should we read that to mean utilization starts going higher? And what the effect on that will be on gross margins as we go through the year.', 'Kris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes, Chris. When you look at gross margins, we did 46.4% in Q1. We're still impacted there by underutilization, a little bit of a headwind from a mix point of view as well, that continues somewhat in the March quarter that we guided. But then when I look beyond the March quarter, we will see some really nice gross margin uplift in the remainder of the fiscal and the calendar year."", 'Part of that is higher utilization because we will no longer have to focus on a reduction of inventory. That is behind us. We reduced the inventory by almost $200 million in the December quarter. There is maybe still a little bit of opportunity there, but we feel good about the inventory levels where they are right now.', ""In addition to that, our broad markets business is going to grow faster than the mobile business. And so that gives us a little bit of a mix tailwind as well. And then in addition to that, we will really benefit from all the cost reductions that we've done over the last 12 months. We really focused on taking out structural parts of the cost structure."", 'We focused on operational efficiencies, driving yield improvements, and test time reductions. And in addition to internal cost, we also start seeing some benefit from external cost. And so when you put it all together, we will see some nice gradual gross margin improvement after the March quarter.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Your line is open.', 'Christopher Rolland -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst', ""Hey, guys, thank you for the question. I guess, first of all, in broad markets, if you can -- you had some great color as to how you break those out into kind of subsegments. I would love to know kind of what those look like, how they're trending. And then also, you alluded to the gross margin benefits as we move through the year."", ""I don't know if you can talk to the broad markets effect on gross margin as we move through the year."", 'Kris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah. So as it relates to broad markets, roughly 40%, 45% is IoT, more consumer IoT where we provide connectivity solutions in tablets, in wearables and PCs, your home connectivity with routers and all the access points that tap into that. There has been an inventory correction for multiple quarters, but we are getting toward the end of the inventory correction there. In addition to that, we see strong growth in that part of the market due to an uplift in content as we transition from Wi-Fi 6 into Wi-Fi 6E and 7 type of solutions that have a substantially higher RF content of Skyworks inside.', ""The next 30%, 35% is infrastructure, cloud, data center, enterprise networking. There is definitely an inventory correction going on in that part of the business that has started in the December quarter and will continue for a couple of quarters here. Nevertheless, that as well, I think in that market, we're very well positioned with some key customers, including our timing solutions for data centers. And then the last part is 20%, 25% is automotive and industrial."", ""There as well, I think we're well positioned. But you've heard it from many of our peers, there is an inventory correction going on. I don't think it will be a long drag-out inventory correction. It's probably December, March, two quarters of an inventory correction."", 'And then again, we are very well-positioned in that market. The connected car that eventually become an autonomous car, as well as EV, where we play with our power resolution solutions. And so again, when you put it all together, December is the bottom for our broad markets. We start seeing some sequential growth in March and beyond.', 'And as you know, yes, those markets typically have a higher gross margin compared to broad markets and that will help us to lift the gross margin.', 'Christopher Rolland -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst', ""Thank you for that color, Kris. You guys already talked about AI smartphones, but also you called out AI-enabled workloads driving cloud and data center upgrades. You also talked about 800-gig and this being an opportunity for you. Is that all related to your timing business from your acquisition? Or are there other ways that you're leveraging infrastructure around AI as well?"", 'Liam Griffin -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, largely through the infrastructure business that we have and some of the technology that we brought forth in our Silicon Labs deal, that's driving new vectors for us at Skyworks in the industrial markets and the data center markets, and it's a really vibrant growth source for us, and there's a lot of room to grow there as well. So lots more to do, but we've been making some great progress in that area."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Your line is open.', 'Edward Snyder -- Charter Equity Research -- Analyst', ""Thank you very much. I'd like to touch on, if we could, later this year, especially in mobile, it seems pretty clear at this point, given your largest customer scrambled to get their thing done by 2025 that all attention is on that and that we're going to have kind of the, I don't know, the best way to put it, but basically, kind of on hold -- not on hold, but a repeat of what we've seen before, not much new in the new one, and the competition is clear. So basically, I would expect in the fall, you're going to see more competition or you already know it now. Qualcomm is going to talk about it a lot on Wednesday."", ""So I'm trying to get a feel for the profile of your mobile business in the second half of the year. It sounds like it might be weaker than we have normally seen since Qualcomm share got to come out of somebody. If you could maybe characterize or just without getting into too much detail about what should we look at in terms of the mix in the second half, you're already talking about broad markets being much stronger. The mobile, by implication, is going to be a little bit weaker."", 'And is that mostly just organic growth? Or is there going to be some share loss? Or how do we think about that? And then I have a follow-up, please.', 'Liam Griffin -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Well, of course, we're deeply engaged with mobile in all angles, right? So we have a broad set of technologies that are applicable to multiple customers, including the largest. And that's our craft. That's the largest part of our portfolio."", ""We're growing across other markets, but certainly, the know-how that we have in RF, the ability to do things in-house, as you know, and the vectors that we put forth to drive this company. So we're all over it at every angle, and we're continuing to work on market share and new innovations. Delighting our customers, over current consumption, expanding the reach, doing a little bit more in the Android markets that we've kind of hinted around that. We're going to continue to execute there and still drive the best performance solutions that we can."", 'Edward Snyder -- Charter Equity Research -- Analyst', ""OK. Maybe I could follow up with a different angle here. You're going to grow in Android, you've kind of been under-earning there for several years, I think on purpose because you've done very well outside of that market. R&D is going up in order to address the products yet because it's a different product market."", ""But margins typically are lower in that whole market. Competition is a lot more intense, one, should we expect to see revenue growth in the second half? It's a little early, but revenue growth in the second half of the year, whether it's on an inventory snapback or new product wins and Android try to take up some of that slack. And then, Kris, maybe you could articulate how you're going to offset the margin, the natural margin dilution of Android over, say, the U.S. customer and then, of course, all mobile dilution against broad markets in the second half, if you could, please."", 'Thanks.', 'Liam Griffin -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. So yes, we're working on that. So there's a lot of opportunity for us to be more aggressive across the Android ecosystem. It's not just China."", ""You get names like Google and Samsung, they are tremendous opportunities that we can drive. We're built for this kind of stuff. And we have an end-to-end process that we continue to improve and refine at every turn. It helps our customers."", ""It helps our gross margin and our utilization. We have incredible factories, homegrown stuff that we have here in Irvine that really, really is the solution of choice as far as I know, with our technology know-how and the ability to be flexible and customizable to each account. And I think that's an asset for us, and I think we'll continue to drive that portfolio."", 'Kris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah, as it relates to gross margin, the gross margin profile of our mobile customers is on or about the same. And part of that is because you know, we are somewhat selective. We are not sliding down in the mid or low end of the market. We stay at the high end.', ""We stay at the high-performance part. And in that part of the market, you compete based on performance. It's not a price competition. You compete based on performance."", ""And again, that's why gross margins are somewhat the same in -- with all the customers in that segment."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.', 'Gary Mobley -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Hi, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. I want to start with a quick housekeeping question. What was the mix of revenue from your largest customer in the quarter?', 'Kris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer', 'The largest customer was approximately 73% of total revenue which is high, obviously, because the December quarter is the top quarter with the largest customer. And given that the broad markets was bottoming out in December, you get to on or about 73%. Obviously, when you look forward on a full year basis or even in March, it will be well below the 73%.', 'Gary Mobley -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""OK. Thank you, Kris. I want to ask Ed's previous question in perhaps a more direct way. Doing the math, it would indicate that your Android-related mobile customers are trending now at about a $400 million annualized rate or at least that was the case for the December quarter."", ""But in the past, fiscal year '22, I believe that level is closer to $800 million. And so my question is, if we see a rebound in the Android market and based on your design win footprint that you currently have today, can we expect that segment of your business to bounce back to the previous level?"", 'Liam Griffin -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, absolutely. We've got, as I said, a lot of opportunity to go harder and stronger and more direct on the Android ecosystem. We absolutely have the technology to make it work. We have the manufacturing scale and know-how to get it done."", ""So yes, I mean, it's certainly a play for us there, and I think we'll take advantage."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question coming from the line Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.', 'Karl Ackerman -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst', ""Yeah, thank you. Two questions, if I may. On mobile, your largest customer is down on a seasonal basis in March. But at the same time, given you're improving execution within Android, does Android grow sequentially in March? How do we think about that within mobile, please? And I have a follow-up."", 'Kris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah. Android is kind of flattish, slightly up into March.', 'Karl Ackerman -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst', ""Got it. Thanks for that, Kris. At the same time, I do want to touch on mobile one more time. It's been asked in several different ways, but I guess I'll try it again."", ""You are less tied to China than peers, but are you seeing any changes to the competitive landscape in China? I ask because there are anecdotes supporting China RF suppliers winning content in low band SAW and TC-SAW. But at the same time, as you indicated earlier, Kris, you're not necessarily competing in that particular area of the market. So if you can just highlight the competitive landscape and what you're seeing in China, that would be very helpful. Thank you."", 'Liam Griffin -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. I mean the OVX players, we do some reasonable business there. We could probably do a little bit more on the Android side, but we really don't step down much further there. We're not in the low end at all."", ""We could be, but I think we generate a better outcome for our customers and our shareholders to drive that mid and high end. So it's something we can do. But I think the way our business runs, I think, we're more accretive as a company going down the playbook that we have today."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.', 'Blake Friedman -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'This is Blake Friedman on for Vivek. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus on opex, it seems spending has returned to levels seen prior to the industry downturn. So I was curious how we should think about the trajectory of opex for the remainder of the year.', 'Kris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah. So as it relates to opex, I think we did a good job in the December quarter at $191 million. We are guiding with a little step-up in March to $195 million. Keep in mind that this is the start of a new calendar year.', 'And so you get a reset of the social charges and some of that, that kicks in. In addition to that, we are going to continue to invest in our technology and product road maps. We feel good about our position with our mobile players. As Liam articulated, we have plenty of opportunity in our broad markets.', ""And we're going to continue to invest. Now we're going to do it the Skyworks way. We focus on efficiency, effectiveness. We're not wasting any dollars here."", ""But yes, we're going to continue to invest. And so opex will continue to gradually move up in the remainder of the fiscal and calendar year."", 'Blake Friedman -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Got it. And then kind of quickly circling back on some of your comments. I know the broad markets business is a key initiative for Skyworks. And just with the business kind of returning to this cash positive level and generating pretty strong cash flow from here.', 'Just curious how you think about M&A and anything, in particular, you guys would look to add to the broad markets assets.', 'Kris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. First of all, the cash flow is outstanding, and it's definitely something that we focus on. And so we generate a ton of cash. As you have seen in the last couple of quarters, we have used that cash flow."", 'Of course, to continue to invest in the business. We pay our dividends every quarter. And we have been paying off the term loan that, as you probably know, had a variable interest rate and was getting a little expensive there. But we are done with that.', ""And so now, again, looking forward, we will continue to drive a very strong free cash flow. It's not going to be every quarter 63%. We feel we have a sustainable plus 30% free cash flow margin on a fiscal or calendar year basis. But that's generating a lot of cash."", ""And of course, we want to put that cash to work. We have optionality. We can switch on the buybacks or we can be active from an M&A point of view. And as you know, yes, we focus on becoming a more diverse company despite the fact that we like the mobile business, but we focus on becoming a more diverse company in part through organic investments in that business but we have the optionality to accelerate through M&A, and we're working that."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. And our next question coming from the line Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Your line is open."", ""Thomas O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst"", ""Hey, thanks for taking my questions, guys. I just wanted to understand the underutilization charges into the March quarter. Obviously, gross margin being guided down slightly but you're seeing broad market step-up. So that mix should help you."", 'Where are you seeing more of those underutilization charges? Are those as a percentage basis coming more on the mobile side or more on the broad market side?', 'Kris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer', ""So, no, it's not really tied to one of the businesses. But we have been bringing down the utilization of our factories in part because the revenue is down year over year, but also because we have been focusing on driving down the inventory, right? We are taking our medicine now. We're not just building inventory to protect the gross margin. Now it takes a little bit of time for those underutilization charges to hit the P&L."", ""It goes through an inventory cycle, right? That's why you continue to see slightly down gross margins on a sequential basis into the March quarter. But again, we have confidence that March is the bottom in terms of gross margin, and you will start seeing gradual improvements after the March quarter."", ""Thomas O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst"", 'Helpful. And then just on the moving pieces for the back half of the fiscal year. It sounds like Android is getting better typical seasonality on your largest customer side in mobile. But I just want to get a feel for what you guys kind of are looking at in terms of the reacceleration of broad markets.', ""If you look at March for your guidance, up slightly, you're still down 20% year over year. Do you think that kind of exiting your fiscal year, are you looking to kind of be growing year over year? Or just can you give us any kind of color on the pace of recovery there just because I know things are improving, but just how quickly is something that I think is a little more difficult to wrap our heads around. Thank you."", 'Liam Griffin -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, sure. There's a lot there, but I think I get your point. So we definitely believe there's going to be more acceleration in revenue in the broad markets. We have a roster of incredible companies that we're serving right now from Cisco to Ford, Daimler, Nest, we talked about before and Google company."", ""It's a very diverse set of products and customers in the broad markets portfolio, and that's what we like. Each one has their own vector. And we're continuing to nurture that and grow into that. And it also have a great opportunity on the sales side because we do have quite a bit of revenue in mobile."", ""But the number of accounts that we haven't served yet is still very, very high, and that's a great opportunity for us to go after."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our last question in queue is coming from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham. Your line is open.', 'Quinn Bolton -- Needham and Company -- Analyst', ""Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. It's been a couple of questions on the call that seem to be alluding to perhaps you guys may be losing content at your largest customer in the second half of the year. And I haven't heard you guys specifically address that. Can you give us any thoughts as you look into the second half, how you're feeling content-wise for that largest customer? And then I've got a follow-up for Kris on the gross margins."", 'Liam Griffin -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. I think we have a great position with our largest customer. Nothing really is concerning on that point. I mean we know exactly who we are and who they are, and we have great partnerships and will continue to drive success.', 'Quinn Bolton -- Needham and Company -- Analyst', ""OK. And then for Kris, you've kind of talked about the gross margin drivers. Potentially pretty quick recovery post the March bottom. I'm just kind of curious."", ""Can you give us any sense how quickly can you get back to 50%? Is that something you think you can do in the calendar year '24. And does it require you to get to a certain revenue level to get rid of some of those underutilization charges or are things like product mix, a much bigger factor, as well as the cost reductions you've taken to getting back to that 50%, so it tends to be maybe a little bit less driven by a certain revenue level? Just what's the best way to think about getting back to 50%?"", 'Kris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. I mean, we guide only one quarter at a time, and there's a reason for it, right? There's a lot of puts and takes that go into the equation. But again, we have confidence that March, 45%, 46% guide is the bottom and we'll start seeing gradual improvement from there. We obviously want to get as fast as we can back to the 50%, right?

INC.', 'DISCUSSION REGARDING THE USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES', 'Our earnings release contains some or all of the following financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""): (i) non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, (ii) non-GAAP operating income and operating margin, (iii) non-GAAP net income, (iv) non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, and (v) non-GAAP free cash flow and free cash flow margin. As set forth in the ""Unaudited Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" table found above, we derive such non-GAAP financial measures by excluding certain expenses and other items from the respective GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operating performance and compare it against past periods, make operating decisions, forecast for future periods, compare our operating performance against peer companies, and determine payments under certain compensation programs. These non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain non-recurring expenses and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods and competitors more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations, or reduce management’s ability to make forecasts.', 'We provide investors with non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating income and operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, and non-GAAP free cash flow and free cash flow margin because we believe it is important for investors to be able to closely monitor and understand changes in our ability to generate income from ongoing business operations. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures give investors an additional method to evaluate historical operating performance and identify trends, an additional means of evaluating period-over-period operating performance and a method to facilitate certain comparisons of our operating results to those of our peer companies. We believe that providing non-GAAP operating income and operating margin allows investors to assess the extent to which our ongoing operations impact our overall financial performance. We also believe that providing non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share allows investors to assess the overall financial performance of our ongoing operations by eliminating the impact of share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, settlements, gains, losses, and impairments, restructuring-related charges, and certain tax items which may not occur in each period presented and which may represent non-cash items unrelated to our ongoing operations. We further believe that providing non-GAAP free cash flow and free cash flow margin provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability, and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders. We believe that disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures contributes to enhanced financial reporting transparency and provides investors with added clarity about complex financial performance measures.', 'We calculate non-GAAP gross profit by excluding from GAAP gross profit, share-based compensation expense and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. We calculate non-GAAP operating income by excluding from GAAP operating income, share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, settlements, gains, losses, and impairments, and restructuring-related charges. We calculate non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share by excluding from GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share, share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, settlements, gains, losses, and impairments, restructuring-related charges, and certain tax items. We calculate non-GAAP free cash flow by deducting capital expenditures from GAAP net cash provided by operating activities. We exclude certain items identified above from the respective non-GAAP financial measure referenced above for the reasons set forth with respect to each such excluded item below:', 'Share-Based Compensation Expense - because (1) the total amount of expense is partially outside of our control because it is based on factors such as stock price volatility and interest rates, which may be unrelated to our performance during the period in which the expense is incurred, (2) it is an expense based upon a valuation methodology premised on assumptions that vary over time, and (3) the amount of the expense can vary significantly between companies due to factors that can be outside of the control of such companies.', 'Acquisition-Related Expenses and Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles - including such items as, when applicable, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration, fair value charges incurred upon the sale of acquired inventory, acquisition-related expenses, and amortization of acquired intangible assets because they are not considered by management in making operating decisions and we believe that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to our future business operations and thereby including such charges does not necessarily reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges or reversals are incurred.', 'Settlements, Gains, Losses, and Impairments - because such settlements, gains, losses, and impairments (1) are not considered by management in making operating decisions, (2) are infrequent in nature, (3) are generally not directly controlled by management, (4) do not necessarily reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are recognized, and/or (5) can vary significantly in amount between companies and make comparisons less reliable.', 'Restructuring and Other Charges - because these charges have no direct correlation to our future business operations and including such charges or reversals does not necessarily reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges or reversals are incurred.', 'Certain Income Tax Items - including certain deferred tax charges and benefits that do not result in a current tax payment or tax refund and other adjustments, including but not limited to, items unrelated to the current fiscal year or that are not indicative of our ongoing business operations.', 'The non-GAAP financial measures presented in the table above should not be considered in isolation and are not an alternative for the respective GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each such non-GAAP financial measure. Investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on these non-GAAP financial measures and are urged to review and consider carefully the adjustments made by management to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to arrive at these non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures may have limited value as analytical tools because they may exclude certain expenses that some investors consider important in evaluating our operating performance or ongoing business performance. Further, non-GAAP financial measures are likely to have limited value for purposes of drawing comparisons between companies as a result of different companies potentially calculating similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures in different ways because non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.', 'Our earnings release contains forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of our 2024 fiscal year (""Q2 2024""). We provide this non-GAAP measure to investors on a prospective basis for the same reasons (set forth above) that we provide it to investors on a historical basis. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of our forward-looking estimate of Q2 2024 GAAP diluted earnings per share to a forward-looking estimate of Q2 2024 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share because certain information needed to make a reasonable forward-looking estimate of GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q2 2024 (other than estimated share-based compensation expense of $0.25 to $0.35 per diluted share, estimated amortization of intangibles of $0.20 to $0.30 per diluted share and certain tax items of -$0.15 to $0.00 per diluted share) is difficult to predict and estimate and is often dependent on future events that may be uncertain or outside of our control. Such events may include unanticipated changes in our GAAP effective tax rate, unanticipated one-time charges related to asset impairments (fixed assets, inventory, intangibles, or goodwill), unanticipated acquisition-related expenses, unanticipated settlements, gains, losses, and impairments, and other unanticipated non-recurring items not reflective of ongoing operations. The probable significance of these unknown items, in the aggregate, is estimated to be in the range of $0.00 to $0.15 in quarterly earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Our forward-looking estimates of both GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance may differ materially from our actual results and should not be relied upon as statements of fact.', '[a]

Corporation (NYSE:VFC) over the past 12 months. An insider's optimism about the company's prospects is a positive sign."", 'While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.', ' Check out our latest analysis for V.F ', ""In the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Interim Independent Chairman of Board Richard Carucci bought US$764k worth of shares at a price of US$19.09 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being US$17.22). It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. It is generally more encouraging if they paid above the current price, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels."", 'In the last twelve months V.F insiders were buying shares, but not selling.

For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.', ""Over the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at V.F. Specifically, Independent Director Matthew John Shattock bought US$598k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any sales whatsoever. This makes one think the business has some good points."", ""Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insiders own 0.9% of V.F shares, worth about US$63m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders."", ""It is good to see the recent insider purchase. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses. Insiders likely see value in V.F shares, given these transactions (along with notable insider ownership of the company).

I'm pleased to discuss some of the highlights from the fourth quarter and full year 2023 and, of course, the compelling year we have had. I would like to begin with a few reflections for -- on 2023. As you know, we missed our initial internal projections and Street expectations predominantly related to our COVID products, which affected our stock price performance. Despite, however, this challenging year, there were a few great things that happened in 2023 that may have gotten lost amidst the missed expectations. First, in 2023, Pfizer impacted the lives of more than 620 million (sic) [618 million] people approximately around the world. We believe there is no other company that can reach as many people and patients as Pfizer. If you multiply this with our brand equity and awareness, it creates a connection with consumers that can be a very strong asset for us. Second, despite the decline in revenue from our COVID products, as of the reported results of the first 9 months of 2023, we were the #1 pharmaceutical company in terms of revenues from pharma-only products, a marked improvement from our fourth position in 2019. Next, 2023 was a record year for FDA approvals with 9 new molecular entity approvals from Pfizer and many more approvals for new indications in already approved products, marking a very productive year of pipeline execution for Pfizer. Finally, we closed the Seagen acquisition. In the current regulatory environment, being able to close such a large acquisition demonstrates our ability to successfully engage with regulatory bodies. Our deliberate and strategic efforts throughout 2023 created a strong foundation to support us. We are now focused on maximizing the opportunities that have positioned us for success, and our team is driving confidently as we start 2024. From the advent of penicillin to the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer has been at the forefront of medical and pharmaceutical breakthroughs for the past 175 years. This year is our 175th anniversary, that have not only changed patients' lives but have changed history. Our strategy to continue to build on our proud history of innovation and commercial excellence is supported by the power and strength of our unmatched global scale and footprint spanning commercial, financial, medical, regulatory, manufacturing and government relations. We have a clear view on how we will deliver operational, commercial and financial success across our business. Our confidence stems from the opportunity we have to bring additional focus to our business by executing 5 strategic priorities. We will get into each in more detail, but the 5 key priorities for Pfizer this year are: first of all, to achieve a world-class oncology leadership; to deliver the next wave of pipeline innovation; to maximize the performance of our new products; expand margins by realigning our cost base; allocate capital to enhance shareholder value. I'm confident that Pfizer is well positioned to execute and that we can deliver meaningful value for our patients and our shareholders. Let's start with our first priority, which is to achieve a world-class oncology leadership, which I believe we are in a strong position to do. As a reminder, 1 in 3 people will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. Oncology represents one of the largest and fastest-growing therapeutic areas. Completing the acquisition of Seagen doubled our oncology research and resources overnight and meaningfully expanded the reach and medical impact of our U.S. commercial and medical footprint, with a range of portfolio expansion opportunities boosted by Seagen's broad and deep pipeline. Seagen's in-line medicines are expected to immediately enhance Pfizer's top line growth, and our combined portfolio provides the opportunity to lead genitourinary cancers and be a leader in breast cancer and deliver at least 8 potential blockbuster products by 2030. We look forward to providing more information about our oncology platform at our Pfizer Oncology Innovation Day on February 29. As we build our leadership position, we have multiple potential key oncology catalysts in 2024 that we are acutely focused on. On the commercial side, the PADCEV launch in locally advanced/metastatic bladder cancer in combination with pembrolizumab and XTANDI launch in nonmetastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. We are excited by the strength of our PADCEV EV-302 data and recent FDA approval, as it represents an opportunity to broaden the reach of this potentially practice-changing, platinum-free regimen to even more patients in the frontline metastatic urothelial cancer setting. Essentially, the recent approval doubles the addressable population, which had already doubled this past spring. We are also looking forward to Phase III data readouts from vepdegestrant in second-line HR-positive metastatic breast cancer; and Braftovi in first-line BRAF colorectal cancer. We also plan to advance our late-stage pipeline with Phase III starts of CDK4 in post-CDK4/6 metastatic breast cancer and B6A in non-small cell lung cancer. Building on Pfizer's potential medicines, the pipeline across breast cancer, genitourinary cancer, hematology and CRC, our CDK4 inhibitor could be a compelling follow-on to IBRANCE. And finally, in the early-stage pipeline, we look forward to initiating first inpatient studies of 4 new ADC candidates this year, where we believe we have acquired the expertise to be a leader. Our second priority is to deliver the next wave of pipeline innovation with discovery and development across our therapeutic areas outside of Oncology in Vaccines, Anti-Infectives, Internal Medicine Metabolic Diseases and Inflammation and Immunology. In 2024, we plan to continue to make meaningful investments in R&D. In fact, Pfizer's R&D budget is one of the highest in the industry and supports our robust pipeline. We are pursuing cutting-edge science across modalities and platforms to deliver the next generation of potential breakthroughs. We are also leveraging AI and other digital tools across the value chain to increase speed and success rates. Starting first with our fourth-generation PCV vaccine candidate, which recently entered the clinic and received FDA Fast Track designation. Building on our deep heritage with Prevnar, we aim to solidify our leadership in the pneumococcal vaccine space by increasing valency and serotype immunogenicity while maintaining our unique FDA label, which includes both IPD and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults. Respiratory vaccine combinations are another area where we are poised to lead, building upon our successful COVID vaccine. With the first-generation stand-alone mRNA flu vaccine, data demonstrated relative efficacy versus a recommended flu vaccine in 18 to 64-year-olds, but did not meet success criteria for immunogenicity for the B strains.Our second-generation flu vaccine was tested in a Phase II COVID/flu combination study for 18 to 64-years-old and has shown encouraging results in both the A and the B strains. This new construct has now moved already into a Phase III COVID/flu combination trial. Moving next to GBT601. Our next-generation and potentially best-in-class HbS polymerization inhibitor represents a potential step-wise evolution over Oxbryta for sickle cell disease. Recent data presented at ASH 2023 demonstrated multiple blood parameters approaching normal ranges with treatment, suggesting GBT601 may have the potential to deliver strong efficacy with the convenience of a once-daily pill. We have reaffirmed our commitment to our emerging cardiometabolic programs, with several early clinical development compounds. On the other end of the weight management spectrum, we have ponsegromab, our GDF-15 neutralizing antibody for cancer cachexia with Phase II data expected later this year. Ponsegromab has the potential to be first-in-class and the first FDA-approved treatment for cancer cachexia, which accounts for 20%, 30% of all cancer deaths, a significant statistic. Our third priority is, of course, to maximize the performance of our new products and core franchises through a relentless focus on execution to continue growing our top line. To do this, we are prioritizing and focusing while leveraging data to make changes quickly and adapt. Our Pfizer U.S. Commercial and our Pfizer International Commercial organizations will leverage a more focused, efficient structure to drive executional excellence in their respective markets and expand reach to drive growth over the next several years. To discuss a few examples, we continue to be very enthusiastic about the potential of Nurtec to help the more than 1 billion people living with migraines worldwide. As access and prescriptions in the U.S. and globally continue to increase, we will continue to focus on direct-to-consumer marketing and reducing barriers to access and affordability for health care practitioners and patients. With Oxbryta, we will continue to educate health care practitioners and patients on the importance of proactively treating the underlying cause of sickle cell disease by reframing treatment goals to chronic/proactive treatment. With Abrysvo, we are focused on increasing overall RSV market growth and market share by establishing RSV vaccination as a year-round discussion and expanding our retail contracting and offerings. With ELREXFIO, we are focused on educating health care practitioners in both academic institutions and in the community, awareness building and new patient trialists. Coming off the initial launch of VELSIPITY, we are focused on helping ensure patient access to VELSIPITY as a first-line advanced therapy oral option. With LITFULO, we continue to accelerate the consideration of advanced systemic treatments for appropriate alopecia areata patients and further unlock access to LITFULO. In addition, of course, we continue to protect and grow our core franchises and key blockbusters, including Prevnar, VYNDAQEL and Eliquis, while exploring further opportunities to advance a number of innovative combination regimens. We believe we are well positioned to bring our global commercial manufacturing and supply capabilities to accelerate current and future marketed products. We believe all these components support our growth potential through 2024 and drive growth potential into 2025. We plan to provide updates throughout the year on how we are advancing these strategic priorities. And with that, I will turn the call over to Dave, who will discuss our financial performance, our initiative to realign our cost base and our capital allocation strategy to enhance shareholder value. Dave?"", 'David M. Denton', ""Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. As we enter 2024, we are clearly focused on a small number of critical priorities. These priorities include building a world-class Oncology organization; ensuring the next wave of pipeline innovations; maximizing our new product portfolio performance with a more efficient commercial structure; and finally, rightsizing our cost base. With that said, I'll start this morning with our full year and our fourth quarter results, then I'll touch upon our capital allocation priorities. I'll finish this morning with a few comments on our 2024 guidance and the near-term expectations that set this year as a foundational year to drive our growth potential in the latter half of the decade. For the full year 2023, we recorded revenues of $58.5 billion, achieving 7% operational growth, solidly in line with our expectations when excluding contributions from both COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID. The significant sales decline in our COVID products, including a $3.5 billion revenue reversal for PAXLOVID, were the primary driver of an overall 41% operational decrease year-over-year. And with the expectation that Seagen will be a substantial growth contributor in 2024 and beyond, our full year and fourth quarter results include approximately $120 million in Seagen product revenue after the close of the acquisition on December 14. On the bottom line, we reported full year 2023 diluted EPS of $0.37 a share, a 93% year-over-year decline and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.84, down 72% versus LY. This decline is primarily due to a significant decrease in sales for both COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID; the impact of the $3.5 billion reversal for PAXLOVID revenues in the fourth quarter related to an expected return of an estimated 6.5 million unused EUA-labeled treatment courses from the U.S. government; and finally, a noncash inventory write-off and other charges of $5.6 billion recorded in the third quarter for PAXLOVID and, to a lesser extent, COMIRNATY. Now turning to the quarter, I'd like to highlight that we delivered a solid 8% year-over-year operational revenue growth, again, excluding COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID. Contributing to the strong performance were our newly approved RSV vaccine as well as VYNDAQEL and Eliquis, partly offset by lower revenues from IBRANCE and the Prevnar family. However, our Q4 results, both top and bottom line, continued to be significantly and negatively impacted by our COVID products on a year-on-year basis. Revenues declined 42% operationally, the result of a significant decrease in both COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID sales. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased by 12 percentage points, driven primarily by the $3.5 billion noncash PAXLOVID revenue reversal and, to a much lesser extent, unfavorable changes in sales mix. Overall, our adjusted operating expenses declined 10% compared to Q4 of last year. Adjusted SI&A expenses increased 1% operationally in the quarter, primarily driven by the timing of marketing and promotional activities, including those related to recently launched and acquired products. And consistent with our strategy, we have been focused on reprioritizing our R&D spending to enhance overall returns. Adjusted R&D expenses decreased 24% operationally, driven primarily by lower spending across both vaccine programs and certain acquired assets as well as lower compensation-related expenses. Both our reported diluted loss per share of $0.60 and our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.10 for the quarter were negatively impacted by the $3.5 billion PAXLOVID revenue reversal, which dampened EPS by approximately $0.54. Continued declines in both COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID sales also negatively affected our performance in the quarter. Foreign exchange movements had an immaterial impact compared to last year's fourth quarter. As we are increasingly focused on prioritizing our investments to drive forward-looking growth, our GAAP results include a $1.4 billion intangible asset impairment charge associated with etrasimod, based on changes in the development plans for additional indications and overall revenue expectations. But I will point out that this product is still projected to contribute over $1 billion in peak annual sales. Additionally, we recorded a nearly $1 billion intangible asset impairment for Prevnar 13, reflecting a transition to vaccines with higher serotypes coverage. As discussed in prior quarters, our capital allocation strategy is designed to enhance shareholder value and is based on 3 core pillars: first is growing our dividend; second is reinvesting in the business; and finally is making share repurchases after delevering our balance sheet. For 2023, we returned $9.2 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend; we've invested $10.7 billion in internal R&D; and finally, we've invested approximately $44 billion in completed business development transactions, net of acquired cash, essentially for the acquisition of Seagen. Our expectation is to maintain and grow our dividend while delevering our capital structure, with a gross leverage target of 3.25x and a goal to preserve our credit rating and access to Tier 1 commercial paper. Upon achieving our delevering goals, we anticipate returning to a more balanced capital allocation strategy, inclusive of share repurchases. Now given that we issued our full year 2024 revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance on December 13, let me just hit a few of the highlights. We expect total company full year '24 revenues to be in the range of $58.5 billion to $61.5 billion, which reflects our expectation of strong contributions across our product portfolio. Importantly, excluding COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID, we anticipate operational revenue growth of 8% to 10%. We remain confident on delivering at least $4 billion of net savings from our cost realignment program by the end of this year. We believe rightsizing the cost base will put us on a strong footing towards margin expansion and increased operational efficiency moving forward. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.25 a share for the full year of 2024. And as a reminder, this range is inclusive of an anticipated $0.40 of earnings dilution from the Seagen acquisition and again, with the vast majority of this dilution resulting from the financing costs associated with the deal. Cycling into 2024, we have significantly invested in our business to fuel our long-term growth, and the foundation is set to deliver on our commitments to enhance long-term shareholder value. We are acutely focused on driving near-term performance while solidifying our growth expectations for the back half of this decade. And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Albert to begin our Q&A session."", 'Albert Bourla', ""Thank you. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, please assemble the queue."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions)And our first question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities.', 'Robyn Kay Shelton Karnauskas', ""So maybe I'm stupid on this question, but if I'm doing your math for your guidance of margins in low 70s for fiscal year '24, by my math, the margins for other biopharma would have to drop to about 60% in order to balance out the other margins. Can you just help me understand your guidance and triangulate that with your top line and bottom line guidance and triangulating that with your margin guidance?"", 'David M. Denton', ""Yes. So maybe -- this is Dave. Correct. Our guidance for gross margin, although we don't provide it specifically, we've given some color around the fact that it's approximately 70%. Obviously, our focus going forward is to improve our margin rate and, more importantly, improve our operating margin rate to the bottom line. I would -- as we look here at 2024, there's a few things that have compressed our margin rate versus as COVID has declined year-over-year, that has served to, I'll say, delever, if you will, the P&L as COVID takes up and cover some fixed overhead. But importantly, what's happening is we are in-sourcing products that we've recently acquired. Those -- that in-sourcing requires time before we get up to peak yield and performance so that in the short term, dampens gross margin rate but has a trajectory to improve gross margin rate over time. And then secondly, we have new launches that are coming online late in Q3 or -- late in the second half of 2023 and moving into '24. Again, those are not at peak performance yet. That will ultimately improve gross margin rate as we cycle into later years. And then finally, I will say that over the last several years, we have absorbed some amount of inflation within our cost of goods sold. That is an area of opportunity for us as we think about improving performance longer term. So I hope that gives you some color."", 'Operator', 'Next, we have Carter Gould with Barclays.', 'Carter Lewis Gould', ""Maybe another kind of finance question here. Certainly, R&D in 4Q was meaningfully below kind of where you guys had set the guide there. How should we think about that? Does it just reflect sort of faster cost cutting? Is it just more an artifact of the later integration of SGEN? And clearly, you're reaffirming your guide but just maybe if you can just sort of check that box for us, that would be helpful."", 'David M. Denton', ""Sure. Probably not much to read into that. Obviously, R&D came in a little favorable than our expectations previously. Part of this is the fact that we are very focused on our -- realigning our cost base, so consistent with the program. And then secondly, there probably is some timing that's dampening R&D in the fourth quarter that will slide into 2024 and into 2025. So there is some timing implications to that performance level. But I think importantly, back to my prepared remarks, is our focus is on delivering net savings of $4 billion. And if you look through the end of 2023, about half of that we've achieved already. We're now focused on achieving the additional $2 billion or so as we cycle into 2024, and all eyes are on that objective."", 'Albert Bourla', 'Thank you, Dave. We have high confidence on the number that we gave.', 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Louise Chen with Cantor.', 'Louise Alesandra Chen', 'Wanted to ask you on your Prevnar franchise. First of all, for the fourth-generation PCV, could you give more color on how it compares in contrast with Prevnar 20? And then just on the Prevnar order timing issue, was that U.S. or ex U.S.?', 'Albert Bourla', ""Thank you. Aamir, why don't you take the Prevnar question? And then maybe Alexandre, you can add a little bit color on the situation in the U.S. So what is the situation in Prevnar with the orders?"", 'Aamir Malik', ""Yes. So Louise, with regards to Prevnar, with the pediatric business, we often see some lumpiness in quarterly revenues given the timing and impact of CDC orders, so it's difficult to kind of map that all out quarter by quarter. So you should expect that on the pediatric business. But the pediatric business, otherwise, we're very happy with how our launch is progressing and the growth momentum that we see there. On the adult business, I think it's different in the sense that we have a 96% market share that we closed the adult business with at the end of the year. But it's really important to keep in mind that we are operating in a market where the patient pool is steadily decreasing. There was a big catch-up opportunity versus the prior recommendation, and we've worked through that catch-up opportunity already. So the remaining patients are generally those that are aging into the 65-plus population as well as those with underlying medical conditions, and those are harder to activate patients. So we expect that business to continue to face that smaller patient population going forward. And we also expect competition with V116 emerging that will make the adult market more competitive, but we see a lot of growth potential in the pediatric market."", 'Albert Bourla', 'Thank you. Alexandre, how was the Prevnar situation in the last quarter or in the year in international markets?', 'Alexandre de Germay', ""Yes. Louise, good question. As you know, the majority of our ex U.S. business is driven by tender. And of course, we book the sales when we ship the product. It doesn't reflect utilization. And then the government schedule their campaign in their respective markets. The reality is that we continue to have an IP exclusivity in 113 markets around the world. And at the same time, we continue to progress both on the pediatric, as you saw last week, the CHMP positive opinion, and now we're going to go into the final approval and then vaccine technical committees and pricing in all those markets, so that will take a bit of time. But at the same time, we see some positive traction on the adult franchise, where we have launched in over 30 markets. And we see some very good developments with the recommendation of the vaccine technical committee. To give you an example, we used to have very limited access on our Prevnar 13 in country like Germany or France and U.K. And we just received a recommendation from the VTC in Germany that actually recommended usage of Prevnar 20 in old adults over 60 as well as at-risk population from 18 to 59, which we believe we have a significant growth opportunity in increasing vaccination in the adult population ex U.S."", 'Albert Bourla', 'And Mikael, to conclude what about the fourth-generation Prevnar?', 'Mikael Dolsten', ""Yes. I'm very pleased that the fourth generation has entered clinical studies. It has a Fast Track designation from U.S. FDA, indicating a unique product offering. And it includes some of the new technology we have developed that gives us a really cutting-edge toolbox, whether it's chemistry, carriers or reformulations. And of course, it relies on the unique Pfizer platform to have potential prevention of both invasive disease, which is the smaller disease burden and pneumococcal disease, which causes more than 150,000 hospitalizations. And to the best of my knowledge, we are the only one that can address both of them. So we feel very good about that entry."", 'Albert Bourla', ""Thank you, Mikael. So to summarize the Prevnar, which I know it is in the minds of all, let's start with the commercial front. In the U.S., clearly, the adult opportunity, we have taken the cream basically of the catch-up opportunity. This is happening once you are getting a recommendation from CDC for a catch-up. This market, the pool of patients has been largely exhausted. We have already 96% market share of that. So this is not a market, the adult from now that we expect that will continuously grow in the U.S.Pediatric, very different story because our market share is now growing, and we have indications that we'll continue growing very strongly. So we expect in the U.S., the Prevnar situation to be a strong growth story in pediatric. International, both, we expect to see growth because the products have just been launched, and then the recommendations are following. So there is a delay in international higher than usually there is in the U.S. So we expect to see growth in adult and in the pediatric.I want to reemphasize that we have basically exclusivity of Prevnar 13 in more than 100 countries, 113 countries in NI of tenders. And we plan to convert that now to 20. And then on the fourth generation, we are moving full speed. We think that our expertise will allow us to build a polyvalent vaccine that will really compete very, very nicely as a fourth generation and we will do that successfully and fast. So that's the story."", 'Operator', 'Next, we have a question from Trung Huynh with UBS.', 'Trung Chuong Huynh', ""Trung from UBS. Two, please. So in your prepared remarks, you noted you took a $1.4 billion impairment charge associated with etrasimod. Can you add more color here? What prompted that reevaluation? And any feedback of how that launch has gone? Secondly, on Abrysvo, so can you give us some color on how your contracting has evolved in '24 versus '23? And based on that, what's your market share do you think you can capture this year versus the 35% last year?"", 'Albert Bourla', ""Thank you very much. Why don't you take, Dave, the impairment question and then I will move to commercial guys?"", 'David M. Denton', ""Yes. So on etrasimod, keep in mind that this product, we still anticipate to be over $1 billion in peak sales. As you know, there are multiple indications attributed to this medicine. And financially, as you look at that medication, there were additional indications that met the financial criteria for an impairment of which we took in the quarter. Clinically, obviously, clinically, there's still some work that will be ongoing in support of the asset. So with that..."", 'Albert Bourla', 'Thank you very much. So Aamir, maybe etrasimod commercially, how the launch is doing and the Abrysvo.', 'Aamir Malik', ""Sure. So I'll start with etrasimod or VELSIPITY, as we call it. So just in terms of the product value proposition, we think this is a very promising oral option for moderate to severe UC patients. It's got strong efficacy that patients and physicians that we've exposed this to. They want to start transitioning from conventional therapy to advanced therapy. And it gives them an option also to maintain once-a-day oral routine, which many are already on instead of beginning with an injection or infusion. So about 80% of those patients that haven't progressed to an advanced therapy prefer an oral option, but only about 10% of those patients actually get one.So there's a very clear need here that VELSIPITY can help us fit. And the benefit-risk profile for VELSIPITY is also very, very strong. So we approved -- we received approval at the end of last year. And so we've invested efforts in building HCP and patient awareness on the label and on the value proposition. But I just want to remind you that with any immuno-inflammatory product, it takes time to get broad national access. And that is where our focus is right now is ensuring that we secure VELSIPITY access as a first-line advanced therapy oral option, and that's going to take some time to put in place. And when we have that in place, we see upside momentum from the launch."", 'Albert Bourla', 'What about Abrysvo?', 'Aamir Malik', ""On Abrysvo, I'll comment briefly on the adult and then on the maternal. On the adult vaccine, I think the market was clearly ahead of everyone's expectations and not limited by shared clinical decision-making versus a routine recommendation. We would like to do better than the 30-some percent share that you referred to as well. So we're very focused going forward on retail contracting for the '24, '25 season. But I will also mention that we are doing that with real thoughtfulness on ensuring that we secure a profitable share in those contracts and also differentiating using our maternal indication.We also see opportunities in the nonretail setting, where for example, with the VA system and with IDNs, we have strong share. And we're going to also focus on new opportunities that we're currently studying with Abrysvo, adults aged 18 and older with underlying medical conditions as well as a new packing presentation to better fit our customer needs. So we see momentum there. And on the maternal side, we're only a few months in but we're encouraged by what we're seeing as the first maternal vaccine to prevent infants from birth to 6 months when they are the most vulnerable. More than 65% of women prefer to get the maternal vaccine versus having their infant immunized with a monoclonal antibody. And we think that the label provides us opportunity to grow that segment as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.', 'Terence C. Flynn', ""Two for me. I guess the first one is just COMIRNATY rest of world was ahead of consensus expectations this quarter. Just wondering if there were any onetime benefits in that number, if that's a fair go-forward sales level to think about through 2026 given the existing EU contract? And then the second one is, I noticed that danuglipron wasn't mentioned in the PR or the prepared remarks. Just wondering if that once-daily PK trial completed yet and what the next steps are there."", 'Albert Bourla', ""Thank you very much. Maybe very quickly on the danu, we didn't mention because we don't have anything to say more. So that's the only thing. There is a program, which is composed with a lot of experiments that we are doing now in terms of moving it to once-daily and we will speak only when we have data. We don't want to become now the focus again of another earnings call. But that being said, I'm moving it to Alexandre to discuss about COMIRNATY in the rest of the world outside the U.S. What are the dynamics over there then?"", 'Alexandre de Germay', ""That's why there are several elements playing out on the COMIRNATY franchise. First, what we see is restrictions on vaccination guidelines, right? So versus the previous years, we see that the guidelines are really focusing on the older population as well as the at-risk population. But we have, as you know, already signed several contracts with the European Commission, Canada, U.K. and Australia. And following the approval in August last year, we started to execute on our contract with the European countries. As a matter of fact, some countries have decided to advance some of their order in 2024 into 2023 so that they can execute their vaccination campaign properly.The other trend that we see is that actually, we don't see major vaccination uptakes in the future year. We think that what we have seen in 2023, 2024 campaign is really the type of vaccination we will see, and that will be carried on the next few years. The only area where there is a potential future growth in terms of vaccination uptake is if we can increase our co-administration with the flu vaccines where in all our key markets, the rate of vaccination in flu is actually higher than it is for COMIRNATY. So we believe that there is potentially here an opportunity.The last point that I want to say is, as you see that the COMIRNATY self pattern is evolving towards a seasonal pattern. So you saw you have a very strong Q4, like you expect in flu vaccination type of market. And that's what we see also to be expected in 2024. And actually, as I was reading some of your models in the financial community, I think there is some confusion that we will have higher Q1, Q2, which I believe will be more towards the second part of the year, but of course, in line with the guidance."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.', 'Umer Raffat', ""Albert, so I was looking at SEC filings from Cerevel and they disclosed that Pfizer was open to putting out a bid on Cerevel after Phase III data, which would have been in 2024, meaning I also noticed that you were saying you're not open to a buyback in 2024 and deleveraging remains a top priority. So I just want to balance those two, especially also in the context of where the stock stands."", 'Albert Bourla', ""Well, look, I will ask Dave to speak about it. But the fact that we are looking everything and we are engaging in everything doesn't mean that, that's our obligation. We are doing all the work. It doesn't mean that our intention is to deviate the capital allocation strategy that we have just articulated. And that is the #1 priority is our dividend and the growing dividend. Then it's a year of execution. We try to delever, as David said.And then once we bring our deleverage to the levels that we are aspiring, we will start also moving into share buybacks and, of course, M&A, which means that for '24, we will see everything in existence because we never say never to business development opportunities could come. But our strategy, it is that you will not see anything major in business development in terms of dollars. David, did I say it well?"", 'David M. Denton', 'You said it well. You are correct.', 'Albert Bourla', 'Thank you very much. You are a good teacher. Thank you. And the other question, Umer? I think that was it, right? Yes. Thank you, Umer.', 'Operator', 'Next, we have Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.', 'Timothy Minton Anderson', ""Maybe for Aamir. So Eliquis is the biggest drug on the initial list of 10 drugs for IRA. CMS has until February 1 to provide you the initial proposed negotiated price, so that's 2 days away. So 2 questions here. Can you confirm you haven't already received that initial proposal yet? And second question, can we expect that at some point between now and September 1, which is the deadline that they have to make the final price public, that you'll give some investors some sort of directional information on how those discussions are going? Are we going to be kind of in the dark until September 1?"", 'Albert Bourla', 'So Aamir, are you planning to give light to Tim more? Give us.', 'Aamir Malik', ""So Tim, as you can appreciate, this whole price setting authority in Medicare, this is new and pharma companies obviously beginning to understand this process of the federal government. The rules are complicated, so we're wrapping our mind around it. Our alliance partner, BMS, is taking lead and engaging with CMS in an official process to determine the price for Eliquis in Part D that will begin in January 1, 2026. And also as I'm sure you can appreciate, we're not going to comment on an ongoing price-setting process and negotiation."", 'Albert Bourla', ""Yes. It's very difficult to comment on these things because they are ongoing. So it's very inappropriate and absolutely could complicate things. I understand that there is a need for people to understand because that's an important product. And we will try as soon as possible and practical to be able to provide the level of details that we are looking at, everybody is looking so that they can model it appropriately."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Andrew Baum with Citi.', 'Andrew Simon Baum', ""A couple of questions, please. First to Aamir, under your new leadership and commercial focus, what key products would you guide us to of recent launches that we should look for in terms of acceleration of rollout trajectory? And it doesn't have to be recently launched, established ones as well. And then second to Mikael. Could you just share a little bit more information about your next-generation PCV vaccine, specifically how many serotypes? And I'm assuming that given it's a new technology, you will lose the ability to grandfather the pneumonia claim from the CAPiTA trial into the product profile as it matures. If you could confirm, that would be great."", 'Albert Bourla', ""Thank you very much, Andrew. Your assumption, I don't think it is correct, but Mikael will answer that. But let's first go to Aamir to basically give us a view how you see in '24 the priorities of the commercial execution in the U.S."", 'Aamir Malik', ""Yes. So Andrew, I'll take a step back and let me start by saying I've been very excited about this role and this opportunity. And also to do it with the team that we've built, which is a mix of both seasoned Pfizer leaders as well as experienced leaders from outside of Pfizer. I mean my focus and we can talk about specific products, we've touched on many of them already. But my focus overall is on execution excellence, right? So in our primary care and specialty care portfolio, we have a lot of great brands. We have some really enduring franchises, VYNDA, Eliquis, Prevnar. I spent quite a bit of time talking about that. Our focus there is to defend and grow where we can, and we do see some opportunities.And we also have to acknowledge that we have some brands that have great value propositions, but they happen to be in highly competitive categories with some very, very well-entrenched competitors. So in a situation like that, my focus is principally let's really prioritize the actions that can grow each of the brands and we can talk about the individual launches. There's a lot of operational focus on blocking and tackling, including contracting.And then when we look at our main resources, we have our field force, our advertising and promotion dollars and our medical capabilities just prioritizing exactly where we put those. That is what I'm focused on with me and my management team. And as I mentioned, we see opportunities in some of the core franchises and defending and growing our share but then also in a number of our launches. And Albert mentioned in his opening remarks what we hope and expect to do with Abrysvo, with Nurtec, with LITFULO, CIBINQO. Those are all brands that we're going to continue to focus on, including some of our recent acquisitions like Oxbryta as well."", 'Albert Bourla', 'Thank you, Aamir. Andrew, let me take the liberty to ask also the other commercial leaders to comment a little bit on their priorities because that will give you better sense of the whole picture. Alexandre, in international, as you are taking over, what are your key priorities?', 'Alexandre de Germay', ""Thanks for the question, Albert, and the opportunity to share my priorities. My main focus is really to focus on the area where we can generate material growth with improved return on investment. This is my mantra. How are we going to do that? My top 4 markets in the order: China, Japan, Germany, and France represents 40% of our international division. So it's quite concentrated. Those 4 markets will report directly to me so that we can have the resources and support the country to execute on their plan at best and to generate the most growth.Our top 15 country represents 70% of our total international. So it's, again, quite concentrated. What I'm actually doing currently is in each of those markets, we are selecting our drivers of growth. What are the key in-line and the key new products where we can have material impact with improved return investment? So to give you an example, of course, it's going to be different from one country to the other because the archetype and the dynamic of those markets are different. So last week, I was in Japan. And so for instance, VYNDAQEL, diagnosis rate is half the diagnosis rate that we have in the U.S. and in France. So we reviewed last week the plan to go and catch those increased diagnosis rate. And we're going to continue to, of course, track on execution.In Germany, Eliquis has a very strong Eliquis franchise. We believe we have growth to untapped opportunity. And I'm next week in Germany to actually review the plan on the Eliquis precisely. And we'll do the same thing on the new product. And it's going to be, for instance, LORBRENA in China. As you know, lung cancer in China is unfortunately affecting a large proportion of the population. And as a matter of fact, the proportion of the lung cancer that can benefit from LORBRENA in the worldwide community is about 1.7%. In China, it's actually 7%. So we believe we have a huge opportunity.What are we doing is actually developing a plan last week when I was visiting China to quickly get LORBRENA to those patients that could benefit from the clinical outcome. So this is really what I'm doing in each of our top 15 countries. Then frankly, the rest of the year will be simply tracking our execution, tracking all the metrics both from activities, medical activities and KPIs for each of our key products."", 'Albert Bourla', 'Thank you. And then maybe, Chris, also on the commercial front. How do you think of the oncology in the U.S. evolving?', 'Chris Boshoff', ""Thank you, Andrew, Albert. Our biggest priority right now is obviously continuity of the business. We've done a lot of work during the last 9 months during integration planning. And we don't want to miss a beat and it's now moving towards flawless execution with immediate priorities, obviously, the PADCEV launch for advanced metastatic bladder cancer from the EV-302 study, the launch of XTANDI in nonmetastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer from the EMBARK trial, the early launch, and also focus on access and awareness during 2024 for ELREXFIO in late-line multiple myeloma. And for TALZENNA where up to 25% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer would be eligible in the U.S. for the -- from the TALAPRO-2 indication."", 'Albert Bourla', ""Thank you, Chris. And then let's go to Mikael Dolsten, if you can make some comments on the next generation as much as you can share about sales."", 'Mikael Dolsten', ""Yes. I think we have a very strong position with good momentum in the PCV conjugate. And I think Alexandre, you mentioned just the positive recommendation we got for PCV20 in Europe. Now we're building on that unique platform. And as Andrew did say here, we are able, what you call, grandfather in unique claims for the adult segment for pneumococcal pneumonia. It's really the major burden with 150,000 U.S. hospitalizations. And to the best of our knowledge, the Pfizer platform with a new fourth generation, as was with the third generation, will be the only one that can carry that claim based on, as you said, the original CAPiTA studies.Now the new generation will contain more serotypes, has applicability for adult and possibly pediatric, as we have done with all of ours. And it also will include improvement on existing serotypes to, altogether, get a very good increased coverage versus the PCV20. And I do think we are the one that really can continue this expansion of more serotypes, but you need conjugation chemistry carry some reformulations. And I am cautious to abandon any serotype where you work on infant and adults as the characterization what caused disease, for example, pneumonia is not very well described so maintaining the coverage as we have uniquely and it's not really happening with the other product is a unique differentiation. So I feel very good about the fourth generation."", 'Albert Bourla', 'Thank you, Mikael.', 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.', 'Geoffrey Christopher Meacham', ""Albert, the Oncology franchise following Seagen, I suspect, will probably be one of your bigger growth drivers for Pfizer going forward. The question is, is there an intermediate or long-term target as a percent of revenue that you're looking to achieve for this segment? And then are there technologies beyond ADC that you think could be additive to the pipeline?"", 'Albert Bourla', ""Yes. Very general, then I will ask Chris to comment a little bit on the technologies that we are having here. I can't say how much Oncology will contribute. But clearly, we have given expectations about Seagen, and we say that we expect it to be at $10 billion by year 2030 from $3.1 billion that we gave guidance in 2024. And actually, we feel very good about the $10 billion. The more data coming -- when we gave the $10 billion, we were not aware of some of the readouts that follow that projection. So we feel very, very good about that.Now I have to say that the Pfizer pipeline in Oncology I think was also among the strongest in our [current] therapeutic areas. So I think the combination, in general, is giving us, let's say, a lot of strength. But Chris, why don't you comment a little bit about how you see the R&D evolution of oncology, the platforms you are going to base your strategies?"", 'Chris Boshoff', 'Thank you. So with the modalities we want to focus on for now are those where we see we have significant strength and capabilities, including with medicinal chemistry, our protein engineering as well as our strength in cancer biology. We therefore want to focus on small molecules, especially from our La Jolla; bispecifics, both La Jolla and the new Seattle site; and ADCs in Seattle. So small molecules, biologics.As you know, we do have an interest also in allogeneic CAR T cells with the formation of Allogene, the company we still follow and have a significant interest in. But for now focusing on those 3 modalities where we see significant opportunity also for combinations, for example, doing small molecules, ADCs, but also potentially in the future between ADCs and bispecific.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.', 'Mohit Bansal', 'Maybe a question on Nurtec, the trends in market share as well as pricing. Just wanted to make sure that is there a significant price delta between Nurtec price versus the competitor price? I mean the discounts that they are offering, given that your competitor has multiple offerings in the headache market. And if there is a delta, do you expect this to grow or decline over 2024 on pricing?', 'Albert Bourla', 'Thank you, Mohit, very much. Aamir, about Nurtec and in general, the migraine franchise.', 'Aamir Malik', ""Yes. So Mohit, thanks for the question. So we were encouraged by Q4 for Nurtec, and I'll also include some comments on ZAVZPRET as part of my response. We were up more than 30% versus the prior year and 20%, over 20% versus the prior quarter. And there's a few things that are encouraging. Nurtec continues to be the #1 prescribed CGRP, so we have leading TRx volume and share. Interestingly, more than 90% of new prescribers in the category, many of whom are primary care physicians are prescribing Nurtec.And our pills per Rx has also, over the last several quarters, been steadily writing. So we continue to see opportunity, and there's a few things to keep in mind. One is there's still a lot of unmet need. Albert referred to it in his written remarks. But there's a lot of patients undiagnosed. Very few get an Rx therapy. Oral CGRPs are still only less than 20% of the Rx market. But as you point out, this is also a very competitive category with QULIPTA and UBRELVY. And I won't comment specifically on their pricing strategies versus ours and GTNs play a role in all of it.But our focus for Nurtec, one, I think we want to be sharper and more competitive in our patient engagement and activation. Two, we have an opportunity with our field force to focus on both the most relevant CGRP writers, and as I said, PCPs. PCPs write 2/3 of triptans but only about a little over 1/3 of CGRP, so there's an opportunity there. And then patient access and experience, there's an opportunity to really reduce the friction there. And I will also mention ZAVZPRET because with an intranasal, we think we can have a very nice complement to an oral for either rapid pain relief, and there's also an unmet need for patients that have nausea and vomiting from the use of an oral. So we want to continue to invest in growing our Nurtec and ZAVZPRET franchise."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen.', 'Stephen Michael Scala', ""Two questions. First on danuglipron, I know Pfizer doesn't want to provide an update. But clearly, the company has greater insight than we do into how the once-daily version is performing in the Phase I PK trial. So I'd like to ask how would you characterize that performance so far? In the absence of any visibility, it's kind of hard for us to be confident in the outlook for this program. Second question is a new weight loss agent was added to Phase I, [designated 6016]. Can you tell us what the mechanism is, please?"", 'Albert Bourla', ""Yes. Steve, I'm going to disappoint you because you are asking things that we have said we are not willing to disclose at this stage for multiple reasons. Clearly, on danu, we have more information than us is very normal with everything that we are doing because we're having a very complicated, as I said, multiple experiments plan right now. But because we don't have new data, we're not going to comment on that.And on the new weight loss molecule also, we said that unfortunately, we are not able to disclose the mechanism of action. The reason is because, first of all, it's too early and we don't want to take competition, nothing strange about that. So I'm sorry to disappoint you but there is not much to offer at this stage. Hopefully, as we said, midyear is where we expect to have more information on that."", 'Operator', 'Next, we have David Risinger with Leerink Partners.', 'David Reed Risinger', ""Thanks for all the updates. So I have 2 questions, please. First is for Dave. Could you please discuss the '24 gross margin prospect in some detail? I think on the last call, you had discussed potentially a low 70% gross margin. But if you can comment on that in more detail, that would be helpful. And the second question is for Mikael. If danuglipron once-daily does have a profile that you're looking for, would the company then conduct a Phase IIa dose-ranging study to assess the efficacy and tolerability in order to design a dose to advance Phase IIb or Phase III?"", 'Albert Bourla', ""Thanks, Dave. Very quickly, Mikael, resolve danu and then we'll go to Dave."", 'Mikael Dolsten', 'Yes. You heard Albert say that we are running a number of clinical experiments to gather insight in that molecule, and we have a second glip. Pfizer has always been open to consider different types of clinical study design. And in general, we tend to move into directly whenever data is supportive, if there is a large safety database into Phase III with a lead-in phase. But we have to look at each program by program. So when we have all the data, we will be able to share with you.', 'Albert Bourla', ""Yes. Let's go to the gross margin where we can share a little bit more information."", 'David M. Denton', ""So David, this is Dave Denton. I'll be very brief here. Obviously, we've indicated our '24 gross margin expectations are in the low 70s, as we discussed previously. As you know, as we cycle into '24, there's a few things that are happening, as I indicated earlier. One is, as COVID comes down, we're kind of deleveraging as COVID had absorbed a lot of fixed overhead. So that's compressing gross margins. Secondly, we're in the process of insourcing many of the acquired products over the last couple of years. And as we insource, the short-term effect of that is dampening on gross margin, which gives us an opportunity to improve gross margins as yields improve over time.And then finally -- or 2 things finally here is new launches have that same characteristic. As we launch a new product, yields and performance are not at peak performance. That will be an opportunity for us going forward. And then finally, we have absorbed some inflation over time. That is an opportunity for us to take out over the next several periods. So again, an opportunity for us to enhance performance over time. But again, we're in this roughly low 70s for 2024 is our expectation."", 'Albert Bourla', ""And David, let me add a little bit more color here, but the COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID are big products but they are manufactured in the same facilities, but they are separate facilities so they are not affecting the margins of the other products. So the margins were really absorbing in those facilities when you had such a huge volume production and value reduction, of course, the margins were seriously -- those products are seriously taking a lot of the overhead.Now as we are reducing our expectations for COVID into very realistic within targets, this doesn't mean that we have eliminated our capacity to produce more if the demand is there because that would be not responsible, first of all, from a public health perspective but also from our investors' money perspective. So that's why so far, we maintain all this capacity although the revenues are down, so there's a significant bit.The second thing that David said, keep in mind, all basically our new acquisitions that brought so many new products, they were from smaller relative companies. They didn't really have their own manufacturing. So these were all outsourced and outsourced, of course, is way more expensive than when you are able to bring it. There are plans for everything to insource, but in manufacturing, that takes 3 years, right, to be able to reduce the margin. And the last but not least, we have disproportional amount of new loans. And those new loans are coming with a very big cost when you build infrastructure or something new to be developed, but of course, you build it for your peak revenues. But of course, you start with very low revenues and then those are going up.So as the infrastructure is there, but then higher revenues for these new products are coming, it's always the case with new products, but margins are expected. So it's not something about gross margins. You can see it in months, you see it in years, the improvement. But clearly, this is an area that we know why it's happening what's happening and how we can improve it."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.', 'Christopher Thomas Schott', ""And maybe just for Dave and Albert, just kind of building on mid- to longer-term margin piece of the equation. It sounds like we should think about margin recovery as a gradual process versus a snapback. Is that fair? And I guess kind of the bigger picture question I was asking is just how do we think about reasonable longer-term margins? Maybe not giving specific time lines, but can we think about kind of like mid- to high 30% operating margins as still a reasonable target for Pfizer? Or just kind of factoring in some of the dynamics we're seeing now, do we need to kind of rethink where margins can go over time?"", 'David M. Denton', ""No, I think you're absolutely correct. Mid- to high 30s is a reasonable target for us, with a slight caveat sense that the vaccine program, COMIRNATY, has a shared, as you know, gross margin level with our partner. And so that's dampening to gross margins and operating profit. So I'll say, slightly mix adjusted for that product. And then from a progression standpoint, yes, you can think about this as a gradual steady improvement story over the next several periods."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Rajesh Kumar with HSBC.', 'Rajesh Kumar', ""Just on the medium-term margin profile. Thank you for the color you've provided. If you think about the growth aspirations you have, does that require you sacrificing some of the margins? So if you were to say hit the top end of your growth profile, would we be looking at mid-30s gross margin or lower? Or what is the balance there? And the second one, you briefly touched on your capital allocation priorities earlier. Obviously, cost cutting and deleveraging is a priority for 2024. In the medium term, which are the therapy areas where you would deploy more capital after 2024 deleveraging exercise done?"", 'Albert Bourla', ""David, why don't you take that?"", 'David M. Denton', ""Yes. So maybe on the margin discussion, obviously, what we've said is we have invested pretty substantially in our business over the past couple of years. So largely, the investment phase at least from a business development standpoint is behind us. We have work to invest to improve performance going forward, but the big dollars are already invested now. It's an execution story and a continued improvement story. So you should expect that to occur over the next several periods.Obviously, the higher the revenue, the better performance because you get to leverage your fixed costs. So clearly, the higher those revenue targets and achievement happen, the better improvement from a margin perspective you should expect from us. And then from a capital allocation perspective, I think you said it right. We are, at the moment, focused on executing our plan, focused on supporting our dividend growth over time, but importantly, beginning to delever as we cycle into an integration of (inaudible) assets. And then from a priority standpoint, clearly, we've made a significant investment in oncology. You should expect us to put the investment thesis behind that franchise going forward. Clearly, that's number one."", 'Albert Bourla', ""And I would add that following the oncology, where clearly, we have right now the biggest part of our R&D expenses and we have a significant also part of our SI&A expenses. The other areas that we are putting a lot of emphasis when it comes to reserve, clearly, vaccines, it's a crown jewel and we plan to have significant productivity. In internal medicines, our metabolic franchise, it is an area that we are very excited. Obesity is part of that. We do believe that obesity is a big market and it's growing.And we do believe that Pfizer has the capabilities that allows us to play and win in that area. So that's an area that we will continue investing. Immune inflammation, we have significant investments is the other area. And of course, we have -- we are among the few that have antiviral and the anti-infectives still investments. So those are the areas that we will put money, oncology, number one, then vaccines, metabolic diseases, immuno-inflammation, antivirals are the ones that we are continuing to invest in."", 'Operator', 'Next, we have Kerry Holford with Berenberg.', 'Kerry Ann Holford', ""Just a couple of pipeline questions for me, please. Firstly, on RSV. Can we expect you to announce the date for Abrysvo following that third season in Q2? And then also on the 2 Phase III starts, you've highlighted today B6A in lung, CDK4 in breast. When can we expect Phase III data readouts for these 2 products?"", 'Albert Bourla', ""I'm not sure -- what was your question on RSV?"", 'Kerry Ann Holford', 'To understand when are you going to publish the data from the following, the third season, third season of RSV?', 'Albert Bourla', ""Yes. Yes, I got it. Thank you. Why don't you take that, Mikael, on the Abrysvo? And then Chris."", 'Mikael Dolsten', 'We continue to accumulate important RSV data and expansion of how the -- this important vaccine can be used. So you should expect this first half of the year, likely Q2, that we share more from our clinical trials, including full second season but also expansion in traditional age groups, as you can know, on clintrial.gov, we have active trials, and we think that will very nicely allow high-risk groups across a large age span to be addressed.', 'Albert Bourla', 'Thank you, Mikael. And then Chris?', 'Chris Boshoff', 'Thank you very much for the question. So the immediate readouts for this year, second half 2024 will be vepdegestrant in second-line hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer, the VERITAC-2 study, also second half 2024. We expect to anticipate results from BREAKWATER, a very important indication, up to 12% of colorectal cancer with Braftovi in first-line BRAF CRC. The new study starting right now is CDK4, B6A and [dacetuzumab] in Phase III programs and then also I hope later this year for EZH2. Those will appear in clinicaltrials.gov and probably completion dates beyond 2025 and 2026. But obviously, there could be interim results with earlier results.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.', 'Chris Shibutani', ""Two questions, if I may. Aamir, with your prior role, you had talked about a $25 billion in revenues by 2030 that the company was looking to deliver based upon M&A. We have the impairment with Arena. Is there an update for that? And now that you're in the role of U.S. Chief Commercial Officer, non-Oncology, non-COVID, what would be on your wish list in your current seat in terms of where you feel an opportunity to expand those revenues potentially through business development that could work to hit that $25 billion target by 2030?Then secondly, with the M&A activity across the industry, investors are always paying attention to what's going on with the FTC. Having passed through this gauntlet with Seagen last year, is there anything you can comment about to help us think about how regulators are thinking about the M&A environment in terms of particularly size of deal or any other dimension that you think is worth being aware of that might have been your observations from your experience in '23?"", 'Albert Bourla', ""Thank you very much. Aamir, why don't you take the question? By the way, let me clarify that Aamir's responsibility includes COVID revenue. So go ahead, Aamir."", 'Aamir Malik', ""Okay. So Chris, there's a lot in what you asked. Firstly, on the $25 billion goal that we put out there, I'll just remind that we guided to $20 billion for what we plan on getting to by 2030 for the deals that we had done. And I would also just remind you that the $25 billion was a 2030 goal, so there is lots of time between now and 2030 to achieve that goal, consistent with our capital allocation priorities that Dave described.On your second question, I mean, to be honest, yes, everyone's got a wish list, but my focus is on exactly what I described right now and what we talked about as a management team, which is delivering value from our launches and delivering value from the deals that we've done. So that's where my focus is. Now lastly, in terms of FTC, it's not appropriate for us to comment on what the FTC is going to do or not do. But what I can say is that we feel very good about how we have operated with all regulators in all regulatory bodies across the world to get done all the deals that we did. And I think that just speaks to our patient-centric approach and our collaborative nature with regulators."", 'Operator', 'Next, we have Akash Tewari with Jefferies.', 'Akash Tewari', 'Fair point on the Prevnar comments with the impairment charge and kind of the moving parts between adult, pediatric and international. Consensus had modest top line growth over the next few years for the entire franchise. Is that a reasonable expectation for investors, given the increased competition from Merck and the U.S. pool shrinking? And then do you have an internal view on what the ACIP recommendation will be regarding Prevnar and V116?', 'Albert Bourla', ""Look, Aamir, why don't you take the -- is it the Prevnar expectations? We don't comment on what the expectations of the Street are, right? So are we -- and I think we gave a very good, let's say, high-level trajectory how we see this market. In the U.S., the adult opportunity, it is mainly as always with the adult, a catch-up opportunity. So when you come, you have a pool of all the people that are eligible, but some of them would choose to make the vaccine.Usually, that happens in the first year and maybe a little bit then on the second year. We have exhausted, I think, this opportunity with a 96% market share. So right now, I don't think that we will see in the U.S., in the adult, huge opportunity. Merck competition is coming into that. So this is not a very big growth area for us because, as I said, this is not where we plan to do it. It's huge when you launch them very quickly, goes down because then it is just the people that we are really [going to sway], they are going into this cohort in terms of age.The big opportunity it is the pediatric because it is 4 doses, it's not 1. And because it is a huge cohort every year, way bigger the cohort of newborns than people that are becoming 65 in the (inaudible). So that's how we should see it. So there is nothing much to add into that."", 'Operator', 'Our last question will come from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Evan David Seigerman', ""Two questions from me. One, when you think about the additional $25 billion revenues by 2030, now that Seagen's part of this business, where are we in getting to that metric? And then my second question is really on Oxbryta on sickle cell disease. When you bought the asset, you really -- you noted that you plan to speed up the distribution of the drug to parts of the world most impacted by the disease. We haven't really seen much OUS, given recent competitive approvals of Casgevy in the Middle East. How do you think about the OUS opportunity in context of the competitive updates there? So Seagen and then thinking about some Oxbryta comments."", 'Albert Bourla', ""On Seagen, maybe I can take it because that's an easy answer. From Seagen, we expect to get $10 billion by year 2030. That was a number that we put out there when we announced the acquisition. Since then, a few things that have reinforced our confidence in this number have occurred. The first one, it is that ADC became the hottest thing on the M&A activity. Everybody wants an ADC, which basically our big bet was in this technology. So it looks like there is an overall consensus among investors, companies, analysts that this is a technology that will deliver a lot. So that gives us a lot of comfort that happened after we announced.The second thing that also happened after we announced is $10 billion was that Seagen came out with significant readouts or significant products that were beyond our expectations. But also what you don't see but we see, they are advancing a lot of stuff that some of them we will show you in the 29th of February. So also, it was a bet in the technology, a bet in the company, we feel that we did very well in both.So the $10 billion is $10 billion of the $25 billion, but we remain -- we don't change it, but we remain confident that we can make it. Then of course, in addition to that, there was an additional $10 billion for all the other things that we have done, and this $5 billion that we could execute. Now on Oxbryta, how Oxbryta is doing, Aamir?"", 'Aamir Malik', ""Yes. So Evan, with regards to Oxbryta and then I'll comment on the acquisition as well since you referred to that. We're pleased with the U.S. performance. Q4 was up 30% over the prior year and 14% over the prior quarter. The prescription trends are very solid. We've made a lot of investments in customer-facing teams since we made that acquisition. So we like the momentum that we're seeing in the U.S., and we expect to see more.Right now, the rest of the world is a very small part of Oxbryta revenue, and that is something that will take time to develop and we'll obviously look at that appropriately. And as you think about the GBT acquisition, it's important to look at Oxbryta, but I also would remind you that we're also very excited about GBT601, which we expect can bring a lot of value in addition to Oxbryta. Some of it will -- if it's successful from a clinical and regulatory perspective, some sales will be cannibalized, but there will also be room for Oxbryta in the market to continue to grow.So when you look at the combination of the momentum in the U.S., an opportunity that's yet to be developed outside the U.S. and 601, where we presented great data at ASH in December, we think that there's a lot of value to be gained from this acquisition."", 'Albert Bourla', ""Yes. And I would add, it is the same exactly with the GBT acquisition. When we did the acquisition, we announced our projections for year 2030. Since then, things have improved in terms of our confidence to deliver these numbers. And I'm not talking only that Oxbryta is performing exactly as we thought it would, but the most important upside it is that we had data that we didn't have when we made the acquisition on the 601 but has the potential to become a transformative therapy in the sickle cell and really, really brings to the next -- it's a step change if that thing -- if the Phase III, let's say, reconfirms the Phase II results.So also over there, I think what we announced, we feel now we're more confident but we should be able to achieve and hopefully exceed. So with that, I think we start to end the call. In summary, we are optimistic about the year ahead. We have defined our 5 key priorities that will keep us focused. And I repeat again, this will be a year of execution. I have a sample, a team that are healthy, that I believe are the absolutely right leaders to execute. And I know that the whole world was impressed with the way that we executed our COVID strategies, how we were able to execute on the R&D front, on the manufacturing front and on the commercial front with 2 products, the vaccine with the highest market share and with the product in oral antiviral.We plan to repeat the same execution excellence level as we are building oncology leadership, as we are progressing the next wave of our pipeline, as we are maximizing the performance of all these new launches that have happened, as we execute our cost realignment program starting this year with SI&A, but also which you will see the results. But also of course, the program to improve the gross margin that you won't see results now because it takes long but we started now as we speak, and laser focus in maximizing value for shareholders with the way that we allocate our capital.The team is there to make sure that this will happen, and I think we should meet again in 3 months, and we will see how we are progressing against those stated goals. Thank you very much all. Bye-bye."", 'Operator', ""Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's Pfizer's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.

I'd like to begin with a few reflections on 2023."", 'As you know, we missed our initial internal projections and Street expectations predominantly related to our COVID products, which affected our stock price performance. Despite however this challenging year, there were a few great things that happened in 2023 that may have gotten lost amid the mixed expectations. First, in 2023, Pfizer impacted the lives of more than 620 million people approximately around the world. We believe there is no other company that can reach as many people and patients as Pfizer.', 'If you multiply this with our brand equity and awareness, it creates a connection with consumers that can be a very strong asset for us. Second, despite the decline in revenue from our COVID products, as of the reported results for the first nine months of 2023, we were the No. 1 pharmaceutical company in terms of revenues from pharma-only products, a marked improvement from our fourth position in 2019. Next, 2023 was a record year for FDA approvals with nine new molecular entity approvals on Pfizer and many more approvals for new indications in already approved products, marking a very productive year of pipeline execution for Pfizer.', 'Finally, we closed the Seagen acquisition. In the current regulatory environment, being able to close such a large acquisition demonstrates our ability to successfully engage with regulatory bodies. Our deliberate and strategic efforts throughout 2023 created a strong foundation to support us. We are now focused on maximizing the opportunities that have positioned us for success and our team is driving confidently as we start 2024.', 'From the advent of penicillin to the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer has been at the forefront of medical and pharmaceutical breakthroughs for the past 175 years. This year is our 175th anniversary. That can not only change patient lives but has changed history. Our strategy to continue to build on our proud history of innovation and commercial excellence is supported by the power and strength of our unmatched global scale and footprint, spanning commercial, financial, medical, regulatory, manufacturing, and government relations.', ""We have a clear view on how we will deliver operational, commercial, and financial success across our business. Our confidence stems from the opportunity we have to bring additional focus to our business by executing five strategic priorities. We will get into each in more detail but the five key priorities for Pfizer this year is here are: First of all, to achieve world-class oncology leadership, to deliver the next wave of pipeline innovation, to maximize the performance of our new products, expand margins by realigning our cost base, allocate capital to enhance shareholder value. I'm confident that Pfizer is well-positioned to execute and that we can deliver meaningful value for our patients and our shareholders."", ""Let's start with our first priority which is to achieve a world-class oncology leadership, which I believe we are in a strong position to do. As a reminder, one in three people will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. Oncology represents one of the largest and fastest growing therapeutic areas. Completing the acquisition of Seagen doubled our oncology research and resources overnight, and meaningfully extended the reach and medical impact of our U.S."", ""commercial and medical footprint, with a range of portfolio expansion opportunities boosted by Seagen's broad and deep pipeline. Seagen's in-line medicines are expected to immediately enhance Pfizer's top-line growth, and our combined portfolio provides the opportunity to lead genitourinary cancers and be a leader in breast cancer and deliver at least eight potential blockbuster products by 2030. We look forward to providing more information about our oncology platform at our Pfizer Oncology Innovation Day on February 29th. As we build our leadership position, we have multiple potential key oncology catalysts in 2024 that we are acutely focused on."", 'On the commercial side, the Padcev launch in locally advanced/metastatic bladder cancer in combination with pembrolizumab and Xtandi launch in nonmetastic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. We are excited by the strength of the Padcev EV-302 data and recent FDA approval, as it represents an opportunity to broaden the reach of this potentially practice-changing, platinum-free regimen to even more patients in the frontline metastatic urothelial cancer setting. Essentially, the recent approval doubles the addressable population, which had already doubled this past spring. We are also looking forward to phase 3 Data readouts from Vepdegestrant in second line HR+ metastatic breast cancer and Braftovi in first line BRAF colorectal cancer.', ""We also plan to advance our late-stage pipeline with phase 3 starts of CDK4i in post-CDK4/6 metastatic breast cancer and B6A in non-small cell lung cancer. Building on Pfizer's potential medicines, the pipeline across breast cancer, genitourinary cancer, hematology, and CRC, our CDK4 inhibitor could be a compelling follow-on to IBRANCE. And finally, in the early stage pipeline, we look forward to initiating first-in-patient studies of four new ADC candidates this year, where we believe we have acquired the expertise to be a leader. Our second priority is to deliver the next wave of pipeline innovation with discovery and development across our therapeutic areas outside of Oncology in Vaccines, Anti-Infectives, Internal Medicine Metabolic Diseases, and Inflammation and Immunology."", ""In 2024, we plan to continue to make meaningful investments in R&D. In fact, Pfizer's R&D budget is one of the highest in the industry and supports our robust pipeline. We are pursuing cutting-edge science across modalities and platforms to deliver the next generation of potential breakthroughs. We are also leveraging AI and other digital tools across the value chain to increase speed and success rates."", 'Starting first with our 4th-generation PCV vaccine candidate, which recently entered the clinic and received FDA Fast Track designation. Building on our deep heritage with PREVNAR, we aim to solidify our leadership in the pneumococcal vaccine space by increasing valency and serotype immunogenicity while maintaining our unique FDA label, which includes both IPD and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults. Respiratory vaccine combinations are another area where we are poised to lead, building upon our successful COVID vaccine. With the first-generation stand-alone mRNA flu vaccine, data demonstrated superior relatively efficacy versus a recommended flu vaccine in 18-to-64-year-olds, but did not meet success criteria for immunogenicity for the B strains.', 'Our second-generation flu vaccine was tested in a phase 2 COVID/Flu combination study for 18–64-year-olds and has shown encouraging results in both the A and the B strains. This new construct has now moved already into a phase 3 COVID/Flu combination trial. Moving next to GBT-601. Our next-generation and potentially best-in-class HbS polymerization inhibitor represents a potential step-wise evolution over Oxbryta for sickle cell disease.', 'Recent data presented at ASH 2023 demonstrated multiple blood parameters approaching normal ranges with treatment, suggesting GBT-601 may have the potential to deliver strong efficacy with the convenience of a once-daily pill. We have reaffirmed our commitment to our emerging cardiometabolic programs, with several early clinical development compounds. On the other end of the weight management spectrum, we have Ponsegromab, our GDF15 neutralizing antibody for cancer cachexia with phase 2 data expected later this year. Ponsegromab has the potential to be first-in-class and the first FDA-approved treatment for cancer cachexia, which accounts for 20%, 30% of all cancer deaths significantly.', 'Our third priority is of course to maximize the performance of our new products and core franchises through a relentless focus on execution, to continue growing our top line. To do this, we are prioritizing and focusing, while leveraging data to make changes quickly and adapt. Our Pfizer U.S. Commercial and our Pfizer International Commercial organizations will leverage a more focused, efficient structure to drive executional excellence in their respective markets and expand reach to drive growth over the next several years.', 'To discuss a few examples, we continue to be very enthusiastic about the potential of Nurtec to help the more than one billion people living with migraines worldwide. As access and prescriptions in the U.S. and globally continue to increase, we will continue to focus on direct-to-consumer marketing and reducing barriers to access and affordability for healthcare practitioners and patients. With Oxbryta, we will continue to educate healthcare practitioners and patients on the importance of proactively treating the underlying cause of sickle cell disease by reframing treatment goals to chronic/proactive treatment.', 'With Abrysvo, we are focused on increasing overall RSV market growth and market share by establishing RSV vaccination as a year-round discussion and expanding our retail contracting and offerings. With Elrexfio, we are focused on educating healthcare practitioners in both academic institutions and in the community, awareness building, and new patient trialists. Coming off the initial launch of Velsipity, we are focused on helping ensure patient access to Velsipity as a first-line advanced therapy oral option. With Litfulo, we continue to accelerate the consideration of advanced systemic treatments for appropriate alopecia areata patients and further unlock access to Litfulo.', 'In addition, of course, we continue to protect and grow our core franchises and key blockbusters, including Prevnar, Vyndaqel, and Eliquis, while exploring further opportunities to advance a number of innovative combination regimens. We believe we are well-positioned to bring our global commercial manufacturing and supply capabilities to accelerate current and future marketed products. We believe all these components support our growth potential through 2024 and drive growth potential into 2025. We plan to provide updates throughout the year on how we are advancing these strategic priorities.', 'And with that, I will turn the call over to Dave, who will discuss our financial performance, our initiative to realign our cost base, and our capital allocation strategy to enhance shareholder value. Dave?', 'Dave Denton -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. As we enter 2024, we are clearly focused on a small number of critical priorities. These priorities include building a world-class oncology organization, ensuring the next wave of pipeline innovations, maximizing our new product portfolio performance with a more efficient commercial structure, and finally right-sizing our cost base. With that said, I'll start this morning with our full-year and our fourth-quarter results, then I'll touch on our capital allocation priorities."", ""I'll finish this morning with a few comments on our 2024 guidance and the near-term expectations that set this year as a foundational year to drive our growth potential in the latter half of the decade. For the full-year 2023, we recorded revenues of $58.5 billion, achieving 7% operational growth, solidly in line with our expectations when excluding contributions from both Comirnaty and Paxlovid. The significant sales decline in our COVID products, including a $3.5 billion revenue reversal for Paxlovid, were the primary drivers of an overall 41% operational decrease year-over-year. And with the expectation that Seagen will be a substantial growth contributor in 2024 and beyond, our full-year and fourth-quarter results include approximately $120 million in Seagen product revenue after the close of the acquisition on December 14th."", ""On the bottom line, we reported full-year 2023 diluted EPS of $0.37 a share, a 93% year-over-year decline, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.84, down 72% versus year-over-year. This decline is primarily due to a significant decrease in sales for both Comirnaty and Paxlovid; the impact of the $3.5 billion revenue reversal for Paxlovid revenues in the fourth quarter related to an expected return of an estimated 6.5 million unused EUA-labeled treatment courses from the U.S. government; and finally a non-cash inventory write-off and other charges of $5.6 billion recorded in the third quarter for Paxlovid and to a lesser extent Comirnaty. Now turning to the quarter, I'd like to highlight that we delivered a solid 8% year-over-year operational revenue growth, again, excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid."", 'Contributing to this strong performance were our newly approved RSV vaccine as well as Vyndaqel and Eliquis; partially offset by lower revenues for Ibrance and the Prevnar Family. However, our Q4 results, both top and bottom line, continued to be significantly, and negatively, impacted by our COVID products on a year-on-year basis. Revenues declined 42% operationally, the results were significant decrease in both Comirnaty and Paxlovid sales. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased by 12 percentage points driven primarily by the $3.5 billion non-cash Paxlovid revenue reversal, and to a much lesser extent, unfavorable changes in sales mix.', 'Overall, our adjusted operating expenses declined 10%, compared to Q4 of last year. Adjusted SI&A expenses increased 1% operationally in the quarter, primarily driven by the timing of marketing and promotional activities, including those related to recently launched and acquired products. And consistent with our strategy, we have been focused on reprioritizing our R&D spending to enhance overall returns. Adjusted R&D expenses decreased 24% operationally, driven primarily by lower spending across both vaccine programs and certain acquired assets, as well as lower compensation-related expenses.', ""Both our reported diluted loss per share of $0.60 and our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.10 for the quarter were negatively impacted by the $3.5 billion Paxlovid revenue reversal, which dampened EPS by approximately $0.54. Continued declines in both Comirnaty and Paxlovid sales also negatively affected our performance in the quarter. Foreign exchange movements had an immaterial impact compared to last year's fourth quarter. As we are increasingly focused on prioritizing our investments to drive forward-looking growth, our GAAP results include a $1.4 billion intangible asset impairment charge associated with etrasimod, based on changes in development plans for additional indications and overall revenue expectations."", 'But I will point out that this product is still projected to contribute over a $1 billion in peak annual sales. Additionally, we recorded a nearly $1 billion intangible asset impairment for Prevnar 13 reflecting a transition to vaccines with higher sero-type coverage. As discussed in prior quarters, our capital allocation strategy is designed to enhance shareholder value and is based on three core pillars. First is growing our dividend.', 'Second is reinvesting in the business. And finally is making share repurchases after de-levering our balance sheet. For 2023, we returned $9.2 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, we have invested $10.7 billion in internal R&D and finally, we have invested approximately $44 billion in completed business development transactions, net of cash acquired, essentially all for the acquisition of Seagen. Our expectation is to maintain and grow our dividend while de-levering our capital structure, with a gross leverage target of three and a quarter time and a goal to preserve our credit rating and access to Tier 1 commercial paper.', ""Upon achieving our de-levering goals, we anticipate returning to a more balanced capital allocation strategy, inclusive of share repurchases. Now given that we issued our full-year 2024 revenue and adjusted diluted EPS guidance on December 13th, let me just hit a few of the highlights. We expect total company full-year '24 revenues to be in the range of $58.5 billion to $61.5 billion, which reflects our expectation of strong contributions across our product portfolio. Importantly, excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid, we anticipate operational revenue growth of 8%-10%."", 'We remain confident on delivering at least $4 billion of net savings from our cost-realignment program by the end of the year. We believe right sizing the cost base will put us on a strong footing toward margin expansion and increased operational efficiency moving forward. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.25 a share for the full-year 2024 and as a reminder, this range is inclusive of an anticipated $0.40 of earnings dilution from the Seagen acquisition, and again with the vast majority of this dilution resulting from the financing costs associated with the deal. Cycling into 2024, we have significantly invested in our business to fuel our longer-term growth, and the foundation is set to deliver on our commitments to enhance long-term shareholder value.', ""We are acutely focused on driving near-term performance while solidifying our growth expectations for the back half of the decade. And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Albert to begin our Q&A session."", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, please assemble the queue."", '', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities.', 'Robyn Karnauskas -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', ""Thank you guys for taking my question. So maybe I'm stupid on this question, but if I'm doing your math for your guidance of margins in low-70s for fiscal year '24. By my math, the margins for other biopharma would have to drop to about 60% in order to balance out the other margins. Can you just help me understand your guidance and triangulate that with your top-line and bottom-line guidance and triangulating that with your margin guidance? Thank you."", 'Dave Denton -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. This is Dave. Correct. Our guidance for gross margin, although we don't provide it specifically, we give us some color around the fact that it's approximately 70%."", ""Obviously, our focus going forward is to improve our margin rate and more importantly, improve our operating margin rate to the bottom line. As we look here at 2024, there's a few things that have compressed our margin rate. First is, as COVID has declined year-over-year, that has served to, I'll say, delever, if you will, the P&L as COVID takes up and cover some fixed overhead. But importantly, what's happening is we are in sourcing products that we've recently acquired."", ""That in sourcing requires time before we get up to peak yield and performance so that in the short-term, dampens gross margin rate, but has a trajectory to improve gross margin rate over time. And then secondly, we have new launches that are coming online late in Q3 -- late in the second half of 2023 and moving into '24. Again, those are not at peak performance yet. That will ultimately improve gross margin rate as we cycle into later years."", 'And then finally, I will say that over the last several years, we have absorbed some amount of inflation within our cost of goods sold. That is an area of opportunity for us as we think about improving performance longer term. So I hope that gives you some color.', 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Dave. Operator. Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'Next, we have Carter Gould with Barclays.', 'Carter Gould -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe another kind of finance question here. Certainly, R&D in 4Q was meaningfully below kind of where you guys had set the guide there.', ""How should we think about that? Does it just reflect sort of faster cost cutting? Is it just more an artifact of the later integration of SGen? And clearly, you're reaffirming your guide but just maybe if you can just sort of check that box for us, that would be helpful. Thank you."", 'Dave Denton -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Sure. Probably not much to read into that. Obviously, R&D came in a little favorable than our expectations previously. Part of this is the fact that we are very focused on our -- realigning our cost base so consistent with the program.', ""And then secondly, there probably is some timing that's dampening R&D in the fourth quarter that will slide into 2024 and into 2025. So there is some timing implications to that performance level. But I think importantly, back to my prepared remarks is our focus is on delivering net savings of $4 billion. And if you look through the end of 2023, about half of that we've achieved already."", ""We're now focused on achieving the additional $2 billion or so as we cycle into 2024, and all eyes are on that objective."", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you, Dave. We have high confidence on the number that we gave. Let's move to the next question, please."", 'Operator', ""Our next question will come from Louise Chen with Cantor. Please make sure that you're unmuted."", 'Louise Chen -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- Analyst', 'Hi. Sorry, I was muted. Wanted to ask you on your Prevnar franchise. First of all, for the fourth-generation PCV, could you give more color on how it compares in contrast with Prevnar 20? And then just on the Prevnar order timing issue, was that U.S.', 'or ex-U.S.?', 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Aamir, why don't you take the Prevnar question? And then maybe Alexandre, you can add a little bit color on the situation in the U.S. So what is the situation in Prevnar with the orders?"", 'Aamir Malik -- Chief Business and Innovation Officer', ""Yes. So Louise, with regards to Prevnar, with the pediatric business, we often see some lumpiness in quarterly revenues, given the timing and impact of CDC orders, so it's difficult to kind of map that all out quarter by quarter. So you should expect that on the pediatric business. But the pediatric business, otherwise, we're very happy with how our launch is progressing and the growth momentum that we see there."", ""On the adult business, I think it's different in the sense that we have a 96% market share that we closed the adult business with at the end of the year. But it's really important to keep in mind that we are operating in a market where the patient pool is steadily decreasing. There was a big catch-up opportunity versus the prior recommendation, and we've worked through that catch-up opportunity already. So the remaining patients are generally those that are aging into the 65-plus population as well as those with underlying medical conditions, and those are harder to activate patients."", 'So we expect that business to continue to face that smaller patient population going forward. And we also expect competition with V116 emerging that will make the adult market more competitive, but we see a lot of growth potential in the pediatric market.', 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you. Alexandre, how was the Prevnar situation in the last quarter or in the year in international markets?', 'Alexandre de Germay -- Executive Vice President, Chief International Commercial Officer', 'Yes. Louise, good question. As you know, the majority of our ex-U.S. business is driven by tender.', ""And of course, we book the sales when we ship the product. It doesn't reflect utilization. And then the government schedule their campaign in their respective markets. The reality is that we continue to have an IP exclusivity in 130 markets around the world."", ""And at the same time, we continue to progress both on the pediatric, as you saw last week, the CHMP positive opinion, and now we're going to go into the final approval and then vaccine technical committees and pricing in all those markets, so that will take a bit of time. But at the same time, we see some positive traction on the adult franchise, where we have launched in over 30 markets. And we see some very good developments with the recommendation of the Vaccine Technical Committee. To give you an example, we used to have very limited access on our Prevnar 13 in country like Germany or France and U.K."", 'And we just received a recommendation from the VTC in Germany that actually recommended usage of Prevnar 20 in old adults over 60 as well as at-risk population from 18 to 59, which we believe we have a significant growth opportunity in increasing vaccination in the adult population ex-U.S.', 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'And Mikael, to conclude what about the fourth-generation Prevnar?', 'Mikael Dolsten -- Chief Scientific Officer and President, Research and Development', ""Yes, I'm very pleased that the fourth generation has entered clinical studies. It has a Fast Track designation from U.S. FDA, indicating a unique product offering. And it includes some of the new technology we have developed that gives us a really cutting-edge tool box, whether it's chemistry carriers or reformulations."", 'And of course, it relies on the unique Pfizer platform to have potential prevention of both invasive disease, which is the smaller disease burden and pneumococcal disease, which causes more than 150,000 hospitalizations. And to the best of my knowledge, we are the only one that can address both of them. So we feel very good about that entry.', 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you, Mikael. So to summarize the Prevnar, which I know it is in the minds of all, let's start with the commercial front. In the U.S., clearly, the adult opportunity, we have taken the cream basically of the catch-up opportunity. This is happening once you are getting a recommendation from CDC for a catch-up."", ""This market, the pool of patients has been largely exhausted. We have already 96% market share of that. So this is not a market, the adult now that we expect that will continuously grow in the U.S. Pediatric, very different story because our market share is now growing, and we have indications that we'll continue growing very strongly."", 'So we expect in the U.S., the Prevnar situation to be a strong growth story in pediatrics. International, both, we expect to see growth because the products have just been launched, and then the recommendations are following. So there is a delay in international higher than usually there is in the U.S. So we expect to see growth in adult and pediatrics.', 'I want to reemphasize that we have basically exclusivity of Prevnar 13 in more than 100 countries, 113 countries in of tenders. And we plan to convert that now to 20. And then on the fourth generation, we are moving full speed. We think that our expertise will allow us to build a polyvalent vaccine that will really compete very, very nicely as a fourth generation and will do that successfully and fast.', ""So that's the story and let's move to the next question, please."", 'Operator', 'Next, we have a question from Trung Huynh with UBS.', 'Trung Huynh -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Trung from UBS. Two, please.', ""So in your prepared remarks, you noted you took a $1.4 billion impairment charge associated with etrasimod. Can you add more color here? What prompted that reevaluation? And any feedback of how that launch has gone? Secondly, on Abrysvo, so can you give us some color on how your contracting has evolved in '24 versus '23? And based on that, what's your market share do you think you can capture this year versus the 35% last year?"", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you very much. Why don't you take the impairment question and then I will move to commercial?"", 'Dave Denton -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Yes. So on etrasimod, keep in mind that this product, we still anticipate to be over $1 billion in peak sales. As you know, there are multiple indications attributed to this medicine. And financially, as you look at that medication, there were additional indications that met the financial criteria for an impairment of which we took in the quarter.', ""Clinically, obviously, clinically, there's still some work that will be ongoing in support of the asset. So with that --"", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you very much. So Aamir, maybe etrasimod commercially, how the launch is doing and the Abrysvo?', 'Aamir Malik -- Chief Business and Innovation Officer', ""Sure. So I'll start with etrasimod or Velsipity as we call it. So just in terms of the product value proposition, we think this is a very promising oral option for moderate to severe UC patients. It's got strong efficacy that patients and physicians we've exposed this to."", ""They want to start transitioning from conventional therapy to advanced therapy. And it gives them an option also to maintain once-a-day oral routine, which many are already on instead of beginning with an injection or infusion. So about 80% of those patients that haven't progressed to an advanced therapy prefer an oral option, but only about 10% of those patients actually get one. So there's a very clear need here that Velsipity can help us fit."", ""And the benefit risk profile for Velsipity is also very, very strong. So we approved -- we received approval at the end of last year. And so we've invested efforts in building HCP and patient awareness on the label and on the value proposition. But I just want to remind you that with any immuno-inflammatory product, it takes time to get broad national access."", ""And that is where our focus is right now is ensuring that we secure Velsipity access as a first-line advanced therapy oral option, and that's going to take some time to put in place. And when we have that in place, we see upside momentum from the launch."", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'What about Abrysvo?', 'Aamir Malik -- Chief Business and Innovation Officer', ""On Abrysvo, I'll comment briefly on the adult and then on the maternal. On the adult vaccine, I think the market was clearly ahead of everyone's expectations and not limited by shared clinical decision-making versus a routine recommendation. We would like to do better than the 30-some percent share that you referred to as well. So we're very focused going forward on retail contracting for the '24, '25 season."", ""But I will also mention that we are doing that with real thoughtfulness on ensuring that we secure a profitable share in those contracts and also differentiating using our maternal indication. We also see opportunities in the non-retail setting, where for example, with the system and with IDNs, we have strong share. And we're going to also focus on new opportunities that we're currently studying with Abrysvo, adults aged 18 and older with underlying medical conditions as well as a new packing presentation to better fit our customer needs. So we see momentum there."", ""And on the maternal side, we're only a few months in, but we're encouraged by what we're seeing as the first maternal vaccine to prevent infants from birth to six months when they are the most vulnerable. More than 65% of women prefer to get the maternal vaccine versus having their infant immunized with a monoclonal antibody. And we think that the label provides us opportunity to grow that segment as well."", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you. Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.', 'Terence Flynn -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Two for me. I guess the first one is just Comirnaty rest of world was ahead of consensus expectations this quarter.', ""Just wondering if there were any one-time benefits in that number, if that's a fair go-forward sales level to think about through 2026, given the existing EU contract? And then the second one is, I noticed that Danuglipron wasn't mentioned in the PR or the prepared remarks. Just wondering if that once-daily PK trial completed yet and what the next steps are there?"", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you very much. Maybe very quickly on Danuglipron, we didn't mention because we don't have anything to say more. So that's the only thing. There is a program, which is composed with a lot of experiments that we are doing now."", ""In terms of moving it to once-a-day and we will speak only when we have data. We don't want to become now the focus again of another earnings call. But that being said, I'm moving it to Alexandre to discuss about Comirnaty in the rest of the world outside the U.S. What are the dynamics of Comirnaty?"", 'Alexandre de Germay -- Executive Vice President, Chief International Commercial Officer', ""That's why there are several elements playing out on the Comirnaty franchise. First, what we see is restrictions on vaccination guidelines, right? So versus the previous years, we see that the guidelines are really focusing on the older population as well as the at-risk population. But we have, as you know, already signed several contracts with the European Commission, Canada, U.K. and Australia."", ""And following the approval in August last year, we started to execute on our contract with the European countries. As a matter of fact, some countries have decided to advance some of their order in 2024 into 2023 so that they can execute their activation campaign properly. The other trend that we see is that actually, we don't see major vaccination uptakes in the future year. We think that what we have seen in 2023, 2024 campaign is really the type of acceleration we will see, and that will be carried on the next few years."", 'The only area where there is a potential future growth in terms of vaccination uptake is, if we can increase our co-administration with the flu vaccines where in all our key markets, the rate of vaccination in flu is actually higher than it is for Comirnaty. So we believe that there is potentially here an opportunity. The last point that I want to say is, as you see that the Comirnaty self-pattern is evolving toward a seasonal pattern. So you saw you have a very strong Q4, like you expect in flu vaccination type of markets.', ""And that's what we see also to be expected in 2024. And actually, as I was reading some of your models in the financial community, I think there is some confusion that we will have higher Q1, Q2, which I believe will be more toward the second part of the year, but of course, in line with the guidance."", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you very much, Alexandre. Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.', 'Umer Raffat -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', ""Thanks for taking my question. Albert, I was looking at SEC filings from Cerevel and they disclosed that Pfizer was open to putting out a bid on Cerevel after phase 3 data, which would have been in 2024. Meaning I also noticed that you were saying you're not open to a buyback in 2024 and deleveraging remains a top priority. So I just want to balance those two, especially also in the context of where the stock stands."", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Look, I will ask Dave to speak about it. But the fact that we are looking everything and we are engaging in everything doesn't mean that, that's our obligation. We are doing all the work. It doesn't mean that our intention is to deviate the capital allocation strategy that we have just articulated."", ""And that is the No. 1 priority is our dividend and the growing dividend. Then it's a year of execution. We try to delever as David said."", ""And then once we bring our deleverage to the levels that we are aspiring, we will start also moving into share buybacks and, of course, M&A, which means that for '24, we will see everything in existence because we never say never to business development opportunities could come. But our strategy, it is that you will not see anything major in business development in terms of dollars. David, did I say it well?"", 'Dave Denton -- Chief Financial Officer', 'You said it well. You are correct.', 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you very much. You are a good teacher. Thank you. And the other question, Umer? I think that was it, right? Thank you very much.', ""Let's go to the next question, please."", 'Operator', 'Next, we have Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.', 'Tim Anderson -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', ""Thank you. Maybe for Aamir. So Eliquis is the biggest drug on the initial list of 10 drugs for IRA. CMS has until February 1st to provide you the initial proposed negotiated price so that's two days away."", ""So two questions here. Can you confirm you haven't already received that initial proposal yet? And second question, can we expect that at some point between now and September 1, which is the deadline that they have to make the final price public, that you'll give some investors some sort of directional information on how those discussions are going? Are we going to be kind of in the dark until September 1st?"", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'So Aamir, are you planning to give light to more? Give us.', 'Aamir Malik -- Chief Business and Innovation Officer', ""So Tim, as you can appreciate, this whole price setting authority in Medicare, this is new and pharma companies obviously beginning to understand this process of the federal government. The rules are complicated, so we're wrapping our mind around it. Our alliance partner, BMS, is taking lead and engaging with CMS and an official process to determine the price for Eliquis in Part D that will begin in January 1st, 2026. And also, as I'm sure you can appreciate, we're not going to comment on an ongoing price-setting process and negotiation."", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes, it's very difficult to comment on these things because they are ongoing. So it's very inappropriate and absolutely could complicate things. I understand that there is a need for people to understand because that's an important product. And we will try as soon as possible and practical to be able to provide the level of details that we are looking at everybody is looking so that we can model it appropriately."", ""Thank you very much. Let's move to the next question, please."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Andrew Baum with Citi.', 'Andrew Baum -- Citi -- Analyst', ""Many thanks. A couple of questions, please. First to Aamir, under your new leadership and commercial focus, what key products would you guide us to of recent launches that we should look for in terms of acceleration of rollout trajectory? And it doesn't have to be recently launched, established ones as well. And then second to Mikael."", ""Could you just share a little bit more information about your next-generation PCV vaccine, specifically how many serotypes? And I'm assuming that given it's a new technology, you will lose the ability to grandfather the pneumonia claim from the CAPiTA trial into the profile as it matures. If you could confirm, that would be great."", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you very much, Andrew. Your assumption, I don't think it is correct, but Mikael will answer that. But let's first go to Aamir to basically give us a view how you see in '24 the priorities of the commercial execution in the U.S."", 'Aamir Malik -- Chief Business and Innovation Officer', ""Yes. So, Andrew, I'll take a step back and let me start by saying, I've been very excited about this role and this opportunity. And also to do it with the team that we've built, which is a mix of both seasoned Pfizer leaders as well as experienced leaders from outside of Pfizer. I mean, my focus and we can talk about specific products, we've touched on many of them already."", 'But my focus overall is on execution excellence, right? So in our primary care and specialty care portfolio, we have a lot of great brands. We have some really enduring franchises, Vynda, Eliquis, Prevnar. I spent quite a bit of time talking about that. Our focus there is to defend and grow where we can and we do see some opportunities.', ""And we also have to acknowledge that we have some brands that have great value propositions, but they happen to be in highly competitive categories with some very, very well entrenched competitors. So in a situation like that, my focus is principally, let's really prioritize the actions that can grow each of the brands and we can talk about the individual launches. There's a lot of operational focus on blocking and tackling, including contracting. And then when we look at our main resources, we have our field force, our advertising and promotion dollars and our medical capabilities just prioritizing exactly where we put those."", ""That is what I'm focused on with me and my management team. And as I mentioned, we see opportunities in some of the core franchises and defending and growing our share but then also in a number of our launches. And Albert mentioned in his opening remarks what we hope and expect to do with Abrysvo, with Nurtec, with Litfulo, with Sabinko. Those are all brands that we're going to continue to focus on, including some of our recent acquisitions like Oxbryta as well."", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Aamir. Andrew, let me take the liberty to ask also the other commercial leaders to comment a little bit on their priorities because that will give you better sense of the whole picture. Alexandre, in international, as you are taking over, what are your key priorities?', 'Alexandre de Germay -- Executive Vice President, Chief International Commercial Officer', 'Thanks for the question, Albert, and the opportunity to share my priorities. My main focus is really to focus on the area where we can generate material growth with improved return on investment. This is my mantra. How are we going to do that? My top four markets in the order, China, Japan, Germany, and France represents 40% of our international divisions.', ""So it's quite concentrated. Those four markets will report directly to me so that we can have the resources and support the country to execute on their plan at best and to generate the most growth. Our top 15 country represents 70% of our total international. So it's, again, quite concentrated."", ""What I'm actually doing currently is in each of those markets, we are selecting drivers of growth. What are the key in-line and the key new products where we can have material impact with improved return investment? So I give you an example, of course, is going to be different from one country to the other because the archetype and the dynamic of those markets are different. So last week, I was in Japan. And so for instance, Vyndaqel, diagnosis rate is half the diagnosis rate that we have in the U.S."", ""and in France. So we reviewed last week the plan to go and catch those increased diagnosis rate. And we're going to continue to, of course, track on execution. In Germany, Eliquis has a very strong Eliquis franchise."", ""We believe we have got untapped opportunity. And I'm next week in Germany to actually review the plan on the Eliquis precisely. And we'll do the same thing on the new product. And it's going to be, for instance, Lorbrena in China."", ""As you know, lung cancer in China is unfortunately affecting a large proportion of the population. And as a matter of fact, the proportion of the lung cancer that can benefit from Lorbrena in the worldwide community is about 1.7%. In China, it's actually 7%. So we believe we have a huge opportunity."", ""What are we doing is actually developing a plan, last week when I was visiting China, to quickly get Lorbrena to those patients that could benefit from the clinical outcome. So this is really what I'm doing in each of our top 15 countries. Then frankly, the rest of the year will be simply tracking our execution, tracking all the metrics both from activities, medical activities and KPIs for each of our key products."", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'And then maybe, Chris, also on the commercial front? How do you think of the oncology in the U.S. evolving?', 'Chris Boshoff -- Executive Vice President, Chief Oncology Officer', ""Thank you, Andrew, Albert. Our biggest priority right now is obviously continuity of the business. We've done a lot of work during the last nine months during integration planning. And we don't want to miss a peak and it's now moving toward flawless execution with immediate priorities, obviously, the Padcev launch for advanced/metastatic bladder cancer from the EV-302 study, the launch of Xtandi in non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer from the EMBARK trial, the early launch, and also focus on access and awareness during 2024 for Abrysvo in late-line multiple myeloma."", 'And for Talzenna where up to 25% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer would be eligible in the U.S. for the -- from the indication.', 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you, Chris. And then let's go to Mikael Dolsten, if you can make some comments on the next generation as much as you can share about sales."", 'Mikael Dolsten -- Chief Scientific Officer and President, Research and Development', ""Yes. I think we have a very strong position with good momentum in the PCB conjugate. And I think Alexandre, you mentioned just the positive recommendation we got for PCB 20 in Europe. Now we're building on that unique platform."", ""And as Andrew did say here, we are able, what you call, grandfather in unique claims for the higher segment for penumococcal pneumonia. It's really the major burden with 150,000 U.S. hospitalizations. And to the best of our knowledge, the Pfizer platform with a new fourth generation, as was with the third generation, will be the only one that can that claim based on, as you said, the original CAPiTA studies."", ""Now the new generation will contain more serotypes, has applicability for adults and possibly pediatric as we have done with all of ours. And it also will include improvement on existing serotypes to, all together, get a very good increased coverage versus the PCV20. And I do think we are the one that really can continue this expansion of more serotypes, but you need communication chemistry to carry some reformulations. And I am cautious to abandon Neseritide where you work on infant and adults as the characterization what caused disease, for example, pneumonia is not very well described, so maintaining the coverage as we have uniquely and it's not really happening with the other product is a unique differentiation."", 'So I feel very good about the fourth generation.', 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you, Mikael. Let's go to the next question, please."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.', 'Geoff Meacham -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for the question. Albert, the oncology franchise following Seagen, I suspect, will probably be one of your bigger growth drivers for Pfizer going forward. The question is, is there an intermediate or long-term target as a percent of revenue that you're looking to achieve for this segment? And then are there technologies beyond ADC that you think could be additive to the pipeline?"", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. Very general, then I will ask Chris to comment a little bit on the technologies that we are having here. I can't say how much oncology will contribute. But clearly, we have given expectations about Seagen, and we say that we expect it to be at $10 billion by year 2030 from $3.1 billion we gave guidance in 2024."", 'And actually, we feel very good about the $10 billion. The more data coming, when we gave the $10 billion, we were not aware of some of the readouts that follow that projection. So we feel very, very good about that. Now, I have to say that the Pfizer pipeline in oncology, I think was also among the strongest in our therapeutic areas.', ""So I think the combination, in general, is giving us, let's say, a lot of strength. But Chris, why don't you comment a little bit about how you see the R&D evolution of oncology, the platforms you are going to base your strategies?"", 'Chris Boshoff -- Executive Vice President, Chief Oncology Officer', 'Thank you. So with the modalities we want to focus on for now are those where we see we have significant strength and capabilities, including with medicinal chemistry, our protein engineering as well as our strength in cancer biology. We therefore want to focus on small molecules, especially from our La Joya site, bispecifics, both La Joya and the new Seattle site and ADCs in Seattle. So small molecules, biologics.', ""As you know, we do have an interest also in allogeneic CAR T cells with the formation of Allogene, the company we still follow and have a significant interest in. But we're now focused on those three modalities where we see significant opportunity also for combinations, for example, doing small molecules, ADCs, but also potentially in the future between ADCs and bispecific."", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Chris. Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.', 'Mohit Bansal -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe a question on Nurtec, the trends in market share as well as pricing. Just wanted to make sure that is there a significant price delta between Nurtec price versus the competitor price, I mean, the discounts that they are offering, given that your competitor has multiple offerings in the headache market.', 'And if there is a delta, do you expect this to grow or decline over 2024 on pricing?', 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Mohit, very much. Aamir, about Nurtec and in general, the migraine franchise.', 'Aamir Malik -- Chief Business and Innovation Officer', ""So Mohit, thanks for the question. So we were encouraged by Q4 for Nurtec, and I'll also include some comments on Zavzpret as part of my response. We were up more than 30% versus the prior year and 20% -- over 20% versus the prior quarter. And there's a few things that are encouraging."", 'Nurtec continues to be the No. 1 prescribed CGRP, so we have leading TRx volume and share. Interestingly, more than 90% of new prescribers in the category, many of whom are primary care physicians are prescribing Nurtec. And our pills per Rx has also, over the last several quarters, been steadily writing.', ""So we continue to see opportunity. And there's a few things to keep in mind. One is, there's still a lot of unmet need. Albert referred to it in his written remarks."", ""But there's a lot of patients undiagnosed. Very few get an Rx therapy. Oral CGRPs are still only less than 20% of the Rx market. But as you point out, this is also a very competitive category with Qulipta and Ubrelvy."", ""And I won't comment specifically on their pricing strategies versus ours and GTMs play a role in all of it. But our focus for Nurtec, one, I think we want to be sharper and more competitive in our patient engagement and activation. Two, we have an opportunity with our field force to focus on both the most relevant CGRP writers, and as I said, PCPs. PCPs write two-thirds of triptans but only about a little over one-third of CGRP so there's an opportunity there."", ""And then patient access and experience, there's an opportunity to really reduce the friction there. And I will also mention Zavzpret because with an intranasal, we think we can have a very nice complement to an oral for either rapid pain relief, and there's also an unmet need for patients that have nausea and vomiting from the use of an oral. So we want to continue to invest in growing our Nurtec and Zavzpret franchise."", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you. Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen.', 'Steve Scala -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', ""Thank you. Two questions. First, on Danuglipron, I know Pfizer doesn't want to provide an update. But clearly, the company has greater insight than we do into how the once-daily version is performing in the phase 1 PK trial."", ""So I'd like to ask how would you characterize that performance so far? In the absence of any visibility, it's kind of hard for us to be confident in the outlook for this program. Second question is a new weight loss agent was added to phase 1, designated 6016. Can you tell us what the mechanism is, please?"", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. Steve, I'm going to disappoint you because you are asking things that we have said we are not willing to disclose at this stage for multiple reasons. Clearly, on Danu, we have more information than is very normal with everything that we are doing because we're having a very complicated, as I said, multiple experiments plan right now. But because we don't have new data, we're not going to comment on that."", ""And on the new weight loss molecule also, we said that unfortunately, we are not going to disclose the mechanism of action. The reason is because, first of all, it's too early. We don't want to keep competition, nothing strange about that. So I'm sorry to disappoint you but there is not much to offer at this stage."", ""Hopefully, as we said, mid-year is where we expect to have more information on that. Let's go to the next question, please."", 'Operator', 'Next, we have David Risinger with Leerink Partners.', 'David Risinger -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst', ""Thanks very much and thanks for all the updates. So I have two questions, please. First is for Dave. Could you please discuss the '24 gross margin prospect in some detail."", ""I think on the last call, you had discussed potentially a low 70% gross margin. But if you can comment on that in more detail, that would be helpful. And the second question is for Mikael. If Danuglipron once-daily does have a profile that you're looking for, would the company then conduct a phase 2A dose ranging study to assess the efficacy and tolerability in order to design a dose to advance phase 2B or phase 3?"", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks, David. Very quickly, Mikael, resolve Danu and then we'll go to Dave."", 'Mikael Dolsten -- Chief Scientific Officer and President, Research and Development', 'Yes, you heard Albert say that we are running a number of clinical experiments to garner insight in that molecule, and we have a second lift. Pfizer has always been open to consider different types of clinical study design. And in general, we tend to move into directly whenever data is supportive, if there is a large safety database into phase 3 with a lead-in phase. But we have to look at each program by program.', 'So when we have all the data, we will be able to share with you.', 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. Let's go to the gross margin where we can serve a little bit more information."", 'Dave Denton -- Chief Financial Officer', ""So David, this is Dave, and I'll be very brief here. Obviously, we've indicated our '24 gross margin expectations are in the low 70s as we discussed previously. As you know, as we cycle into '24, there's a few things that are happening, as I indicated earlier. One is, as COVID comes down, we're kind of deleveraging as COVID had absorbed a lot of fixed overhead."", ""So that's compressing gross margins. Secondly, we're in the process of in-sourcing many of the acquired products over the last couple of years. And as we in-source, the short-term effect of that is dampening on gross margin, which gives us an opportunity to improve gross margins as yields improve over time. nd then finally -- or two things finally here is new launches have that same characteristic, as we launch a new product, yields and performance in -- are not at peak performance."", ""That will be an opportunity for us going forward. And then finally, we have absorbed some inflation over time that is an opportunity for us to take out over the next several periods. So again, an opportunity for us to enhance performance over time. But again, we're in this roughly low 70s for 2024 is our expectation."", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""And David, let me add a little bit more color here, but the Comirnaty and Paxlovid are big products, but they are manufactured in the same facilities, but they are separate facilities so they are not affecting the margins of the other products. So the margins were really absorbing in those facilities when you had such a huge volume production and value reduction, of course, the margins were seriously -- those products are seriously taking a lot of the overhead. Now, as we are reducing our expectations for COVID into very realistic within targets, this doesn't mean that we have eliminated our capacity to produce more if the demand is there because that would be not responsible, first of all, from a public health perspective but also from our investors' money perspective. So that's why so far, we maintain all this capacity although the revenues are down."", ""So there's a significant. The second thing that David said, keep in mind, all basically our new acquisitions that brought so many new products, they were from smaller relative companies. They didn't really have their own manufacturing. So these were all outsourced and outsourced, of course, is way more expensive than when you are able to bring it."", 'There are plans for everything, in-source, but in manufacturing, that takes three years, right, to be able to reduce the margin. And the last but not least, we have disproportional amount of new loans. And those new loans are coming with a very big cost when you build infrastructure or something new to be developed, but of course, you build it for your PIK revenues. But of course, you start with very low revenues and then those are going up.', ""So as the infrastructure is there, but then higher revenue for these new products are coming, it's always the case with new products, but margins are expected. So it's not something about gross margins. You can see it in months. You see it in years the improvement."", ""But clearly, this is an area that we know why it's happening what's happening and how we can improve it. So let's go to the next question."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan.', 'Chris Schott -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Great. Thanks so much for the question. And maybe just for Dave and Albert, just kind of building on mid- to longer-term margin piece of the equation. It sounds like we should think about margin recovery as a gradual process versus a snapback? Is that fair? And I guess, the bigger picture question I was asking is just how do we think about reasonable longer-term margins, maybe not giving specific time lines, but can we think about kind of like mid- to high 30% operating margins as still a reasonable target for Pfizer? Or just kind of factoring in some of the dynamics we're seeing now, do we need to kind of rethink where margins can go over time?"", 'Dave Denton -- Chief Financial Officer', ""No, I think you're absolutely correct. Mid- to high 30s is a reasonable target for us, with a slight caveat in the sense that the vaccine program, Comirnaty, has a shared, as you know, gross margin level with our partner. And so that's dampening to gross margins and operating profit. So I'll say, slightly mix adjusted for that product."", 'And then from a progression standpoint, yes, you can think about this as a gradual steady improvement story over the next several periods.', 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you. Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Rajesh Kumar with HSBC.', 'Rajesh Kumar -- HSBC -- Analyst', ""Hi, there. Good afternoon. Just on the medium-term margin profile. Thank you for the color you've provided."", 'If you think about the growth aspirations you have, does that require you sacrificing some of the margins? So if you were to say, at the top end of your growth profile would we be looking at mid-30s gross margin or lower? Or what is the balance there? And the second one, you briefly touched on your capital allocation priorities earlier. Obviously, cost cutting and deleveraging is a priority for 2024. In the medium term, which are the therapy areas where you would deploy more capital after 2024 deleveraging exercise done?', 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""David, why don't you take that?"", 'Dave Denton -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. So maybe on the margin discussion, obviously, what we've said is we have invested pretty substantially in our business over the past couple of years. So largely, the investment phase at least from a business development standpoint is behind us. We have work to invest to improve performance going forward, but the big dollars are already invested now."", ""It's an execution story and a continued improvement story. So you should expect that to occur over the next several periods. Obviously, the higher the revenue, the better performance because you get to leverage your fixed costs. So clearly, the higher those revenue targets and achievements happen, the better improvement from a margin perspective you should expect from us."", ""And then from a capital allocation perspective, I think you said it right. We are, at the moment, focused on executing our plan, focused on supporting our dividend growth over time, but importantly, beginning to delever as we cycle into an integration of assets. And then from a priority standpoint, clearly, we've made a significant investment in oncology. You should expect us to put the investment thesis behind that franchise going forward."", ""Clearly, that's number one at this point."", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""And I would add that following the oncology, where clearly, we have right now the biggest part of our R&D expenses and we have a significant also part of our SI&A expenses. The other areas that we are putting a lot of emphasis when it comes to reserve, clearly, vaccines, it's vaccines and we plan to have significant productivity. In internal medicines, our metabolic franchise, it is an area that we are very excited. Obesity is part of that."", ""We do believe that obesity is a big market and it's growing. And we do believe that Pfizer has the capabilities that allows us to play and win in that area. So that's an area that we will continue investing. Immune inflammation, we have significant investments is the other area."", 'And of course, we have -- we are among the few that they have antiviral and on the effective still investments. So those are the areas that we will put money in, oncology, number one, then vaccines, metabolic diseases, immuno-inflammation antivirals are the ones that we are continuing to invest in. Next question please.', 'Operator', 'Next, we have Kerry Holford with Berenberg.', 'Kerry Holford -- Berenberg Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""Thank you. Just a couple of pipeline questions for me, please. Firstly, on RSV. Can we expect you to announce the date for Abrysvo following that third season in Q2? And then also on the two phase 3 starts, you've highlighted today B6A in lung and CDK4 in breast."", 'When can we expect phase 3 data readouts for these two products?', 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""I'm not sure -- what was your question on RSV?"", 'Kerry Holford -- Berenberg Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'To understand when are you going to publish the data from the following the third season, third winter season of RSV?', 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. Yes, I got it. Thank you. Why don't you take that, Mikael, on the Abrysvo? And then, Chris."", 'Mikael Dolsten -- Chief Scientific Officer and President, Research and Development', 'We continue to accumulate important RSV data and expansion of how the -- this important vaccine can be used. So you should expect this first half of the year, likely Q2, that we share more from our clinical trials, including full second season but also expansion in traditional age groups, as you can know, on clintrial.gov, we have active trials, and we think that will very nicely allow high-risk groups across a large age span to be addressed.', 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Mikael. And then, Chris?', 'Chris Boshoff -- Executive Vice President, Chief Oncology Officer', 'Thank you very much for the question. So the immediate readouts for this year, second half 2024 will be the vepdegestrant in second-line hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer, the VERITAC-2 study, also second half 2024. We expect to anticipate results from BREAKWATER, very important indication, up to 12% of colorectal cancer with BRAFTOVI in first-line BRAF CRC. The new study starting right now is CDK4, B6A and dasitumab in phase 3 programs and then also later this year for ECH2.', 'Those will appear in clinicaltrials.gov and primary completion dates beyond 2025 and 2026, but obviously, there could be interim results with earlier results.', 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you very much, guys, for answering Kerry's question. Let's go to the next question, please."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.', 'Chris Shibutani -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Thank you very much. Two questions, if I may. Aamir, with your prior role, you had talked about a $25 billion in revenues by 2030 that the company was looking to deliver based upon M&A. We have the impairment with Arena.', ""Is there an update for that? And now that you're in the role of U.S. Chief Commercial Officer, non-oncology, non-COVID, what would be on your wish list in your currency in terms of where you feel an opportunity to expand those revenues potentially through business development that could work to hit that $25 billion target by 2030? Then secondly, with the M&A activity across the industry, investors are always paying attention to what's going on with the FTC. Having passed through this gauntlet with Seagen last year, is there anything you can comment about to help us think about how regulators are thinking about the M&A environment in terms of particularly size of deal or any other dimension that you think is worth being aware of that might have been your observations from your experience in '23?"", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you very much. Aamir, why don't you take the question? By the way, let me clarify that Aamir's responsibility includes COVID revenue. So go ahead, Aamir."", 'Aamir Malik -- Chief Business and Innovation Officer', ""OK. So, Chris, there's a lot in what you asked. Firstly, on the $25 billion goal that we put out there, I'll just remind that we guided to $20 billion for what we plan on getting to by 2030 for the deals that we had done. And I would also just remind you that the $25 billion was a 2030 goal, so there is lots of time between now and 2030 to achieve that goal, consistent with our capital allocation priorities that Dave described."", ""On your second question, I mean, to be honest, yes, everyone's got a wish list, but my focus is on exactly what I described right now and what we talked about as a management team, which is delivering value from our launches and delivering value from the deals that we've done. So that's where my focus is. Now lastly, in terms of FTC, it's not appropriate for us to comment on what the FTC is going to do or not do. But what I can say is that we feel very good about how we have operated with all regulators in all regulatory sites across the world to get done all the deals that we did."", 'And I think that just speaks to our patient-centric approach and our collaborative nature with regulator.', 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you. Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'Next, we have Akash Tewari with Jefferies.', 'Akash Tewari -- Jefferies -- Analyst', 'Fair point on the Prevnar comments with the impairment charge and kind of the moving parts between adult pediatric and international. Consensus had modest top-line growth over the next few years for the entire franchise. Is that a reasonable expectation for investors, given the increased competition from Merck and the U.S. pool shrinking? And then do you have an internal view on what the ACIP recommendation will be regarding Prevnar and VV116?', 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Look, Aamir, why don't you take the -- is it the Prevnar expectations? We don't comment on what the expectations of the Street are, right? So are we -- and I think we gave a very good, let's say, high-level trajectory how we see this market. In the U.S., the adult opportunity, it is mainly as always in with the adult, a catch-up opportunity. So where you come, you have a pool of all the people that are eligible, but some of them would choose to make the vaccine. Usually, that happens in the first year and maybe a little bit then on the second year."", ""We have exhausted, I think, this opportunity with a 96% market share. So right now, I don't think that we will see in the U.S. in the adult huge opportunity. Merck competition is coming into that."", ""So this is not a very big growth area for us because, as I said, this is not where we plan to do it. It's huge when you launch them very quickly, goes down because then it is just the people that we are really graduate, they are going into this cohort in terms of age. The big opportunity is pediatric because it is four doses, it's not one. And because it is a huge cohort every year, way bigger the cohort of newborns than people that are becoming 65."", ""So that's how we should see it. So there is nothing much to add into that. Next question, please."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our last question will come from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Evan Seigerman -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""Hi, guys. Thank you so much. Two questions from me. One, when you think about the additional $25 billion revenues by 2030, now that Seagen's part of this business, where are we in getting to that metric? And then my second question is really on Oxbryta on sickle cell disease."", ""When you bought the asset, you really -- you noted that you plan to speed up the distribution of the drug to parts of the world most impacted by the disease. We haven't really seen much OUS, given recent competitive approvals of in the Middle East. How do you think about the OUS opportunity in context of the competitive updates there? So Seagen and then thinking about some Oxbryta comments."", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""On Seagen, maybe I can take it because that's an easy answer. From Seagen, we expect to get $10 billion by year 2030. That was a number that we put out there when we announced the acquisition. Since then, a few things that have reinforced our confidence in this number have occurred."", 'The first one, it is that ADC became the hottest thing on the M&A activity. Everybody wants an ADC, which basically our big bet was in this technology. So it looks like there is an overall consensus among investors, companies, analysts that this is a technology that will deliver a lot. So that gives us a lot of comfort that happened after we announced.', ""The second thing that also happened after we announced this $10 billion was that Seagen came out with significant readouts or significant products that were beyond our expectations. But also what you don't see but we see, they are advancing a lot of stuff that some of them we will show you in the 29 of February. So also, it was a bet in the technology, a bet in the company, we feel that we did very well in both. So the $10 billion is $10 billion of the $25 billion but we remain -- we don't change it, but we remain confident that we can make it."", 'Then of course, in addition to that, there was an additional $10 billion for all the other things that we have done, and this $5 billion that we could execute. Now on Oxbryta, how Oxbryta is doing, Aamir?', 'Aamir Malik -- Chief Business and Innovation Officer', ""Yes. So Evan, with regards to Oxbryta and then I'll comment on the acquisition as well since you referred to that. We're pleased with the U.S. performance."", ""Q4 was up 30% over the prior year and 14% over the prior quarter. The prescription trends are very solid. We've made a lot of investments in customer-facing teams since we made that acquisition. So we like the momentum that we're seeing in the U.S., and we expect to see more."", ""Right now, the rest of the world is a very small part of Oxbryta revenue and that is something that will take time to develop and we'll obviously look at that appropriately. And as you think about the GBT acquisition, it's important to look at Oxbryta, but I also would remind you that we're also very excited about GBT601, which we expect can bring a lot of value in addition to Oxbryta. Some of it will -- if it's successful from a clinical and regulatory perspective, some sales will be cannibalized, but there will also be room for Oxbryta in the market to continue to grow. So when you look at the combination of the momentum in the U.S., an opportunity that's yet to be developed outside the U.S."", ""and 601, where we presented great data at ASH in December, we think that there's a lot of value to be gained from this acquisition."", 'Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Yes. And I would add, it is the same exactly with the GBT acquisition. When we did the acquisition, we announced our projections for year 2030. Since then, things have improved in terms of our confidence to deliver these numbers.', ""And I'm not talking only that Oxbryta is performing exactly as we thought it would, but the most important upside is that we had data that we didn't have when we made the acquisition on the 601 but has the potential to become a transformative therapy in the sickle cell and really, really brings to the next step change if that thing -- if the phase 3, let's say, reconfirms the phase 2 results. So also over there, I think what we announced, we feel now we're more confident but we should be able to achieve and hopefully exceed. So with that, I think we start to end the call. In summary, we are optimistic about the year ahead."", 'We have defined our five key priorities that will keep us focused. And I repeat again, this will be a year of execution. I have a sample, a team, that are handy that I believe are the absolutely right leaders to execute. And I know that the whole world was impressed with the way that we executed our COVID strategies, how we were able to execute on the R&D front, on the manufacturing front and on the commercial front with two products, the vaccine with the highest market share, and with the product in oral antiviral.', ""We plan to repeat the same execution excellence level as we are building oncology leadership, as we are progressing the next wave of our pipeline, as we are maximizing the performance of all these new launches that have happened, as we execute our cost realignment program starting this year with SI&A, but also which you will see the results. But of course, the program to improve the gross margin that you won't see results now because it takes long but we started now as we speak, and laser focus in maximizing value for shareholders with the way that we allocate our capital. The team is there to make sure that this will happen, and I think we should meet again in three months, and we will see how we are progressing against those stated goals.

The pharmaceutical giant saw a smaller hit than expected from its declining COVID business and is ready to embark on a new chapter, reaffirming its full-year guidance for 2024.', ""I'm very happy to be-- happy to be joined now by Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla. Albert, it's good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us."", 'ALBERT BOURLA: Thank you for having me, Julie.', ""JULIE HYMAN: So as I said, the COVID numbers beat your lowered forecast from December. Sales of some of your other products did miss expectations. It was sort of a mixed picture there. But as we go through 2024, do you think you're going to have better visibility, better predictability from your COVID-related revenue as well as revenues from other products?"", ""ALBERT BOURLA: I do think so because the COVID revenues have been significantly derisked right now. It's not only how much is going to be the utilization of the product but it is basically that we have gone into commercial model. We have renegotiated multibillion-dollar agreements with multiple governments in the world to resolve the stock issues. So I think people can predict the COVID business very well."", ""But the non-COVID business also, it is the one that I think did very well in last year. We had the 7% growth, and we gave a guidance of 8% to 10% growth for the non-COVID business going forward. So we are very, very optimistic that we will make this guidance, and that's why we reaffirmed it."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And you have been laying out this vision for a post-COVID Pfizer, right? The Seagen acquisition obviously a huge part of that and building out that cancer franchise. But it seems like there is a bit of a disconnect between the vision and the optimism that you're expressing and what we're seeing reflected in the stock price and what we're hearing from Wall Street. What do you think accounts for that? What do you think the Street is missing here?"", ""ALBERT BOURLA: I don't think that the Street is missing something. I think the Street was disappointed because we missed our initial expectations on the COVID revenues, and then they were wondering what will happen with this cost base that was quite high. So it's just waiting to see how we are going to execute going forward, so it is a show-me story."", ""I think that we have a very, very good track record. You just mentioned that we beat the EPS consensus. You know, in the last five years, we had 20 earnings releases. In 18 of these 20 earnings, we beat the Bloomberg estimates in EPS. So it's not that we are a company that is used to miss their projections or the external expectations. So we are moving into this new year with a very high confidence that all these investments that we have done so to address the post-LOE gap that we were expecting between year '25 to '30 will return-- will give a very, very good return on investment. And"", 'The flagship of this is, of course, the Seagen acquisition. That is going to position Pfizer as the leader in oncology.', 'JULIE HYMAN: You know, it\'s interesting when you talk about Seagen and the role that it\'s going to play. I was flagged to some commentary from JPMorgan today in reaction to the earnings, and one of the things they said is that the company does not have what they call a, quote, unquote, ""clear anchor asset."" Do you think Seagen is that clear anchor asset? And if it is, why isn\'t that message being received?', ""ALBERT BOURLA: I think Seagen is the anchor platform. When we announced the acquisition of Seagen back in '23 early, we actually made a very big bet in two things-- one, the ADC technology, and secondly, a company that we felt can excel in this technology."", 'Since then, I feel very good for both, actually way better than when we announced. The ADC technology has become the hottest thing in M&A right now. Every company is trying to find an ADC. But, you know, what is available is one product here, a product there. With Seagen, we were able to get the whole platform of four marketed products that are having a very strong lifecycle plan, 13 assets that were in different stages of the pipeline, and the know-how and technology. But it was positioned in the company as the best company of ADC. So I feel that there is an overall consensus in the market that the bet on the technology was the right one.', 'Now coming to the company, I feel even better because since we announced the acquisition, Seagen was able to release data that were transformational in terms of efficacy that they were able to demonstrate in very difficult-to-treat cancers like bladder cancers. So both company and the technologies where I think we are placing our bets, and I think that will be a significant anchor for us.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Now in addition to the enthusiasm over ADCs, as you know, the market has been sort of obsessed with the new weight-loss franchises that are out there. Now, you have an experimental drug on that front, but I do wonder what you make of the hype, some would say, the obsession, some would say, over these new weight-loss drugs. Do you think that that is warranted?', ""ALBERT BOURLA: Look, I can't comment if the stock appreciation that is following, let's say, this obsession, as you called it. It's having as a result. But I think that obesity, it is a major, major problem for the health of humans. I think that the GLP-1s have been proven to be very, very good medicines, and I think it's just the beginning of an era that new antiobesity medicines will come."", ""So I'm very optimistic about the science, and we are not having only one. We have three obesity assets right now in the clinic. And, of course, we are working on many other which are not in the clinic yet."", 'JULIE HYMAN: When we were in Davos, I know you spoke to ""Barron\'s,"" and you talked about investing your pension back into Pfizer\'s stock as another sort of sign of optimism here. Did you want that to be partially sort of a signal to investors about your confidence in the company\'s future?', ""ALBERT BOURLA: First of all, it is a signal that I have a high confidence, and I put my money where my mouth is. So I'm all in. So it was a significant investment for my financial situation, and I put it all in Pfizer because I believe it is one of the best investments that anyone can do right now. So then the investors, of course, they should make their own calls. But myself, my entire pension went in December into Pfizer stock."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Albert, finally I want to ask you about the bigger backdrop in the world right now because as we know, as you were-- as Pfizer was developing the COVID vaccine, you forged a lot of strong relationships with world leaders. As you talk to them now, as you have different conversations, there are obviously a lot of different challenges and conflicts facing the world now. We have Russia-Ukraine. We have Israel, which is now expanding into the Red Sea. We have ongoing US-China tensions. What do you think is most acute, biggest risk there, and how are you thinking about how to manage that?', 'ALBERT BOURLA: There is no doubt that we are living turbulent times, and the geopolitical tensions are right now at an unusual peak. But I think that world leaders, to the degree that I speak to them, they express from one hand concern about that, but also they express optimism that the world will overcome those challenges and a better future is coming.', ""I discuss a lot science issues with a lot of these leaders, and I know that they are very optimistic about what I expect to be a scientific renaissance. I think that, going forward, you are going to see, in the life sciences particularly, significant advancements, not only in biology, but also in technology, AI being one of them. That will allow us to deliver meaningful solutions to patients for diseases that they didn't have a solution before. Oncology, it is clearly one of our very big bets, but the same will happen in many other areas."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Albert, I also-- you talking about the promise of oncology and of science also makes me think about some recent findings that show that the rate of cancer is growing, and in particular, among younger people or younger than it used to be. What do we know scientifically about why that's happening, and how is that going to inform how we treat and even eventually hopefully prevent these cancers?"", ""ALBERT BOURLA: I'm not sure I have all the answers to that, but there is an element that, first of all, people are living longer, and you know cancer is clearly related to the age. So as people are living longer, you have higher incidence of cancers. But as you said also, there are reports and statistics that are demonstrating that we have now more cancer in younger people."", ""I think it's more because we have diagnostics, better diagnostic tools, and then more cancers are diagnosed around the world that were not diagnosed before. I don't know if there are other conditions that are contributing to the growth of patients with cancer other than that. But what I know, it is that right now among all therapeutic areas, cancer is the one that I am mostly most optimistic that science will deliver meaningful solutions. So I think it's good news for patients."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Well, let's hope that you are correct on that front. Albert Bourla, thank you so much. Really appreciate your time today."", 'ALBERT BOURLA: I thank you very much.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Thanks.']"

We're gonna start off with PayPal rising higher as the company-- well, now we're ticking lower by about 2/10 of a percent. Headlines, that's going to reduce its workforce by about 9% this year, as chief executive officer, Alex Chriss, looks to cut costs and improve profits."", ""So that's the headline we're seeing here, Julie. PayPal will reduce its workforce by about 9% in a letter to staff on Tuesday. This per Bloomberg, Chriss saying the decision was made to rightsize the company. Affected staff apparently are going to be notified by the end of the week. We saw a similar round of cuts last year in this time, last January. And [INAUDIBLE] is going to affect about 2,500 workers."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and we've been talking a lot about cuts recently, haven't we? You said the shares rose because they did rise, initially, after this headline came out, and then they kind of dipped back down again, maybe because PayPal has a lot of issues before it in the eyes of investors."", ""We also learned today that Block was cutting jobs, the artist formerly known as Square. It has a goal to cap its workforce at 12,000 people. And so that's why it was doing its cuts. We talked earlier about UPS, which announced cuts of 12,000 workers. So in other words, it's cutting the same number of workers that Block wants to cap its workforce at, which just shows you the size of UPS."", ""What struck me in the UPS announcement is, CEO Carol Tomé said, those workers are never coming back. This is not a temporary reduction. It's sort of a secular permanent change in the way they do business, that they want to be more efficient and use technology more. But it's just interesting in the context of all of these other cuts, all of these companies just really focusing on efficiency, and not in the case of UBS, but in a lot of these cases, being rewarded by investors."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, and PayPal specifically was interesting. We always talk about the kind of idiosyncratic puts and takes. I mean, PayPal is an interesting one. And we've talked a lot about this name because you do have a new CEO, Alex Chriss, named CEO over the summer. And we've talked about how the Street has actually become gradually more cautious on this name. You have seen a number of recent downgrades for different reasons, whether it's competition or pressure on profitability. But the stock, it's up about 4% or 5% this year, but still down about 20% over the last 12 months."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, definitely. Let's move to the oil patch, shall we? Shares of Schlumberger slipping today after Aramco, the Saudi Arabian oil company, said the Saudi government has ordered it to not ramp up its oil production capacity. Aramco said it had been working to increase its production capacity to 13 million barrels a day. Schlumberger and the other oil field services providers falling on the news. Now, why is this a big deal? Well, first of all, Saudi Aramco is huge."", 'JOSH LIPTON: It is the largest oil company on the planet.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Exactly. Secondly, this is a big reversal for the company. It had been planning to boost capacity. Now it's planning to draw back. So there are lots of implications. Obviously, there are implications for these companies and demand for their products, and there are implications for what the Saudi Kingdom believes is the long-term demand for oil, which is quite interesting."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, I mean, I thought it was a [INAUDIBLE] because, one, as you put it, Julie, the first question is, OK, that's really interesting, how the Kingdom is thinking about what global oil demand looks like in the future. Also, where the Kingdom is putting money to work. You know, I mean, crude is, of course, listen, it's still foundational, obviously, to the Saudi economy."", ""But we know they've been expanding natural gas, chemicals, right, renewables. Bloomberg, by the way, citing sources. It says it's those businesses I just named likely get a share of the money saved from the oil capacity expansion. So there are a lot of different, interesting threads. I would say, listen, Schlumberger got hit on this news, but a number of names did, too. Halliburton, I saw down. Baker Hughes as well."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, Weatherford as well. Yeah, really interesting story.', ""JOSH LIPTON: One to watch for sure. All right, let's finish it out here. Super Micro Computer shares surging today. Look at that pop. That's after earnings beat on the top and bottom lines. Company also raising guidance for the full year."", 'A couple interesting-- so obviously, the server maker here, they reported investors liked what they saw. Q2 net sales, 3.66 billion, Julie. That was a beat. They raised their revenue estimate for the year. They now, it looks like, see fiscal year revenue between $14.3 and $14.7 billion. Big move already this year. I mean, this stock jumped not only this year, but this follows a jump of about 235% in 2023.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Wow. This comment from the analysts at Barclays stood out to me. They said, one of the takeaways from the call with management is that AI demand is still outstripping supply, which, obviously, has potential takeaways for AMD, which reports after the close today, NVIDIA, and many of the other server and semiconductor companies that are servicing this booming AI universe, if you will. So we'll see if, indeed, there's the followthrough."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, and other analysts were saying, Julie-- I saw some notes-- yes, very strong demand with this name. No doubt you're seeing the reaction. How much is already priced in, they were asking, is worth noting after the kind of ramp you saw here."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Always a good question.']"

The stock rose by less than the S&P 500 index last year, even if you account for IBM's generous dividend payouts. In fact, for part of the year, IBM's shares even experienced negative dividend-adjusted returns amid the AI boom."", ""That's completely unfair, given the company's decades of AI expertise and its long-standing focus on this exact opportunity."", ""But I also get why the stock hasn't soared on AI-powered wings yet.

It takes time to convert surging enterprise customer interest into revenues and profits."", ""The details may vary on a case-by-case basis, but the basic story is always the same. Hot new technologies such as the Watsonx AI platform must go through several rounds of reviews and testing, focused on performance, security, integration with other systems, and more. Then, the purchase order may need sign-off from several layers of management, especially if it's a high-dollar contract with a multiyear commitment."", ""So today, IBM is quietly building tomorrow's AI-propelled results under the covers of confidential testing and consulting agreements. Early signs of this activity are already popping up."", ""For example, IBM's order bookings in generative AI and Watsonx services doubled between the third and fourth quarters of 2023. At the same time, the number of tech demos and pilot programs related to AI continued to increase during the fourth quarter. In other words, the proven interest is high and rising -- but it hasn't had time to convert these brewing commitments into revenues quite yet."", ""I think people have started catching on to IBM's AI-driven business prospects."", ""The fourth-quarter report it delivered on Jan. 24 was largely in line with Wall Street's consensus expectations, but the stock still soared by as much as 12.7% over the two days that followed the release. You see, the forward-looking parts of that report shone a bright spotlight on IBM's AI opportunity."", ""And it's more than a portfolio full of sophisticated AI tools and services aimed squarely at the needs of enterprise-class customers. A couple of rivals can keep up with IBM that far. But they can't match Big Blue's global consulting services, which come in handy for helping AI clients squeeze maximum value out of their Watsonx contracts. That's a win-win situation for IBM and its customers, unlocking a third win for shareholders."", '""We are the only provider today that offers both the technology stack with our Watsonx platform and consulting services for deploying and managing generative AI,"" CEO Arvind Krishna said on last week\'s earnings call.

References to MPC Capital during the prepared remarks today reflects stand-alone MPC Capital, excluding MPLX. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."", 'Michael J. Hennigan', ""Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. First, I'd like to recognize some changes we made at our executive management level. Maryann Mannen has been appointed President of MPC. In this role, she will be responsible for our Refining & Marketing, Commercial and HES&S organizations. John Quaid, previously CFO of MPLX succeeds Maryann as CFO of MPC. In addition to these changes, Rick Hessling has been appointed Chief Commercial Officer. Rick will lead our global feedstock and clean products teams with the goal of maximizing margin capture across the entire value chain. Brian Partee has been appointed Chief Global Optimization Officer. Brian will be responsible for assessing and redefining business processes that are critical to improving our performance, including our value chain optimization efforts and determining investments needed to accelerate the delivery of results. At a high level, these organizational changes put more emphasis on advancing important value-creating initiatives, driving increased performance throughout our entire value chain and making a step change in our cash flow generation capability.Turning to our 2023 results. We're pleased to continue to deliver on our strategic commitments. Full year cash provided by operating activities was over $14 billion on a consolidated basis, reflecting our team's strong execution. Our Refining & Marketing business delivered excellent full year results generating EBITDA of $12.74 per barrel of throughput and capture of 100%. These results reflect strong utilization of our assets and improved execution against our commercial strategy. Incremental to our Refining & Marketing results, our Midstream business posted nearly $6.2 billion of EBITDA. EBITDA for the Midstream segment grew by approximately 7% year-over-year or by approximately $400 million. We expect MPC will receive $2.2 billion of annual cash distributions supported by MPLX's most recent 10% increase to its quarterly distribution. MPLX is strategic to MPC's portfolio, its current pace of cash distributions fully covers MPC's dividend and more than half of our planned 2024 capital program. We expect MPLX to increase its cash distribution as it pursues growth opportunities further enhancing the value of this strategic relationship. We are committed to returning excess capital to shareholders. In 2023, we returned $11.6 billion through share repurchases, bringing total repurchases to over $29 billion since May of 2021. In addition, we increased MPC's quarterly dividend by 10% in the fourth quarter. Over the past 5 years, we have grown our quarterly dividend at a compound annual growth rate of over 12%. For the full year 2023, this capital return represents a payout of 92% of our operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns. Executing on our commitments, combined with a strong macro environment led to total shareholder returns of approximately 31% for MPC in 2023. Turning to our view on the refining macro environment as we head into 2024, global oil demand hit a record high in '23, and we see another year of record oil consumption in '24. The IEA is currently projecting demand growth of over 1.2 million barrels per day with their projections having been raised higher over the last 3 consecutive months. In our system, both domestically and within our export business, we are seeing steady demand year-over-year for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Global supply remains constrained and anticipated global capacity additions have progressed slower than expectations. Gasoline and diesel inventories remained tight globally. And as we look into '24 anticipate that above-average turnaround activity globally in the first quarter as well as the transition to summer gasoline blends will be supportive of refining margins. As we look further into 2024, we believe the U.S. refining industry will experience an enhanced mid-cycle environment due to global supply-demand fundamentals and its relative advantages over international sources of supply, including energy costs, feedstock acquisition costs and refinery complexity. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. These include: first, sustaining capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. Second, our dividend. We're committed to paying a secure, competitive and growing dividend. We intend to evaluate the dividend at least annually. Third, growth capital. We will invest capital but be disciplined where we believe there are attractive returns, which will enhance our competitiveness and position MPC well into the future. Beyond these 3 objectives, we will return excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count. From May of '21 through January 2024, we reduced our total share count by approximately 45%, repurchasing approximately 300 million shares at an average price of $97. As we execute in 2024, we remain committed to share repurchases as a key component of our capital allocation priorities. MPC's stand-alone 2024 capital investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals $1.25 billion. Underpinning our commitment to safety and environmental performance, sustaining capital is approximately 35% of capital spend. In Refining & Marketing, gross spending is down nearly $200 million compared to 2023, reflecting strong capital discipline. In 2024, we are focused on investments that enhance margin and reduce costs. In low carbon, we are investing in an opportunity that offers an attractive return, lowers our cost, increases reliability and reduces emissions. This morning, MPLX also announced its 2024 capital investment plan of $1.1 billion, which is anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann."", 'Maryann Mannen', ""Thanks, Mike. Solid execution of our 3 strategic pillars remain foundational. We believe the improvements we've made to our cost structure, portfolio and commercial execution have driven sustainable structural benefits, irrespective of the market environment. We will continue to build on this strong foundation to recognize value throughout our business. Our refining utilization in 2023 was 92% as we operated our portfolio to meet consumer demand. Recently, we have said we believe our average capture over longer periods of time is approaching 100%. And in 2023, our full year capture was 100%. This commitment to commercial excellence is foundational, and we expect to continue to see these results. While our capture results will fluctuate based on market dynamics, we believe that the capabilities we have built over the last few years and expect to enhance further will provide a sustainable advantage. Turning to our operations. In the Gulf Coast, the Galveston Bay reformer repairs progressed as planned. We started the unit back up in mid-November, and returned to full operating rates by mid-December. At our Martinez facility, we will be operating at approximately 22,000 barrels per day in the short-term. We have been working closely with the regulators to proceed with repairs to ensure safe and reliable operations. Let me move to Slide 7, which shows our capital investment plan for 2024 in a bit more detail. MPC's investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals $1.25 billion. The plan includes $1.2 billion for Refining & Marketing segments. Our growth capital plan is approximately $825 million between traditional projects and low carbon. We are investing primarily at our large competitively advantaged facilities to enhance shareholder value and position MPC well into the future. Within traditional Refining & Marketing, $100 million is associated with a multiyear project to increase finished distillate yield at the Galveston Bay refinery. $375 million is focused on smaller projects targeted at enhancing yields at our refineries, improving energy efficiency and lowering our costs as well as investments in our branded marketing footprint. Within low carbon, approximately $330 million is allocated to a multiyear infrastructure investment at our Los Angeles refinery, which will improve energy efficiency and lower facility emissions. And $20 million for smaller projects focused on emerging opportunities. Slide 8 provides an overview of the multiyear investment at our Los Angeles refinery. The Los Angeles refinery is a core asset in our West Coast value chain and is one of the most competitive refineries in the region. This investment once completed, is expected to further enhance its cost competitiveness by integrating and modernizing utility systems, which will improve reliability and increase energy efficiency. Additionally, a portion of this improvement addresses a new regulation mandating further reductions in emissions. This regulation applies to all Southern California refineries. The improvements are expected to be completed by the end of 2025. We expect to generate a return on our investment of approximately 20%. Turning to Slide 9. At Galveston Bay, we are investing to construct a 90,000 barrel per day high-pressure distillate hydrotreater. This project is planned to strengthen the competitiveness of the refinery through increased production of higher value finished products. Once in service, the new distillate hydrotreater will upgrade high-sulfur distillate to ultra-low sulfur diesel, eliminating the need for third-party processing or sales into shrinking lower-value high-sulfur export market. This strategic investment ensures we provide the clean burning fuel of the world demand and further enhances the competitive position of our U.S. Gulf Coast value chain. The project is expected to be complete by year-end 2027 and generate a return of over 20%. Turning to our low carbon initiatives. We challenge ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by setting meaningful targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, methane emissions and fresh water intensity. Targets, which we believe we can demonstrate a tangible pathway to accomplish. In our 2024 capital outlook, we are investing to significantly lower energy intensity and emissions at Los Angeles, one of our largest refineries. Additionally, we are investing in smaller amounts of capital in early-stage developments like RNG which could significantly aid in greenhouse gas emission reductions in the future. Overall, we're taking disciplined steps to advance our goal to lower the carbon intensity of our operations and the products we manufacture while continuing to supply a growing and evolving market by safely operating our current asset base with the objective to deliver superior cash flow. Let me turn the call over to John."", 'John J. Quaid', ""Thanks, Maryann. Moving to fourth quarter highlights. Slide 11 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.98 for the fourth quarter and $23.63 for the full year. This quarter's results were adjusted to exclude the $0.14 per share net effect of 3 items, a $145 million LIFO inventory charge. $47 million of net recoveries related to MPLX's Garyville incident response and a $92 million gain recognized by MPLX. Adjusted EBITDA was over $3.5 billion for the quarter and almost $19 billion for the year. Cash flow from operations, excluding working capital changes, was nearly $2.3 billion for the quarter and $13.9 billion for the year. During the quarter, we returned $311 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased over $2.5 billion of our shares. Slide 12 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter to fourth quarter of 2023 as well as the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $2.2 billion, driven by lower R&M margins. The tax rate for the quarter was 18% reflecting the impacts of the MPLX structure and a discrete benefit largely related to state taxes. For 2024, we expect our tax rate to be around 21%.Moving to our segment results. Slide 13 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment for the fourth quarter. Our 13 refineries ran at a 91% utilization processing nearly 2.7 million barrels of crude per day. Sequentially, per barrel margins were lower across all regions driven by lower crack spreads. Capture for the quarter was 122%. Refining operating costs were $5.67 per barrel in the fourth quarter, higher sequentially due to higher energy cost, particularly on the West Coast as well as higher project-related expenses associated with planned turnaround activity. Slide 14 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing margin capture of 122% for the quarter. We ran well and our commercial teams executed effectively to deliver strong results. Capture this quarter benefited from light product margin tailwinds, in particular for jet fuel, as well as less of a headwind from secondary product prices.Slide 15 shows the changes in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2023. Our Midstream segment delivered strong fourth quarter results. For the full year 2023, our Midstream segment EBITDA is up 7% compared to the prior year. Our Midstream business is growing and generating strong cash flows as we advance high return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins. Slide 16 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was nearly $2.3 billion in the quarter, driven by both our Refining and Midstream businesses. Working capital was a $1.1 billion use of cash for the quarter, driven primarily by declining crude prices. Cash from Ops for the quarter was also impacted by a $320 million headwind from changes in our income tax receivable, which you might usually expect to see as a working capital change. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $896 million this quarter. This includes MPLX's acquisition of full ownership of a gathering and processing joint venture in the Delaware Basin for approximately $270 million. MPC returned $2.8 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. This represents an approximate 125% payout of the $2.3 billion of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to deliver superior shareholder returns. As of January 26, we have approximately $5.9 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. And at the end of the fourth quarter, MPC had approximately $10.2 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments, including approximately $1 billion of MPLX cash. Turning to guidance on Slide 17. We provide our first quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of almost 2.5 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 83%. Utilization is forecasted to be lower than fourth quarter levels due mainly to higher turnaround activity. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $600 million. We are executing turnarounds at 4 of our largest refineries, Galveston Bay, Garyville, Los Angeles and Robinson all in the first quarter when margins are typically lower to minimize the financial impact of these outages. Turnaround expense for the full year is anticipated to be similar to last year at around $1.3 billion.Operating costs in the first quarter are expected to be $5.85 per barrel higher sequentially due mainly to lower throughput volumes associated with the significant planned turnaround activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.45 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $185 million. And with that, let me pass it back to Mike."", 'Michael J. Hennigan', ""Thanks, John. We've delivered strong execution on our strategic commitments again this year. This includes running reliably with high utilization, structural improvements to our commercial performance, fostering a low-cost culture and strengthening the competitive position of our assets. At MPLX, the partnership has continued to grow, increasing its cash flow and its cash distribution MPC. We've invested capital to grow earnings while exercising strict capital discipline. This has resulted in superior cash flow generation and supported the repurchase initiatives. Looking forward, we will continue to prioritize capital investments to ensure the safe and reliable performance of our assets, and we will also invest in projects where we believe there are attractive returns. We believe our focus on safety, environmental, I'm sorry, operational excellence and sustained commercial improvement will position us to capture this enhanced mid-cycle environment, which we expect to continue longer-term, given our advantages over marginal sources of supply and growing global demand. MPC's Midstream segment, consisting primarily of MPLX has grown EBITDA by $1.3 billion since 2019, which is a 6% compound annual growth rate over the last 4 years. As MPLX continues to grow its free cash flow, we believe it's in a strong position to continue to consistently grow its distributions. As a result of MPLX increasing its distribution 10% of [reach] in the last 2 years, MPC expects to receive $2.2 billion of cash distribution, which reflects a $400 million increase since 2020. Each 10% distribution increase is approximately $200 million of additional cash flow that MPC receives through its ownership in the partnership. In summary, this year, we generated $14 billion of cash from operations. We increased our dividend 10%, repurchased $11.6 billion of shares, resulting in a 92% payout ratio. In 2023, MPC's total shareholder return was 31%. We believe MPC is positioned as the refinery investment of choice with the strongest through-cycle cash generation and the ability to deliver superior return to our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back over to Kristina."", 'Kristina Anna Kazarian', ""Thanks, Mike. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. Sheila, we're ready."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.', 'Neil Singhvi Mehta', ""Yes. the first question is really on Slide 14, and this is what we're getting from investors this morning. which is the 122% system capture and that $885 million of margin uplift. And I recognize there's some sensitivities about what you can say and can't say here. But just can you talk about what drove that strength? And how much of this feels onetime-ish versus stuff we want to carry forward?"", 'Maryann Mannen', ""Neil, it's Maryann. Thanks for the question. So first and foremost, as you know, commercial performance has been and will continue to be a foundational pillar for us in terms of delivering outstanding execution and meeting the goals and objectives that Mike shared with you around delivering best through cycle cash flow throughout the cycles. In the quarter, we generated about 122% capture as we shared. Overall, as you know, we've been talking about our ability to continue to drive toward 100%. Over the last couple of quarters, Rick and Brian have been sharing with you some of the key elements around structural changes that we believe are sustainable, and then Mike announced this morning a couple of other changes, which we think will continue to drive our ability to identify and deliver against that foundational principles. In the quarter, we had a couple of benefits that delivered the 122%. So first of all, strong light product margins and frankly, a more favorable secondary products impact. This is not abnormal for this period of time. Having said that, we also saw stronger jet fuel premiums to diesel and the benefit of diesel blending, excuse me, of butane blending in the quarter as well. To your question, how much of this is repeatable? Obviously, some of those things are not repeatable, particularly when we look at the sharper drop in crude oil and refined product prices. We also did have the ability of having, as I shared with you, our reformer at GBR and other benefits of projects that we completed fully operating in the quarter. So let me pause there and see if that helped to answer your question at all."", 'Neil Singhvi Mehta', ""That's great, Maryann it's a lot of good color there. The follow-up is just on Slide 17, sticking with the deck here, which is it does seem like a period of heavier turnaround in Q1, particularly in the West Coast region. Maybe talk about the decision around where you took maintenance, how that fits into the full year plan? And anything we should be thinking about as you approach this turnaround season?"", 'Michael J. Hennigan', ""Yes, Neil, it's Mike. Yes, I think we said in our prepared remarks that our turnaround spend this year is about the same as last year. But the way you should think about it is, as Maryann mentioned, in the first quarter, we're pretty heavy at 4 of our largest facilities, our largest financial generating facility. So we're taking advantage of the fact that margins are down in the first quarter. So we're spending $600 million in the first quarter, which is a high number, relative to the full year. And I know we don't traditionally give quarter-to-quarter, but I'll just tell you that next quarter, the turnaround number drops down to like $200 million or so, somewhere in that range. So we're being opportunistic in some regard. A lot of the activity does get planned, but at the same time, we want to take advantage of the fact that the margin environment now is constructive for us to be off-line so that when margins, we think, are going to be a lot stronger in the second quarter, we'll have our 4 largest facilities turn around and ready to deliver results."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Manav Gupta with UBS.', 'Manav Gupta', ""First of all, congrats guys. I know one of the goals was to get to 100% capture, although Mike always stays focused on EBITDA per barrel margin and free cash. I know one of the goals was to get to 100% capture. So congrats on overshooting that mark. My question here is on the 2 growth projects. Los Angeles. Some of the people out there are looking to exit the state given the tougher laws, you were actually going back and investing in this project. So help us understand what's driving that? And again, on the Galveston Bay moving from upgrading high sulfur to ULSD, what kind of realization uplift could you get if you do execute this project?"", 'Michael J. Hennigan', ""Yes, Manav, this is Mike. I'll start. First of all, thank you for the comment on capture. And as you said, it's not my favorite metric, but I'm a big believer in how much cash are we generating, how much cash per share we're generating. And I want to lead in those categories is the metric that I spend the most time looking at. But, it does get some good indication, as Neil said, it's hard just to differentiate the question Neil asked between what's happening in the market? And what are some of the structural improvements that we've implemented over the last couple of years here. But anyway, thanks for the comment. As far as our capital investment, I'm hoping everybody sees a couple of things. One is, yes, we are investing in our L.A. facility. It's an area where we believe that we can put a decent amount of investment in there and really improve the competitiveness of that facility, but we already believe it's one of the top facilities on the West Coast. So it is an area that we want to invest in. Now that particular investment is about efficiency, reliability and lowering our costs. And to your point, being a very reliable supplier out there is an important part of the equation. The other project that we've announced is a margin enhancement project. And in our view, things are not going to get easier for unhydrotreated distillate into the future. And if you look at the spreads today, even today, they're pretty wide. So at the end of the day, what's driving us the most in both of those, when we put this in the slides is we think both of these projects are north of 20% returns. And hopefully, we're conservative on that, but we think they're very good investments. And again, in 2 of our largest, highest financial generating facilities. So one of the themes that you've heard from us is we're going to invest in projects that we feel really strong about on a return basis, but they're also enhancing in competitive positions of some of our biggest facilities. And I think you've heard the theme from us for a while here. It's margin enhancement, lower cost and efficiencies. And out on the West Coast, the other driver is there's emissions reductions goals that are going to occur over time, and this project will take care of that in a large way, and that's why we grouped it into our low-carbon area. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color."", 'Manav Gupta', 'Perfect. My quick follow-up here is you were looking to ramp towards the nameplate capacity at your renewables diesel project on the West Coast. If you can give us some update over there, how is that project progressing?', 'Maryann Mannen', ""Certainly, it's Maryann. Currently, we are running at about 22,000 barrels a day versus our nameplate at 48,000. We're going to continue to run at that level as we work with the regulators to determine what repairs need to be complete in order to be able to get to that nameplate at 48,000. As we think about that, as you know, we've got our JV partnership with Neste, so really, what we're looking at is the differential for MPC of about 13,000 barrels a day. So not meaningful to the 3 million-barrel system that we run. But again, running at 22,000 overall for the facility, and we'll continue to work with our regulators to determine when we can bring it to full 48,000."", 'Operator', 'Next, we will hear from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Securities.', 'Douglas George Blyth Leggate', ""Mike, I hate to do this. So I wonder if I could try to capture a question in a slightly different way because we, I guess, have a slightly different view of this. If you look at your system as more of an LP, we see a great deal of linearity between the indicator margin and what you're delivering. I think I agree with you. I think capture is a terrible metric to try and measure a linear program business, frankly. But what we do see, however, is that the mix of inputs seems to be changing some, which is allowing you to capture more of the margin. So my question is really that. What are you doing in your commercial business or operations that is changing the optimization of the slate that you're running in your system? Obviously, there are a lot of moving parts around crude in the U.S. right now with TMX and a few other things. Is that a factor?"", 'Rick D. Hessling', ""Yes. Doug, this is Rick. So I'll take a stab at that. So we are significantly I would say every day, Doug, we are optimizing our slate. And we look at this regionally. We look at this by plant. But in the end, Doug, I think what we do better than others in the industry, is we optimize for the betterment of our total return at the end of the day. So we are not, we could suboptimize one plant for the benefit of another, and we have worked years, decades, as a matter of fact, to give ourselves optionality within our Mid-Con system. We are currently juggling optionality with TMX in our West Coast and Pacific Northwest system as well as we've worked on it for quite a while on the Gulf Coast.So you are onto something from a crude slate perspective. It's constantly changing. We're constantly pushing the norm on what we should run, what crudes we look at, what assays we look at, updating our system. So this is just an ongoing exercise that's been happening now for several years now. And I've said it before, we're unpacking everything from A to Z, Doug, we're leaving no rock unturned in terms of capturing value. And that not only goes certainly on the crude slate side, but it goes throughout our entire value chain."", 'Michael J. Hennigan', ""And Doug, it's Mike. I know it's been a source of frustration since we don't give a lot of detail in this area for competitive reasons. But to Rick's point, we've made some changes. And to be honest with you, I'm more excited about what's in the future for us. Brian's new role as Head of Global Optimization for us, I think, is going to make a step change for where we're going. So we've had a lot of momentum in this area. It's showing up in the results. As we discussed, capture is not my favorite, but generating cash is.And at the end of the day, I think we have more opportunity in the whole area. If we run well and then deliver commercially, we'll continue to generate cash and be a good source of return for shareholders."", 'Douglas George Blyth Leggate', ""LPs are a complicated beast and you guys seem to have figured it out. So thank you for the answer, guys. My follow-up is probably for, it might be for Maryann. I'm not sure. Congratulations to everyone on the new roles. But Maryann, if I look at Slide 21, you're showing your debt maturity profile at the MPC level. Obviously, sitting with a net cash position at the MPC level, what are your thoughts on where you want your balance sheet to be as those debt maturities come due?"", 'John J. Quaid', ""Doug, it's John. I'll go ahead and take that."", 'Douglas George Blyth Leggate', ""I wasn't sure if you take or not."", 'John J. Quaid', ""No, no, it's not a problem at all. And I think you kind of -- were hinting at it as you were getting there. We've got a lot of financial flexibility right now. We're very comfortable with the gross amount of debt that MPC has but certainly have the balance sheet to be very thoughtful about the right timing of refinancing that debt and really optimizing our cost of capital and really that cost of debt. And I think longer term, right, we've laid out a target of kind of the gross debt to cap of 25% to 30%. We're a good bit away from that, but that's something we'll continue to monitor as we look out into the future."", 'Douglas George Blyth Leggate', 'And John, remind me, is that consolidated for MPLX or stand-alone?', 'John J. Quaid', ""It's stand-alone. (inaudible) in a much different position. I can probably speak to that one pretty well just given the seat I was in before, or you've got a really stable company running at sub-3.5% leverage, but the cash flows there can probably support a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4x. Again, they've got some financial flexibility to be smart about what they're doing as well. So I think both balance sheets are in a really strong place."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.', 'Paul Cheng', ""Good morning. I think in the past, you have shown that you are not really interested in acquisition of refining assets. But one may argue that, I mean, given how well you are running your facility, do you think that there's a value to be added to have some additional assets to your platform so you can apply your technical know-how to even a bigger profile. And also in the Gulf Coast, you have 2 huge refineries. If we add additional facility, would that further diversify and reduce the operating risk, having multiple facilities and also, frankly, that will perhaps even increased commercial and optimization opportunities. So just want to see that, I mean, how you guys look at that question internally?"", 'Michael J. Hennigan', ""Yes. Paul, first off, Dave Heppner's group is constantly looking at the market and what assets are available. I always say I never say never. But in the meantime, while Dave is working on that side of the equation, we're also looking at the footprint we have and the assets we have. And that's part of the reason that we came out with the announcement today. 2 of our key facilities, we think we can make a meaningful change. And we've been more transparent than normal to try and explain to people. We think we got north of 20% return projects here on the assets that we own ourselves.So, there's always a balance call between, obviously, the assets you own, you know inside and out, whereas the ones you're evaluating externally, there's a little bit of concern from diligence, et cetera. But I will tell you, I think people know my DNA in general. But at the same time, Dave and his team are challenging where can we make investments that are outside of our portfolio. We haven't done a lot, as you mentioned on the refining side. But we have made some investments overcalling low carbon. We made some investments in some pretreat facilities on the low carbon side. We've invested in an RNG facility. So Dave and his team are looking at both refining and outside of refining.And we just constantly talk about that and decide where do we think we want to put our capital. And for today, we're pleased to report that we think we have 2 pretty good projects. But the other part, let me just mention this one last thing because this is kind of important. On the slide where we talk about our capital, we say in traditional refining, we're investing $475 million. Maryann mentioned that $100 million of that is related to the DHT project, but $375 million of that is what we don't typically talk about on earnings calls. These are projects in all of our facilities that are higher returns, really good projects for us, but they don't have the sexy headline about them. But if you look at it, though, $375 million out of the $475 million in traditional are these smaller high-return projects. So, the team does a nice job.Tim and his organization are constantly looking for areas where we can make margin improvement, lower cost, increase reliability. As you said, this all starts with you got to run reliably, and then you got to be smart commercially. And I think we've demonstrated that a little bit, and then we just try to invest capital to keep bolstering that equation. So hopefully, that gives you a little more color."", 'Paul Cheng', ""Absolutely. Can I just go back into the commercial question. In the fourth quarter, you guys definitely done well in [your site]. And if we're looking at versus the margin capture of [100% additional 22%]. Is there a number that you can share how much of them is coming from the commercial side of the business that you have done really well? And that's why that you are seeing that much better in the capture. And also that I think in the past, you're saying that one of the maybe holy grail for commercial operations is that you will be able to optimize based on break down the (inaudible) and optimized based on the total company. Where are we in that process? Do you think that you're already there or that you're just still stretching the service on that process?"", 'Michael J. Hennigan', ""Yes. Paul, I'll start with the second part. As I said, I'll repeat myself a little bit, but we still think there's quite a ways to go where we can do better, and that was part of the reasoning behind the organizational change. Brian's role as global optimization lead is going to, his team is going to work with the commercial guys with our refining guys. And you heard me say we define process, find places to invest, change what we're doing today. So I think we've made a lot of progress. People always ask what inning or I guess it's football season. So what quarter are we in? And that's always hard to ascertain because I think we keep peeling the onion back and seeing that we can make another step change.So I'm optimistic that we got a lot of road to go. And I think at the end of the day, our mantra is we'll just keep watching our results and you'll see the -- what comes out of it. As far as the first part, it's always hard. That's why I'm not the biggest fan of that metric. It's always hard to differentiate some of the market factors that Maryann mentioned. Obviously, the fourth quarter, you get butane blending as one thing that enhances capture. But there is a significant, if I want to give some kudos to our team, there is a significant change in the way we're approaching the business. You heard from Rick earlier. And so I think it is additive to whatever the market has given us. And, and my thought is the way we have to run the company is we don't control the margin environment, but whatever margin environment is given to us, we just got to deliver more results and generate more cash and more cash per share.So while everybody outside and inside wants to talk about that capture metric, I just keep looking at the one that matters the most to me."", 'Maryann Mannen', ""Paul, it's Maryann. I just might try to add a bit more around some of the things that we're doing specifically around commercial performance without necessarily trying to give you a percentage. But we've been talking over the last several quarters about the capabilities we've built regionally, obviously, at Houston Office and Singapore office, London office that has helped us. Doug was laughingly saying to Mike about cracking the code on linear programming. But some of the capabilities that Rick and Brian and their respective teams have built historically give us very robust tools and data analytics that allow us to assess the decisions that we've made and know how good or bad those decisions were and what we might do with that to change it. So, it is building these capabilities are building sustainable learnings and capabilities in the organization that we think will continue to drive our performance. I hope that's a bit more helpful, too."", 'Operator', 'Next, you will hear from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.', 'Roger David Read', ""Yes. Congratulations on the quarter. Maybe just if we could address the changes here on the management team and whether or not that portend, what it does portend about the future. I know, Mike, you're approaching the point at which the Board has to make a decision to extend if I understood correctly from the meetings back in late November. So, anything you can offer us up on any updates there?"", 'Michael J. Hennigan', ""Yes, Roger, I'll start off with, the changes are driven by 2 things: Results, One of the things that I feel my responsibility is to reward the results that we're getting because the team has done a very nice effort across the whole team. And the Second part is development, putting people in positions such that they grow more personally so that they can contribute to the team. So both of those factors, I think, played into a lot of these assessments that occurred at the executive level, but it's also occurring below that and not everybody gets to see.So I'm a big believer in the team approach, practically in all decisions that we make all of our team is involved in. So there's a heavy component of development on top of the results that have occurred in the last couple of years. As far as me, personally, I think you've heard in the past, that's a Board decision. The Board is very aware of that. That will play itself out in time. But Board's, if it's not their top priority, it's obviously at the very top of the first couple is what their responsibility is. So that's just work in progress. It's been in progress for quite some time, and it will play itself out as time goes by."", 'Roger David Read', ""Okay. And then my other question was to follow up a little bit on the balance sheet question. I think, Doug had asked about in debt-to-cap guidance given. But if you keep buying shares back theoretically, you could end up shrinking the equity side, which could get you to the 25%, even if you held debt flat. So none of us can predict the future exactly where all this will shake out. But would that sort of math imply that you could actually end up staying at the same debt level? In other words, simply refinance the debt, implying that all the cash that's on there would be eligible for share repurchases or some other sort of return to shareholders, and that's the right math to follow?"", 'John J. Quaid', 'Roger, it\'s John. You read through my subtle comments very, very well. And certainly, the other part of that equation, right, is what we\'re doing on the equity side. So that was my comment, ""hey, we think our gross levels of debt are appropriate as we look forward"" because that will be part of the math. We\'ll take a look at that, but I think you\'re pretty spot on. I\'m not sure I can add much from what you said, to be honest.', 'Michael J. Hennigan', ""Roger, the other thing I would add -- I'm sorry, I just wanted to just add. As a general rule, my belief is we don't want to be underlevered. We don't want to be over-levered. We want to find what we think is the appropriate level. And we think we've been there and we've been consistent there. And that's why people should read into our cash position as that's going to be targeted for return to shareholders. I think our job is to generate the most cash we can, run the balance sheet properly, which we've done over the past, and then at the end of the day, return excess capital to shareholders."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from John Royall with JPMorgan.', 'John Macalister Royall', 'So I just had a follow-up on the balance sheet. You had another strong quarter for the buyback of $2.5 billion. But with the crack environment turning down, you did end up drawing almost $3 billion of cash. And despite the big maintenance coming up in 1Q, it looks like January is off to a really healthy pace at $900 million. So my question is, would you expect to maintain a similar pace throughout 1Q as you progress these turnarounds? And what could that mean for the cash draw and where balances could be at the end of 1Q?', 'John J. Quaid', ""John, it's John here. I'll take that one and let Mike add some other comments as well. But let me just start by saying, as I roll into the seat, I want to be clear, there's no change in how we're viewing return of capital, as you heard even in Mike's prepared remarks. Again, really strong performance last year, again, as we're looking to drive strong returns to our investors, and that will continue to be a key part of our capital allocation priorities in 2024. And as we look at that, we're going to look at lots of things. One, we want to be opportunistic in the overall capital allocation and we'll consider the refining macro environment along with lots of other items, but, and the balance sheet and where it is. But ultimately, I just want to be clear, we're going to be steadfast in our commitment to return of capital."", 'Michael J. Hennigan', ""John, it's Mike. The only thing that I'll add is we think it's part of our DNA and duty to return capital as part of our mantra. So we've been saying for quite some time, and we've been fortunate, as you said, the margin environment has been conducive to generating more cash. But we've targeted all along to return that capital to shareholders. We're going to continue to do that. And then again, whatever market environment we get handled, or get handed, I'm sorry, we'll make that still a priority for us. It's on our capital allocation priority. We'll start off with maintaining the assets, growing the dividend, investing in the business. So that's still part of our DNA as well. But at the end, I'm a huge believer is, give that capital back to shareholders and then let shareholders decide where they want to invest longer-term. We want to be the vehicle where we generate cash and return capital, and as people have seen that over time, that isn't going to change regardless of what the margin environment is."", 'John Macalister Royall', 'Great. And then I apologize ahead of time to Mike for this, but I do have another question on capture. But the commercial stuff aside, can you help us think about some of the moving pieces in the first quarter? And particularly, how should we think about the impact of the heavy maintenance in the quarter? Is this still a potential to be 100% type quarter given you have so much maintenance? And any other moving pieces that we should think about that might move you away from that 100% in either direction in 1Q?', 'Maryann Mannen', ""John, it's Maryann. And let me see if I can take that for you and address your questions. So first and foremost, as we say, we continue to think for 2024. Our objective is to drive toward that 100%. You're absolutely right in the quarter. As we said, we've got about $600 million, but we're touching crude units. So we're not expecting a significant amount of negative impact on our capture despite the fact that we are seeing that level of turnaround. Now as you know, we do have variables that impact the capture rate from quarter-to-quarter. But right now, we are not expecting turnaround to have a substantially negative impact on that drive towards 100%."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays.', 'Theresa Chen', 'I wanted to ask about the outlook from a product supply perspective. Just so on the domestic front, there does seem to be a good amount of planned work this quarter, including within your own system which should be constructive for inventories going to summer, but internationally, there is quite a bit of new supply coming online. And one of your competitors has talked about a 1.5 million barrel per day number. Would you agree with that? And how much do you think could be realistically utilized?', 'Rick D. Hessling', ""Theresa, this is Rick. I'll attack the new refining capacity first. So we see that coming on later versus sooner. And when I say later, I would say second half of this year and then some over the years, when you bring on new greenfield facilities, which are being brought on, it's been proven difficult to bring them on in a timely fashion. And these specific facilities like others, we'll face challenges with logistics and supply. So I won't specifically comment on the 1.5, but I will say we believe it will be later versus earlier, and then for the demand piece specifically, certainly, you've seen, as you referenced, utilization even here recently down 7% in the last week due to turnarounds and weather-related events.When we look at that and look going forward, we're continuing to see steady demand. As Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, our export book on gas and diesel has been very solid. It was solid in 2023, and we're off to a very good start in '24. So when we look at all of this together, we see it setting up very well, Theresa, for a very supportive spring and summer season."", 'Michael J. Hennigan', ""Theresa, it's Mike. I'll just add. I mean it's pretty well documented. I mean last year, oil demand globally was over 2 million barrels a day. I know some of the forecasters are calling it 1 million plus-ish. We'll see how that plays itself out for this year. But I think the bigger picture, even though there's been a lot of attention, particularly to these 2 refineries that are coming up, as Rick mentioned later in the year. The reason we believe it's more constructive over time is we're still believers and demand is going to continue to rise. And absent this short-term issue with some of the supply coming on, we just see it very constructive where demand is going to continue to outpace, and that's why we think margins will stay in an above mid-cycle of the term everybody is using.I think at the end of the day, we'll obviously keep a watch out it, and there may be some short-term variations to that. But I think part of the reason that we remain bullish is that if we look over time, we're just big believers in demand is going to stay robust. And on paper, aside from the short-term issue, we don't see a whole lot of supply response, trying to match that. Hopefully, that makes sense to you."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.', 'Ryan M. Todd', 'Great. Thanks. Maybe a, as a follow-up on that last question. In your prepared remarks, I mean, you mentioned that you, what you view as an enhanced mid-cycle environment for U.S. refiners in the coming years. I mean I think you were just talking about some of the some of the broader global supply and demand that I think would feed into that. But can you maybe talk a little bit more about what you view as the primary drivers of an uplift in margins? Particularly for U.S. refiners. And when you think about the go-forward environment versus -- go-forward mid-cycle versus past mid-cycle. Do you what sort of uplift can, do you think about $1 a barrel, $2 a barrel. Is there, and how do you underpin that in terms of kind of U.S. advantages for you and your system?', 'Rick D. Hessling', ""Yes, Ryan, it's Rick. So for U.S. advantages, they're quite significant. Mike touched on early on in his prepared remarks, we have a feedstock advantage here in North America with feedstock at our doorstep, and we have access to crude from around the world. So we believe that's a significant advantage. And it's been very well documented. We have an energy advantage with the U.S. being extremely long in nat gas and we have cheap nat gas prices. But in addition to that, when we look at our workforce at our assets and our refinery complexity, when you start layering all of those on top of one another, Ryan, it adds up significantly to an advantage, which is why Mike referenced earlier, we believe in an enhanced mid-cycle.Now when you think of it from our perspective, this is where our scale really comes into play. So we run a 1 billion-barrel of system -- 1 billion-barrel system annually. So you can pick the number. We won't give you a number, but, it's easy math. If it's a mid-cycle plus $1, that adds $1 billion to MPC's bottom line, a $2 incentive or enhancement over mid-cycle, $2 billion. So that's where our scale really comes into play. Now we are bullish because of a lot of the reasons Mike mentioned, global demand we believe will hit a record consumption in '24. '23 was a record we believe '24 will be a record. IEA believes '24 will be a record. In fact, IEA continues to revise up their demand forecast month after month and have done so for the last 3 months.In addition, we referenced turnarounds. Globally, turnarounds are high. When you're looking at history and we are set up well here for a strong spring and summer. I hope that helps you."", 'Michael J. Hennigan', ""Ryan, it's Mike. Let me just add. We don't pick a number. We do scenario planning, like Rick gave you some examples. But, so we do scenario planning, what if it's $2, what if it's $4, what if it's $6 and take a look at it from that perspective rather than trying to estimate what the number is. I'm a big believer and it's hard to call the 50-yard line, but if we get the banks of the river we get the two end zones, right? Then we'll be able to run the business properly for the long-term."", 'Operator', 'And we do have time for just one more question. Our last question will come from Jason Gabelman with T.D Cowen.', 'Jason Daniel Gabelman', ""I wanted to ask about the West Coast project that you disclosed today. A 2-part question on it. First, when you referenced the returns, how much, is there a decent chunk of that that's related to avoided regulatory penalties that you would incur if you didn't do the project? And then how do you get comfortable with the demand outlook on the West Coast and the potential regulations that can limit MPC's ability to capture periods where product prices are higher?"", 'Michael J. Hennigan', ""So Jason, on your first part, there's nothing that you said was avoiding costs, whatever. So nothing is related to that. So it's a, think of it as a reliability project, a modernization project, an efficiency project, a lower-cost project, and reducing greenhouse gas, which we need to do out there. There's regulations out there that are going to occur over time. We could have made the choice to wait until that regulatory requirement was there, but we saw an opportunity to enhance the facility ahead of time. And we've kind of disclosed already, we think there's greater than 20% return there. How do we get comfortable in the overall macro?There's going to be a tough environment for California, if things get more and more competitive out there. But we think we have a very competitive asset. So we think we're in it for the long-term. We don't think all the facilities out there will survive the long-term, but as that volatility occurs out there, we want to have a really strong, competitive, reliable, efficient, low-cost facility."", 'Rick D. Hessling', ""Jason, I'll just add to that. We believe our integrated system in California is a competitive advantage over the merchant refiner as well. So when you look across our entire value chain from feedstocks in all the way through to the station level. That's a competitive advantage over the merchant refinery when you have demand declines."", 'Kristina Anna Kazarian', 'All right.

MPLX is strategic to MPC's portfolio."", ""Its current pace of cash distributions fully covers MPC's dividend and more than half of our planned 2024 capital program. We expect MPLX to increase its cash distributions as it pursues growth opportunities, further enhancing the value of this strategic relationship. We are committed to returning excess capital to shareholders. In 2023, we returned $11.6 billion through share repurchases, bringing total repurchases to over $29 billion since May of 2021."", ""In addition, we increased MPC's quarterly dividend by 10% in the fourth quarter. Over the past five years, we have grown our quarterly dividend at a compound annual growth rate of over 12%. For the full year 2023, this capital return represents a payout of 92% of our operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns. Executing on our commitments, combined with a strong macro environment, led to total shareholder returns of approximately 31% for MPC in 2023."", ""Turning to our view on the refining macro environment as we head into 2024. Global oil demand hit a record high in '23, and we see another year of record oil consumption in '24. The IEA is currently projecting demand growth of over 1.2 million barrels per day, with their projections having been raised higher over the last three consecutive months. In our system, both domestically and within our export business, we are seeing steady demand year over year for gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel."", ""Global supply remains constrained, and anticipated global capacity additions have progressed slower than expectations. Gasoline and diesel inventories remain tight globally. And as we look into '24, we anticipate that above-average turnaround activity globally in the first quarter, as well as the transition to summer gasoline blends, will be supportive of refining margins. As we look further into 2024, we believe the U.S."", 'refining industry will experience an enhanced midcycle environment due to global supply demand fundamentals and its relative advantages over international sources of supply, including energy costs, feedstock acquisition cost, and refinery complexity. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. These include, first, sustaining capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees, and support the communities in which we operate.', ""Second, our dividend. We're committed to paying a secure, competitive, and growing dividend. We intend to evaluate the dividend at least annually. Third, growth capital."", ""We will invest capital but be disciplined where we believe there are attractive returns, which will enhance our competitiveness and position MPC well into the future. Beyond these three objectives, we will return excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count. From May of '21 and through January 2024, we reduced our total share count by approximately 45%, repurchasing approximately 300 million shares at an average price of $97. As we execute in 2024, we remain committed to share repurchases as a key component of our capital allocation priorities."", ""MPC's stand-alone 2024 capital investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals $1.25 billion. Underpinning our commitment to safety and environmental performance, sustaining capital is approximately 35% of capital spend. In refining and marketing, gross spending is down nearly $200 million compared to 2023, reflecting strong capital discipline. In 2024, we are focused on investments that enhance margin and reduce costs."", ""In low carbon, we are investing in an opportunity that offers an attractive return, lowers our cost, increases reliability, and reduces emissions. This morning, MPLX also announced its 2024 capital investment plan of $1.1 billion, which is anchored in the Marcellus and Permian Basins. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann."", 'Maryann Mannen -- President', ""Thanks, Mike. Solid execution of our three strategic pillars remains foundational. We believe the improvements we've made to our cost structure, portfolio, and commercial execution have driven sustainable structural benefits, irrespective of the market environment. We will continue to build on this strong foundation to recognize value throughout our business."", 'Our refining utilization in 2023 was 92% as we operated our portfolio to meet consumer demand. Recently, we have said we believe our average capture over longer periods of time is approaching 100%. And in 2023, our full year capture was 100%. This commitment to commercial excellence is foundational, and we expect to continue to see these results.', 'While our capture results will fluctuate based on market dynamics, we believe that the capabilities we have built over the last few years and expect to enhance further will provide a sustainable advantage. Turning to our operations in the Gulf Coast. The Galveston Bay reformer repairs progressed as planned. We started the unit back up in mid-November and returned to full operating rates by mid-December.', ""At our Martinez facility, we will be operating at approximately 22,000 barrels per day in the short term. We have been working closely with the regulators to proceed with repairs to ensure safe and reliable operations. Let me move to Slide 7, which shows our capital investment plan for 2024 in a bit more detail. MPC's investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals $1.25 billion."", 'The plan includes $1.2 billion for refining and marketing segment. Our growth capital plan is approximately $825 million, but between traditional projects and low carbon. We are investing primarily at our large competitively advantaged facilities to enhance shareholder value and position MPC well into the future. Within traditional refining and marketing, $100 million is associated with a multiyear project to increase finished distillate yield at the Galveston Bay refinery; $375 million is focused on smaller projects targeted at enhancing yields at our refineries, improving energy efficiency, and lowering our costs, as well as investments in our branded marketing footprint.', 'Within low carbon, approximately $330 million is allocated to a multiyear infrastructure investment at our Los Angeles refinery, which will improve energy efficiency and lower facility emissions; and $20 million for smaller projects, focused on emerging opportunities. Slide 8 provides an overview of the multiyear investment at our Los Angeles refinery. The Los Angeles refinery is a core asset in our West Coast value chain and is one of the most competitive refineries in the region. This investment, once completed, is expected to further enhance its cost competitiveness by integrating and modernizing utility systems, which will improve reliability and increase energy efficiency.', 'Additionally, a portion of this improvement addresses a new regulation mandating further reductions in emissions. This regulation applies to all Southern California refineries. The improvements are expected to be completed by the end of 2025. We expect to generate a return on our investment of approximately 20%.', 'Turning to Slide 9. At Galveston Bay, we are investing to construct a 90,000-barrels-per-day high-pressure distillate hydrotreater. This project is planned to strengthen the competitiveness of the refinery through increased production of higher-value finished products. Once in service, the new distillate hydrotreater will upgrade high-sulfur distillate to ultra-low sulfur diesel, eliminating the need for third-party processing or sales into shrinking lower-value, high-sulfur export markets.', 'This strategic investment ensures we provide the clean burning fuels the world demands and further enhances the competitive position of our U.S. Gulf Coast value chain. The project is expected to be complete by year-end 2027 and generate a return of over 20%. Turning to our low-carbon initiatives.', ""We challenge ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by setting meaningful targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, methane emissions, and freshwater intensity targets, which we believe we can demonstrate a tangible pathway to accomplish. In our 2024 capital outlook, we are investing to significantly lower energy intensity and emissions at Los Angeles, one of our largest refineries. Additionally, we are investing small amounts of capital in early stage developments like RNG, which could significantly aid in greenhouse gas emission reductions in the future. Overall, we're taking disciplined steps to advance our goal to lower the carbon intensity of our operations and the products we manufacture, while continuing to supply a growing and evolving market by safely operating our current asset base with the objective to deliver superior cash flow."", 'Let me turn the call over to John.', 'John Quaid -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thanks, Maryann. Moving to fourth quarter highlights, Slide 11 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.98 for the fourth quarter and $23.63 for the full year. This quarter's results were adjusted to exclude the $0.14 per share net effect of three items: a $145 million LIFO inventory charge, $47 million of net recoveries related to MPLX's Garyville incident response, and a $92 million gain recognized by MPLX."", 'Adjusted EBITDA was over $3.5 billion for the quarter and almost $19 billion for the year. Cash flow from operations, excluding working capital changes, was nearly $2.3 billion for the quarter and $13.9 billion for the year. During the quarter, we returned $311 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased over $2.5 billion of our shares. Slide 12 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter to fourth quarter of 2023, as well as the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter.', 'Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $2.2 billion, driven by lower R&M margins. The tax rate for the quarter was 18%, reflecting the impacts of the MPLX structure and a discrete benefit largely related to state taxes. For 2024, we expect our tax rate to be around 21%. Moving to our segment results.', 'Slide 13 provides an overview of our refining and marketing segment for the fourth quarter. Our 13 refineries ran at a 91% utilization, processing nearly 2.7 million barrels of crude per day. Sequentially, per-barrel margins were lower across all regions, driven by lower crack spreads. Capture for the quarter was 122%.', 'Refining operating costs were $5.67 per barrel in the fourth quarter, higher sequentially due to higher energy costs, particularly on the West Coast, as well as higher project-related expenses associated with planned turnaround activity. Slide 14 provides an overview of our refining and marketing margin capture of 122% for the quarter. We ran well, and our commercial teams executed effectively to deliver strong results. Capture this quarter benefited from light product margin tailwinds and particularly for jet fuel, as well as less of a headwind from secondary product prices.', 'Slide 15 shows the changes in our midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2023. Our midstream segment delivered strong fourth quarter results. For the full year 2023, our midstream segment EBITDA is up 7% compared to the prior year. Our midstream business is growing and generating strong cash flows as we advance high-return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian Basins.', 'Slide 16 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was nearly $2.3 billion in the quarter, driven by both our refining and midstream businesses. Working capital was a $1.1 billion use of cash for the quarter, driven primarily by declining crude prices. Cash from ops for the quarter was also impacted by a $320 million headwind from changes in our income tax receivable, which you might usually expect to see as a working capital change.', ""Capital expenditures and investments totaled $896 million this quarter. This includes MPLX's acquisition of full ownership of a gathering and processing joint venture in the Delaware Basin for approximately $270 million. MPC returned $2.8 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. This represents an approximate 125% payout of the $2.3 billion of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to deliver superior shareholder returns."", 'As of January 26th, we have approximately $5.9 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. And at the end of the fourth quarter, MPC had approximately $10.2 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments, including approximately $1 billion of MPLX cash. Turning to guidance on Slide 17, we provide our first quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of almost 2.5 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 83%.', 'Utilization is forecasted to be lower than fourth quarter levels due mainly to higher turnaround activity. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $600 million. We are executing turnarounds at four of our largest refineries, Galveston Bay, Garyville, Los Angeles, and Robinson, all in the first quarter when margins are typically lower to minimize the financial impact of these outages. Turnaround expense for the full year is anticipated to be similar to last year at about $1.3 billion.', 'Operating costs in the first quarter are expected to be $5.85 per barrel, higher sequentially due mainly to lower throughput volumes associated with the significant planned turnaround activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.45 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $185 million. And with that, let me pass it back to Mike.', 'Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks, John. We've delivered strong execution on our strategic commitments again this year. This includes running reliably with high utilization, structural improvements to our commercial performance, fostering a low-cost culture, and strengthening the competitive position of our assets. At MPLX, the partnership has continued to grow, increasing its cash flow and its cash distribution to MPC."", ""We've invested capital to grow earnings while exercising strict capital discipline. This has resulted in superior cash flow generation and supported the repurchase initiatives. Looking forward, we will continue to prioritize capital investments to ensure the safe and reliable performance of our assets, and we will also invest in projects where we believe there are attractive returns. We believe our focus on safety, environmental -- I'm sorry, operational excellence, and sustained commercial improvement will position us to capture this enhanced midcycle environment, which we expect to continue longer term given our advantages over marginal sources of supply and growing global demand."", ""MPC's midstream segment, consisting primarily of MPLX, has grown EBITDA by $1.3 billion since 2019, which is a 6% compound annual growth rate over the last four years. As MPLX continues to grow its free cash flow, we believe it's in a strong position to continue to consistently grow its distribution. As a result of MPLX increasing its distribution 10% over each of the last two years, MPC expects to receive $2.2 billion of cash distributions, which reflects a $400 million increase since 2020. Each 10% distribution increase is approximately $200 million of additional cash flow that MPC receives through its ownership in the partnership."", ""In summary, this year, we generated $14 billion of cash from operations, we increased our dividend 10%, repurchased $11.6 billion of shares, resulting in a 92% payout ratio. In 2023, MPC's total shareholder return was 31%. We believe MPC is positioned as the refiner investment of choice with the strongest through-the-cycle cash generation and the ability to deliver superior returns to our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back over to Kristina."", 'Kristina Kazarian -- Managing Director', ""Thanks, Mike. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will reprompt for additional questions. Sheila, we're ready."", '', 'Operator', 'Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.', 'Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Yeah. Good morning, Mike. Good morning, team. Thanks for doing this.', ""Great quarter. The first question is really on Slide 14, and this is what we're getting from investors this morning, which is the 122% system capture and that $885 million of margin uplift. And I recognize there are some sensitivities about what you can say and can't say here, but just can you talk about what drove that strength and how much of this feels one-time-ish versus stuff we want to carry forward?"", 'Maryann Mannen -- President', ""Hey, Neil. Good morning. It's Maryann. Thanks for the question."", ""So, you know, first and foremost, as you know, commercial performance has been and will continue to be a foundational pillar for us in terms of delivering outstanding execution and meeting the goals and objectives that Mike shared with you around delivering best through-the-cycle cash flow throughout the cycles. In the quarter, we generated about 122% capture, as we shared. Overall, as you know, we've been talking about our ability to continue to drive toward 100%. Over the last couple of quarters, Rick and Brian have been sharing with you some of the key elements around structural changes that we believe are sustainable."", 'And then Mike announced this morning a couple of other changes which we think will continue to drive our ability to identify and deliver against that foundational principle. In the quarter, we had a couple of benefits that delivered the 122%. So, first of all, you know, strong light product margins and, frankly, a more favorable secondary products impact. You know, this is not abnormal for this period of time.', ""Having said that, you know, we also saw stronger jet fuel premiums to diesel and the benefit of diesel blending -- excuse me, of butane blending in the quarter as well. To your question, how much of this is repeatable? Obviously, some of those things are not repeatable, particularly when you look at the sharper drop in crude oil and refined product prices. We also did have the ability of having, as I shared with you, you know, our reformer at GBR and other benefits of projects that we completed fully operating in the quarter. So, let me pause there and see if that's -- that helps to answer your question at all."", 'Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""That's great, Maryann. That's a lot of good color there. And the follow-up is just on Slide 17, sticking with the deck here, which is it does seem like a period of heavier turnaround in Q1, particularly in the West Coast region. Just maybe you could talk about, you know, the decision around where you took maintenance, how that fits into the full year plan, and anything we should be thinking about as you approach this turnaround season?"", 'Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, Neil. It's Mike. Yeah, I think, you know, we said in our prepared remarks that our turnaround spend this year is about the same as last year. But the way you should think about it is, as, you know, Maryann mentioned, in the first quarter, we're pretty heavy at four of our largest facilities, our largest financial generating facility."", ""So, we're taking advantage of the fact that, you know, margins are down in the first quarter. So, we're spending 600 in the first quarter, which is a high number, you know, relative to the full year. And I know we don't traditionally give, you know, quarter to quarter, but I'll just tell you that, you know, next quarter, the turnaround number drops down to like 200 or so, somewhere in that range. So, you know, we're being opportunistic in some regard."", ""You know, a lot of the activity does get planned. But at the same time, you know, we want to take advantage of the fact that the margin environment now is constructive for us to be offline so that, you know, when margins, we think, are going to be a lot stronger in the second quarter, you know, we'll have our four largest facilities, you know, turned around and ready to deliver results."", 'Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Thanks, Mike.', 'Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""You're welcome, Neil."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Manav Gupta with UBS. Your line is open.', 'Manav Gupta -- UBS -- Analyst', 'First of all, congrats, guys. I know one of the goals was to get to 100% capture. Although Mike always says to focus on EBITDA per barrel margin and free cash, I know one of the goals was to get to 100% capture, so congrats on overshooting that mark. My question here is on the two growth projects.', ""Los Angeles, some of the people out there are looking to exit the state given the tougher laws. You are actually going back and investing in this project, so help us understand what's driving that. And again, on the Galveston Bay moving from, you know, upgrading high-sulfur to ULSD, what kind of realization uplift could you get if you do execute this project?"", 'Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, Manav. This is Mike. I'll start. First of all, thank you for the comment on capture, and as you said, it's not my favorite metric, but, you know, I'm a big believer in how much cash are we generating, how much cash per share are we generating."", ""And I want to lead in those categories is the metric that I spend the most time, you know, looking at. But it does give some good indication, as Maryann said. It's hard just to differentiate, you know, the question Neil asked between what's happening in the market and, you know, what are some of the structural improvements that we've implemented over the last couple of years here. But anyway, thanks for the comment."", ""As far as our capital investment, I'm hoping everybody sees a couple of things. You know, one is, yes, we are investing in our LA facility. It's an area where we believe that we can put a decent amount of investment in there and really improve the competitiveness of that facility. But we already believe it's, you know, one of the top facilities, you know, on the West Coast."", ""So, it is an area that we want to invest in. Now, that particular investment is about efficiency, reliability, and lowering our cost. And to your point, you know, being a very reliable supplier out there is an important part of the equation. The other project that we've announced is a margin enhancement project."", ""And in our view, you know, things are not going to get easier for unhydrotreated distillate into the future. And if you look at the spreads today, even today, they're pretty wide. So, at the end of the day, what's driving us the most in both of those when we put this in the slides is we think both of these projects are north of 20% returns. And hopefully, we're conservative on that, but we think they're very good investments."", ""And again, in two of our largest, highest financial generating facilities. So, one of the themes that you've heard from us is we're going to invest in projects that we feel really strong about on a return basis, but they're also enhancing the competitive positions of some of our biggest facilities. And I think you've heard the theme from us for a while here. It's margin enhancement, lower costs, and efficiencies."", ""And out on the West Coast, the other driver is, you know, there's an emissions reduction goals that are going to occur over time, and this project will take care of that in a large way. And that's why we grouped it into our low-carbon area. So, hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color."", 'Manav Gupta -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Perfect. My quick follow-up here is you were looking to ramp toward the nameplate capacity at your renewable diesel project on the West Coast. If you can give us some update over there. How is that project progressing?', 'Maryann Mannen -- President', ""Certainly. It's Maryann. Currently, we are running at about 22,000 barrels a day, versus our nameplate at 48,000. We're going to continue to run at that level as we work with the regulators to determine what repairs need to be complete in order to be able to get to that nameplate at 48,000."", ""You know, as we think about that, as you know, we've got our JV partnership with Neste. So, you know, really, what we're looking at is the differential for MPC of about 13,000 barrels a day. So, you know, not meaningful to the, you know, 3 million barrel system that we run. But again, running at 22,000 overall for the facility, and we'll continue to work with our regulators to determine when we can bring it to full 48,000."", 'Manav Gupta -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Thank you so much.', 'Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""You're welcome, Manav."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Next, we will hear from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Securities. You may proceed.', 'Doug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mike, I hate to do this, I wonder if I could try to capture a question in a slightly different way because we, I guess, have a slightly different view of this. If we look at your system as more of an LP, we see a great deal of linearity between the indicator margin and what you're delivering."", 'I think I agree with you. I think capture is a terrible metric to try and measure a linear program business, frankly. But what we do see, however, is that the mix of inputs seems to be changing some, which is allowing you to capture more of the margin. So, my question is really that.', ""What are you doing in your commercial business or operations that is changing the optimization of the slate that you're running in your system? Obviously, there are a lot of moving parts around crude in the U.S. right now with TMX and a few other things. Is that a factor?"", 'Rick Hessling -- Chief Commercial Officer', ""Yeah. Hi, Doug. This is Rick. So, I'll take a stab at that."", 'So, we are significantly -- I would say, every day, Doug, we are optimizing our slate. And we look at this regionally. We look at this by plant. But in the end, Doug, I think what we do better than others in the industry is we optimize for the betterment of our total return at the end of the day.', ""So, we are not -- we could sub-optimize one plant for the benefit of another, and we have worked years, decades, as a matter of fact, to give ourselves optionality within our mid-con system. We are currently juggling optionality with TMX and our West Coast and Pacific Northwest system, as well as we've worked on it for quite a while on the Gulf Coast. So, you are onto something from a crude slate perspective. It's constantly changing."", ""We're constantly pushing the norm on what we should run, what crudes we look at, what assays we look at, updating our system. So, this is just an ongoing exercise that's been happening now for several years now. And I've said it before, we're unpacking everything from A to Z, Doug. We're leaving no rock unturned in terms of capturing value."", 'And that not only goes certainly on the crude slate side, but it goes throughout our entire value chain.', 'Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Hey, Doug. It's Mike. I know it's been a source of frustration since we don't give a lot of detail in this area, you know, for competitive reasons, but to Rick's point, you know, we've made some changes. And to be honest with you, I'm more excited about what's in the future for us."", ""You know, Brian's new role as head of global optimization for us, I think, is going to, you know, make a step change for where we're going. So, we've had a lot of momentum in this area, and, you know, it's showing up in the results. As we discussed, you know, capture is not my favorite, but generating cash is. And at the end of the day, I think we have more opportunity in the whole area."", ""You know, if we run well and then deliver commercially, we'll continue to generate cash and be a good source of return for shareholders."", 'Doug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""LPs are a complicated beast, and you guys seem to have figured it out. So, thank you for the answer, guys. My follow-up is probably for -- maybe for Maryann. I'm not sure."", ""Congratulations, everyone, in their new roles. But, Maryann, if I look at Slide 21, you're showing your debt maturity profile at the MPC level, obviously, you know, sitting with a net cash position at the MPC level. What are your thoughts on where you want your balance sheet to be as those debt maturities come due?"", 'John Quaid -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. Hey. Good morning, Doug. It's John."", ""I'll go ahead and take that one."", 'Doug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Thanks, John. I wasn't sure if you'd take it or not. Thank you."", 'John Quaid -- Chief Financial Officer', ""No, no, no. Not a problem at all. And I think you kind of were hinting at it as you were getting there. We've got a lot of financial flexibility right now."", ""We're very comfortable with the gross amount of debt that MPC has, but certainly have the balance sheet to be very thoughtful about the right timing of refinancing that debt and really optimizing our cost of capital and really that cost of debt. And I think longer term, right, we've laid out a target of kind of the gross debt to cap at 25% to 30%. We're a good bit a ways from that, but that's something we'll continue to monitor as we look out into the future."", 'Doug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'And, John, remind me, is that consolidated for MPLX or stand-alone?', 'John Quaid -- Chief Financial Officer', ""It's stand-alone."", 'Doug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'OK. Great. Thank you very much.', 'John Quaid -- Chief Financial Officer', ""MPLX is in a much different position. I can probably speak to that one pretty well given the seat I was in before where you've got a really stable company running at, you know, sub-3.5% leverage. But the cash flows there can probably support a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of four times. Again, they've got some financial flexibility to be smart about what they're doing as well."", 'So, I think both balance sheets are in a really strong place.', 'Doug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open.', 'Paul Cheng -- Scotiabank -- Analyst', 'Hey, guys. Good morning.', 'Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning, Paul.', 'Paul Cheng -- Scotiabank -- Analyst', ""Mike, I think in the past, you have shown that you are not really interested in acquisition of refining assets. But one can argue that, I mean, given how well you are running your facility, do you think that there's a value to be added if you have some additional assets to your platform so you can apply your technical know-how to even a bigger profile? And also, in the Gulf Coast, you have two huge refinery. If we add additional facility, would that further diversify and reduce the operating risk, having multiple facility. And also, frankly, that will perhaps even increase the commercial and optimization opportunities."", 'So, just want to see that. I mean, how you guys look at that questions internally?', 'Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, Paul. First off, you know, Dave Heppner's group is constantly looking at the market and what assets are available. I always say never say never. But in the meantime, you know, while Dave is working on that side of the equation, we're also looking at the footprint we have in the assets we have, and that's part of the reason that we came out with the announcement today."", ""You know, two of our key facilities we think we can make a meaningful change. And we've been more transparent than normal to try and explain to people, you know, we think we got north of 20% return projects here on the assets that we own ourselves. So, there's always a balance, Paul, between, obviously, the assets you own, you know inside and out, whereas the ones you're evaluating externally, there's a little bit of, you know, concern from diligence, etc. But I will tell you, you know, I think people know my DNA, in general, but at the same time, you know, Dave and his team are challenging, you know, where can we make investments that are outside of our portfolio."", ""We haven't done a lot, as you mentioned, on the refining side, but we have made some investments, you know, in what we're calling low carbon. You know, we've made some investments in some pre-treat facilities on the low-carbon side. We've invested in our RNG facilities. So, Dave and his team are looking at both refining and outside of refining and we just, you know, constantly talk about that and decide where do we think we want to put our capital."", ""And for right -- for today, we were pleased to report that we think we have two pretty good projects. But the other part -- let me just mention this one last thing because this is kind of important. On this slide where we talk about our capital, we say in traditional refining, we're investing 475 million. Maryann mentioned that 100 million of that is related to the DHT project."", ""But 375 million of that is what we don't typically talk about on earnings calls. These are projects in all of our facilities that are higher return, really good projects for us, but they don't have the sexy headline about them. But if you look at it, though, 375 out of the 475 in traditional are these smaller, high-return projects. So, you know, the team does a nice job."", ""You know, Tim and his organization are constantly looking for areas where we can make margin improvement, lower costs, increase reliability. And as you said, you know, this all starts with you got to run reliably and then you've got to be smart commercially, and I think we've demonstrated that a little bit, and then we just try to invest capital to keep bolstering, you know, that equation. So, hopefully, that gives you a little more color."", 'Paul Cheng -- Scotiabank -- Analyst', ""Absolutely. Can I just go back into the commercial question? In the fourth quarter, you guys definitely done well and you [Inaudible] And if we're looking at versus the margin capture, the 100%, the additional 22%, is there a number that you can share, how much of that is coming from the commercial side of the business that you have done really well and that's why that you are seeing that much better in the capture? And also that I think in the past, you're saying that one of the maybe Holy Grail for commercial operations is that you will be able to optimize based on breakdown design and optimize based on the total company. Where we in that process? Do you think that you're already there or that you're just still scratching the surface on that process?"", 'Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Paul, I'll start with the second part. As I said, I'll repeat myself a little bit, but we still think there's quite a ways to go where we can do better, and that was part of the reasoning behind the organizational change. You know, Brian's role as global optimization lead is going to -- his team is going to work with the commercial guys, with our refining guys."", ""And you heard me say redefine process, find places to invest, change what we're doing today. So, I think we've made a lot of progress. You know, people always ask, you know, what inning, or I guess it's football season, so what quarter are we in? And that's always hard to ascertain because I think we keep, you know, peeling the onion back and seeing that we can make another step change. So, I'm optimistic that we got a lot of road to go."", ""And I think at the end of the day, you know, our mantra is, you know, just keep watching our results, and you'll see the -- you know, what comes out of it. As far as the first part, it's always hard. That's why I'm not the biggest fan of that metric. It's always hard to differentiate some of the market factors that Maryann mentioned."", ""Obviously, in the fourth quarter, you get butane blending, you know, as one thing that, you know, enhances capture. But there is a significant -- if I want to give some kudos to our team, there is a significant change in the way we're approaching the business. You know, you heard from Rick earlier. And so, I think it is additive to whatever the market's given us."", ""And my thought is the way we have to run the company is, you know, we don't control the margin environment, but whatever margin environment is given to us, you know, we just got to deliver more results and generate more cash and more cash per share. So, while everybody outside and inside wants to talk about that capture metric, I just keep looking at the one that matters the most to me."", 'Paul Cheng -- Scotiabank -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""You're welcome."", 'Maryann Mannen -- President', ""Hey, Paul. It's Maryann. I just might try to add a bit more around some of the things that we're doing specifically around commercial performance without necessarily trying to give you a percentage. But, you know, we've been talking over the last several quarters about the capabilities we've built regionally, obviously, at the Houston Office, at the Singapore office, the London office, that has helped us."", ""You know, Doug was laughingly saying to Mike about, you know, cracking the code on linear programming. But, you know, some of the capabilities that Rick and Brian and their respective teams have built historically give us very robust tools and data analytics that allow us to assess the decisions that we've made and know how good or bad those decisions were and what we might do with that to change it. So, it is building -- these capabilities are building, you know, sustainable learnings and capabilities in the organization that we think will continue to drive our performance. I hope that's a bit more helpful, too."", 'Paul Cheng -- Scotiabank -- Analyst', 'Absolutely. Thank you, Maryann.', 'Operator', 'Next, we will hear from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.', 'Roger Read -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Yeah. Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter.', 'Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Roger.', 'Roger Read -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""Maybe just if we could address the changes here on the management team and whether or not that portend -- or what it does portend about the future. I know, Mike, you're approaching the point at which the board has to make a decision to extend, if I understood correctly from the meetings back in late November. So, anything you can offer us up on any updates there?"", 'Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, Roger. I'll start off with, you know, the changes are driven by two things. You know, results. You know, one of the things that I feel my responsibility is to reward the results that we're getting because the team has done a very nice effort across the whole team."", ""And the second part is development. You know, putting people in positions such that they grow more personally so that they can contribute to the team. So, you know, both of those factors, I think, played into a lot of these assessments that occurred at the executive level, but it's also occurring, you know, below that and not everybody gets to see. So, I'm a big believer in the team approach."", ""You know, practically all decisions that we make, all of our team is involved in. So, you know, there's a heavy component of development on top of, you know, the results that have occurred the last couple of years. You know, as far as me personally, you know, I think you've heard in the past, that's a board decision. The board's very aware of that."", ""You know, that'll play itself out in time. But boards, you know, if it's not their top priority, it's, you know, obviously at the very top of the first couple of what their responsibility is. So, that's just a work in progress. It's been in progress for quite some time, and, you know, it'll play itself out as time goes by."", 'Roger Read -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""OK. And then my other question was to follow up a little bit on the balance sheet question I think Doug asked about -- in debt to cap guidance given. But if you keep buying shares back, theoretically you could end up shrinking the equity side, which could get you to the 25%, even if you held debt flat. So, none of us can predict the future exactly where all this will shake out, but would that sort of math imply that you could actually end up, you know, staying at the same debt level? In other words, simply refinance the debt, implying that all the cash that's on there would be eligible for share repurchases or some other sort of return to shareholders and that's the right math to follow?"", 'John Quaid -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. Hey, Roger. It's John. You read through my subtle comments very, very well."", ""And certainly, the other part of that equation, right, is what we're doing on the equity side. So, that was my comment. Hey, we were -- we think our gross levels of debt are appropriate as we look forward because that'll be part of the math. We'll take a look at that, but I think you're pretty spot on."", ""I'm not sure I can add much from what you said, to be honest."", 'Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Roger, the only thing I would add is -- I'm sorry, I just wanted to just add. As a general rule, you know, my belief is, you know, we don't want to be under-levered. We don't want to be over-levered."", ""You know, we want to find what we think is the appropriate level, and we think we've been there and we've been consistent there, and that's why people should read into our cash position as, you know, that's going to be targeted for return to shareholders. You know, I think our job is to generate the most cash we can; run the balance sheet properly, which, you know, we've done over the past; and then at the end of the day, return excess capital to shareholders."", 'Roger Read -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Thanks.', 'Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""You're welcome."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question will come from John Royall with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.', 'John Royall -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, I just had a follow-up on the balance sheet.', 'You had another strong quarter for the buyback at 2.5 billion. But with the crack environment turning down, you did end up drawing almost 3 billion of cash. And despite the big maintenance coming up in 1Q, it looks like January is off to a really healthy pace at 900 million. So, my question is would you expect to maintain a similar pace throughout 1Q as you progress these turnarounds and what could that mean for the cash draw and where balances could be at the end of 1Q?', 'John Quaid -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. Hey. Good morning, John. It's John here."", ""I'll take that one and let Mike add some other comments as well. But let me just start by saying as I roll into this seat, I want to be clear, there's no change in how we're viewing return of capital, as you heard even in Mike's prepared remarks. Again, really strong performance last year again as we're looking to drive strong returns to our investors. And that'll continue to be a key part of our capital allocation priorities in 2024."", ""And as we look at that, we're going to look at lots of things. One, we want to be opportunistic in the overall capital allocation, and we'll consider the refining macro environment, along with lots of other items, but -- and the balance sheet and where it is. But ultimately, I just want to be clear, we're going to be steadfast in our commitment to return of capital."", 'Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""And, John, it's Mike. The only thing that I'll add is, you know, we think it's part of our DNA and duty to return capital as part of our mantra. So, you know, we've been saying for quite some time and we've been fortunate, as you said, you know, the margin environment has been, you know, conducive to generating more cash. But we've targeted all along to, you know, return that capital to shareholders."", ""We're going to continue to do that. And then again, whatever market environment we get handled -- or get handed, I'm sorry, we will -- we'll make that still a priority for us. It's on our capital allocation priority. You know, we'll start off with maintaining the assets, growing the dividend, investing in the business."", ""So, that's still, you know, part of our DNA as well. But at the end, I'm a huge believer of give that capital back to shareholders and then let shareholders decide where they want to invest longer term. We want to be the vehicle where we generate cash and return capital. And as people have seen that over time, you know, that isn't going to change regardless of what the margin environment is."", 'John Royall -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Great. Thank you. And then I apologize ahead of time to Mike for this, but I do have another question on capture, but, you know, the commercial stuff aside. Can you help us think about some of the moving pieces in the first quarter and particularly how should we think about the impact of the heavy maintenance in the quarter? Is this still, you know, potential to be a 100%-type quarter given you have so much maintenance, and any other moving pieces that we should think about that might move you away from that 100% in either direction in 1Q?', 'Maryann Mannen -- President', ""Hey, John. It's Maryann, and let me see if I can take that for you and address your question. So, you know, first and foremost, as we say, we continue to think, for 2024, our objective is to drive toward that 100%. You're absolutely right."", ""In the quarter, as we said, we've got about 600 million. But, you know, we're touching crude units, so we're not expecting a significant amount of negative impact on our capture, you know, despite the fact that, you know, we are seeing, you know, that level of turnaround. Now, as you know, we do have variables, you know, that impact the capture rate from quarter to quarter. But right now, we are not expecting turnaround to have a substantially negative impact on that drive toward 100%."", 'John Royall -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Great. Thank you very much.', 'Maryann Mannen -- President', 'You are welcome.', 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is open.', 'Theresa Chen -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Hi. I wanted to ask about the outlook from a product supply perspective, just so on the domestic front, there does seem to be a good amount of planned work this quarter, including within your own system, which should be constructive for inventories going to summer. But internationally, there is quite a bit of new supply coming online, and one of your competitors has, you know, talked about a 1.5 million barrels per day number. Would you agree with that and how much do you think, you know, could be realistically utilized?', 'Rick Hessling -- Chief Commercial Officer', ""Hi, Theresa. This is Rick. I'll attack the new refining capacity first. So, we see that coming on later versus sooner."", ""And when I say later, I would say second half of this year and then some. You know, over the years, when you bring on new greenfield facilities, which are being brought on, it's been proven difficult to bring them on in a timely fashion. And these specific facilities, like others, will face challenges with logistics and supply. So, I won't specifically comment on the 1.5, but I will say we believe it'll be later versus earlier."", ""And then for the demand piece specifically, certainly you've seen, as you referenced, utilization even here recently down 7% in the last week due to turnarounds and weather-related events. When we look at that and look going forward, we're continuing to see steady demand. As Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, our export book on gas and diesel has been very solid. It was solid in 2023, and we're off to a very good start in '24."", 'So, when we look at all of this together, we see it setting up very well, Theresa, for a very supportive spring and summer season.', 'Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Theresa, it's Mike. I'll just add. I mean, it's pretty well documented. I mean, last year, oil demand globally was over 2 million barrels a day."", ""I know some of the forecasters are calling it, you know, one-plus-ish. You know, we'll see how that plays itself out for this year. But I think the bigger picture, even though, you know, there's been a lot of attention, particularly to these two refineries that are, you know, coming up, as Rick mentioned, later in the year, the reason we believe it's more constructive over time is we're still believers in demand is going to continue to rise. And absent this short-term issue with, you know, some of the supply coming on, we just see it very constructive where demand is going to continue to outpace."", ""And that's why we think margins will stay, you know, in an above midcycle is the term everybody's using. I think at the end of the day, you know, we'll obviously keep a watch out. And there may be some short-term, you know variations to that. But I think part of the reason that we remain bullish is if we look over time, we're just big believers in demand is going to stay robust."", ""And on paper, aside from the short-term issue, we don't see a whole lot of supply response trying to match that. Hopefully, that makes sense to you."", 'Theresa Chen -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""You're welcome."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question will come from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.', 'Ryan Todd -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', 'Good. Thanks. Maybe as a follow-up on that last question, you -- in your prepared remarks, I mean, you mentioned that you -- what you view as an enhanced midcycle environment for U.S. refineries in the coming years.', 'I mean, I think you were just talking about some of the broader global supply and demand that I think would feed into that. But can you maybe talk a little bit more about what you view as the primary drivers of that uplift to margins, particularly for U.S. refiners? And when you think about the go-forward environment versus -- go-forward midcycle versus past mid-cycle, you know, do you -- what sort of uplift can -- you know, do you think about $1 a barrel, $2 a barrel? Is there -- and, you know -- and how do you underpin that in terms of kind of U.S. advantages for you and your system?', 'Rick Hessling -- Chief Commercial Officer', ""Yeah, Ryan. It's Rick. So, for U.S. advantages, they're quite significant."", ""You know, Mike touched on early on in his prepared remarks, we have a feedstock advantage here in North America, with feedstock at our doorstep, and we have access to crude from around the world. So, we believe that's a significant advantage. And it's been very well documented, we have an energy advantage with the U.S. being extremely long in nat gas and we have cheap nat gas prices."", 'But in addition to that, when we look at our workforce and our assets and our refinery complexity, when you start layering all of those on top of one another, Ryan, it adds up significantly to an advantage, which is why Mike referenced earlier we believe in an enhanced midcycle. Now, when you think of it from our perspective, this is where our scale really comes into play. So, we run a billion barrel a system -- a billion barrel system annually. So, you can pick the number.', ""We won't give you a number, but it's easy math. If it's midcycle plus a buck that adds $1 billion to MPC's bottom line. A two-buck incentive or enhancement over midcycle, 2 billion. So, that's where our scale really comes into play."", ""Now, we are bullish because of a lot of the reasons Mike mentioned. Global demand, we believe, will hit a record consumption in '24. '23 was a record. We believe '24 will be a record."", ""IEA believes '24 will be a record. In fact, IEA continues to revise up their demand forecasts month after month and have done so for the last three months. In addition, we referenced turnarounds. Globally, turnarounds are high when you're looking at history, and we are set up well here for a strong spring and summer."", 'I hope that helps you.', 'Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Hey, Ryan. It's Mike. Let me just add. You know, we don't pick a number."", ""We do scenario planning, you know, like Rick gave you some examples. But -- so we do scenario planning, what if it's two bucks, what if it's four bucks, what if it's six bucks, and take a look at it from that perspective rather than trying to estimate what the number is. I'm a big believer and it's hard to call the 50-yard line, but if we get the banks of the river, we get the two end zones, right? You know, then we'll be able to run the business properly for the long term."", 'Operator', 'And we do have time for just one more question. Our last question will come from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. Your line is open.', 'Jason Gabelman -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', 'Yeah. Hey. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in.', ""I wanted to ask about the West Coast project that you disclosed today and a two-part question on it. First, when you reference the returns, how much? Is there a decent chunk of that that's related to avoided regulatory penalties that you would incur if you didn't do the project? And then how do you get comfortable with the demand outlook on the West Coast and the potential regulations that can limit MPC's ability to capture periods where product prices are higher?"", 'Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer', ""So, Jason, on the -- on your first part, there's nothing that you said was avoiding costs or whatever. So, nothing's related to that. So, it's a -- you know, think of it as a reliability project, a modernization project, an efficiency project, a lower-cost project, and reducing greenhouse gas, which we need to do out there. There's regulations out there that are going to occur over time."", ""You know, we could have made the choice to wait until that regulatory requirement was there, but we saw an opportunity to enhance the facility ahead of time. And we've kind of disclosed already, we think there's greater than 20% return there. You know, how do we get comfortable, you know, in the overall macro? It's -- there's going to be a tough environment for California if things get, you know, more and more competitive out there, but we think we have a very competitive asset. So, we think we're in it for the long term."", ""We don't think all the facilities out there will survive in the long term. But as that volatility occurs out there, we want to have a really, you know, strong competitive, reliable, efficient, low-cost facility."", 'Rick Hessling -- Chief Commercial Officer', ""Jason, I'll just add to that. We believe our integrated system in California is a competitive advantage over the merchant refiner as well. So, when you look across our entire value chain, from feedstocks and all the way through to the station level, that's a competitive advantage over the merchant refinery when you have demand declines."", 'Kristina Kazarian -- Managing Director', 'All right.

Brown-Forman caught a downgrade this morning from Morgan Stanley, but still remains an attractive stock. At least, that's what our next guest believes. For more on the alcohol sector, we're joined by Nadine Sarwat, who is the Bernstein Director of American Alcoholic Beverages and Cannabis."", ""Nadine, great to have you here with us this morning. First and foremost, we've got to think about this industry more broadly and the consumer appetite or taste profiles that continue, especially, in this environment, where there is more thought process to discretionary purchases. How is that making its way into this sector?"", ""NADINE SARWAT: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for having me. So you're absolutely right in that consumers are being more thoughtful. 2023 was really hard for US alcohol more generally, including spirits, beer, and wine."", ""But what we've seen is that a lot of those structural trends that have existed for the past decade are still existing, even within a tough year. Namely, that spirits continues to gain share from beer. That's for three structural reasons."", ""First, women are becoming an increasing proportion of the drinking population versus 10 years ago. And they prefer spirits to beer. Second of all, men are drinking differently today. So 20, 30 years ago, your average male American would just drink beer. Now, they're enjoying a bottle of wine with their partner over dinner, still drinking beer while watching sports, but, also, enjoying cocktail out with friends."", 'And the third point is health and wellness. Now, we could sit here and debate which of the three types of alcohol, I just listed, are healthier. But suffice to say, that a lot of consumers feel spirits are more aligned with their health and wellness and calorie goals.', ""So when you look at all of that, even though it's been a tough year, a lot of the same structural factors that drive consumer choices are still here today."", ""SEANA SMITH: So Nadine, given that there's been lots of talk about GLP-1, the impact that that's having on consumer staples on the food categories, what about alcohol? Because that's been lost a little bit within the conversation."", ""NADINE SARWAT: You're absolutely right. Well, the first assumption we'd have to make is that GLP-1's does have a negative impact on alcohol consumption. So far, studies have only been done on rodents. But even if we look at anecdotal surveys, Bernstein conducted one as well, we do find that there is some hit to alcohol consumption."", ""Now, the real question, though, is does this hit what we have called the super user of alcohol? If you think about soda companies or sugary or salty snacks, what really places them at risk from GLP-1's is the fact that the GLP-1 target consumer, so the average obese American, will heavily overlap with the consumer, who disproportionately eats or drinks the majority of those soda, sugar, or salty snack products."", ""In alcohol, we did the work. We dug through a huge amount of academic studies. And we found that that overlap simply doesn't exist. At sometimes, it's neutral, if not slightly negative. Now, that's not to say that you wouldn't get a GLP-1 hit, but it will not be in the magnitude of some of those other CPG stocks."", 'BRAD SMITH: Hard seltzers, spiked drinks, who is the strongest play in that category from your perspective?', ""NADINE SARWAT: Yeah. So the category you're referring to is often called the fourth category. It's not beer. It's not wine. It's not spirits. It's the intersection of all three. Now, in our coverage, really, who continues to stand out is Boston Beer. They are the maker of truly hard seltzers. Now, that brand is in decline."", ""But the main brand that they have today, 50% of their volumes in Nielsen tracked channels is Twisted Tea. And they have had successful four waves of innovation, where they've either been the first mover or a fast follower."", ""Now, we don't think that that's enough to like the stock today.

And with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary."", 'Mary T. Barra', ""Thanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. As we begin 2024, I believe GM is well positioned for a year of strong financial performance that builds on everything we accomplished and importantly learned in 2023. Consensus is growing that the U.S. economy, the job market and auto sales will continue to be resilient. At GM, we expect healthy industry sales of about 16 million units. We have an unmatched ICE portfolio in North America, rising EV production on the Ultium platform and GM Financial continues to perform well. We're building on a foundation of products that our customers love. In 2023, GM sold more vehicles in the U.S. than anyone else. All of our U.S. brands grew their sales year-over-year, and we gained U.S. market share with healthy margins, thanks to stable pricing and incentives that were more than 20% below the industry average. The Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV had record sales. We led the industry in initial quality for the second year in a row according to J.D. Power. And we now have led the industry in combined pickup, full-size van and full-size SUV sales for 10 consecutive years, making us the leader in the highest ATP quadrant of the market and helping us lead the commercial fleet market. And we have passed Honda and Toyota in the most affordable quadrant, thanks to attractive and profitable vehicles like the Chevrolet Trax, which is one of Car and Driver's 10 best trucks and SUVs, and the Buick Envista, which is winning with younger buyers. In fact, more than 1 in 4 Envista customers are between the ages of 18 and 35. The broad-based momentum we have today is important for our future because our customers are the most loyal in the industry. All of this success contributed to full year EBIT adjusted of $12.4 billion and adjusted auto free cash flow of $11.7 billion in 2023, which brings our total to more than $22 billion for '22 and '23. Almost 2/3 of that cash is being returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including the impact of the $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we announced in November. Through the ASR, we immediately retired 215 million common shares in the fourth quarter. Our current share count is less than 1.2 billion, and we are working to reduce this even further to less than 1 billion common shares outstanding, which would be about 600 million fewer than at our peak. As we look ahead, our priorities and our commitments are clear. They are to maximize the opportunities we have with our winning ICE portfolio, grow our EV business profitably, deliver strong margins and cash flow and refocus and relaunch Cruise. Across the enterprise, we are taking important steps to deliver on each priority. Let's start with our ICE portfolio. Chevrolet's crossover lineup had record sales last year. And this year, we're enhancing 2 of its most important models, which compete in growing segments. For example, Super Cruise will be available on the Traverse for the first time, and we will introduce a new Premium Z71 off-road model. The 2025 Chevrolet Equinox that we unveiled last week is another great example. It has more standard safety equipment, new truck-inspired styling and a strong focus on technology. And importantly, both the Traverse and Equinox will have higher projected margins than the outgoing model. Buick and GMC are also launching new crossovers this year to keep our momentum going. In our EV business, we expect our U.S. portfolio to be variable product positive in the second half of the year based on our current expectations for EV demand and production growth. Strong interest in our vehicles, lower commodity prices and other factors will support this. Our plan is to produce and wholesale 200,000 to 300,000 Ultium-based Chevrolet, GMC, Cadillac and BrightDrop EVs in North America this year, but we will be guided by customer demand. It's true the pace of EV growth has slowed, which has created some uncertainty. We will build to demand, and we are encouraged that many third-party forecasts have U.S. EV deliveries rising from about 7% of the industry in '23 to at least 10% in 2024, which would mean another year of record EV sales. We believe our competitive position will improve throughout the year based on higher production of the Cadillac LYRIQ, the GMC HUMMER EV, the Chevrolet Blazer EV and the Silverado EV Work Truck. We're also excited to have the Chevrolet Equinox EV and the Silverado EV RST, the GMC Sierra EV Denali and the Cadillac Escalade IQ arriving in showrooms over the course of the year. We are confident in the design and performance of these vehicles. For example, the LYRIQ is driving growth at Cadillac. Its sales have increased sequentially every month since September, and January deliveries should be in line with December despite winter storms across the country. We also have more than 10,000 -- or excuse me, 100,000 reservations and orders for EV pickups that we expect to fulfill in '24 and '25. However, if demand conditions change, we'll take advantage of our manufacturing flexibility in Spring Hill and Ramos to build more ICE models and fewer EVs. We can also mix between different EV products at Factory ZERO. Ultimately, we will follow the customer. The supply chain, manufacturing and software changes we have made will support our growth. On the battery front, our Ultium Cells joint venture is at full production in Ohio. And the new plant in Tennessee will begin shipping cells this quarter. In addition, our supply chain team has moved very quickly to resource 2 minor cell components after the U.S. Treasury published its updated IRA guidelines in December. This change means that new production going forward of the Chevrolet Blazer EV and the Cadillac LYRIQ will qualify for the full $7,500 consumer credit. We work closely with our dealers to ensure consistent pricing for our customers, which we estimate will impact no more than about 25,000 vehicles. Our battery module production is on schedule. The team has improved the automated equipment at our assembly plants used to build modules, and the installation of new high-capacity assembly lines should be complete by midyear. Our software and services team is on process of resolving the stability issues some customers have experienced with the Chevrolet Blazer EV that impacted their screens and charging experience. And they are working with a huge sense of urgency to lift the stop sales soon. We disappointed these customers, and we know it. We are determined to get the software right, and we will. We have made several organizational and process improvements that will help us deliver the best possible customer experience going forward. Among several important organizational realignments, we established a software quality division within the software and services team that has been performing a retrospective on the Blazer EV and has improved the current software development and test processes across the enterprise. Outcomes of this activity are getting applied to all programs going forward. And they include improved standardization of the software development and release process, increased focus on test automation at the vehicle level and additional quality gates and metrics for software at the vehicle level. From a margin and cash flow perspective, we are making good progress on cost reduction and capital efficiency. Compared with 2022, our fixed costs net of depreciation and amortization will be down $2 billion as we exit 2024, which will offset the impact of higher labor costs. We are also beginning to see savings from winning with simplicity. And all of our current and future programs have embraced this very important way of designing products. Each team is responsible for creating trim series that make vehicles easy to order with the content customers want and far fewer standalone options. By making more equipment standard and trim series with logical price walks, we can eliminate literally thousands of unique part numbers and dozens of software releases. For example, we have eliminated over 1,000 selectable options across our current and near-term product programs, which is reducing hardware, software, ordering and manufacturing complexity and importantly, all the costs associated with them. In 2024, the savings are expected to be about $200 million. To be clear, we're talking about $200 million of savings to execute the same product plan. These savings will grow over time as we apply the discipline to future products like our next-generation full-size pickups. We're also continuing to balance capital priorities and consistent free cash flow generation. We expect that our 2024 capital spending will be in the $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion, which is roughly flat year-over-year and down considerably from the $13 billion top of our initial 2023 guidance. Our forward plans include bringing our plug-in hybrid technology to select vehicles in North America. Let me be clear, GM remains committed to eliminating tail-type emissions from our light-duty vehicles by 2035. But in the interim, deploying plug-in technology in strategic segments will deliver some of the environmental benefits of EVs as the nation continues to build its charging infrastructure. We are timing the launches to help us comply with the more stringent fuel economy and tailpipe emission standards that are being proposed. And we plan to deliver the program in a capital- and cost-efficient way because the technology is already in production in other markets. We'll have more to share about this down the road. Moving to Cruise. Last week, we released the results of the third-party reviews, and we've already begun to implement significant changes to build a better Cruise. We are committed to earning back the trust with our regulators and the public through our actions. Our planned 2024 investment in Cruise reflects our more deliberate and cadence go-to-market strategy. And we are developing new financial targets and a new road map. Spending will be down considerably this year, but we will continue to invest in the people who are advancing the software, specialized hardware and AI capabilities. This reflects our commitment to our vision, which is to deliver the safety benefits of self-driving technology and a scalable, profitable business. I look forward to sharing our timetable for returning Cruise AVs to the road soon. To summarize, we learned a lot in 2023. And those learnings are helping us build our strengths and addressing our challenges. Everyone on the team is committed to building on our momentum and creating shareholder value. You'll see in our proxy statement this spring, executive compensation is tied even more closely to delivering our comprehensive ICE, EV, AV and software plans while meeting our financial targets. So our goals are truly aligned with yours. Before I turn the call over to Paul, I would like to share some thoughts about our next Investor Day. Because of the significant changes that are underway at GM and Cruise, we think it makes sense to wait until later in the year to host an event. This will give our software team the time to focus on software for our upcoming launches. And we will be able to share more tangible proof points on all 4 pillars of our strategy: ICE, EV, AV and software. When we do get together, we will show you what we've done, not just tell you what we're going to do. In the meantime, we've already provided a road map for EV profitability in 2025. And we'll share updates on Cruise as we finalize the technology and relaunch plans. With that, I'll turn it over to Paul to go through our 2023 financials and provide more details on our 2024 outlook. Then we'll take your questions."", 'Paul A. Jacobson', ""Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you all joining us this morning. I'd like to begin by recognizing the entire GM team for what they accomplished in 2023. And when you look back over the last couple of years, the results show an impressive trend in revenue growth, EPS consistency and cash generation. For the full year, our EBIT adjusted of $12.4 billion came in slightly above the midpoint of the range we guided to in November, thanks to the continued strength of the core business. We grew revenue by 10% year-over-year to a record $172 billion and generated $7.68 of EPS diluted adjusted. A key focus has been profitable growth. And for the full year, we demonstrated this by growing U.S. market share by 30 basis points while keeping incentives well below industry averages. It's important to mention the 2023 actions we've taken to reduce fixed costs and the progress made on the $2 billion net cost reduction program. For example, automotive engineering was reduced by $400 million driven by portfolio simplification, realizing the benefits from winning with simplicity as well as our drive to virtual engineering. Marketing spend was reduced by $500 million, and we expect another $400 million this year. And we saw approximately $500 million from lower BrightDrop and other growth business spend along with the impact of the voluntary separation program across the enterprise. These $1.4 billion of fixed cost reductions were partially offset by $400 million of higher depreciation and amortization, meeting our target to achieve half of the $2 billion program in 2023. We began 2023 with $24 billion of auto cash and marketable securities, generated full year adjusted auto free cash flow of $11.7 billion and returned approximately $12 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including the impact of the $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program initiated in Q4. Coming into 2024, we are well positioned with roughly $20 billion of auto cash and marketable securities. And we'll appropriately balance our capital allocation priorities with the plan to continue to return capital to our shareholders through repurchases and our new higher dividend rate. Let's get into Q4 results. Total company revenue was $43 billion, consistent year-over-year despite the impact of the strike. However, we did have a number of cost items that we do not expect to reoccur in 2024 that impacted our margin performance in the quarter. We achieved $1.8 billion in EBIT adjusted, 4.1% EBIT-adjusted margins and $1.24 in EPS diluted adjusted. These results were also impacted by the strike, which had a $900 million EBIT-adjusted impact in Q4 and a $1.1 billion impact for the full year, primarily from losing an estimated 95,000 units of production. Additionally, we increased our inventory valuation allowances by $1.1 billion to remeasure battery cell and EV inventory held at year-end. This adjustment was significantly larger in Q4 versus prior quarters driven by a combination of increasing cell production in preparation for our 2024 EV acceleration and holding more EVs in company inventory. Adjustments for the full year totaled $1.7 billion. We expect this to be substantially lower in 2024 as we continue to make progress toward our EBIT margin targets on EVs. North America delivered Q4 EBIT adjusted of $2 billion, down $1.6 billion year-over-year driven primarily by the $900 million strike impact and $1 billion of inventory adjustments I just discussed. The performance was also driven by higher pricing and lower fixed costs, which more than offset mix headwinds. North America margin of 8.7% was within our targeted 8% to 10% range for the full year and included a 1.6 percentage point impact from the strike and the inventory adjustments. Part of this performance is from proactively managing our inventory levels, helping to minimize incentives. I'm pleased that we ended the year at 50 days of U.S. inventory, which is at the low end of our 50- to 60-day target range and incentives that were more than 20% below the industry average. GM International had another solid quarter with Q4 EBIT adjusted of $300 million, which was consistent year-over-year. I want to thank the entire international team for another year of good execution and delivering $1.2 billion of EBIT adjusted. GM Financial also performed well with Q4 EBT adjusted of $700 million, down slightly year-over-year. Full year results were $3 billion, at the top end of the $2.5 billion to $3 billion guidance range. Portfolio credit metrics continue to be strong in part due to a predominantly prime credit mix with net charge-offs up slightly due to moderation in credit performance. GM Financial has consistently been an integral part of the business, supporting our customers, supporting our dealers and paying dividends of $1.8 billion to GM in 2023. Cruise expenses were $800 million in the quarter, up $300 million year-over-year and similar to the spend level in Q3. So let's look ahead to 2024. We expect EBIT adjusted in the $12 billion to $14 billion range, EPS diluted adjusted to be in the $8.50 to $9.50 range, including an estimated $1.45 per share benefit from last year's accelerated share repurchase based on the current share price, which will be partially offset by roughly $0.50 headwind from a higher tax rate and lower interest income on lower cash balances. And adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $8 billion to $10 billion range for the year. I want to summarize a few items in 2023 that we don't expect to repeat and will help to contribute to our higher outlook for this year despite some of the potential macro headwinds. These include the $800 million EBIT-adjusted impact from the LG agreements. And as a reminder, this will save us an additional $1,000 per vehicle going forward on our path to EV profitability. $1.1 billion EBIT-adjusted impact from the strike and a substantial amount of the $1.7 billion of net realizable value adjustments as we work through the cell inventory, improve EV profitability and benefit from lower lithium prices. In light of the current macro environment, we anticipate a market similar to 2023 with total U.S. industry volumes of around 16 million units. We expect wholesale volume to grow as we rebound from the impact of the strike and continue our track record of market share gains primarily from higher EV volume. However, we do assume mix headwinds from our ICE production driven by anticipated actions to proactively manage full-size truck inventory levels. We also assume a 2% to 2.5% pricing headwind year-over-year. But overall, we remain confident in our ability to balance production, inventory levels and profitability while growing revenues and sustain our North America margins in the 8% to 10% range. We are on track to realize the remaining $1 billion of net fixed cost savings with the benefits coming from similar areas to last year, including marketing, engineering and the full year benefit of the actions we took in 2023. We expect $1.3 billion in higher labor costs along with logistics being a slight headwind year-over-year primarily due to -- driven by higher finished vehicle shipping costs. Cruise expenses are expected to be around $1 billion lower, given the new operational plan Mary mentioned earlier. In November, we gave an update on our path to EV profitability with an estimated EBIT margin improvement of more than 60 percentage points and a lower overall EV loss in '24 compared to '23 even when you exclude the impact of the inventory adjustments. This will largely be driven by higher EV volumes and fixed cost leverage from both EV and battery cell manufacturing along with the benefit of all of our North America volume being on the Ultium platform. We are already seeing an improvement in cell costs today driven by significantly lower raw material prices and better pricing on cells produced at our first battery JV plant from higher capacity utilization. For GM International, we expect relative stability in our South America and Middle East operations. However, we anticipate ongoing pressure in China, including the plan to reduce production in Q1 to balance dealer inventory levels. These actions will likely result in Q1 China equity income being a slight loss with a return to profitability starting in Q2. For GM Financial, we expect EBT-adjusted again in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range with credit performance and used vehicle prices returning to normal throughout the year along with earning asset growth from retail loan originations and the commercial loan portfolio. We are forecasting another year of robust automotive adjusted free cash flow, but we anticipate modest year-over-year headwinds from '23 working capital benefits that we assume will not repeat and the timing of payments associated with accruals recognized last year, for example, warranty, tax and higher assumed inventory levels. From a modeling perspective, remember that Q1 is our seasonally weakest cash flow quarter of the year. We expect our capital spend to be similar to 2023, inclusive of $500 million to $1 billion of investments in our battery JVs. Our 2024 effective tax rate is assumed to be in the range of 18% to 20%, up from last year primarily due to the global mix of earnings and lower R&D credits primarily due to lower Cruise spend. And our full year EPS guidance assumes a weighted average fully diluted share count of slightly below 1.15 billion shares. This includes the impact of the remaining shares to be purchased through the ASR, which we expect will reduce our fully diluted share count to below 1.1 billion shares once completed. The actual share count will depend on several factors that impact the final ASR settlement, including the average share price during execution and excludes the impact of any incremental share repurchases beyond the ASR. In closing, we know the EV market is not going to grow linearly. And we are prepared to flex between ICE and EV production, given our unique manufacturing capabilities to balance inventory levels and to build customer demand. This will help support pricing and our continued incentive discipline. While we have faced some challenges in our EV transition, we are actively working to address them and remain excited about our future and look forward to a successful 2024. This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question from the line comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi.', 'Itay Michaeli', ""Congratulations. Just a couple of questions on the outlook. First, maybe can you share what you're assuming for end-of-year U.S. dealer inventory days supply? And on the pricing, Paul, I think you mentioned 2%, 2.5%. Maybe talk a bit of what you're assuming for individual segments there?"", 'Paul A. Jacobson', ""Yes, Itay, thanks for your comments and your questions. First, on the inventory question, what I would say is we're continuing to pursue our targeted range of 50 to 60 days on hand of inventory. I think the team has done a really good job of balancing that. And I think that's provided some of the ability to be disciplined with incentives and clearly, has, I think, resulted in a competitive advantage for us that we've utilized for the last couple of years. As we think about that 2% to 2.5%, similar to what we've done for the last couple of years, I would call that a planning assumption rather than an expectation of where we see pricing. We want to make sure that we do that to make sure -- to ensure that we can hit our targets, generate the cash flow that's needed for investment and drive the free cash flow performance. So as similar to years past, if we don't see that, I would expect that we can get some upside into the numbers that we've talked about. So we haven't gone through and assigned an expectation to any particular categories. That's something top-sided we do in the planning process. I hope that helps."", 'Itay Michaeli', ""It does help. A quick follow-up. On the second half target on EV positive VP per unit, can you just talk about what you're assuming for the broader competitive environment, maybe how much cushion you have on the price mix side and still be able to hit those targets?"", 'Paul A. Jacobson', ""So without getting into very detailed specifics because obviously, it can get quite complicated, what I would say is we feel confident about hitting that variable profit positive target in probably the low 200,000 units of the range that Mary mentioned. That's based on a pretty consistent demand profile. So as we've seen the demand for the vehicles that we're producing and the way that customers have received them, we think we can keep that up. So to the extent that we see any pricing softness or demand retreat, we might have to revisit that. But we feel very good about the trajectory that we're on right now."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.', 'Rod Avraham Lache', ""Wanted to just first ask like from the outside at least, it looks like there's a lot more scrutiny being applied to capital allocation. I'm thinking about the posture that you're talking about for Cruise and BrightDrop and the adjustments to EV spending. So my question is just on the surface, it looks like the pendulum has moved a little bit from growth to cash flow. Are these kind of temporary changes or are you kind of thinking about adjustments to GM strategy?"", 'Mary T. Barra', ""Rod, thanks for your comments. I wouldn't -- necessarily it's a change in our strategy. I think as we've continued to progress in the EV transformation, we have found more ways to be much more efficient with capital. And I do want to correct the statement I made earlier where I said we'd eliminated 1,000 selectable options across our portfolio. It was really 100, although I think I have a new stretch target for the team as we take the initiative global. But it's initiatives like that of continuing to look for ways to optimize the capital. When you look at our ICE portfolio, the investment that we made in the last part of the last decade really sets up -- sets us up well to have all new products coming off the existing platforms, whether it's full-size trucks, full-size SUVs, midsize SUVs, et cetera. And so we're looking to continue to be very focused with capital to make sure it's going to generate the right return. And I would also say we are prioritizing continuing to return cash to our shareholders as we go through this transformation because we think the strength of our business, especially our ICE business, allows us to do that. So it's not a change in strategy. I would say on some of the business you mentioned like BrightDrop and others, as we look at the business, I think it was important as we started them to give them some room, but as we got clarity on where the real opportunity for GM was, we can make those businesses much more efficient. And we're going to continue to do that to work on our cost structure to make every dollar of capital count. But we still see growth opportunity. I mean we had a revenue growth of 10% last year. So we're still -- we still have many initiatives in which to grow. We're just going to do it in a very optimized way."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Dan Ives with Wedbush.', 'Daniel Harlan Ives', ""So can you just talk about Cruise? What are sort of the targets for this year that we should think about that would just give more confidence that we've turned the corner there? I mean from an investor perspective and how you look into that long term. I mean you are committed to Cruise, right? That's the best way to think about that one to get through some of these situations."", 'Mary T. Barra', ""Yes. Appreciate the question, Dan. We are committed to Cruise. When we look at the technology, the foundational technology is sound. We had already demonstrated and validated externally that Cruise technology is already safer than a human driver. One of the things we've learned is humans expect technology computers to be much more safe than their expectations that they have for other people. And with that knowledge, we are already working on what the level of the technology needs to be to meet the consumers' expectations. We think we can do that. So we are committed, and we are working on the detailed plan right now of how we'll go forward. We're also looking -- the other big learning was as you roll out technology that is as transformative as this and has incredible benefits to safety, you have to do it in a way where you're really working with the regulators at the local, state and federal level as well as first responders. So as we roll out anywhere, we're going to make sure we build the right relationships, they understand the technology, they understand the benefit of the technology, and that's what we'll do. But we have confidence in the underlying technology, and you'll hear more about our plans for Cruise as we develop the plan in the upcoming weeks."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with UBS.', 'Joseph Robert Spak', ""Maybe just back to the EVs, Mary and Paul. I mean you talked about the positive variable profit. It sounds like the LC NRV charge going lower is a big portion of that, but you also mentioned some other factors. So I was wondering if you could give a little bit more detail there. And then is this something that you will continually give us on a quarter-by-quarter basis to sort of track the progress you're making towards that positive variable profit?"", 'Paul A. Jacobson', ""Joe, it's Paul. Thanks for the questions. Probably just to digress for a second on the lower cost or market adjustment on the EV inventory. So a couple of things. Number one, they're not in -- that's not in any of the metrics that I think are important. Clearly, it is a year-over-year benefit for us on our journey. But when you think about the 2 metrics that we're looking at, there isn't an impact from that. So first is variable profit positive. This relates a lot more to sort of EBIT and how we think about that going forward. But variable profit is mainly benefiting from scale and lower material costs going forward, so not a contributor to that. And then when you think about getting to the mid-single-digit margin target in 2025, we would expect that there isn't really going to be inventory that's necessarily carrying that. And if there is, we'll call that out as we go forward. But it's not in our calculations and not a part of what we think our journey is going to be. So I appreciate the question and not surprised by it, but we're continuing to march along. When you think about the -- sorry, the second part of your question was on? Apologies. What's the second part of your question? Oh, on tracking. Yes, on when we'll disclose. We'll continue to talk about our journey and give confidence as far as specific data points. Not sure that we're going to do it quarterly yet, but we'll continue to update on our progress."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.', 'Adam Michael Jonas', ""Just one question, one follow-up. I want to follow up on Rod's question first on strategy. Can you confirm what portion of your forward year CapEx and R&D is dedicated to EV battery, AV projects, the Auto 2.0? Any reason to think that this -- that you may have scope to dial back the vertical integration, given the changing market? And then my follow-up and again, because I think in the past, where you've talked about well over half, I think you said in recent years of your spending was on that, but I just wanted to know if that was changing. And then the follow-up was on Elon Musk recently said that in the absence of trade barriers that China will demolish most of the Western EV players. Curious your reaction to that comment, whether you'd agree."", 'Mary T. Barra', ""Yes. Thanks, Adam. So from a capital perspective and to build on what I said with Rod, the majority of our capital spend is toward EV. Remember, from an ICE perspective, we have the foundation, already built the plant. And as I mentioned, all of the architectures for our really strong ICE portfolio, that capital has already been deployed. So this is really an opportunity for us to just continue to do great vehicles with very optimized capital from an ICE portfolio as mentioned with the Traverse, the Equinox and the full-size truck, just to name a few. To your point on capital deployed from an infrastructure perspective, as the market evolves and as battery technology evolves, we will continue to evaluate our level of vertical integration. I think with the work we've done on Ultium and the work we've done on electric motors and the joint ventures with plant 1, 2 and 3, and then 4 -- our fourth plant is with Samsung, that gives us a different form factor with prismatic and cylindrical cells, I think we're well positioned. But as we move forward, we'll evaluate that. So I think there's options there. And as you can see, with all the initiatives we have, we are really working to take overall capital down but still get the number of programs that we need. So Adam, I hope that helps. Happy if you have additional questions there. And then on Elon's comments about China. I think, look, I don't discount any competitor. We need to make sure we have beautifully designed vehicles that have the right features, the right safety and the right customer experience. And we have to do it at a competitive cost base, and that's why we're focused so much on our cost base. Now when you mentioned the Chinese consumers, we do need a level playing field. I mean there comes a point where if it's not a level playing field between tariff and nontariff barriers, any industry is going to struggle to compete. So give us a level playing field, and I'll put our products in our cost structure that we continue to improve up against any."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America.', 'John Joseph Murphy', ""Mary, I just wanted to follow up on the strategy line that Adam and Rod have breached here. I mean we're seeing fits and starts in technology, and it will eventually get there. But at the same time, we are seeing this tectonic shift in competition, particularly coming from China, as Adam alluded to. You made sort of pronouncements and how the business strategy will be set up for a few years not too long ago. But these shifts have been pretty extreme more recently. So I'm just curious, as you think about strategy and the position of the company, you haven't been shy from making big changes in the past like exiting Europe. Can we think about the potential for real shifts in strategy of focus where the highest margin and highest return is sort of in the business truly 5 to 10 years down the line, which might include things like exiting China, which sounds like heresy but might be the best move to make for 5 years out, maybe rebranding Cruise and really kind of taking a new sort of approach to where the company will land in 5 to 10 years. It's really protect profitability and cash flow from a position of strength instead of maybe a position in 5 to 10 years where it might be a weaker position."", 'Mary T. Barra', ""John, thanks for the question. And we continue to evaluate the strategy on a regular basis. We have very robust strategy discussions with our Board and with the leadership team. And as you mentioned, the world is changing quickly whether it's EV, whether it's software, autonomy, et cetera, and we're going to continue to respond to that. I do agree with you that we're doing that from a position of strength. And we'll evaluate where we have the opportunity to deploy capital and generate an appropriate return. And like we made the decision for China -- or excuse me, for Europe, when we looked at that, what we said actually has happened. We said it would be a win-win-win, a win for the Opel team, a win for at the time, PSA and a win for General Motors because we participate in the warrants, and we did just that. So we're not going to shy away from making tough calls or maybe calls that people wouldn't expect if we think it's the right thing to do for the business to ensure we're here. We protect our strengths in the markets that we have, whether it's North America. I mentioned on the earnings call, in the top quartile, we've been leading that for several years, and now we profitably have taken the most affordable segment. And we have a strong business in South America in many of our international markets. China, as Paul mentioned, there's tremendous changing not only from a technology point of view but a competitive point of view. And so we're evaluating China. We think there's a place to play. It is a tremendous growth opportunity if we can do that well, and that's our goal. But nothing is off the table in ensuring that GM has a strong future to generate the right profitability and the right return for our investors."", 'John Joseph Murphy', 'And if I could just sneak one follow-up on the plug-in hybrid comment of potentially bringing those here to the U.S. to fill sort of maybe this interim gap. What kind of capacity or volume could you hit there here in the U.S.? I know the dealers are clamoring for those vehicles.', 'Mary T. Barra', ""Yes. We are going to be bringing those in at a time where we need them from a compliance perspective. This year, we're very focused in -- I think as we are able to get the delivery to our dealers that are going to see the strength of the EV portfolio. So I'll have more to share on the hybrid capacity. We'll adjust the capacity because, again, we have the technology. We know the targeted segments that we're going to apply it to. So we'll have the ability to flex and do what we need to from a hybrid perspective. But I think for calendar year '24, EV is our focus. And we think we've got tremendous growth opportunity as we free up getting the availability of the products to customers."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.', 'Ryan Joseph Brinkman', ""Obviously, the '24 outlook is far stronger than investors expected. How much of that higher outlook versus consensus do you think stems from different industry-related factors that are a matter of debate such as expectations for volume or pricing in different markets versus how much do you think stems from company-specific factors that you would naturally have a better handle on internal to the company such as lower Cruise spending, a potential for more structural cost reduction, the magnitude of guidance to the fact you may be more positive on industry factors, but your pricing comments also seemed pretty in line. So not really sure. How are you thinking about like how much of your meeting this great guide in '24 will come down to factors under your control versus out of your control?"", 'Paul A. Jacobson', ""So Ryan, thanks for the question. I'll take a shot at that. When you look at the macro backdrop, I think we're approaching it pretty consistently to what we have for the last few years. So we've talked about a 16 million SAAR, about 2% to 2.5% of sort of total pricing pressure across the board. A lot of it is, I would say, a testament to what we achieved and overcame in 2023 that we don't expect to repeat. Of course, there will be some things that pop up as there are every year. And I think the team has done a good job of knocking those things down and overcoming some of those challenges going forward. So against the macro backdrop, that feels a little bit consistent with some conservatism in there on the pricing side of it. I think a lot of it is on our ability to execute. And we have had a lot of challenges, as Mary mentioned. I think '23 was a big year of learning for us. But as she talked about with the work that we're doing on the module assembly and where we see EV ramp as well as the customer response to the EVs that we're producing, I think this is a year of our executing and a lot of it is in our control."", 'Ryan Joseph Brinkman', ""Okay. Great. I just wanted to ask on Cruise too, starting with whether the guided $1 billion of lower spending in '24 versus the '23 full year $2.7 billion figure or maybe the 4Q run rate of $3.2 billion. And then what has the response been so far? I realize there hasn't been a lot of time passed, but from the regulators to the recently released comprehensive review. Previously, I think you've guided to potentially significantly less than the non-Cruise, maybe on the business update call, but then followed a day or 2 later at Barclays by saying several hundred million, now it's $1 billion. So of course, you were still waiting for the review at that point. Is there anything to read into the $1 billion being higher than several hundred million? Is that maybe the reception of the review could lead to a more prolonged suspension of commercial operations? And then just finally, the outlook for the EBIT loss in '24 or whatever it is $1.7 billion or $2.7 billion, it's greater than the $1.3 billion of cash that Cruise had at year-end, right, on, I think, Slide 26 or so. So just capital raise, curious on the thoughts there."", 'Mary T. Barra', ""Ryan, there's a lot in there, but let me first by saying the response from regulators has been positive. So -- and we'll continue to have that outreach and build that relationship and be transparent with them. You shouldn't read too much into what we said, shortly thereafter we learned the situation. We went in and did a lot of work. And I got a -- I have to give our co-presidents, Craig Glidden and Mo Elshenawy credit for going in and really staying focused on the technology, making sure we keep the very talented software engineers that are doing incredible work and have allowed us to already clock 5 million miles of driverless miles. So it was really just going to look a lot of where the opportunity to cut costs came from, the change in strategy to really focus on one city to demonstrate it as opposed to -- you remember at one point, they were talking about 20 cities this year. And so there were a lot of people who had been recently added more from an operational standpoint that we were able to exit those employees. But clearly a focus on the technology. And the way I look at this is we're going to make sure we do it right from a regulatory, a consumer, a customer relationship perspective, get the technology where we think it would be. And then once we're informed by doing it well in the cities, then we'll have the opportunity to go quickly and scale from there. So don't read anything into the $1 billion other than we went and did the work and saw the opportunity."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Dan Levy with Barclays.', 'Dan Meir Levy', ""Two questions on cash. One is you're guiding to $8 billion to $10 billion of free cash. And that pro forma gets your cash balance on the balance sheet to something like $28 billion to $30 billion at the end of 2024. To what extent are you willing to put forward another share buyback plan beyond what you have if the target is to have cash balance of $20 billion? And the second question is on Cruise, on cash. They're at roughly $1.3 billion. I think that gives you a little less than a year of runway on cash. So what's the plan on further funding for Cruise?"", 'Mary T. Barra', ""So on the further funding on Cruise, I'll take that, and I'll have Paul answer the other question. As we get the detailed plan of how we're going to relaunch Cruise in the road map, then we'll evaluate the overall funding needs. And we'll determine is it internal or externally sourced."", 'Paul A. Jacobson', ""And Dan, on your question on cash, I think the simple math is correct. We would obviously see a sizable increase in our cash balance. Our capital allocation stance remains the same, which is to invest in the business. And we've talked about $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion of CapEx this year. We have been streamlining that and making that efficient and a priority to drive free cash flow. And as we look at the balance sheet, I think the balance sheet is in really good shape. And there's no change to our stance of, call it, $18 billion or about $20 billion of cash on hand. So clearly, we've demonstrated a renewed commitment and prioritization of returning cash to shareholders. And we'll maintain that flexibility going forward."", 'Dan Meir Levy', 'Just to clarify, the $18 billion, $20 billion, is that a target or is that a floor?', 'Paul A. Jacobson', ""That's kind of been our floor/targeted range. Obviously, we've carried quite a bit more than that over the last few years as we dealt with some of the uncertainty. But as we imagine -- or as we said in November when we announced the share repurchase with a lot of that uncertainty behind us, lower CapEx spending, we felt comfortable operating at that lower balance. So $18 billion to $20 billion feels very comfortable as the targeted range."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.', 'Emmanuel Rosner', ""First of all, I was hoping to ask you about the scale required to achieve the EV profitability goals. So I think when you shared those goals back in November, in particular, the 60-point EBIT margin improvement this year, I think 60% of that came from scale. I'm curious if the 200,000 to 300,000 units you're planning for this year, is that enough to get you that scale piece? So are you counting more on like lower battery costs and maybe a bit of a shift in terms of some of the savings? And then similar question on the mid-single-digit EBIT margin target for next year. I think some of it was going to come from scale. What kind of unit volume you need to get the scale piece of -- to get to these targets?"", 'Paul A. Jacobson', ""Emmanuel, thanks for the questions. On the 2024 numbers, I think they're wholly consistent with the 200,000 to 300,000 range that we've articulated here. And as I mentioned earlier in response to a question around EVs, the low 200,000 is kind of what gets us to the point where we feel comfortable about getting the variable profit positive from there. Obviously, growth is a component, but it's a much smaller component of the walk from '24 to '25 than it is from '23 to '24. But it will require some growth. We're not going to commit to that other than just to say kind of that's where we stand, and we'll see where customer demand is going forward. And the other point if I didn't make it earlier on the lower battery raw material costs, keep in mind that we don't start to see meaningful benefit from that until we get to the middle part of the year because a lot of the cells that we have in inventory were built with higher raw materials costs. So while we're producing cells today, we're going first in, first out on the cells. So we have a little bit of a lag before we realize that. That lower battery raw material cost of about $4,000 a vehicle that we articulated, we'll also have some annualization benefits in 2025 since we're not getting a full benefit here in '24. I hope that's helpful."", 'Emmanuel Rosner', 'Yes, very helpful. One very quick follow-up on Cruise. The spending, $1 billion lower for this year. Is that -- could that be considered sort of like a new run rate for spending? Or is it sort of like a temporary situation as a result of some of the path currently in the testing and rollout?', 'Mary T. Barra', ""Emmanuel, I would consider it right now it's our best estimate for this year. Obviously, as we develop a much more detailed plan that will inform over the next couple of years what the spending needs to be, so more to come."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore.', 'Christopher Patrick McNally', ""Great numbers. Mary, I just want to shift gears and talk maybe advanced ADAS and software really quickly. Super Cruise, you introduced in 2018. You don't put out too many usage numbers, but I think in the middle of last year, you talked about almost 100 million miles cumulatively. Even if we double that for time passage, it's not many vehicles, tens of thousands. We also read Ultra Cruise has now been installed. Just high level, isn't this a very slow pace for Level 2+ product? Tesla has been providing for a decade charging anywhere from 6,000 to 12,000 for top versions. I guess the question is, isn't this becoming a big miss opportunity for GM at this point for additional revenue? Even Slide 7, I think, only shows one of the ICE launches, the Traverse highlighting Super Cruise. So just a broad update when we could start to see what is a technology probably everyone wants at more sort of mass deployment scale across your fleet?"", 'Mary T. Barra', ""Yes. Chris, appreciate the question. I think back in the '18 time frame, I think we should have, in hindsight, put it across the portfolio much more quickly. It's not a number of models. I don't have it off the top of my head. Ashish, we can provide that. But it's on a number of models across the portfolio right now. As we launch the Traverse this year will be added to the Traverse. Again, we're seeing extremely strong response from customers where I think it's over 80%, 85% of customers once they experience the technology say they would never -- they would not want a car without it or they would strongly prefer it on their vehicle, which, in my experience, is a pretty high interest rate for a single technology. So we're committed. We're going to continue to develop. And we have been, along the way, adding more roads and adding more capability, whether it's lane change, whether it's trailering. So there's a robust plan to continue to improve Super Cruise, and we'll stay on that. And we are seeing the profitability benefits. And the more vehicles to your point, we get it on, the better it will be. And we're committed to do that and frankly, have done quite a bit already. And we can provide that."", 'Christopher Patrick McNally', ""No, that's -- and just in terms of the evolution of the speed, is it a technology bottleneck? Or is it more just marketing, meaning like you thought of it as a premium product, you charge sort of a premium rate compared to other GM add-ons? Or is it just like you said, there's a cost to putting it on every vehicle on the RD&E. So that could increase, but it would obviously be an engineering cost to get it on more vehicles."", 'Mary T. Barra', ""Yes. No, we are committed to getting it on many vehicles as possible. In some cases, we had planned to make it standard. The semiconductor shortage kind of slowed us down on that because it was a choice of building a vehicle at all or waiting to build it with Super Cruise. So we are very committed to getting across many vehicles. We've dramatically taken the cost down on the technology. So it's a really good value. And in my opinion, we're deploying it as quickly as we can. And it's really just with -- there is engineering required and some sensors required when you add it to a new vehicle, but we're doing that in a very cadenced but as quick as possible fashion."", 'Operator', 'Our last question comes from the line of Tom Narayan with RBC.', 'Gautam Narayan', 'Just wanted to kind of make sure I got all the good points here on the bridge in 2023 to 2024 -- sorry, a boring question. You have, I guess, price down 2% to 2.5%, $200 million cost savings, Cruise down $1 billion, higher labor $1.3 billion. Three items not quantified were market share gains you guys called out in the slide, EV margin improvement, and the third is lower mix. Just curious if we could get a sense of order of magnitude for those 3 last buckets?', 'Paul A. Jacobson', ""Tom, I'll suggest that we take that off-line, work through any modeling details. But at the end of the day, clearly, the commercial market, as we talked about, we expect to be relatively stable and pricing down 2% to 2.5%. Not going to get into the specifics about how we're thinking about market share gains other than to say, fairly consistent about what we've been doing for the last few years going forward. And then on EVs, a lot of that, we will continue to talk about as we come to sort of later Investor Day and subsequent calls going forward. I think we've given good detail on the overall walk on a vehicle program level."", 'Gautam Narayan', ""Okay. Sure. And as a quick follow-up, typically, when -- if an OEM, let's say, changes production levels, so in this case, EV, if you move to plug-in hybrids or what have you, there are monies that get paid to suppliers, right, for that, let's say, they have to cut production of EV components. Just curious if those supplier concessions if you were to, let's say, reduce EV production or shift to plug-in hybrids with -- are those something that you've envisioned in the 2024 guidance?"", 'Paul A. Jacobson', ""So Tom, I think our -- we've got great relationships with our suppliers and a team that works very, very closely with them. They have been, I would say, very patient with us over the last few years because we've had a lot of volatility. And in those situations where we need to help, we've been willing to do that going forward. And we always look at both efficiencies and any challenges in our annual budget process, and this year is no different."", 'Operator', ""I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing remarks."", 'Mary T. Barra', ""Thank you very much. And thanks, everybody, for your questions. I'd like to share just a couple of thoughts before we close. Fundamentally, we believe we are well positioned to have a strong year, thanks to our success in high-margin and growing ICE segments, our expanding EV portfolio, our cost discipline and our continuous improvements to design, engineering, supply chain, manufacturing and marketing process improvements. In addition, we are prioritizing the return of cash to our shareholders on a consistent basis as we execute the plan. We know we must execute in every part of the business in '24, not just ICE. And I can assure you we will. So thank you for your continued support and for joining today's call, and please stay safe."", 'Operator', 'That concludes the conference call for today.

When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well.

ROST appears encouraging on the back of the successful execution of its strategic initiatives and strong fundamentals. The company is undertaking store expansion efforts to drive efficiency and boost growth. It continues to gain from the positive customer response for its merchandise across both banners, which has been boosting the comparable store-sales (comps) performance.Buoyed by such endeavors, the off-price apparel retailer’s shares have increased 24.7% in the past six months, surpassing the industry’s 12.9% growth. Impressively, analysts seem optimistic about the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 sales and earnings per share (EPS) is currently pegged at $20.1 billion and $5.36, showing an increase of 7.5% and 22.4%, respectively, year over year. The consensus estimate for fiscal 2024 sales and EPS is presently $21 billion and $5.83, respectively, indicating growth of 4.3% and 8.8% year over year.', 'Ross Stores has been benefiting from higher merchandise margin, as well as lower distribution expenses, domestic freight and occupancy expenses due to the easing of supply-chain headwinds. This led to a 260-basis points (bps) decline in the cost of goods sold, as a percentage of revenues, which boosted operating margin in third-quarter fiscal 2023. Merchandise margins increased 235 bps year over year, resulting from lower ocean freight costs. Additionally, the company witnessed a 45 bps decline in distribution expenses, a 40 bps decline in domestic freight and 25 bps leverage from occupancy costs. Further, comps improved 5%, backed by improved traffic in the said quarter.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', ""The company predicted improved operating margin for fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 driven by lower domestic freight and distribution costs, partly due to favorable packaway timing. The operating margin for the fiscal fourth quarter is expected to be 11.3-11.5% compared with the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of 10.7%, driven by gains from higher merchandise margins, owing to lower ocean freight costs and a 65-bps gain from the 53rd week.Ross Stores has been consistent with the execution of its store expansion plans over the years. The company’s store expansion efforts are focused on continually increasing penetration in the existing as well as new markets. In third-quarter 2023, the company completed its targeted store expansion plans for fiscal 2023. Through the nine months of fiscal 2023, the company opened 97 stores, including 72 Ross and 25 dd’s DISCOUNTS. It expects to close fiscal 2023 with 1,764 Ross stores and 345 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. This reflects an addition of net 94 stores for the fiscal year.Management had earlier raised its long-term store expansion targets. The company expects to expand “Ross Dress for Less” to 2,900 stores and dd’s DISCOUNTS to 700 stores. This represents a 20% increase in potential store growth targets, thus bringing it to 3,600 stores. This indicates significant growth from the company’s store count of 1,923 stores at the end of fiscal 2021.Ross Stores operates a chain of off-price retail apparel and home accessories stores, which target value-conscious men and women, aged 25 to 54 in middle-to-upper middle-class households. The company has a proven business model as the competitive bargains it offers continue to make its stores attractive destinations for customers in all economic scenarios. Moreover, the off-price model offers a strong value proposition and micro-merchandising that drive better product allocation and margins.

(NYSE:MA) trades at approximately 31 times consensus 2024 earnings per share. Comparably, the S&P 500 trades at roughly 21 times consensus earnings.', 'Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) appears to believe the stock is worth its premium valuation as Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) owns nearly 4 million shares. Based on current market prices, this position is worth roughly $1.6 billion.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with MA.', 'I agree with Buffett and believe that Mastercard is worth its premium valuation due to its wide moat and strong growth prospects.', 'Mastercard is the third-largest payments processing company globally with an estimated total market share of 24%. The global payments market is highly concentrated with the leading player, Visa (NYSE:V), having an estimated 39% market share. China-based UnionPay is the second-largest player globally with an estimated 34% market share. Outside of China, the payments network business is dominated by Visa and Mastercard as the vast majority of UnionPay volume is inside China.', ""In the U.S., Mastercard competes with smaller players such as American Express (NYSE:AXP), Capital One (NYSE:COF) and Discover (NYSE:DFS). However, the marketplace is dominated by Mastercard, Visa and American Express. For these reasons, the payment network business can be characterized as an oligopoly. This market structure results in a low degree of competition and high profit margins. The company's consistently high profit margins, which have averaged over 40% over the past 10 years, serve as evidence of the wide moat that Mastercard enjoys."", 'Barriers to entry for new players are very high in the card network business as it would require massive adoption among merchets to be competitive with the coverage of Visa or Mastercard networks.', 'The result of a low degree of existing competition and high barriers to entry is that Mastercard is a wide-moat business.', 'MA Data by GuruFocus', 'Mastercard has several key growth drivers, including annual increases in card spending due to economic growth and a continued transition toward spending on credit cards versus cash. Historically, nominal U.S. gross domestic product has grown at around 6%. Thus, assuming no increase in the proportion of transactions executed on cards versus cash, Mastercard should be able to grow revenue at 6%. Research conducted the Pew Research Center suggests that roughly 41% of Americans do not use cash for any of their purchases, while 44% of Americans still use cash for some of their purchases. This is a significant change from 2015, when it was estimated that roughly 24% of Americans did not use cash for any of their purchases while 51% of Americans did. Thus, while the trend away from cash has been growing, there is significant room for a further shift in spending volumes away from cash and toward cards.', ""Current consensus estimates call for Mastercard to report revenue growth of 12.20% in 2024, 13% in 2025 and 10.90% in 2026. I view these estimates as fairly reasonable given the company has grown revenue at an annual rate of roughly 11% over the past five years. Consensus estimates call for the company to report earnings per share growth of 16.90% for 2024, 18% for 2025 and 18.20% for 2026. I view these estimates as reasonable since the company has grown earnings per share over the past five years at an annual rate of roughly 18%. Earnings are likely to grow faster than revenue due to the impact of share repurchases and modest margin expansion. I view modest margin expansion as likely given that the company's cost base is unlikely to rise at the same pace as revenues since Mastercard has very little marginal costs for additional spend on its network."", 'Mastercard is currently trading at approximately 31 times forward earnings per share. This compares to its larger peer Visa, which trades at approximately 28 times forward earnings. I view this relative premium valuation as reasonable given that the company has historically experienced slightly better growth prospects due to a higher percentage of its volume being outside the U.S. compared to Visa. Mastercard is also expected to experience modestly better revenue and earnings per share growth than Visa over the next few years, which further supports the case that it should trade at a premium. For context, consensus estimates for 2024 to 2026 call for Visa to grow earnings per share at rates of 12.60%, 12.90% and 14.60%.', ""I also find Mastercard's premium valuation to the broader market as reasonable as it has better near-term growth prospects than the broader market. While consensus estimates call for the S&P 500 to grow earnings by roughly 12% for fiscal year 2024, I expect growth to moderate back toward historical norms of high single digits in the years that follow. I view 10% as a reasonable five-year earnings growth estimate for the S&P 500. Comparably, over the next five years, I believe Mastercard can grow earnings at a annual rate of 16%, which represents a small discount to the growth rate over the past five years. Thus, based on these growth estimates, the stock is trading at a forward PEG ratio of 1.90 while the broader market is trading at a PEG ratio of 2.10."", ""Mastercard's forward price-earnings ratio of 31 is also fairly attractive versus historical norms. Over the past few years, the stock has traded at an average forward price-earnings ratio of approximately 35. Over the past 10 years, it has traded at an average trailing price-earnings ratio of approximately 37. Thus, based on these metrics, I view the company's current valuation as attractive versus historical norms."", 'MA Data by GuruFocus', 'I believe the biggest risk to the Mastercard bull case is the potential for regulatory reform, which might limit how much card network operators can change or increase competition. For example, the proposed Credit Card Competition Act would require banks to give merchants a choice of two different network to process credit card transactions on. In response to this proposed legislation, Mastercard released a public letter to a number of U.S. Senators noting the proposed legislation would remove customer choice, erode security, eliminate rewards and prevent small businesses from investing in their future.', 'I view near-term passage of the Credit Card Competition Act unlikely given the other events, including wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, competing for time on the congressional agenda. That said, investors should continue to actively monitor the regulatory environment as it poses a key risk to the business over the longer term.', ""Mastercard trades at a premium valuation to the broader market and its closest peer. I view the premium as warranted given the company's wide-moat business and solid growth potential. Additionally, I view the modest valuation premium relative to Visa as appropriate given the fact Mastercard has modestly better growth prospects. The stock is trading at a discount to its historical valuation norms, which suggests it is undervalued relative to its own historical valuation norm."", 'The biggest risk facing the company is potential regulatory reform. However, I view this as unlikely given the current political climate.', 'For these reasons, I believe Mastercard is worthy of its premium valuation and view the shares as attractive currently.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

It has multiple AI investments, a cloud computing division (Google Cloud), and other properties like YouTube. But at the end of the day, Alphabet is primarily an advertising company. With nearly 80% of its revenue coming from ads, the ad market must stay strong.', 'It showed signs of strength in the third quarter, with ad revenue rising 9.5% -- a significant improvement compared to recent quarters. Advertising market strength is expected to persist throughout the year as the economy shrugs off recession expectations.', 'This is part of why analysts expect 11% revenue growth and 26% earnings growth in 2024. As a result, the stock trades for a reasonable 23 times forward earnings (reasonable, at least when compared to other big-tech stocks).', ""Alphabet's main business is in recovery mode, and with the upside of AI, it could be a strong year for the third-largest company in the U.S. markets."", ""Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) was supposed to be ruined by a recession in 2023 or 2024. However, that hasn't happened, and the company has continued to deliver strong results. In Q3, revenue rose 18% to $3.4 billion and produced an impressive $1.3 billion in free cash flow. With nights and experiences rising 14% year over year, it's clear that Airbnb is still a popular choice when traveling."", 'With fourth-quarter revenue expected to grow around 13%, it should be another strong quarter when Airbnb reports results. Despite that, Airbnb trades at a fairly cheap price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio when 2024 results are used. Wall Street analysts expect earnings per share of around $8.07 in 2024, pricing the stock at 18 times forward earnings. Considering the S&P 500 trades for a forward P/E of around 20, Airbnb stock looks like a bargain.', ""UiPath (NYSE: PATH) is a bit of an artificial intelligence (AI) play, as its robotic process automation (RPA) software uses AI to broaden what it can automate. However, it doesn't come with the price tag you'd expect from an AI-related company. UiPath trades for under 11 times sales -- a reasonable level that would still make sense even if it was fully profitable (Airbnb trades at 10 times sales)."", ""UiPath is rapidly growing, too, with annual recurring revenue (ARR) rising 24% year over year to $1.38 billion. While it's nowhere near profitable, it has enacted several improvements to increase its operating efficiencies in pursuit of breaking even."", 'UiPath provides this group with rapid growth without needing to overpay for it.', ""Like Alphabet, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is also heavily exposed to the advertising industry. While it has other investments in mixed and virtual reality, the metaverse, and AI, Meta's primary revenue stream comes from its Family of Apps, consisting of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Threads."", ""Ad revenue struggled in late 2022 and into 2023 but dramatically recovered in Q3 by rising 24% year over year. Thanks to this massive revenue boost and operating expenses decreasing, Meta's earnings per share (EPS) shot up from $1.64 to $4.50."", 'If it can keep this up throughout 2024, the stock will look dramatically undervalued. With a forward P/E ratio of 22, it still looks like a strong buy at these prices.', ""Last is Visa (NYSE: V), which recently reported its most recent earnings for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended Dec. 31). While Visa's revenue growth didn't reach double digits (it grew 9%), its stock buyback program and operational improvements allowed its EPS to increase by an outstanding 20%."", ""These results allowed Visa to notch a new all-time high stock price.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up."", 'Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Tapestry (NYSE:TPR). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Tapestry with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.', ' View our latest analysis for Tapestry ', ""If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. To the delight of shareholders, Tapestry has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 55%, compound, over the last three years. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but it should be more than enough to pique the interest of the wary stock pickers."", ""Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. It seems Tapestry is pretty stable, since revenue and EBIT margins are pretty flat year on year. That's not a major concern but nor does it point to the long term growth we like to see."", 'In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.', ""In investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Tapestry's forecast profits?"", ""Since Tapestry has a market capitalisation of US$8.9b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they hold US$32m worth of its stock. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Despite being just 0.4% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture."", ""Tapestry's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching Tapestry very closely. Don't forget that there may still be risks.

Because Nvidia is a hardware company, this strength will eventually fade, and investors will be stuck holding a stock valued for a business it no longer has."", ""Instead, a far better alternative to Nvidia is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent company of Google. I've got four reasons why Alphabet will be a much better long-term investment today than Nvidia, and why its business is more sustainable."", ""As mentioned above, Nvidia is a hardware company. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the best in class for AI model training. However, once it sells the GPU, that's it. Unless clients come back to build additional supercomputers or upgrade their system down the line, Nvidia's sales are a one-time benefit."", ""Alphabet is a massive Nvidia GPU buyer, but it has set up a subscription model using these products. One of Alphabet's most exciting segments is Google Cloud, its cloud computing division. By filling data centers with powerful Nvidia GPUs, clients who need access to extreme computing power can rent it from Alphabet. This allows these clients to stay asset-light and quickly scale up or down according to their needs. Because the revenue stream from this business is recurring, it's far more sustainable."", ""Additionally, Alphabet has other AI products, like its generative AI model Gemini. This model beats the competition in multiple tests and will create a new revenue stream for Alphabet as it's implemented into various programs."", ""While Nvidia's one-time sales may provide flashy year-over-year growth figures in boom times, they're not as sustainable as Alphabet's subscription-focused approach."", ""Because Nvidia is a pick-and-shovel play, it saw the first wave of AI demand. With companies like Alphabet ordering thousands of GPUs to outfit their data centers, it experienced a sudden demand rush. It's not advisable to invest in a company in the middle of a demand rush, as many lofty expectations are already baked into the stock."", ""While Alphabet has seen increased demand for cloud computing and generative AI, it's in the early stages. This means the rush hasn't happened for Alphabet yet, making me more excited to get into Alphabet's stock before the big move comes along."", ""Another issue with Nvidia's stock is how expensive it has gotten. With Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio sitting at a much higher level than Alphabet's valuation, it has a lot of expectations built in."", ""Alphabet doesn't have nearly the same hype around its stock and trades at about the same level as the broader S&P 500, which has a forward P/E of 20."", 'If Alphabet maintains its status quo, it will still be a market-beating stock. If Nvidia misses expectations, the bottom will fall out of the stock.', ""Finally, Alphabet is far more diversified than Nvidia. If this AI trend turns out to be a bust (I don't think it will be), then a large swath of Nvidia's business will evaporate. This wouldn't be the first time this has happened to Nvidia, as multiple crypto crashes have caused the company's revenue to drop rapidly when demand fell."", ""Although many investors (including myself) are excited about Alphabet's AI prospects, at the end of the day, nearly 80% of its revenue comes from advertising services. Advertising has been around for thousands of years and likely won't fade away anytime soon."", 'So, regardless of how successful AI proliferation is, Alphabet should be fine.', 'To me, Alphabet is a much better investment right now than Nvidia. While Nvidia may see strength throughout the rest of 2024, it will likely eventually experience a drop in demand due to its non-subscription business model. If you like roller coasters, Nvidia may be a better stock, although you may never return to the highs you experience early on.

The diversified chip designer and manufacturer actually beat estimates in its fourth-quarter report. Revenue rose 10% to $15.4 billion, ahead of the consensus at $15.16 billion, while adjusted earnings per share jumped from $0.15 to $0.54, topping expectations at $0.45."", 'If Intel had stopped there, the stock might have gained, but its first-quarter guidance showed that this momentum is grinding to a halt. For the current period, the company expects revenue of $12.2 billion to $13.2 billion, which represents 15% growth at the midpoint from a weak performance a year ago, but is considerably worse than the consensus at $14.1 billion. It also forecast adjusted earnings per share of just $0.13 for the current quarter, below estimates of $0.33.', ""While management didn't give a full-year forecast, it expressed optimism that results would improve later in the year. For example, CFO David Zinsner said on the earnings call that data center revenue would decline by double digits in the first quarter but improve over the rest of the year as it fulfills orders for discrete accelerators."", 'Intel should also benefit from recovering demand for PCs, a category that is expected to grow by low single digits in 2024, and the company has a slew of new products including Gaudi2 AI accelerators and AI PC products like the Intel Core Ultra, its most AI-capable and power-efficient PC processor, that it expects to drive growth.', ""After nearly doubling last year but tumbling on its recent earnings report, Intel stock seems to be at a crossroads. Is it a buy today?

It needs the PC market to recover and it needs to capitalize on that increasing demand. The company touted its AI PC chips on the call, but Intel no longer has an iron grip on the PC market the way it did 20 years ago.', ""Plus, the AI PC era promises to be even more competitive as rivals like AMD and Nvidia, which just unveiled its own AI PC chips, are eager to capitalize on the new opportunity. Investors will also be watching Intel's broader efforts in AI in areas like data centers, even as it acknowledged that some demand has shifted away from its strength in CPUs toward accelerators."", ""Finally, Intel has an opportunity in its foundry services, a market that Taiwan Semiconductor dominates. Chip manufacturing is in high demand, and Intel's plans to build several new factories in the U.S. and around the world could help establish it as a significant player in contract chip manufacturing."", ""Thus far, the rising AI tide has lifted nearly every boat in the semiconductor sector, but it won't be like that forever. Eventually, the pretenders will be separated from the contenders."", ""One quarter's outlook isn't enough to judge Intel's prospects for the year, especially given its favorable commentary, but it is clear why investors were disappointed, especially considering the company's hyped-up AI event last month."", ""At this point, Intel doesn't have the same credibility as peers like AMD, Nvidia, or Broadcom, which have made smart strategic moves and have delivered market-trouncing returns over the last decade. Similarly, CEO Pat Gelsinger hasn't yet earned the benefit of the doubt from investors. With competition increasing in the AI PC market, including from Nvidia, Intel is also facing a new set of challenges that could stymie its expected recovery in its core personal computing market."", 'Gelsinger called Friday\'s sell-off ""overstated,"" and that opinion could be borne out over the coming months, but there are other chip stocks, including the ones above, that seem much easier to own at this point, and more likely to be successful in an AI-first world.', ""Investors will have a better sense of Intel's prospects after peers like AMD report earnings this week.

The rise of streaming platforms has resulted in audiences moving away from traditional cable and satellite subscriptions.The decline in ratings for broadcast television and the reduced demand for theatrical content sales pose significant challenges for industry participants. Advertisers' hesitant spending, driven by concerns over inflation and higher interest rates, has added to the industry's woes amid an increasing rate of cord-cutting and stiff competition from subscription video-on-demand and virtual Multichannel Video Programming Distributor services.Despite stiff competition, industry players are benefiting from the spike in the demand for high-speed broadband. Strong demand for WiFi devices and wireless Internet has been a boon.Diversified content offerings, which are original, regional, short and suitable for small screens (smartphones and tablets), improved Internet speed and penetration, and technological advancement are benefiting the industry participants. As monetization and revenues in terms of ad-spend continue to be subdued, profit protection and cash management with greater technology integration have gained strategic significance and are expected to have driven the top lines of industry participants like Disney DIS and Paramount Global PARA in the soon-to-be-reported quarter."", ""Investing in media companies at the forefront of the digital transformation, leveraging original content creation and the wave of high-speed Internet demand, presents a compelling opportunity. The convergence of these factors positions such companies to capture new revenue streams, expand internationally and navigate the evolving media landscape successfully.The industry's pivot toward digital platforms is driving a surge in original content creation. Media companies like Warner Bros. Discovery WBD are investing heavily in producing high-quality, exclusive content to meet the demands of a discerning audience. This shift is not only a response to changing consumption patterns but also a proactive strategy to differentiate and compete in a crowded digital space. Successful content creation not only enhances subscriber loyalty but also opens avenues for additional revenue streams through licensing and syndication deals.Media companies are also experiencing a paradigm shift in revenue generation, moving beyond traditional TV platforms. The ability to harness ad revenues from diverse digital channels, including websites and other digital platforms, presents a significant growth opportunity. Target-based advertising, facilitated by the data-rich digital environment, is becoming a cornerstone for revenue diversification.The growing preference for digital and subscription services over linear pay television has compelled media companies to alter their business models. Acknowledging the shift in consumer behavior, industry players are adopting alternative business models, such as skinny bundles, to provide more cost-effective options to consumers. These bundles, delivered at lower costs than traditional offerings, aim to attract a wider audience and enhance the industry's competitiveness.The surge in demand for high-speed Internet, including broadband, is a pivotal catalyst propelling the growth of industry participants like Rogers Communications and Charter. Faster Internet speeds are fostering a preference for high-quality video content and the trend of binge-watching. The strengthening broadband ecosystem on a global scale, coupled with the proliferation of smart TVs, creates a conducive environment for media companies to thrive. As consumers seek seamless, high-quality content delivery, companies providing engaging digital experiences stand to benefit from the expanding market.Continuous investment in technology, content innovation and strategic partnerships will be crucial to staying ahead in this dynamic landscape."", 'With the existence of a number of industry players, finding media stocks that have the potential to beat earnings estimates can be daunting.

And while customers continue to watch their budgets, F5 sees encouraging signs of stabilizing demand trends. Here to discuss this and more is Francois Locoh-Donou F5 chief executive officer and president. Francois, it is great to see you again. Thanks so much for joining us.', 'FRANCOIS LOCOH-DONOU: Thank you.', '- Talk to me about the stabilizing demand. Talk me through what you are seeing from customers and their willingness to spend.', 'FRANCOIS LOCOH-DONOU: Julie, I think last year, we were seeing a lot of customers that were canceling projects or delaying projects because they were surprised, you know, sometimes in the middle of a project that their budget would go away. We have not been seeing that over the last six months. And specifically over the last three months, we have seen more predictability and more stability with large enterprise customers around the globe.', ""We've seen that both in the US and outside of the US where customers are clear on their budgets going in. And they move forward with the projects that they have planned. So it gives us a little more visibility and stability in the business."", ""- And Francois, I know in that earnings printed-- and it's great to see you and have you on the show again. I know the Street, Francois, was impressed by the strength in profitability. EPS came in ahead of consensus. How confident can you be, Francois, that that kind of continues here over the next few quarters?"", 'FRANCOIS LOCOH-DONOU: Well, thank you, Josh. Yes, we did deliver a revenue at the top end of our range. And earnings per share growth well above our guidance range.', ""And so, you know, we're confident that we're going to be able to execute over the next few quarters based on the stability and the predictability we're seeing on the market. But beyond that, Josh, there's a broader trend in the market, which is that today businesses are run by apps and APIs. And there was this idea a few years ago that, you know, all applications that large enterprise would move all of their applications to a single cloud. And that idea is pretty much dead today."", ""The reality is large enterprises-- to deliver the digital experiences that we all enjoy, large enterprises, you know, are moving their applications across multiple clouds. Today, 90% of organizations actually deploy their applications in multiple public clouds, in data centers, and on edge sites. And that's great from a flexibility perspective."", ""But it has created a crisis for securing all these applications and all these APIs. And F5 has built a portfolio now that is unique in its ability to secure all applications regardless of where they're at. And so we think that that position and the trends in the market for the explosion of apps, explosion of APIs is going to give us a very strong, you know, mid to long-term opportunity to grow the business."", ""- And, Francois, how much has generative AI been a factor in that change that you're talking about with these various application-driven clouds?"", 'FRANCOIS LOCOH-DONOU: Julie, generative AI is going to play a very important role because generative AI is an accelerator of what I just described. So I just said that the world is run by apps and APIs today. And we are going to-- you know, and AIs are going to be modern applications that themselves are going to be highly distributed.', ""So AI workloads are going to make heavy use of APIs. They are going to live in multiple public clouds. And the needs for security, specifically securing these apps, securing these APIs are going to be significantly accelerated by generative AI. And this is something we're going to see play out over the next several quarters and even over the next several years."", '- And, Francois, has AI, you know, changed or impacted the way you at F5 think about hiring and spending?', ""FRANCOIS LOCOH-DONOU It hasn't impacted how we think about hiring today. But it is impacting how we think about spending because we have started-- across multiple functions at F5, we have started testing and experimenting large language models in areas where we can increase productivity. And so we're looking at that for software development and accelerating productivity in software development. We're looking at that for support and for our sales and marketing efforts."", ""I think at this point in time, we're-- you know, I think large enterprises are all going through the learning curve. We are going through the learning curve pretty quickly. So I would expect that we start seeing these things in production more in the 2025 time frame and beyond."", '- And, Francois, something I have been wondering amongst, you know, the enterprise-reliant companies like yourselves, as we see this AI spending cycle, is there any concern because of the huge investments at AI that other places will not be getting the attention that they need? And', ""FRANCOIS LOCOH-DONOU It is likely that other categories of spend for large enterprises could suffer from the focus and the spend on AI. F5, you know, we are pretty confident about where the spend is going to go because we are an enabler of AI as a company. If you think about all these AI workloads and large language models that are going to be deployed, they're going to need more traffic management capacity, and they're going to need more security."", 'Security is a huge issue for AI. And we have positioned ourselves to have unique value proposition to really secure all these AI workloads across all cloud environments. And therefore, we think from a category spend perspective, over time, we should be a beneficiary of investment in AI.', ""- And, Francois, I also want to get your take on kind of the broader competitive landscape. It's an issue you touched on during the call, Francois. You talked about how a few of your rivals have now gone through this kind of change of control, as you said. Maybe just kind of walk us through how the landscape is shifting."", 'FRANCOIS LOCOH-DONOU You know, the landscape is changing. You know, in our traditional application delivery market, we have had a couple of competitors, both in hardware and software, that have had a change of control. And their customer playbook has changed materially. And that contrasts with F5.', ""We have been investing in this category for many years. And we're just now releasing next-generation hardware and software that's very exciting to our customers because it brings the benefits of the public cloud to their on-prem, their data center environment. And so we're seeing a contrasting approach from us versus competitors that we think will benefit over time."", ""And then in the areas of security specifically, we have been really focused, Josh, on securing applications and APIs. We have competitors that look at a lot of areas of security. But we are absolutely focused on apps and APIs because we think that is where the value is. And we think that AI will accelerate the needs for more apps and APIs. And that's where we are focusing our competitor attention. And hopefully, we'll continue to deliver value for customers in these areas."", ""- Francois, it is always great to have you on the show talking about F5's earnings and what's ahead. Thank you so much, as always, for your time."", 'FRANCOIS LOCOH-DONOU Thank you so much.']"

With that, I will turn the call over to Francois.', ""Francois Locoh-Donou: Thank you, Suzanne, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. In my remarks today, I will speak to our Q1 highlights as well as our expectations for Q2. Frank will then review the details of our Q1 results and provide some additional color about our outlook. Q1 was our third consecutive quarter of stability with the quarter and individual deals playing out largely as expected. We are not yet hearing that customers' budgets are increasing but the more predictable spending patterns are encouraging. Our team delivered another solid quarter with consistent performance across our geographic theaters. We had a strong performance from our service provider vertical, which correlates to unusually strong perpetual license software revenue in the quarter."", ""This is likely less indicative of service provider trends overall and more of a reflection of F5's position in some key projects. We delivered Q1 revenue above the high end of our guidance range. In addition, our continued operating discipline enabled us to deliver non-GAAP operating margins of 35.5%. This is up more than 900 basis points from the year ago period. As a result of these factors and a modest tax benefit, we also delivered non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 39% with EPS of $3.43 per share, well above the high end of our guidance range. Our customers are still watching their budgets closely. As we look ahead, we are encouraged by several factors, including better predictability from customers, improving systems demand and the fact that some customers are making decisions that investments need to happen now."", ""We are cautiously optimistic that these factors signal an easing of the extreme customer spending caution that characterized last year. And in fact, we are seeing stronger underlying demand. Because of the backlog headwind we faced in FY '24, despite improving demand signals, we expect our Q2 revenue will be down low-single digits from Q2 of last year. Frank will discuss our outlook in greater detail in a few minutes. As little as five years ago, nearly every large enterprise organization expected that they would move their application environments from on-premises to the public cloud or SaaS. They also expected that doing so would dramatically simplify their operations and reduce costs. Instead today, customers are grappling with a more intricate and costly set of challenges than ever before."", 'In our most recent State of Application Strategy research, 88% of our customers report they are currently operating applications across on-premises and cloud environments. The same research found that 38% of organizations are hosting their applications in six different types of environments. The expanding number of applications across distributed environments demands specific expertise and tools for each environment, which adds cost and operational complexity. At the same time, this expanded landscape provides cybercriminals with more potential targets, amplifying security concerns. This complexity is further intensified by the rapid growth in the number of applications, a growth trajectory that is poised to accelerate significantly with the widespread adoption and proliferation of AI.', ""We firmly believe that F5 is strategically positioned to support our customers as they navigate these escalating challenges across a rapidly evolving landscape. Our innovation and product portfolio evolution over the last several years has been aimed at addressing exactly these challenges. Before I pass the call to Frank, I will speak to some customer highlights from the quarter. Our F5 BIG-IP family serves traditional applications either on-premises, co-located or in cloud environments. BIG-IP's data plane performance, automation capabilities and seamless integration into public cloud environments continues to differentiate it from competitors. Our commitment to innovation and to providing customer flexibility through a range of consumption models also has enabled us to continue to gain share in the traditional ADC space."", ""BIG-IP's capabilities drove a significant win in Q1 with a North American service provider. The customer is now deploying F5 cloud-native software at scale in its 5G architecture. Over the last five years, we have invested to modernize BIG-IP and to deliver industry leading container native functions to scale and secure 5G cloud infrastructures. These investments made this win possible. Modern F5 BIG-IP software is now powering the growth from this provider's consumer 5G handset demand and securing its overall fixed wireless access offerings, the fastest growing 5G service in North America. Turning to F5 NGINX, which serves modern container-native and microservices-based applications and APIs. We continue to see large enterprises adopt NGINX for their cloud and Kubernetes-based applications."", 'As those applications scale, we are seeing our NGINX opportunity scale as well. In addition, customers are also leveraging NGINX for app layer security for containers. In Q1, an APAC-based auto manufacturer selected NGINX Plus with App Protect to power and protect its next-generation connected car data and service offering. Beyond the standard car-related maintenance information, the customer is empowering a range of vehicle related services from traffic management and statistics to fleet management and automated insurance claims. The customer envisions providing rich data enabled services, including traffic data to government agencies for road maintenance and enabling automated insurance claim filing using telemetry and location data. The customer selected NGINX for this ambitious project because of its unique ability to implement WAF for containers on AWS as well as its ability to support specific requirements that could not be met by native cloud services.', ""F5 Distributed Cloud Services is a portfolio of SaaS and managed services which we have built from a combination of organic and inorganic efforts. The platform will have its second birthday shortly and continues to gain traction with customers as a result of its flexibility and strong capabilities. We are intercepting two exciting growth categories with Distributed Cloud, Webapp and API Protection, or WAAP, and the emerging opportunity in secure multi-cloud networking. In fact, we have seen explosive growth in the number of attacks blocked by Distributor Cloud's WAAP capabilities with a number of blocked attacks growing more than 100% in Q1 from Q4. In one WAAP win from the quarter, a large U.S. based financial institution selected F5 Distributed Cloud Services to solve its challenge of application security in hybrid cloud."", 'The customer leveraged our flexible consumption program, adding API discovery and protection to manage the many fintech aggregator applications that access their financial data through APIs. F5 Distributed Cloud Services is also gaining traction in API security. In just the last 12 months, we have observed a substantial increase in the volume of API attacks. 95% of customers surveyed for our State of Application Strategy report say they have deployed an API gateway. This is a significant increase from 2019 when only 35% have deployed one. In fact, 92% of the total attacks mitigated by Distributed Cloud in Q1 were targeted towards APIs, that is up from 73% in Q4. As an example of an API security win in Q1, following multiple service impacting outages, a service provider in our APAC region selected Distributed Cloud to replace their prior API security vendor.', ""Distributed Cloud's multi-cloud networking capabilities are making it possible for the customer to switch between public clouds when necessary while providing visibility and reporting via a single pane of glass. F5 Distributed Cloud Services is also gaining traction in secure multi-cloud networking use cases. In another example from Q1, a global provider of traditional and digital learning resources deployed Distributed Cloud Services. The customer was looking for consistent application-level security, multi-cloud scalability and networking. Distributed Cloud enable them to simplify their infrastructure, strengthen the management of their multi-cloud architecture and improve application security. They also deployed multiple F5 customer edge software instances in their cloud infrastructure and in their on-premises data center, enabling them to meet an aggressive cloud migration schedule."", 'I will spend just a 2 minutes talking about the opportunity we see emerging with AI applications. AI will accelerate the growth in the number of applications and APIs. We are seeing the start of this already in the form of AI models and new AI-driven services becoming available from start-ups and established tech companies alike. We expect that as enterprises ramp adoption of AI over the next one to two years, that adoption will bring with it a flood of new enterprise applications that leverage those AI models and the APIs of the new AI-driven services. These AI-powered applications differ from typical applications in several important ways: first, they are API-driven, both in terms of leveraging the APIs of third-party AI models and services and also in terms of exposing their own capabilities as APIs for downstream use.', 'Thus, API security for these AI-powered apps is critical. Customers tell us that API security is the top security service in used or planned for use to protect the integrity of AI and machine learning models. Customers also tell us that AI is driving demand for a comprehensive API security solution, inclusive of DDoS protection, bot detection and data masking and leak protection. Second, AI-powered applications tend to be comprised of many different components and data sources, which are distributed across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. F5 is an AI enabler. Effectively optimizing, managing and securing AI applications and the APIs that connect them demands a blend of specialized expertise and capabilities that align seamlessly with our solutions portfolio.', ""We are the application and API expert with a deep understanding of the needs of demanding applications built over decades. This expertise and the capabilities of F5 Distributed Cloud Services is a powerful combination, particularly as customers begin to deploy real-life AI use cases. During Q1, we secured a win that highlights the synergies of our product families and showcases how F5 supports and enables AI-driven use cases. An EMEA-based service provider selected the combination of F5 Distributed Cloud Services and BIG-IP to secure and deliver a first-of-its-kind AI-as-a-service offering for their B2B customers. After comparing F5's capabilities to alternatives, the customer determined only F5 can meet the security and scalability requirements needed to deliver their offering in a cost efficient way."", 'These real-life use cases offer a view to how we are enabling customers to secure, deliver and optimize their applications and APIs and how we simplify the challenges of operating in a complex hybrid multi-cloud world. Now I will turn the call to Frank. Frank?', ""Frank Pelzer: Thank you, Francois, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our Q1 results before I elaborate on our Q2 outlook. We delivered Q1 revenue of $693 million, reflecting sales that were down 1% year-over-year with a mix of 56% global services and 44% product revenue. Global services revenue of $387 million grew a strong 7% due to continued high maintenance renewals as well as the continued benefit from price increases we introduced in FY '22. Product revenue totaled $306 million, down 10% year-over-year. Systems revenue of $135 million declined 22% year-over-year, reflecting a lower level of backlog-related shipments than we had in the year ago period. Software revenue grew 2% over the year ago period to $170 million."", ""As Francois noted, Q1 was an unusually strong perpetual software license quarter with several service providers opting to leverage CapEx versus OpEx models. Our perpetual software revenue was $46 million in Q1, representing 19% growth year-over-year and 27% of Q1 software revenue. We believe providing consumption model flexibility to our customers is a strategic advantage over competitors who restrict customer choice. The result can be quarters like this one, where we have unusual growth in perpetual software revenue. We do not believe that Q1 software revenue mix is indicative of changing customer preferences. Rather, it is a function of preferences of specific customers in the quarter. Our subscription-based revenue declined 3% year-over-year to $125 million, representing 73% of Q1's total software revenue."", ""New subscriptions and renewals both performed to plan in the quarter. Revenue from recurring sources contributed 73% of Q1's revenue, up from 68% a year ago. This is down slightly from recent levels as a result of the perpetual license revenue contribution in the quarter. Recurring revenue includes subscription-based revenue as well as the maintenance portion of our services revenue. On a regional basis, revenue from Americas was down 6% year-over-year, representing 54% of total revenue. EMEA grew 5%, representing 28% of revenue, and APAC grew 8%, representing 18% of revenue. Looking at our major verticals. During Q1, enterprise represented 64% of product bookings, service providers represented 17%, and government customers represented 19%, including 4% from U.S. federal."", ""Our Q1 operating results were strong, reflecting our continued operating discipline. GAAP gross margin was 80.3%, non-GAAP gross margin was 83.1%, an improvement of 264 basis points from Q1 of FY '23. GAAP operating expenses were $392 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $330 million. Our GAAP operating margin was 23.8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 35.5%, an improvement of more than 900 basis points from Q1 of FY '23. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.7%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19.9%. This is below our initial expectations for the year as a result of IRS guidance issued during the quarter relating to foreign tax credits. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $138 million or $2.32 per share. Our non-GAAP net income was $205 million or $3.43 per share, well above the top end of our guidance range."", 'This is a result of the revenue beat, continued operating discipline with $0.09 as a result of the Q1 tax benefit. I will now turn to cash flow and the balance sheet, which also remain very strong. We generated $165 million in cash flow from operations in Q1. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $9 million. DSO for the quarter was 67 days due to the back end linearity of invoicing in the quarter. Cash and investments totaled approximately $832 million at quarter end. Deferred revenue increased 4% year-over-year to $1.83 billion. Our share repurchases reflect our ongoing commitment to returning cash to shareholders. We repurchased $150 million worth of F5 shares in Q1 at an average price of $163 per share. Finally, we ended the quarter with approximately 6,440 employees.', ""Francois outlined our Q2 outlook at the start of the call. I'll recap it with some additional color. We expect Q2 revenue in the range of $675 million to $695 million. We expect gross margins in the range of 82% to 83%. We estimate Q2 operating expenses of $347 million to $359 million. This is a step-up from Q1, reflecting our seasonal sequential uptick related to the reset and payroll taxes. This year, it also reflects marketing expenses related to our global App World customer events, which will take place in Q2 in San Jose and in other locations across the globe. We are targeting Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.79 to $2.91 per share. We expect Q2 share-based compensation expense of approximately $56 million to $58 million. At this point in the fiscal year, we are not revising our revenue or operating margin targets for FY '24."", ""We continue to expect to achieve our FY '24 operating margin target range of 33% to 34%, which accounts for the normal seasonal step-up in operating expenses from Q1 to Q2. We now expect our FY '24 tax rate will be in the range of 21% to 22%, down slightly from our prior range of 21% to 23%. Given the new outlook in our annual tax rate, we now expect FY '24 non-GAAP EPS will grow between 6% to 8%. This is up from the 5% to 7% range we provided last quarter. I will now turn the call back over to François. François?"", 'Francois Locoh-Donou: Thank you, Frank. In conclusion, I will reiterate that F5 is the only company capable of securing, delivering and optimizing any application, any API regardless of its location, be it in the data center, any one of the public clouds, as SaaS, or at the network edge. Amidst a complex web of environments and solutions, F5 empowers customers to establish and maintain a consistent security posture across all of their applications, enhancing security, streamlining operations and reducing costs. Moreover, we are unifying our solutions to provide customers with unprecedented levels of visibility, manageability and automation. Before we go to questions, I will elaborate on the strategy and product session we are hosting next Thursday.', 'We are going to use this event to discuss the hybrid multi-cloud challenges faced by large organizations worldwide including the implications of AI on applications, APIs and security.

Operating results excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations are calculated by translating the current period’s results by the prior period’s exchange rates.', ""Restructuring programs: In the fourth quarter of 2023, following the closing of the Adenza acquisition, our management approved, committed to and initiated a restructuring program, “Adenza Restructuring” to optimize our efficiencies as a combined organization. In connection with this program, we expect to incur pre-tax charges principally related to employee-related costs, contract terminations, real estate impairments and other related costs. We expect to achieve benefits primarily in the form of expense and revenue synergies. In October 2022, following our September announcement to realign our segments and leadership, we initiated a divisional alignment program with a focus on realizing the full potential of this structure. In connection with the program, we expect to incur pre-tax charges principally related to employee-related costs, consulting, asset impairments and contract terminations over a two-year period. We expect to achieve benefits in the form of both increased customer engagement and operating efficiencies. Costs related to the Adenza restructuring and the divisional alignment programs will be recorded as “restructuring” in our consolidated statements of income. We will exclude charges associated with this program for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures as they are not reflective of ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Nasdaq's performance between periods."", 'CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS', 'Information set forth in this communication contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly, Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky."", 'Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.', ' View our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive ', 'The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Colgate-Palmolive had US$8.55b in debt in December 2023; about the same as the year before. On the flip side, it has US$1.15b in cash leading to net debt of about US$7.40b.', 'The latest balance sheet data shows that Colgate-Palmolive had liabilities of US$4.41b due within a year, and liabilities of US$11.0b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$1.15b in cash and US$1.59b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$12.7b.', ""Given Colgate-Palmolive has a humongous market capitalization of US$69.1b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time."", ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses."", ""We'd say that Colgate-Palmolive's moderate net debt to EBITDA ratio ( being 1.6), indicates prudence when it comes to debt. And its strong interest cover of 16.9 times, makes us even more comfortable. The good news is that Colgate-Palmolive has increased its EBIT by 8.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Colgate-Palmolive can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", ""Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Colgate-Palmolive recorded free cash flow worth 67% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate."", ""The good news is that Colgate-Palmolive's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And the good news does not stop there, as its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow also supports that impression! When we consider the range of factors above, it looks like Colgate-Palmolive is pretty sensible with its use of debt. While that brings some risk, it can also enhance returns for shareholders. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Colgate-Palmolive , and understanding them should be part of your investment process."", ""At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

Measures', 'Juniper Networks believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial information provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the company’s financial condition and results of operations.', 'This press release, including the tables above, includes the following non-GAAP financial measures derived from our Preliminary Consolidated Statements of Operations: operating income; operating margin; net income; and diluted net income per share. These measures are not presented in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for GAAP. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the table above should not be considered in isolation from measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. Certain of the adjustments to our GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future.', 'We utilize a number of different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, in analyzing and assessing the overall performance of our business, in making operating decisions, forecasting and planning for future periods, and determining payments under compensation programs. We consider the use of the non-GAAP measures presented above to be helpful in assessing the performance of the continuing operation of our business. By continuing operation, we mean the ongoing revenue and expenses of the business, excluding certain items that render comparisons with prior periods or analysis of on-going operating trends more difficult, such as expenses not directly related to the actual cash costs of development, sale, delivery or support of our products and services, or expenses that are reflected in periods unrelated to when the actual amounts were incurred or paid. Consistent with this approach, we believe that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the readers of our financial statements provides such readers with useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, allows for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance. In addition, we have historically reported non-GAAP results to the investment community and believe that continuing to provide non-GAAP measures provides investors with a tool for comparing results over time. In assessing the overall health of our business for the periods covered by the table above and, in particular, in evaluating the financial line items presented in the table above, we have excluded items in the following three general categories, each of which are described below: Acquisition Related Charges, Other Items, and Share-Based Compensation Related Items. We also provide additional detail below regarding the shares used to calculate our non-GAAP net income per share. Notes identified for line items in the table above correspond to the appropriate note description below.', 'The above tables and reconciliations can also be found on our Investor Relations website at http://investor.juniper.net.', 'Note A: Acquisition Related Charges. We exclude certain expense items resulting from acquisitions including amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. The amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with acquisitions results in recording expenses in our GAAP financial statements that were already expensed by the acquired company before the acquisition and for which we have not expended cash. Moreover, had we internally developed the products acquired, the amortization of intangible assets, and the expenses of uncompleted research and development would have been expensed in prior periods. Accordingly, we analyze the performance of our operations in each period without regard to such expenses. In addition, acquisitions result in non-continuing operating expenses, which would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our business operations. We believe that providing non-GAAP information for acquisition-related expense items in addition to the corresponding GAAP information allows the users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historic and current results of our continuing operations, and also facilitates comparisons to less acquisitive peer companies.', 'Note B: Other Items. We exclude certain other items that are the result of either unique, infrequent or unplanned events, including the following, when applicable: (i) strategic investment-related gain or loss, including gain or loss from our equity method investment and our privately-held investments; (ii) legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits; (iii) gain or loss on significant isolated events or transactions, including divestitures and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which are directly related to the events, objectively quantifiable, and not expected to occur regularly in the future that are not indicative of our core operating results; (iv) legal and advisory fees incurred to effect the acquisition by HPE; (v) significant effects of tax legislation and judicial or administrative interpretation of tax regulations, including the impact of income tax reform; (vi) recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits that are non-recurring in nature; and (vii) the income tax effect on our financial statements of excluding items related to our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, the non-GAAP results exclude the effects of NQDC-related investments. It is difficult to estimate the amount or timing of these items in advance. Although these events are reflected in our GAAP financial statements, these transactions may limit the comparability of our on-going operations with prior and future periods.', 'In addition, we exclude restructuring benefits or charges as these result from events that arise from unforeseen circumstances, which often occur outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations. As such, we believe these expenses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred or comparisons to past operating results. We also exclude gains or losses related to strategic investments as well as significant isolated events as they are directly related to an event that is distinct and does not reflect current ongoing business operations. In the case of legal reserves and settlements, these gains or losses are recorded in the period in which the matter is concluded or resolved even though the subject matter of the underlying dispute may relate to multiple or different periods. As such, we believe that these expenses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing operations for the period in which they are incurred. Additionally, we exclude previously unrecognized tax benefits that are non-recurring in nature which are recorded in the period in which applicable statutes of limitation lapse or upon the completion of tax review cycles as the tax matter may relate to multiple or different periods. Further, certain items related to global tax reform may continue to impact the business and are generally unrelated to the current level of business activity. We believe these tax events limit the comparability with prior periods and that these expenses or benefits do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred. We also believe providing financial information with and without the income tax effect of excluding items related to our non-GAAP financial measures provide our management and users of the financial statements with better clarity regarding the on-going performance and future liquidity of our business. Because of these factors, we assess our operating performance with these amounts both included and excluded, and by providing this information, we believe the users of our financial statements are better able to understand the financial results of what we consider our continuing operations.', 'Note C: Share-Based Compensation Related Items. We provide non-GAAP information relative to our expense for share-based compensation and related payroll tax. Due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types, which affect the calculations of share-based compensation, we believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation and related payroll tax allows for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to our peer companies and is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation on our results of operations. Further, expense associated with granting share-based awards does not reflect any cash expenditures by the company as no cash is expended.', 'Note D: Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share Items. We provide diluted non-GAAP net income per share. The diluted non-GAAP net income per share includes additional dilution from potential issuance of common stock, except when such issuances would be anti-dilutive.', '\xa0', 'Juniper Networks, Inc.',

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), which doesn't pay any dividends, posted a gain of 176% during the same period."", 'Oracle impressed investors with the expansion of its cloud ecosystem and big buybacks. However, its market cap of $316 billion still makes it a lot smaller than Alphabet, which is now worth $1.91 trillion. So could Oracle follow Alphabet into the 12-zero club and eclipse its market cap by the end of the decade?', ""Oracle is the world's largest database-software company. Over the past decade, it gradually transformed its on-premise database software into cloud-based services, which were easier to scale and locked in its clients with sticky subscriptions."", 'That transformation was driven by a long list of acquisitions, including the cloud-software giant NetSuite in 2016 and the healthcare IT services leader Cerner in 2022. It expanded that cloud-based ecosystem with its new enterprise-resource planning (ERP) services and its own Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) platform.', ""From fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last May), Oracle's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5%. That growth rate might seem sluggish, but it represented a significant acceleration from its CAGR of 1% from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2018. That acceleration was driven by the growth of its software as a service (SaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) businesses, which collectively generated 37% of its revenue in its latest quarter."", ""As Oracle's revenue growth accelerated, it repatriated a lot of its overseas cash and bought back a fifth of its shares over the past five years. As a result, its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew at a CAGR of 10% from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2023."", ""Oracle's slow but steady growth made it an appealing stock to own as the market was rattled by the pandemic, inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical conflicts over the past five years. Analysts expect its revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 8% and 23%, respectively, from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026 as the macroenvironment improves."", ""Oracle currently trades at 29 times forward earnings. If it maintains that multiple, matches analysts' expectations through fiscal 2026, and continues to grow its EPS at a reasonable CAGR of 15% from fiscal 2026 to 2030, its stock could be trading at about $290 per share with a market cap of $800 billion by the beginning of the final year."", 'That would represent a respectable gain of 150% from its current price, but it would still be less than half the size of Alphabet today.

In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 20.13% and 22.79%, respectively.', ""Investors should also take note of MU's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, MU is averaging 13,605,398 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', 'The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well.

From toys and games to television programming, motion pictures, and a licensing program, Hasbro reaches customers by leveraging its well-known brands such as Transformers, Nerf, and Magic: The Gathering. Ownership stakes in Discovery Family, which offers programming around Hasbro brands, and production capabilities (some of which are set to be divested) from Entertainment One helped bolster Hasbro's multichannel presence. The firm acquired EOne in 2019, bolting on popular family properties like Peppa Pig and PJ Masks, and tied up with Dungeons & Dragons Beyond in 2022, offering the firm access to 10 million digital tabletop players."", 'Hasbro Inc has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1986.

Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate increased to 4.20% per year.

The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-09-30, Hasbro Inc's dividend payout ratio is 0.85, which may suggest that the company's dividend may not be sustainable."", ""Hasbro Inc's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers.

The company has reported positive net income for each of year over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability."", ""To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Hasbro Inc's growth rank of 8 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors."", ""Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Hasbro Inc's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. Hasbro Inc's revenue has increased by approximately 4.70% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 63.66% of global competitors."", ""The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Hasbro Inc's earnings increased by approximately -26.90% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 19.14% of global competitors."", ""Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of -4.30%, which outperforms approximately 36.1% of global competitors."", ""In conclusion, Hasbro Inc's consistent dividend payments and status as a dividend achiever highlight its commitment to shareholder returns. However, the high payout ratio may raise questions about the long-term sustainability of these dividends. Despite this, Hasbro Inc's strong profitability and good growth metrics provide some reassurance about its financial health. As the company navigates through industry trends and strategic initiatives, investors should monitor these factors closely. Is Hasbro Inc's dividend policy sustainable in the long run given its current financials? This remains an essential question for value investors considering adding HAS to their portfolios."", 'GuruFocus Premium users can screen for high-dividend yield stocks using the High Dividend Yield Screener.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

If you want to skip our coverage of the latest stock market news and the current economic environment, then you can take a look at the 5 Stocks with Potential to Explode. ', ""As investors and markets make a slow start to 2024, the main question on everyone's mind is how far can markets go this year. 2023 was a topsy turvy ride that saw major indexes continuously fluctuate in response to the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. At the same time, the mega cap technology sector continued to perform well amidst optimistic estimates for A.I., and the U.S. economy did not tip into a recession. As a whole, 2023 was better than what many might have expected to lay in store at the start of the year, and now, it's time to take stock of expectations for 2024."", 'Talking about stocks, several investment banks and research firms are out with their predictions for the flagship S&P 500 index\'s performance in 2024. These predictions range from optimistic to cautious, and the analyst opinions range from believing 2024 to be an ""average"" year to increasing year end targets. Starting from the cautious one first, this voice belongs to Michael Wilson of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). The analyst outlines three scenarios for the market this year, and links all of them to the economy. Starting from best to worst, these assume a soft landing with accelerating growth, a standard soft landing, and a recession. To position a portfolio for the latter two scenarios, the investment bank outlines that a combination of defensive stocks and cyclical stocks can do well for a soft landing. For a recession, defensive stocks only can be a fruitful endeavor.', ""While Morgan Stanley is urging caution, others are far more optimistic. One such voice is from the teams at UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS). The UBS analysts set the S&P 500's highest year end target for 2024 in mid January, as they shared that the index can close at a level of 5,150 points. This marked an upgrade from their earlier estimate of 4,850, placing the firm firmly in the market camp that believes that interest rates will significantly reduce this year. This optimism is also met by teams at The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) and RBC Capital. Starting from RBC, like UBS, it also started the year by upgrading estimates for the S&P 500. These estimates now match the ones from UBS, and also mark an upgrade over RBC's previous value of 5,000 points. However, RBC's Lori Calvasina raised the firm's year end target for the S&P 500 to 5,150 earlier this month, and Calvasina added that when compared to RBC's 5,000 target in November that reflected a 10% gain from levels at that time, the new target is actually more conservative as it prices in an 8% appreciation."", 'Finally, one bank whose predictions in 2022 stood the test of time in 2023 is Goldman Sachs. While several big players on Wall Street were all doom and gloom in 2022 about the prospects of the U.S. economy, Goldman Sachs bucked the trend and wagered that if all went well, then the U.S. economy could very well avoid a recession. The topic of a recession is complex in itself when we consider the current monetary policy environment as the Federal Reserve has rapidly hiked interest rates to cull inflation and wages. A weakening economy increases the pressure on the Fed to cut rates and stimulate growth; however, if the economy is robust, then the central bank can feel comfortable knowing that its policies are not causing damage to businesses.', ""With this in mind, Goldman Sachs's latest prediction about America's economic future is in line with its previous sentiment. In a note released mid January, analysts upgraded their growth forecasts to predict 2.3% in GDP growth for the U.S. in 2024. The economic boost came roughly a month after Goldman had increased its S&P 500 forecast for 2024 to 5,100 points - just 50 points shy of estimates from RBC and UBS. One can speculate that perhaps robust economic growth is behind the 50 point divergence as it could mean that higher for longer rates prevent the stock market from fully spreading its wings this year."", 'So, as the economic and stock market tea leaves start to orient themselves for another 12 months, we decided to see if any stocks have the potential to explode.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$8.84b', 'US$9.80b', 'US$10.4b', 'US$11.4b', 'US$12.1b', 'US$12.7b', 'US$13.2b', 'US$13.6b', 'US$14.1b', 'US$14.5b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x8', 'Analyst x4', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ 6.10%', 'Est @ 4.93%', 'Est @ 4.12%', 'Est @ 3.55%', 'Est @ 3.15%', 'Est @ 2.87%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3% ', 'US$8.2k', 'US$8.4k', 'US$8.2k', 'US$8.2k', 'US$8.1k', 'US$7.8k', 'US$7.5k', 'US$7.2k', 'US$6.8k', 'US$6.5k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$77b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth.

Given that we are looking at McDonald's as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.225. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

That size is important to keep in mind as you look at its long-term business opportunity. Of late, however, investors have been more focused on the short term. Here's why you may want to dig deeper."", 'Supply chain problems related to the coronavirus pandemic caused investors to rush into the warehouse market. As the leader of this REIT sector, Prologis was a big beneficiary. The story is pretty simple. With more people stuck at home, online shopping grew quickly. Companies needed more warehouse space to accommodate those sales. On top of that, supply chain snarls caused by the pandemic resulted in companies holding higher levels of inventory than normal. Again, a need for more warehouse space was the end result.', ""Increased demand resulted in rising rental rates. The numbers are kind of shocking. For example, in the third quarter of 2023 Prologis was able to increase rents by a whopping 74% on expiring leases, which was actually down sequentially from the second quarter. As you might expect, big rent hikes are good for business. All of the REIT's leases don't expire at the same time, so the benefit has been ongoing and is likely to continue for a while longer."", ""Early on, Wall Street was very excited about this story and pushed Prologis's share sharply higher. And then reality seems to have set in that this situation wouldn't last forever. The stock has since fallen back down to earth, though it remains well above where it started out in 2020."", ""Here's the thing: Rent hikes are only one avenue for growth that Prologis has to offer investors."", ""This brings the story back to Prologis's size, which its enormous market cap highlights. The most obvious growth path was put on display in 2022, when Prologis agreed to pay $26 billion to buy rival Duke Realty. That's a big chunk of change, but given Prologis's size it was a manageable transaction. It's highly likely that no other REIT could have pulled off that deal. Being an industry consolidator is a key growth path, as indicated by Prologis's follow-up purchase of a large property portfolio from alternative investment manager Blackstone."", ""But there's something of a hidden gem waiting to be taken advantage of within Prologis' globally diversified portfolio. Here are the numbers. In North America the REIT owns 803 million square feet of space across 3,877 buildings and 7,885 acres of undeveloped land. In South America the numbers are 83 million square feet across 341 buildings and 1,960 acres of undeveloped land. In Europe the REIT owns 242 million square feet across 1,112 buildings and has 2,157 acres of undeveloped land. And in Asia, Prologis operates 114 million square feet of warehouse space across 283 buildings and owns 89 acres of undeveloped land."", ""The takeaway is that it owns a massive portfolio of working properties in key transportation hubs. And, right in the same areas, it has land that it can develop if demand for property merits the investment. Prologis estimates that this land could be a $40 billion investment opportunity, which is even bigger than the Duke deal. Clearly, that won't all happen at one time. But that's actually good news, since it suggests that there are years of growth ahead for Prologis even after the benefit from rent increases dwindles."", ""It is likely that Wall Street got ahead of itself with Prologis coming out of the pandemic disruptions. But investors looking at the REIT today need to think long-term. Yes, the benefit of rolling over expiring leases to higher rates will eventually peter out. But the company's ability to act as an industry consolidator and its massive portfolio of vacant land suggest that there are other powerful growth drivers here. With the 2.7% dividend yield still near its highest levels in five years, growth and income investors should probably give Prologis a second look."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Prologis right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Prologis, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Prologis wasn't one of them.

386,db6a9149-4730-372c-96ed-49bb8d669bd6,PCAR,2024-01-31,Paccar Is Reaching New Highs With Best-in-Class Operating Performance,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paccar-reaching-highs-best-class-130111065.html,1706706071,STORY,['PCAR'],"[""Paccar Inc. (NASDAQ:PCAR) announced robust fourth-quarter operating results on Jan. 23, surpassing analysts' expectations. Over the past year, its share price has surged by approximately 37%, surpassing $99.60 per share at the time of writing and outperforming the S&P 500's return of 20.67%. After the stock achieved all-time highs, I estimate it is fairly valued."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Sign with PCAR.', 'The company operates as a global designer, manufacturer and distributor of a diverse range of commercial trucks. It is structured into three primary business segments: Trucks, Parts and Financial Services. The Trucks segment is the largest revenue contributor, generating $21.5 billion, which accounted for 74.60% of the total revenue in 2022. The Parts segment follows closely behind, delivering $5.8 billion in revenue and representing 20% of total sales. The Financial Services segment constitutes the smallest part of the business with revenue of $1.5 billion, or 5.20% of total sales for 2022.', ""The Financial Services segment is the most profitable, with a pre-tax margin exceeding 39%. This success is attributed to the company's robust finance and leasing portfolio, which includes 233,000 trucks and retailers and boasts over $21 billion in assets. The Parts segment, known for distributing aftermarket parts via a vast global network of more than 2,300 dealerships, ranked second in profitability, with a pre-tax margin of 24.90%. Despite generating the most revenue, the Trucks segment is the least profitable, with a pre-tax margin of just 8.80%."", ""As a key player in the commercial truck industry, Paccar's business is closely linked to economic conditions. When the economic outlook is negative, there tends to be a decline in demand for its products. In contrast, a positive economic outlook can significantly boost truck demand, increasing the company's sales. Despite the cyclical nature of its business, PAaccar has demonstrated the growing trend in revenue and operating profit over the years. Over the past two decades, its revenue has seen an upward trajectory, rising from $7.22 billion in 2002 to $35.10 billion in 2023. Similarly, its operating income has increased from $794.20 million to approximately $5.95 billion within the same timeframe."", 'Since 2002, Paccar has recorded sales declines in only five years, notably during the global recession from 2007 to 2009, in 2016 and during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Reflecting these challenging periods, operating income also declined. Post-2020, however, the company has seen a remarkable recovery, with revenue and operating income increasing by 87.4% and 278.7%, respectively.', ""Paccar stands out as a top performer in the commercial truck industry, boasting the highest margins and superior operating efficiency. This success is primarily attributed to the company's adoption of lean manufacturing and Six Sigma principles in its production and operations. Compared to its competitors, including Volvo (VLVLY), Daimler Truck (DTGHF), Traton (TRATF) and Iveco (IVCGF), Paccar has demonstrated effective cost management. As a percentage of revenue, its selling, general and administrative expenses have consistently been the lowest, fluctuating between 2% and 3%. This starkly contrasts to its peers, where SG&A expenses consume a larger portion of revenue. Volvo and Iveco's SG&A expenses hover around 6%, Daimler Truck's are approximately 9% and Traton has the highest with nearly 11% of revenue for SG&A. This comparison highlights Paccar's efficiency in managing its overhead costs relative to its industry counterparts."", ""Source: Paccar's presentation"", ""Moreover, the company distinguishes itself from competitors with an exceptionally high inventory turnover rate of 12 times. This rate is significantly higher than its peers, who generally report inventory turnovers in the range of 4 to 7 times. This disparity not only underscores PACCAR's operational efficiency, but also implies a competitive edge in reducing holding costs and enhancing responsiveness to evolving market trends and shifting customer preferences."", ""Source: Paccar's presentation"", ""With growing revenue, effective cost management and high inventory turnover, Paccar has consistently outperformed its peers in terms of profit margin over the past decade. Notably, after the Covid-19 pandemic, the company's profit margin significantly increased, reaching 13% in 2023. This figure notably surpasses that of Volvo and Daimler Truck, which both approximately achieved a 6% profit margin. Among these five companies, Traton and Iveco have the lowest margins at 3% and just over 1%, respectively."", ""Source: Paccar's presentation"", ""Paccar has a long tradition of rewarding its shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks. The company boasts a remarkable track record of 85 consecutive years of profitability and has consistently paid dividends since 1941 without interruption. Its history of returning cash to shareholders, encompassing both dividends and share buybacks, has seen fluctuations but demonstrates a compound annual growth rate of 12%. Notably, its dividend's 10-year annualized growth rate has reached 7%. In 2023, Paccar declared a dividend of $4.24 per share, which included an additional cash dividend of $3.20 per share. At the current share price of $101 per share, shareholders are getting decent dividend yield at 4.20%."", ""Investors are also notably impressed by Paccar's exceptional return on invested capital. Over the past five years, the company has maintained an average return on invested capital of 22%. In 2023, its ROIC impressively rose to 37.8%, significantly outperforming its competitors. Volvo's ROIC stood at 17%, Daimler Truck's was around 10%, while Traton and Iveco both hovered at nearly 4%."", ""Source: Paccar's presentation"", ""Let's calculate Paccar's intrinsic value per share using the two-stage dividend discount model. Assuming the company continues to increase its dividend payments by 7% annually for the next five years, similar to its annual dividend growth rate over the past 10 years, the dividend growth rate would decelerate to 3% afterward. By applying a discount rate of 8%, Paccar's intrinsic value can be determined as follows:"", ""Source: Author's table"", 'By applying the dividend discount model, the estimated intrinsic value of Paccar is approximately $98 per share. This is close to its current trading price of $101 per share. Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that the company is reasonably valued at its current market price.', ""Paccar can be considered a solid investment, combining strong financial results, operational efficiency and a consistent commitment to shareholder value. The company's resilience in economic cycles, coupled with its top performance in the commercial truck industry, is reflected in its current valuation. Paccar represents a balanced investment opportunity in the commercial trucking sector, marked by stability and the potential for sustained success."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Sir, the floor is yours.', 'PJ Guido', ""Good morning and welcome to the UPS Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO; Brian Newman, our CFO; and a few additional members of our executive leadership team. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which are described in our 2022 Form 10-K and other reports we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission.These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC.

Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. (Operator Instructions). And now I'll turn the call over to Carol."", 'Carol B. Tome', ""Thank you, PJ and good morning. Let me begin by thanking UPSers for their hard work and effort. I'm proud of our team for their commitment to customer service and for once again making UPS the industry leader in on-time performance, not only during peak but throughout 2023. Looking at our volume trends for the fourth quarter. While total average daily volume or ADV declined 7.5% from last year, our performance was a marked improvement from what we reported in the third quarter. During the fourth quarter, our salespeople did an outstanding job of winning back diverted volume and pulling through new volume. In fact, U.S. domestic ADV surged 30% from the third quarter to the fourth, which was our highest sequential volume ramp ever.By the end of December, we had won back and pulled through nearly 60% of the volume diverted during our labor negotiation. Winning back and winning new volume is part of a program we call Project Brown. And this program will continue into 2024. You will recall that at the end of the third quarter, we provided a range of expected revenue and operating profit for the fourth quarter. Looking at our fourth quarter results versus last year, consolidated revenue declined 7.8% to $24.9 billion, which was slightly below the low end of our expectation. Operating profit was $2.8 billion. A decrease of 27.1% from last year but slightly higher than the low end of our expectations. As a result, our consolidated operating margin was 11.2%, which was well within our expectation.For the year, consolidated revenue was $91 billion, a decrease of 9.3%. Consolidated operating profit totaled $9.9 billion, 28.7% lower than last year and consolidated operating margin was 10.9%. We generated $5.3 billion in free cash flow during 2023 and we returned $7.6 billion to share owners in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Brian will provide more detail about our financial results in a moment. 2023 was a unique and quite candidly, a difficult and disappointing year. We experienced declines in volume, revenue and operating profit in all 3 of our business segments. Some of this performance was due to the macro environment and some of it was due to the disruption associated with our labor contract negotiations as well as higher costs associated with the new contract. Through the year, however, we controlled what we could control. And in many areas, we delivered the highest productivity results in our company history.And I think most importantly, we stayed on our strategy of Customer First, People Led and Innovation Driven. Let me share a few examples of how our strategy is establishing a foundation for future growth. Starting with Customer First. In 2023, our healthcare portfolio achieved our target of $10 billion in revenue. Here, we've made strong progress towards our goal of becoming the #1 complex healthcare provider, in the growing $130 billion global healthcare logistics market. Our global network of healthcare-compliant distribution space topped 17 million square feet in 2023. And our acquisitions of Bomi Group and MNX Global Logistics have expanded our call chain capabilities and are enabling us to reach new markets and customers.To support growth in our international small package business, in December, we announced plans to build a new air hub at Hong Kong International Airport. This new air hub supports our plans to grow in the best parts of the market, including highly profitable Asia trade lines and will enable us to expand our export and import business in the region. During the year, we continued to grow our SMB penetration. In 2023, SMBs made up 28.6% of our total U.S. volume, an increase of 60 basis points from last year. Part of this growth came from DAP, our digital access program. DAP has transformed how small companies do business with UPS. And in 2023, we generated $2.9 billion in DAP revenue, an increase of 22% year-over-year.Moving to People Led. In 2023, we delivered a labor agreement that provides certainty for the next 5 years. And because I'm a big believer in the power of 1 UPS, this year, we are returning to a policy of everyone back in the office 5 days a week. In terms of our culture, we are a network company, not just of logistics capabilities but of personal relationships too, which brings me to Innovation Driven. On our busiest peak days, we sort over 50 million packages in the U.S. and deliver more than 30 million packages worldwide. How do we do it? By leveraging the agility of our integrated network, powered by UPS technology and the skills of our engineers and operating team. Our network planning tools enabled us to quickly match capacity with volume across the network and drive productivity. Technology also enabled improvements to driver and helper route planning and dispatch, resulting in improvements in density and fewer seasonal support drivers than in prior years.It might surprise you to learn that we typically see an increase in returns volume before Christmas. In the fourth quarter, we moved lightning fast to integrate Happy Returns. We made box-free, label-free returns available in over 5,000 UPS store locations, just 8 days after the acquisition closed. Happy Returns' digital experience helped drive returns volume in the fourth quarter with momentum extending into the first quarter of 2024. Finally, we continue to deploy transformative technology to increase efficiency within our warehousing facilities. The latest example is our state-of-the-art pick, pack and ship center in Louisville, Kentucky, that we call UPS Velocity. We named it Velocity because it leverages robotics, automation, machine learning and artificial intelligence to streamline fulfillment operation. This facility is capable of processing over 350,000 units per day and enables a best-in-class experience for our customers and their customers.Our Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven strategy is the foundation of our business and our continued execution of this strategy enabled us to exit 2023 with momentum. But momentum is not enough. We've decided to take some bold moves to rightsize our company for the future and to focus on the key enablers of growth. So today, we are announcing 2 actions. First, we plan to explore strategic alternatives for our truckload brokerage business, known as Coyote. Coyote is part of supply chain solution and is a business that is highly cyclical with considerable earnings volatility. We will keep you apprised as we move forward with this analysis. Second, we are going to fit our organization to our strategy and align our resources against what's widely important. This will result in a workforce reduction of approximately 12,000 positions and around $1 billion in cost out this year. Here, we've identified new ways of working and are calling this fit to serve.Let me end by sharing our 2024 outlook. In 2024, the small package market in the U.S. excluding Amazon, is expected to grow by less than 1% and projected market growth rates for the rest of our business segments suggest some improvement but not until the latter part of the year. In building our 2024 financial targets, we included the low end of our guidance on market growth. And for the high end of our guidance, included growth we should experience if we capture market share. In 2024, we expect to generate consolidated revenue ranging from approximately $92 billion to $94.5 billion and a consolidated operating margin ranging from approximately 10% to 10.6%. Given the nuances of our new labor contract, there will be stark contrast between our first half and our second half performance.First half earnings will be compressed and second half earnings will expand. In both the low and high end of our guidance range, we expect to exit the year with a U.S. operating margin of 10%. Brian will provide more details in a moment. UPS remains rock-solid strong. While our dividend payout is currently higher than our targeted payout of 50% of our prior year's adjusted earnings per share, we are confident in our future. As a result, the UPS Board approved a $0.01 increase in the quarterly dividend from $1.62 per share to $1.63 per share. This is the 15th consecutive year we have increased the UPS dividend. So now that 2023 is behind us, we look forward to seeing you at our upcoming Investor and Analyst Day on March 26. At that time, we will share our 3-year plans to grow and drive share owner value.With that, thank you for listening. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian."", 'Brian O. Newman', ""Thanks, Carol and good morning. In my comments, I'll cover 3 areas, starting with the macro and our fourth quarter results, then I'll review our full year 2023 results, including cash and shareowner returns. And lastly, I'll provide comments on expectations for the market and our financial outlook for 2024. The macro environment in the fourth quarter showed improvement. However, in the transportation and logistics sector, conditions remained under pressure, both in the U.S. and internationally due to soft demand and overcapacity in the market. Throughout the quarter, we leveraged the agility of our integrated network to match capacity with demand and we were recognized by an independent third party for providing industry-leading service for the sixth peak in a row.Looking at our financial results. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue was $24.9 billion, down 7.8% from the fourth quarter of 2022. All 3 of our segments demonstrated agility and on a combined basis, drove down total expense by $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter year-over-year. This enabled us to deliver operating profit within the range we communicated to you last quarter. Consolidated operating margin was 11.2% for the quarter and in line with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share was $2.47, down 31.8% from the fourth quarter of 2022.Now let's look at our business segments. In U.S. Domestic, we knew going into the fourth quarter that volume would be ramping up off an exceptionally low third quarter. Our efforts to win back diverted volume and pull through new volume resulted in a record sequential volume surge. Throughout peak, we delivered excellent service to our customers while managing expenses. In the fourth quarter, average daily volume came in at the low end of our range and was down 7.4% year-over-year. The B2B average daily volume in the fourth quarter was down 6.8% year-over-year driven by declines in the retail, manufacturing and high-tech sectors. In the fourth quarter, B2B represented 35.5% of our volume which was up slightly from 35.3% in the same period last year.Also in the fourth quarter, continued macro pressures drove customers to seek economy products as we saw customers shift volume out of the air onto the ground. Total air average daily volume was down 15% year-over-year and ground average daily volume was down 5.8% versus the fourth quarter of last year. For the quarter, U.S. Domestic generated revenue of $16.9 billion, down 7.3%. Revenue per piece was slightly positive year-over-year with a number of moving parts. A combination of strong base rates and customer mix increased the revenue per piece growth rate by about 390 basis points. This was offset by a few factors. First, changes in product mix and package characteristics decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 140 basis points.Second, reflecting the lower volume in the quarter, peak season surcharge revenue declined which reduced the revenue per piece growth rate by about 120 basis points. And lastly, changes in fuel prices decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 110 basis points. Turning to cost, total expense was down 3.6% and in the face of a 12.1% increase in union wage rates, which was driven by the contractual increase that went into effect last August, we pulled several levers to more than offset the higher expense. First, we leveraged our network planning tools and total service plan to reduce total hours in the fourth quarter by 10.2%, which was more than the decline in average daily volume. This enabled us to decrease compensation and benefits, which drove down the total expense growth rate by around 30 basis points.Second, lower purchase transportation expenditures reduced the expense growth rate by around 70 basis points, primarily from lower volume levels and our continued optimization efforts. Next, lower fuel costs contributed 160 basis points to the decrease in the total expense growth rate. And lastly, the net of all other expense items and allocations reduced the expense growth rate by 100 basis points. Pulling it all together, these actions helped us reduce U.S. Domestic expense in the fourth quarter by $578 million which was our largest fourth quarter dollar cost reduction ever. Looking specifically at peak, as volume returned to the network and our biggest customers drove a surge in peak volume, we ran our integrated network with agility. In fact, in 2023, we closed over 30 sorts and they remain closed during peak.By leveraging our network planning tools, we took advantage of the flexibility of our integrated network and flowed more volume into our automated buildings. And with smart package, smart facility in over 1,000 buildings, [missed] load frequency improved 67% contributing to the superior service we deliver to our customers. The U.S. Domestic segment delivered $1.6 billion in operating profit, down 32.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. However, compared to the third quarter of 2023, operating profit in U.S. Domestic increased $904 million and was our highest sequential operating profit increase ever. Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 9.3%, a 440-basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2023.Moving to our International segment. Soft demand continued to pressure volumes out of Asia. And in Europe, several key economies remain in recession, which pressured demand and drove a shift away from Express services. In response, we focused on revenue quality and adjusted our global network to match changes in geographic demand. Looking at volume. In the fourth quarter, international total average daily volume was down 8.3% year-over-year. The decline was primarily due to lower domestic average daily volume, which was down 10.8%, driven by declines in Europe and Canada, areas of the world that continue to face persistent inflationary pressures. On the export side, total average daily volume declined 5.9% on a year-over-year basis, driven by declines in Europe due to weak macro conditions.Looking at Asia, export average daily volume was down 8.9%, driven by soft demand in the retail and high-tech sectors. However, export volume on the China to U.S. lane, which is our most profitable lane increased 2.7%, driven by SMBs. Nearly offsetting the decline in Asia over in the Americas region, export average daily volume grew 11.9%, led by customers in Canada and Mexico, leveraging our cross-border ground service. In the fourth quarter, International revenue was $4.6 billion, which was down 6.9% from last year, primarily due to the decline in volume. Revenue per piece increased 3.1%. Strong base pricing and a change in customer mix drove a 420-basis point increase in the revenue per piece growth rate. A reduction in fuel surcharge revenue negatively impacted the revenue per piece growth rate by 60 basis points and lower demand-related surcharge revenue, which was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 50 basis points.Moving to expense. In the fourth quarter, total International expense was down $152 million, primarily driven by lower fuel expense. Additionally, in response to the lower demand environment, we managed our network to match capacity with demand, which included reducing international block hours by 9.4%. Operating profit in the International segment was $899 million, down $192 million year-over-year. Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 19.5%.Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions. In the fourth quarter, revenue was $3.4 billion, down $435 million year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers, in international air freight, overall volumes were down despite a mid-quarter spike in e-commerce. Market rates continue to be pressured, resulting in lower revenue and operating profit. On the Ocean side, volume increased driven by the retail sector. However, excess market capacity pressured revenue and operating profit.Within Forwarding, our truckload brokerage unit known as Coyote, continued to face pressure from excess capacity in the market, which drove revenue and operating profit down. In the fourth quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $319 million and an operating margin of 9.4%. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $207 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $66 million and our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.5%.Now let me comment on our full year 2023 results. For the full year 2023, revenue declined 9.3% to $91 billion and we generated operating profit of $9.9 billion, a decrease of 28.7% compared to full year 2022. Consolidated operating margin was 10.9%. We generated $10.2 billion in cash from operations and continue to follow our capital allocation priorities. We invested $5.2 billion in CapEx, additionally, we acquired MNX Global Logistics and Happy Returns. We distributed $5.4 billion in dividends, which represented a 6.6% increase on a per share basis over 2022. We repaid $2.4 billion in debt that matured during the year. And at the end of the year, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.2 turns.Lastly, we completed $2.25 billion in share buybacks in 2023 and in the segments for the full year, in U.S. Domestic, operating profit was $5.4 billion and operating margin was 9%. The International segment generated $3.3 billion in operating profit and operating margin was 18.4% and Supply Chain Solutions delivered operating profit of $1.2 billion and an operating margin, was 9%.With 2023 behind us, let us move to our outlook for 2024. S&P Global is forecasting an improvement in global macro conditions as the year progresses. Outside the U.S., real exports in Europe are expected to improve each quarter throughout the year. Looking at Asia, we saw positive momentum on the China to U.S. lane exiting the year and remain cautious on the outlook for 2024. In the U.S., the projected small package market growth rate is just under 1%, excluding Amazon. A slight improvement is expected in U.S. manufacturing and the consumer is expected to remain resilient despite lingering inflationary pressures.We've built a plan that reflects the current environment and potential risks that we see. This includes fitting our organization to our strategy and aligning execution to our widely important initiatives under what we call fit to serve. As Carol mentioned, we are exploring strategic alternatives for Coyote, our truckload brokerage business, which will enable us to address some of the cyclical impacts in our forwarding business and we are reducing our workforce by approximately 12,000 positions. This will cut around $1 billion in cost in 2024.Moving to our 2024 financial outlook. We are providing a range based on volume growth. The low end of the range has UPS growing at market rate and the high end of the range has us gaining share. For the full year 2024, on a consolidated basis, revenues are expected to range from approximately $92 billion to $94.5 billion and operating margin is expected to range from approximately 10% to 10.6%. In the range provided, we expect to move total average daily volume from negative growth in the first half of the year to positive growth in the back half.This is primarily driven by lapping the volume diversion we experienced in the U.S. last year during our labor negotiations. Additionally, costs will weigh on us in the first half of the year, primarily due to the high labor cost inflation associated with the new contract. Looking at consolidated revenue. In the first half of the year, we expect the growth rate to decline within a range of approximately 1% to 2%, with the first quarter driving the decline. And in the back half of the year, revenue growth is anticipated to be up within a range of mid- to high single digits. Looking at consolidated operating profit, we expect material improvement as the year progresses with the second half of the year outperforming the first half. Lastly, we expect to generate our lowest consolidated operating margin of the year in the first quarter.Now let me give you a little color on the segments. Looking at U.S. Domestic, average daily volume growth is expected to be within a range of approximately flat to up 2% for the full year. At both the low and high ends of the range, we expect the revenue per piece growth rate to outpace the cost per piece growth rate beginning in the third quarter and we expect to exit the year at a 10% operating margin. Moving to the International segment. We expect 2024 average daily volume to be within a range of approximately flat to up around 3%. At both ends of the guidance range, operating margin is anticipated to be in the high teens. And in Supply Chain Solutions for the full year in 2024, we expect revenue to be within a range of approximately $13 billion to $13.5 billion. At both ends of the guidance range, operating margin for SCS is expected to be high single digits.And for modeling purposes, in total below the line, we expect approximately $400 million in expense in 2024. This is net of $262 million in pension income. We included a slide in the appendix of today's webcast deck to provide you more detail on pension. The webcast deck will be posted to the UPS Investor Relations website following this call. Now let's turn to full year 2024 capital allocation. Our capital allocation priorities have not changed. We are staying on strategy and we'll make the best long-term decisions to capture growth, improve efficiency and deliver value to our shareholders. We expect 2024 capital expenditures to be within our target of around 5% of revenue or $4.5 billion.Now let's turn to our expectations for cash and the balance sheet. We expect free cash flow to be within a range of approximately $4.5 billion to $5.3 billion, including our annual pension contributions of $1.4 billion, which are equal to our expected service costs. As Carol mentioned, the Board has approved a dividend per share of $1.63 for the first quarter. We are planning to pay out around $5.4 billion in dividends in 2024, subject to Board approval. Finally, our effective tax rate in 2024 is expected to be approximately 23.5%.In closing, we look at 2024 as a year to pivot away from negative volume to positive volume growth and from high labor cost inflation to a much lower growth rate. We are laser-focused on executing our strategy, controlling what we can control and improving our financial performance. We look forward to sharing our multiyear targets and details on our strategy at our Investor Day event on March 26.Thank you and operator, please open the lines."", 'Operator', 'We will now conduct a question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.', 'Christian F. Wetherbee', ""I guess I want to start on maybe some of the cost out. You mentioned the 12,000 positions that you're reducing and the $1 billion of cost in 2024. I was hoping maybe you could help us sort of understand the timing of that. So based on the 10% kind of run rate exiting '24, it would imply that the first quarter is fairly low. So I just want to make sure I understand some of those moving pieces and when that $1 billion is going to start to accrue."", 'Brian O. Newman', ""Sure. Happy to give you some color. So we talked about 12,000 heads out, 75% of the reductions will come in the first half, which drive the $1 billion in the 2024 calendar year. But you're absolutely right in terms of the timing and announcement it will be back-end weighted. And really, the other thing I'd like to point out, it's a change in the way we work. So as volume returns to the system, we don't expect these jobs to come back. It's changing the effective way that we operate."", 'Carol B. Tome', ""And I might just add a little more color, if I could, Chris. Today, we have about 495,000 UPSers around the world. A few years ago and when the COVID demand was peaking, we had 540,000 UPSers. So Kate and Nando have done a masterful job of managing our operational headcount to meet the volume in our company and they've done that by managing our turnover and attrition and closing sorts and reducing block hours, et cetera. We have about 85,000 UPSers who are management and this could be full time and part time management. The targeted head count falls really within that group as well as some contractors that will be leaving us. And to Brian's point, this is really about a new way of working. So it's $1 billion of cost out now but there's even more cost out to come as we have a full year benefit in 2025."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein.', 'David Scott Vernon', ""So I just wanted to ask on the productivity side. Obviously, hours down more than volume. We've had a couple of quarters of that, obviously, now the third quarter this year. Is there a point where volume declines become more difficult to offset? I'm just trying to understand the downside risk, right. If volumes continue to remain flat, or weaker than you expect, how should we be thinking about the downside risk on the margin side?"", 'Carol B. Tome', ""So we believe that productivity is a virtuous cycle here at UPS and I'll give you one example, then I'm going to throw it over to Nando to address this. But if I look at just 1 metric, cube utilization. We reached the highest cube utilization in our company history at 60%. That's the equivalent of reducing 1,500 loads per day. So that's not in hours but it's just a cost out. So we've got productivity across the operations. And Nando, why don't you talk about what you're going to do in 2024."", 'Nando Cesarone', ""Yes. So David, for us, it is a virtuous cycle. So we're working ahead of any type of volume variability. So whether it goes up or down, we've got some of our best engineers, operations folks, finance folks identifying additional cost outs as we move forward, as we're executing the ones that we have in front of us. So we feel good that there's a good pipeline of opportunity no matter what the volume does. And as Carol had mentioned, we lever our hourly headcount and match that to the volume and the activity. And so far, so good but still lots in front of us and they're pretty meaty, so we feel really good about those initiatives."", 'Carol B. Tome', ""And at our Investor Day in March, we're going to talk to you about network of the future. We've got an integrated network. We don't have to integrate. But we can transform our network with some very exciting ideas. So we're going to share that with you in March."", 'David Scott Vernon', 'And the rate at which resource needs is going to need to be added back on the other side was, maybe we get some volume expansion. Can you talk to the expectations for operating leverage on the upside?', 'Brian O. Newman', ""Yes. I think as we look to the back end of the year, certainly, the volume projections that are in there, in terms of the volume growth for the back end of the year in that 2% to 4% range domestically, we start to see CPP growing slower than RPP. And so that balance is what's going to create the operating margin. With the sorts we closed, over 30 sorts, did not reopen them during peak. So we're changing, Nando is doing an effective job of basically managing more volume with less. So we'll continue to drive that."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank.', 'Amit Singh Mehrotra', ""I just wanted to -- Brian, on the guidance, I guess the guidance implies $9.6 billion in operating profits. You've been pretty helpful historically about giving us kind of the first half, second half cadence of that. And then just related to that, I want to make sure, so you said the $1 billion is included in the guidance. Can you just expand on that a little bit? Because if I take out the $1 billion, the implied change in profits relative to the improvement in revenues, quite a bit worse. So I'm just trying to understand what's actually included in the guidance on the $1 billion and how that kind of translates to what you're assuming underneath that in terms of change of profit relative to change of revenue?"", 'Brian O. Newman', ""Sure. Happy to, Amit. So from a shape of the year perspective, the full year, we called revenue at 1% to 4% but the -- based on lapping of the volumes and the contract overlap, we would expect revenue to be flat to down 2% in the first half, up 4% to 8% in the back half. And from a profit perspective, I had mentioned that it's a tale of 2 cities in terms of halves of the year. The second half of the year, we'd expect profit to grow about 20% to 30%. So Q1 will be the biggest challenge because we're lapping from a volume comp perspective and a full contract. But on a full year basis, we're looking at op margin, 10% to 10.6%. I think you can expect the second half of the year to be in 11% to 12% in that range and you can back into the first half.In terms of your question of backing out the $1 billion in costs, that $1 billion will be a cost benefit in 2024. But I think we've said in the past, Amit, it would take 12 months to digest the new labor cost. We are confident we can get back to consistent expansion of U.S. margins as we lap the first year of the contract, that will be a combination of pricing and productivity. So net-net, it's really lapping that contract and then you start to get the benefits. As Carol said, some of those benefits would accrue over to 2025 as well."", 'Amit Singh Mehrotra', ""And are we done there on the $1 billion? Or is there like there's $55 billion in total cost? I mean, are we just getting started? Or like what's the actual opportunity there beyond the $1 billion?"", 'Brian O. Newman', ""So Carol talked about the differences -- between Nando and Kate, the operating cost and what we're talking about management headcount. If you bifurcate the 2, I think you're going to hear more at the Investor Day through things like Network of the Future, how we go after additional head count in that area but this would be about a 14% reduction in that 85,000 heads."", 'Carol B. Tome', ""We're never done. We continue to drive productivity. It's a virtuous cycle here. And technology has changed just so much in the past year, when you think about the advent of generative AI and the applications inside of our business, we're just getting started and I'm really excited about what the future will mean in terms of driving productivity and as well as improving the customer experience."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.', 'Conor T. Cunningham', ""Just to stick with the productivity side. You've been obviously pretty dynamic with your network and you mentioned, I think, 30 sort closures and whatnot. Can you just talk about the consolidation opportunity in '24 and how that may play out to drive further efficiencies in the business."", 'Carol B. Tome', ""We'd be happy to do that but we're going to kick that question to our March conference because we've got a great presentation to share with you regarding Network of the Future and it would take up way too much time today to go through that. We want to spend a good amount of time talking to you about that in March. So thank you for understanding."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo.', 'Allison Ann Marie Poliniak-Cusic', ""Just want to turn to the growth aspect of it more, I guess, more specifically the market share capture. Could you maybe walk through the different levers in terms of -- I know you mentioned Project Brown, your ability to recapture diversion -- diverted volume but also talking to the SMB penetration, your opportunity on the healthcare side? Just any color in terms of where those levers can be pulled through that market share growth in '24."", 'Carol B. Tome', ""I'll start with a few comments about Project Brown. Project Brown really is a new way of going after business. And it has many elements to it and I'll make some of those real to you. First of all, we looked at ourselves and said, what's getting in the way of speed because it was taking us too long to respond to our customer. And we found that we hadn't really declared service level agreements amongst the various groups that participate in this exercise of providing answers to our customers. So we shortened up the time to response and that's important, and that's going to be with us now forever. I can make that real for you. Outside of the United States it used to take 22 days. We dropped it to 6 days. We're now at 2 days. That's best in class and we made similar improvements in the United States. Project Brown was also looking at Deal Manager.Deal Manager is the new tool that we introduced that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to score a deal and avoid the need for our salespeople to go up to our pricing people for appeals, they can actually see the score of their deal. We've had great acceptance and win rates, 79% win rates with this tool. But we found through Project Brown that we weren't offering all of our products in the tool and one of the products we weren't offering was SurePost, which is a great product. So we introduced SurePost into the Deal Manager and we're getting some good return on that. That's particularly attractive for our small and medium size customers.Another thing that we did is that we improved and increased weekend pickups in several key markets during the year. So and I could go on and on and on but this is a way of operationalizing excellence to drive the business and capture share. So where are we going to capture share? We're going to continue to lean into the small- and medium-sized segment opportunities, we're seeing some real success in that area. We're going to continue to lean into healthcare. When I started here, the healthcare revenues were around $6 billion, now at $10 billion and we're going to continue to grow. We'll lay out our 3-year growth plans for you at our March Investor Day. I think you'll be very pleased with that. We're going to continue to sell off the service that we provide and the capabilities that we have that actually no one else has, that's our integrated network.So at our Investor Day in March, we'll lay out market share capture. But let me just make the market real for you because this might be helpful too. As we think about the addressable market, the addressable market in the United States. It's a little over 52 million packages a day. So there's plenty of addressable market for us to go get. And plenty of market for us to get outside of the United States because we are underpenetrated in so many areas. One reason I called out our new air hub in the Hong Kong International Airport is that the Greater China Bay area is an unbelievable economic power base, the 13th largest economy in the world, 37% of all China exports go through that airport. And today, we have small -- way overcapacity of and buildings that are inefficient with lease rates that are sky high. So we are building a 20000-square meter facility. It will make us the second largest air hub in that important part of the market. So expect to see a lot of growth coming off of that over time."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS.', 'Thomas Richard Wadewitz', ""So I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about the competitive dynamic in the market. I know the backdrop is that you had some share loss associated with the Teamster contract. But it also seems like there might be risks that other competitors are gaining traction in the market. So if you look at Postal Service had, I think, up 7% volumes and they had a new product, the Ground Advantage. And so I guess the question is, is there a risk that the competitive set has got more challenging? And how do we think about what you need to do to have a better volume outcome in 2024? Is there more pressure on price? Or is it a different formula to get the better volume outcome in '24?"", 'Carol B. Tome', ""So I would say that the pricing environment is very rational. And you can see that as Brian picked out the RPP performance in the fourth quarter, we had very strong base rate performance. Now the RPP was muted because of lower fuel costs and product characteristics and the product mix change and lower demand surcharges but the base was very strong. And we expect the base to continue into 2024, our GRI for 2024 is 5.9%. Will we keep all of it? No. But will we keep a lot of it? Yes, just like we did in 2023, we kept about 60% of the GRI in 2023. So the pricing environment is rational. In terms of competitive products, it's incumbent upon us to stay at leading edge and meeting our customers where they want us to be. That's one reason we offered a hyper local product beginning last quarter, which is really a short zone product. We haven't had that before.And as we look at the offerings that we will go to market with this year, we've got some things underway, not ready for prime time. But I suspect looking over at our new Chief Commercial Officer, Matt Guffey, that we might be able to talk about that at our March investor conference and he's nodding his head. So stay tuned for that."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Vertical Research Partners.', 'Jeffrey Asher Kauffman', ""I'm going to defer the big picture stuff to March. But I'm just kind of curious, how did your global view change between when we were discussing the labor deal back in August, September to the year-end. You mentioned the softness in Europe. You mentioned the shift from air to ground but kind of what were the big changes in your outlook over that 4-, 5-month period?"", 'Carol B. Tome', ""Well, what really softened up was Europe. If you look at our -- the volume decline, both domestic and export, it was heavily weighted in Europe. In fact, the decline in our export was 94%, driven by the softness in Europe. So you see what's happening with industrial manufacturing, that is just way off. So that is a big change. There are also dynamics happening in air and ocean freight that you've been watching. We've all been watching the drama in the Red Sea, the fact that the water levels in the Panama Canal are low and that certainly is causing a lot of chaos actually in ocean and air freights. Interestingly, on the air side, both rates and volumes were down, on the ocean side, volumes are up. But as Brian called out, the rates were considerably down.As we sit here today, it's a very dynamic market and ever-changing. A little hard to predict (inaudible) because what we're seeing today is for shippers who have high value packages. They're actually -- they're worried about their ocean conditions, so they're moving to the air. So air rates are tightening a bit. And on the ocean side, because shippers are starting to have to reroute away from the Red Sea or the Panama Canal, the routing is taking longer, so there's some change to the dynamics of the pricing there too. We just have to stay super nimble here and Kate and her team are doing a great job at that. Kate what would you like to add here?"", 'Kathleen M. Gutmann', ""Yes. I would say that the market remains volatile, even in Europe with the drop-off in the inflationary softening. We were able to pull back on the cost to deliver a great margin and that's our commitment. And then to ensure that in the forwarding side of the house, as we've done, stay just razor sharp to ensure that we are right on track with any trend that we see. And I'm really proud of the team because we have got the initiative to gain those customers with high-value goods and that international air freight that's coming as a result."", 'Jeffrey Asher Kauffman', 'And just if I could follow up on that answer. So given the global events with Suez Canal, Panama Canal, looking at the lemonade out of lemons side of this, is this a bigger opportunity for you in Europe? Or is this a bigger opportunity for air out of Asia?', 'Kathleen M. Gutmann', ""It actually is first showing up Asia to Europe lane. And -- but I will say this is going to be the repositioning of vessels around the globe. It's going to be a global event. So we see it as an opportunity throughout and our sales resources are global. Our portfolio is global. So UPS is very well positioned to take advantage of it."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.', 'Brandon Robert Oglenski', 'Can you guys speak to your enterprise customers and the volume trends that you saw in the fourth quarter and expectations going into 2024? And maybe compare and contrast that with B2B as well as your small, medium business mix?', 'Brian O. Newman', ""So happy to, Brandon. We were actually pleased with the volume momentum. We were at a low watermark in August of last year, down 15% and we saw sequential monthly improvement as we looked at our volume domestically from an ADV perspective, down to mid-single-digit declines in the month of December. So that trend continued to play out well. We're going to see some tough comps, though, in the first quarter, so I wouldn't expect positive volume growth in Q1. We start to see positive volume growth in Q2 and then certainly in the back half of the year as the comps change. SMB, Carol mentioned, very focused on penetration on the SMB side and specifically some of the medium SMB customers. We've stated we would like to see that mix trend up to 30% plus. We finished the year at 28%. So we're well on our way in that direction."", 'Carol B. Tome', ""Maybe another comment because this is just an interesting observation on the market. If I look at our top 5 decliners in the quarter, that would include our largest customer and there's an intentional decline there. But then if I look at the remaining decliners, it's really interesting to see what's happening. Of those, only one has diverted some volume. They're a dual sourcer and they have diverted some volume. And I suspect they'll stay dual sourcing. The rest, either their business is just way off or they have worked really hard to create a better experience inside the store to encourage buy online, pick up in store. So there is a bit of dynamic happening within our large enterprise customers. I think for all of us, we're delighted to have anniversaried the demand that we saw through COVID. Now that that's behind us, now that the volume for the small package market has reverted back to the mean, this is an opportunity now for everyone to grow."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen.', 'Helane Renee Becker', ""So on Coyote, when you did the acquisition, what did you think the benefits would be that made it important to do the acquisition. And then what really would actually happened that is causing you to rethink how Coyote fits in the network and my follow-up question is then related. You recently bought 2 747-8 freighters, I saw. And I'm just wondering if you bought those off lease or where they came from since Boeing doesn't make the 747 anymore."", 'Carol B. Tome', ""I'm happy to address the Coyote question to the best of my ability. I was on the Board in 2015 when we bought the company but the strategic rationale was really about expanding the portfolio. And it was a very thoughtful strategic rationale to expand the portfolio. But I don't think we fully understood at the time was just how cyclical this business is. And I'll make it real for you. When we acquired Coyote in 2015, the revenues in the previous year for Coyote were $2.1 billion. During COVID, Coyote peaked up to over $4 billion in revenue. Well, it's gone way down since then. In fact, if you look at our Supply Chain Solutions business, it was down $3 billion year-on-year, which is 1/3 of the overall company decline. Within that $3 billion, Coyote made up 38% of the decline for the year and 48% of the decline for the fourth quarter.So you can see the volatility in the revenues line and then we've got a business that has a very low margin. So if you've got that kind of volatility on the revenue line, you're going to have even more volatility on the earnings line. So we're like, gosh, is there are another way to skin this cat. Can we think about an alternative that continues to allow us to provide the service but without all the overhead or perhaps this business is worth more to someone else than it is to us. We don't know. We don't know the outcome of our alternative work. But as soon as we do, we'll share that with you. And on the freighter question."", 'Brian O. Newman', ""So the 2 planes were picked up through Qatar and really it's part of a broader airline strategy to retire some of the MD-11s in terms of efficiency and sustainability."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research.', 'Scott H. Group', 'Just want to follow up a couple of things on the guidance. Brian, I know you said 10% U.S. margin exiting the year. Any color on the shape of the year? You also talked a couple of times about just Q1 being hard. Any more specific color on Q1 and then just lastly, I know every year on this call, you typically give an update on the biggest customer exposure, if you can give us an update there.', 'Brian O. Newman', ""Happy to, Scott. So from a domestic margin perspective, we're looking at the back half of the year being in the range of -- from an op profit perspective, we're looking at 20% to 30% growth, Scott, from a margin and from a margin will be in the 10% to 10%-plus range for the fourth quarter. The challenge we have is the first quarter, we actually expect to be down in the neighborhood. We had a low watermark in Q3 of last year. So we're not going to be down to that point but I don't think we'll be much better from a margin perspective in the U.S. in the first quarter of this year. From a Amazon perspective, we finished the year at 11.8%. And that was not due to an increase in the business, we're still executing our plan with them in terms of a glide down. It was more to the overall enterprise revenue coming down as a part of the enterprise."", 'Carol B. Tome', 'It just came down faster than Amazon, yes.', 'PJ Guido', 'Steven, we have time for 1 more question.', 'Operator', 'Our final question will come from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs.', 'Jordan Robert Alliger', ""So I was sort of thinking about the small package growth that you guys targeted at less than 1% this year. Feels pretty conservative after a couple of years of probably negative industry growth as well. So I'm just sort of curious what's informing that? Is that your economic outlook, your forecast? And then maybe this is, your Analyst Day you'll address it but sort of on a normalized basis, what kind of small package domestic growth, underlying industry growth you think about over a longer-term basis?"", 'Carol B. Tome', ""Yes. The longer-term view is very good. It's 3%. So that's really good growth actually. And we're looking forward to getting into that growth mode. We use a number of external factors to inform our perspective on the market growth. We triangulate from a number of different sources and come up with our best view. This is our best view."", 'Operator', 'I will now turn the floor back over to our host, Mr. PJ Guido. Please go ahead, sir.', 'PJ Guido', 'Thank you, Steven. This concludes our call. Thank you for joining and have a good day.']"

Today, Dirk will provide a business and strategy update, followed by a review of our financial results and outlook by Luca. We will close with Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Dirk."", 'Dirk Van de Put', ""Thanks, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on Slide 4. I'm pleased to share that we delivered our best year ever in 2023 with robust top line growth, continued share improvements, record profit dollar growth and strong total shareholder return. Our double-digit top line performance was driven by strong pricing execution and positive volume/mix growth. We also delivered continued share improvements as consumers across the globe remain very engaged with our iconic snacking brands. We set another record for gross profit dollar growth achieving $2.2 billion through ongoing cost discipline and sound pricing to offset cost inflation as well as volume leverage. We continued our track record of strong free cash flow, generating $3.6 billion. To accelerate our strategy of global snacking leadership, we continue to invest significantly in our brands and capabilities, driving multiyear growth on both the top and bottom lines. I'm especially proud of our record financial results as well as returning nearly $4 billion in capital to shareholders. These results deepen our confidence that the strength of our brands, our proven strategy, our continued and increasing investments and especially our great people, position us well to achieve our long-term financial targets in 2024 and beyond. Turning to Slide 5. You can see that 2023 was a strong year on both the top and bottom lines with substantial reinvestment to drive continued growth in the year ahead. Organic net revenue grew 14.7% or $4.6 billion versus prior year. Our continuing solid performance in volume/mix demonstrates that consumers continue to prioritize our brands and categories. We also delivered record adjusted gross profit dollar growth of $2.2 billion, up 18.8%, significantly lapping the last several years. We're proud of our teams' continued focus and commitment, which enables us to continue investing in the business to drive further sustained growth. Accordingly, we increased A&C investments by more than 21%, helping to drive consumer and customer loyalty to both our iconic global brands and our local jewels, which represent the taste of the nation in their markets. These results translated into strong OI growth of nearly $1 billion, up more than 19% versus prior year. Adjusted EPS grew 19% on top of strong growth in the past several years. All told, we remain confident that our virtuous cycle of strong gross profit dollar growth, fueling local-first commercial execution and increasing investments in our strong brands, capabilities and talent, will enable us to continue delivering attractive sustainable growth. I'm especially proud to share that we continue to outperform our peers in total shareholder return. As you can see on Slide 6, our 5-year TSR is nearly double the average of our peer group. Our 1-year return is particularly impressive, with Mondelez delivering double-digit growth while our peer average return has fallen into negative territory. We view these results as evidence that we have the right strategy, the right brands and their people to continue delivering long-term value for our stakeholders. Switching to Slide 7. Our performance in 2023 gives us confidence that we have not only the right growth strategy but also the right execution to deliver it. Here are just a few highlights of our strategy in action. Our biggest global brands, Oreo, Milka and Cadbury, achieved more than $10 billion in global net revenues. We continue accelerating our focus on our core categories for chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks because these categories offer attractive growth and profitability. We remain on track to deliver 90% of our revenue through these core categories. We also continue to make strong progress in executing our growth strategy. Our U.S. supply chain has stabilized, and we have added more than 600,000 stores to our emerging market distribution channels. Additionally, we continue to advance our portfolio reshaping strategy. In 2023, we integrated Clif Bar and Ricolino. Now we are harnessing the power of these recent acquisitions to strengthen our presence in the global snack bar and the Mexican chocolate and candy segments. We also completed the sale of our developed market gum business for $1.4 billion, providing another important source of reinvestment to further advance our brands, talent and capabilities. On Slide 8, along with our financial performance, I'm pleased to share that we made significant progress towards our sustainability goals and targets in 2023. First, we continue to advance our leadership in more sustainably sourced critical ingredients. About 80% of the cocoa volume used in our chocolate brand is sourced through Cocoa Life, our signature cocoa sourcing program, that works to lift up the people and restore landscapes where cocoa grows. We also made continued progress in helping to combat climate change. We achieved an important milestone in 2023 by submitting our road map to achieve net zero by 2050 to the Science-Based Targets initiative. Additionally, we continued advancing our light and right packaging strategy. More than 97% of our packaging now is designed to be recycled. We also continue investing in ways to empower consumers to make more mindful snacking choices that fit into their healthy active lifestyles. More than 55% of our snacks revenue comes from Mindful Portion snacks, that is, snacks that are packaged in individually wrapped Mindful Portion serving sizes or with clear Mindful Portion recommendations on pack. These are just a few highlights of our continuing progress towards building a more sustainable snacking company. We continue to believe that helping to drive positive change at scale is an integral part of value creation with positive returns for our sellers. We encourage you to watch our annual Snacking Made Right Report, which will be published in April, to view our full year sustainability data. Turning to Slide 9. You can see that like many companies, we continue to navigate through a dynamic operating environment. We are closely tracking and planning around a number of near-term themes, including continuing inflation, shifting consumer habits, geopolitical challenges, rising cocoa prices, just to name a few. We are well positioned to address these challenges, and we remain confident that we can deliver a non-algorithm year. Our confidence is rooted in our conviction that we have the right strategy, the right execution and the right people as well as very strong, widely loved brands. We continue to see momentum in the majority of our key emerging markets. Our categories remain resilient and our solid volume/mix performance demonstrates that consumers continue to prioritize our iconic snacking brands. To continue accelerating this momentum, we are continuing to increase our investments significantly in our brands and capabilities. We are pleased that our U.S. supply chain has substantially improved, and we continue to focus on expanding distribution opportunities in both developed and emerging markets. We're also making solid progress in our European pricing negotiations. We expect to deliver robust EPS growth in both constant and real dollars in 2024. And overall, we remain confident that we have the right strategy to effectively navigate today's volatile environment while continuing to focus on long-term sustainable growth. In conclusion, I'm pleased to reiterate that 2023 was another record year. Our focus in portfolio reshaping strategy is working, and we are well positioned to continue driving attractive growth in 2024 and beyond. By continuing to double-down on our attractive core categories of chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks, investing in our widely loved brands, focusing on operational execution and cost discipline, and empowering our great people, I am confident that we can deliver strong performance for years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca to share additional insights on our financials."", 'Luca Zaramella', ""Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into our financial results and the 2024 outlook, it is important to provide some context related to the developed market gum divestiture and its impact on our results. On Slide 11, you can see that the impact of the divestiture on revenue was around about $500 million; while on growth, 0.3 percentage points negative. EPS was impacted by minus $0.11. I'll give you more color as this relates to the outlook later in the call and how we plan to fully offset impact on income. Moving to Slide 12. In 2023, we delivered exceptional results, starting with double-digit revenue growth, with both volume and value contributing. As we keep saying, gross profit dollar is the most important P&L variable as it allows to [reinvest] and protect on our virtual cycle. Last year, GP dollars grew by $2.2 billion, allowing substantial reinvestments, strong earnings and robust cash flow generation. The strength of these results can be seen across all regions and categories. Revenue growth was plus 14.7% in the year, with 1.3 points of growth coming from volume mix. For the quarter, growth was about 10% with a slight decline in volume mix. Emerging markets grew by 20.4% for the year and 14.9% for the quarter, with trends coming from a substantial number of key countries, including Brazil, China, India, Mexico and Western Andean. Developed markets grew plus 11.1% for the year and plus 6.6% for the quarter, including robust growth from both the U.S. and Europe. Moving to portfolio performance on Slide 13. Our chocolate and biscuits businesses both delivered double-digit growth for the year. Also, Gum & Candy continued to perform well with superior growth in emerging markets. Biscuits grew plus 11.9% for the year and plus 5.5% for the quarter. A large number of brands delivered strong growth for 2023, including OREO, Ritz, Chips Ahoy!, belVita, Tate's, Give & Go, 7Days, Kraft, and Club Social. Chocolate grew plus 14.5% for the year and plus 11.2% for the quarter with significant growth across both developed and emerging market. Volume/mix was up by 2.5% for the year and 2.4% for the quarter. Global brands like Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka and Toblerone, all delivered extraordinary growth while we also delivered strong growth with many of our local jewels, including Lacta, Ricolino, and Côte d'Or.Gum & Candy grew more than 28% for the year and 20% for the quarter. Key markets, including Brazil, Mexico, China and the Western Andean area, all performed well. Let's review market share performance on Slide 14. We held or gained share in 65% of our revenue base with strong results in both chocolate and biscuits. Given the amount of pricing we took in the last couple of years, we see this as a strong accomplishment. And our brand investments, both from a quantity and quality standpoint, clearly played a role. Turning to regional performance on Slide 15. Europe grew plus 14.5% for the year and plus 11.6% for the quarter. Strong execution led to positive volume/mix for the year despite significant customer disruption in Q2. Profit in '23 was up plus 12.8% for the year and plus 1.6% for the quarter. Underlying profit in Europe continues to improve, but Q4 was negatively impacted by ForEx fluctuations on some cash deposits held in dollars that functions as a protection against currency volatility. Excluding these headwinds, EBIT in Q4 was up nicely despite the significant increase in A&C. North America grew plus 9.5% for the full year, while Q4 grew plus 1.9% against an exceptionally strong compare of almost 20% in 2022. Full year growth was driven by higher pricing, broad-based strength across brands and channels and solid volume/mix. In Q4, volume declined as a result of a softening U.S. biscuit category, tight inventory management in advance of Q1 pricing and declines in Give & Go increased. Give & Go was impacted by our decision to release some of the holiday's gingerbread kits, being low profit. We continue to be very happy with Give & Go overall. Clif's results were driven by lower bar consumption and inventory depletion connected to retailers building inventory in Q3 to minimize potential disruption ahead of a system transition in early October. As a result, we made adjustments to inventory, driving a year-over-year shipment decline. We feel comfortable with current inventory levels, along with our programming and investments, to drive '24 growth. Overall, we are confident regarding our prospects in '24 for North America, given our strong activation plans, KDP's expansion, growth channels and substantial investments in A&C. We're going to give you a better sense of these opportunities at CAGNY. North America OI increased plus 22.7% for the year due to strong pricing and solid volume. For the quarter, OR increased by 9.5%. AMEA grew 11.7% for the year and 7.9% for the quarter. India grew strong double digits for the year-end quarter driven by both chocolate and biscuit. China grew high single digits for the year and quarter as well. Southeast Asia grew mid-single digits for the year, and Australia delivered strong results for both the year and the quarter. As it relates volume/mix performance in the region for Q4, there has been some pressure on Western consumer brands in the Middle East since the war began and we have not been immune from that with an impacted sales in the Middle East and part of Southeast Asia. We are supporting colleagues who have been impacted in different ways around the world as well as working with NGOs partners to aid in humanitarian efforts in the regions. While volatile and difficult to predict on a go-forward basis, we are tracking the situation and working with stakeholders and planning for these dynamics in our 2024 outlook. AMEA increased OI by 14.5% for the year and 18.5% for the quarter, continuing the strong track record of annual top and bottom line growth. Latin America grew 34.8% for the year and 28.6% for the quarter with strong volume/mix growth and strong price execution. Ex Argentina, growth for LA was plus 18.1% for the year and 9.2% for the quarter, justifying the good work done by our teams beyond price management in Argentina. Latin America delivered another strong year of profitability. OI grew plus 48.5% for the year and more than 49% for the quarter. Strong volume/mix, pricing and continuation of Gum & Candy momentum drove these results.Turning to Page 16. For the year, we delivered strong double-digit OI dollar growth driven by a record-high increase in gross profit of nearly $2.2 billion. This growth has enabled strong levels of reinvestment behind brands and capabilities for 2024 and beyond. In Q4, we also saw strong double-digit OI and gross profit dollar growth of more than $500 million driven by topline strength and ongoing cost discipline. Other was impacted by the ForEx dynamics and fund protection in U.S. dollar that I discussed about Europe. Next, EPS on Slide 17. Full year EPS grew plus 19% in constant currency. The vast majority of this growth was driven by operating gains. And despite currency headwinds, we grew adjusted EPS at reported ForEx by 14.3%. Adjusted EPS would be $3.30 per share, including $0.11 of contribution from beyond gum. I'll talk more about our plans for '24, but we could aim at removing as much stranded cost as possible. Turning to Slide 18. We delivered $3.6 billion of free cash flow for the full year, including the impact of more than $380 million related to cash taxes from the liquidation of our KDP stake. Our balance sheet remains quite strong as full year leverage ended at 2.6x. Let me take a moment to discuss our outlook and some of our key planning assumptions on Slide 20. For the current year, we expect to deliver on our long-term algorithm for revenue, earnings and cash flow. We expect to be at the upper end of our 3% to 5% algo range for organic net revenue growth as pricing in certain markets with significant top line portfolio such as Europe is expected to be higher than historical levels. We expect free cash flow of $3.5 billion plus. In terms of the assumptions, for inflation, we expect a high single-digit increase for '24. This inflation is driven by significant increases in both cocoa and sugar as well as another uptick in labor costs. As Europe faces more inflation than any other market, we expect customer disruption during Q1 and potentially into Q2 associated with our annual price negotiation process. This process is happening earlier in some cases than last year. So in fact, it might be more pronounced in Q1 from top and margin lines. We also remain committed to substantial brand support in this region and all the others, similar to our stance over the last past several years. In terms of interest expenses, we expect approximately $325 million. We are expecting $0.03 of EPS from headwinds related to ForEx impact for the year. In terms of taxes, we expect an [ETR] in the mid-20s. Shared repurchases expectations are around $2 billion. Turning to our EPS outlook on Page 21. With respect to adjusted EPS, we expect high single-digit growth off our reported base '23 of $3.30 per share, which includes the $0.11 of contribution from our divested developed gum business. We expect to eliminate nearly all of this $0.11 impact by removing stranded costs. In fact, we made good progress by already realizing $0.03 of stranded cost savings in late 2023. With that, let's open the line for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar, Barclays.', 'Andrew Lazar', ""Dirk, I was hoping we could get a bit of a state of the union on how you see the performance in key markets at this stage as we saw a bit more volume weakness in North America in the fourth quarter. And conversely, it still seems like there's strength in many of the other key markets. Trying to get a sense of how you see this playing out in '24 and whether a similar cadence across your markets might be the same or where it might be a bit different. And then I've just got a follow-up."", 'Dirk Van de Put', ""Okay. Thank you, Andrew. Yes, I mean we see there's a very strong full year performance. We feel that there is portfolio strength, which is broad-based across our regions, across the categories, across the brands. The volume/mix growth is solid for the year, and we expect that to continue into next year. Our price execution has been very good this year across the business. Share performance is good. North America, we recovered. AMEA, we've been gaining share. Europe, we had some disruption effect during the year, but we started to recuperate strongly at the end of the year. The strength in emerging markets continues broadly, and I can comment a little bit on where there are some short-term issues. And then we've got some very strong gross profit growth, $2.2 billion for the year, which has allowed us to reinvest quite significantly in the business. And so the acquisitions are doing well. EPS growth adjusted 19%; real, 14%; strong cash flow. So we feel good as we enter 2024. We have some more pricing coming in, but in North America that's already agreed. In Europe, we're in line with where we were last year, and the majority is already agreed. We are planning to continue with strong investments in our brands, with strong activations. The acquisitions, we continue to play a big role for us. And maybe another point to mention is that we have the distribution runway of adding distribution for our brands around the world. So we feel it was a very strong '23, and we feel good entering '24. Now that doesn't mean that there are no particular issues that are on our mind. So the first one would certainly be the cocoa prices and our need to price as needed. We are well covered for the year but we need to, mainly in Europe, get those prices agreed. Consumer, while the consumer is feeling better and more positive, short term, we see that elasticity is still at or below historical norms. But there is some uptick in consumer elasticity in some spots around the world. It is to be expected that we will have customer disruption in the beginning of the year in Europe. The annual negotiations are in progress. Like I said, we are in line with where we were last year and the majority is agreed, but we still have some to go. And then maybe a few words on some of the effects on the volume in Q4, which we don't think will continue in Q1 in certain instances. So there is some tensions in the Middle East, and that has some effect on Western brands, and we have some of those Western brands. We expect that to continue in Q1 and Q2, but gradually, over the year, that will fade away. And that is the main reason why AMEA is not as strong in volume/mix, as you would expect. And then North America, Luca said it in the comments, in particular in the U.S., because of very specific one-off reasons, stopping a part of the range of Give & Go, the systems change in Clif, we expect to return to good volume/mix growth in North America in the beginning of next year. All these items that I'm talking about are included in our full year outlook. And so we believe at this stage, particularly since we have to see how the negotiations go in Europe, that we should guide towards our own algo results for '24, probably more towards the higher side. But we are going to continue with all the things I said, and we'll see how the negotiations go in Europe. That's probably the main question mark that we have at this stage."", 'Andrew Lazar', ""Great. And a quick follow-up for Luca and some of this you covered a little bit, Dirk, but I think there was Street expectation for organic sales growth for '24 to maybe be a little bit above the 3% to 5% long-term algorithm just given the pricing that you're taking. So maybe, Luca, you could walk us briefly through some of the key puts and takes to keep in mind as we think about the sales growth guidance for the year and maybe the phasing aspect of it."", 'Luca Zaramella', ""Thank you, Andrew. I would start by saying that guidance for '24, in our mind, is solid, particularly as we look at what drove '23 and the continuation of that momentum into '24. And so we can, I believe, count on resiliencies of our categories. We're happy, as I said in the prepared remarks, on our share performance. I think you will see momentum in our share, particularly in the first half. And that is related to the unprecedented A&C investment that we put forward. There are still material distribution opportunities that will help us [moat-proof] some of the challenges that we discussed in the prepared remarks. And finally, the acquisitions, I think, will continue to be accretive for us, both in terms of top line and bottom line. Composing the revenue guidance, pricing is clearly a key component of this plan. Its contribution will be a little bit less than we have seen in '23, but it is higher than an average year. And particularly, as we price away cocoa, chocolate will contribute to most of the pricing in '24. Pricing, as we mentioned, presents a couple of challenges. One is potential customer disruption in Europe. We have planned for it. Part of it is also in the base of '23. But while I feel positive, and Dirk said more than half of the price is secured at this point, we cannot really say what is going to happen. And particularly, as we look into Europe, clearly, we don't control customer disruption. Having said that, I think it is important to realize that our product is strong and that they drive significant traffic for retailers. So couple that with the fact that prices is common to market and many competitors will have to price, I think we feel quite positive at this point in time, quite frankly. The second one is elasticity for which I feel better because competitors, as I said, will have to price, too, but also because our brands are unique, and we have been investing quite a bit. We expect for the year volume to be mildly positive with a good contribution actually when we exclude the customer disruption. So at this point in time, given we don't control the level to which customer disruption will affect the plan, we wanted to be a little bit on the cautious side. And look, reality is if we push this through and we are successful, most likely, there will be a revenue upside. And so as I said, we feel good. Importantly, I want to say North America, we have very good plans as we go into 2024. And I think the lineup of all these plans, plus the continuation of the momentum in the acquired platforms, is good. I want to say Latin America is, in our case, continues to be good. AMEA, despite some of the challenges, has a lot of momentum in India and China that will continue. And finally, I think if you look at Europe, excluding customer disruption, the underlying business and the categories are doing well. So I believe the year will play out well for us, depending, obviously, on the extent of customer disruption."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Ken Goldman, JPMorgan.', 'Kenneth B. Goldman', ""I just wanted to clarify a little bit about the EPS guidance. So it's on algo off a $3.30 base, but it's actually above algo if we think about it on a like-for-like basis versus the $3.19, right, if you exclude gum from both 2023 and 2024. And please correct me, if that's not accurate. I'm just curious what would necessarily -- what gives you the confidence it will be a little bit above algo just on that like-for-like basis and maybe how much of that underlying is sort of the elimination of some stranded costs as you think about it? That might just give a little bit more of a boost of the year than we might typically have."", 'Luca Zaramella', ""Yes. Thank you for the question, Ken. We wanted to make sure it was clear that we are trying to eliminate all the stranded costs. And so we really wanted to guide high single-digit cost, the higher base. The confidence comes from the fact that, as I said, we're going to have, excluding the customer disruption, good volume momentum into the business, and that provides leverage. We will continue pricing in a very disciplined manner, and that will offset the material inflation that we see. Clearly, we will continue with cost discipline and productivity. And the fact that we will eliminate 70%, 80% of the stranded cost into '24 allows us to guide to high single digit off a higher base. In all this algo, we are not going to have, I have to say, 20% A&C increase another year, but it will be most likely high single digit or double digits. So we will continue investing across all the regions, across all the brands. And so we feel good about that. Remember, finally, that through the integration of Ricolino, there will be synergies coming to fruition. We are literally going live with SAP in a few days. And hopefully, that will unlock both revenue and cost synergies for 2024."", 'Kenneth B. Goldman', ""And then a quick follow-up. You mentioned disruption a little bit more in 1Q this year. With the understanding it's quite early, is there any way we can get a little bit more of a quantitative sense just to how to think about some of the impact potentially on the top and bottom line in the quarter? I realize, like I said, it's impossible to kind of completely forecast it at the time but just any kind of magnitude at this point would be helpful as we think about our models perhaps."", 'Luca Zaramella', ""Look, I think as you look at the Q1 revenue pacing, we're going to have a revenue, maybe a number that is a little bit below the full year algo. I think you're going to be hopefully happy with the numbers you see across 3 regions out of the 4. Europe is going to be more impacted in relative terms versus the impact that we have already in the base in '23, in Q2. And most likely volume/mix, excluding the customer disruption, is going to be a nice number and positive. I believe total volume/mix might be tilted to slightly negative because of the disruption. But I can't go any further than that. We are in the middle of negotiations and conversations with retailers and we have plans. We have a sense of what might happen. But time will tell exactly how we will land pricing in Europe."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane, Bank of America.', 'Bryan Douglass Spillane', ""I have a couple of questions actually. One is just getting back to the guidance. And I just want to tie in. It's $2 billion of share repurchase this year, but you also repurchased quite a bit of shares in the fourth quarter. So if we think about the impact that share repurchases or a lower share count would have on fiscal '24, it should be more than the roughly 2% that a $2 billion repo would suggest, right? Just simply because of the timing of your share repurchases were so late, it should drive the share count down a little bit more than we would normally see. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that correctly."", 'Luca Zaramella', ""I think you're thinking about that correctly, yes."", 'Bryan Douglass Spillane', ""Okay. All right. Because that's going to square to just how much we need to burden operating profit growth. And I think it's not going to be quite as high as it would have sort of looked. Okay. And then the second question, just Luca, if you could talk a little bit about Argentina. It's been topical over this earnings season for companies operating there. We've seen a range of outcomes, I guess, or actions companies have taken. So if you could just kind of walk us through Argentina, does the devaluation at all have any effect on local operations? What's incorporated into the guidance? And also maybe if you can just touch on, is that what's driving the FX guidance to be so moderate? We fielded that question a bunch over the last few minutes."", 'Luca Zaramella', ""So Argentina for us is around about a $600 million business. We are very happy the way the business has been managed over the years. We have a clear playbook. What matters in Argentina for us is not necessarily top line growth. It's not share. It is about protecting the cash that we have there. And Argentina has been consistently generating cash for us and we have been able also to take some cash out of the country. Some of the companies have talked about exposure on net monetary position. Our net monetary position is in control. It will go down over the course of '24 as we have a clear playbook. And by the way, we incent Argentina not like all the other business units. But we incent Argentina on net monetary position and net free cash flow generation. There was a little bit of a spike in net monetary exposure in Q4. And that was as the old government put in place some price control mechanism. But as those have been released, the net monetary position in Q1 is going to be very manageable, and I don't expect any major impact due to that. It's also fair to say that we have full control of the operation. We are free to price at this point in time, and the team is fully committed to protecting as much as they can the size and the scale of Argentina. So I don't see any issues or whatsoever in terms of impairment. Clearly, there has been material devaluation. The parallel market runs at rates that are even higher than the official one reported that are obviously already much higher than last year. And so we will have to cap most likely growth for Argentina going forward into 2024. Having said that, it becomes a moot point as we guide you to organic net revenue growth and ForEx impact. And so the two offset each other. And if you take the guidance we gave in terms of organic net revenue growth and the impact on revenue, which is around about 0.5 point of growth, that should do the trick in terms of your forecasting Mondelez in total."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore.', 'David Sterling Palmer', ""A couple questions. On Europe and pricing, so often we talk about the retailer customer and the dynamic of getting through pricing there. I wonder, as you're taking pricing this year, is your pricing strategy to offset the dollar impact that you're going to see from cocoa? It would seem like that would be a pretty reasonable expectation for the players there given what's happening with cocoa, but maybe there's some timing issues for 2024 there to think about. And then how -- from what you've seen from the consumer there, is the price elasticity there much different than what you would see from what you see in your biscuit business in the U.S., for example?"", 'Dirk Van de Put', ""Yes, your first assumption is correct in the sense that we are trying to offset the dollar impact of the inflation that we're seeing on our input costs, and we're not pricing for percentage margin but offsetting that dollar impact, which, yes, we believe is a reasonable position. I think this year, seeing the situation in Europe and the fact that the retailers are seeing probably some deflation in other areas of their business, it is a little bit of an explanation to explain that not only cocoa but also sugar or hazelnut are showing significant inflation, which is not the expectation. I think by now they understand that it has to happen in chocolate, so we have high hopes that we will be able to land that in a good way. As it relates to elasticity, I would say the elasticity in Europe has been very reasonable. We might maybe expect a little bit of an uptick as prices keep on going up for a third year in a row, particularly in chocolate. But there is very little or low down trading within the category because everybody will have to price. So it's a joint movement of all the brands. So we don't expect that there will be huge differences between different brands and no shifting of consumers. What we've seen in the past year is a strong price increase of 12% to 15% in Europe in chocolate with a very limited 0 to 0.5% effect on volume. And so that shows that the elasticity is very low. We think that it's driven because of strong brand loyalty. The fact that chocolate has a very distinct taste profile and consumers tend to stick with their chocolate brand because they like the taste and people recognize the taste of their brand, so private label is very small. And people do not tend to switch brands very easy. We call it the taste of the nation. Every country has their favorite chocolate. And then on top of that, we will do significant investments, very strong activations. We've been driving seasonals very hard. In the next year, we will celebrate 200 years of Cadbury, which will be a major activation in the U.K. So all that combined makes us believe and we have proved in the past that the elasticity will be limited to our opinion in chocolate in Europe."", 'David Sterling Palmer', ""And a quick follow-up. Distribution growth seems to be a key driver, a growth driver, for the company. I don't think I've heard you say how much of your organic sales growth will come from distribution expansion. But if you had to guess how many percentage points of that organic sales targets would come from that, what would you say?"", 'Dirk Van de Put', ""Well, roughly, you can assume for the markets where we can drive significant numerical distribution, I'm talking about in China and India, but we are now also starting to drive very hard in places like Brazil, probably, in those markets, you can expect that about 50% of our organic growth is driven through distribution expansion. On a global basis, we're probably talking about 2% of our extra growth coming from this. The runway of this is still quite big to give you a few numbers. So since 2019, we've added 1.7 million stores in China, India and Brazil. But for instance, our biscuits are now in about 3 million of the potential 6 million stores in China or our gum business is only in 2 million of the 6 million potential stores. In India, we've added 180,000 stores in '23. We deployed 100,000 new visi-coolers. But it is over 900 -- sorry, 9 million retail outlets, we cover directly 2 million, and we have about 3 million that are indirect coverage, so within 5 million of the 9 million stores in India. And I can go on in different countries. So I gave you the percentages and what it means for us. And the other message here is that the run rate, the years that we can keep on doing this are quite significant going forward."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen.', 'Robert Bain Moskow', ""I actually had a follow-up on the distribution question. Are you taking extra steps to monitor distribution levels at distributors or even the retailers in light of volatility of consumption. There's been multinationals who have fallen into inventory deloading situations in LatAm. You're expanding distribution so well, I'm just wondering if you're also taking extra steps to monitor it at the same time."", 'Dirk Van de Put', ""Yes. We are aware that the distribution expansion needs to be very well monitored. So what we're putting in place is a direct connection because we use mainly distributors to make this happen. It's a direct connection to their system, so we can read what they sell per store and what the sell-in is, how much the replenishment is. So we monitor that very carefully. We go slow in some of the cities where we're doing the expansion so that we make sure that we can see that setting up the whole distribution system is profitable and that it can be maintained. So we've had no surprises so far. I've done this many times in my career, and I've had surprises. But so far, things have gone quite smoothly. I think our teams around the world know what to do. They're on top of it. We usually accompany these distribution expansions with very heavy activation in the cities that we are doing this. So we feel pretty good that we have a very controlled way of doing it. And like I said, so far, we've had no surprises whatsoever, with this."", 'Robert Bain Moskow', ""And a follow-up on that. In some of these markets, you've introduced more digitized tools to enable small retailers or distributors to order or reorder and also monitor the performance on promotions, I think. Has that improved your ability to keep track of distribution and monitor sales? Like, are the tools better than they were 10 years ago to monitor all this?"", 'Dirk Van de Put', ""Yes. We are still in a relatively experimental phase with that. We are, for instance, mainly experimenting with this in Latin America, largely in channels that we have immediate big coverage. So as an example, I would say, bars in Brazil would be typically something that we don't cover directly or indirectly at the moment. But we have started to have a presence, and we are monitoring how that is going. I would say those tools help the retailer order directly and get our products in there. It helps us to understand how much the store sells. Yes, we can monitor promotions. As a tool to monitor how our distribution is evolving, it's probably complementary to the other system I was talking about, but we prefer at this stage to monitor that through our distributors. Because the way it works is they will order through this new app, and then we, through our normal distribution system, will deliver or we will use a third-party to do it. So that's usually the source of the monitoring of distribution, not necessarily the new app for us."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.', 'Stephen Robert R. Powers', ""Luca, I think based on the EPS guidance, combined with the $3.5-plus billion free cash flow guidance, towards the $3.5 billion, kind of ignoring the plus but focusing the $3.5 billion, I think it implies a 75% or lower free cash flow conversion. And I just wanted to kind of throw that past you and see if that's the message you intended to convey. If so, what might be some of the drags on that free cash flow conversion? Or if there's a higher level of free cash flow conversion we should anchor to as a target, maybe you could talk about that."", 'Luca Zaramella', ""Thank you for the question, Steve. As we think about the free cash flow and net income conversion into free cash flow, it's important to realize that the dividend payout of the joint ventures that we have is not 100%. And so that is a little bit of a factor as you consider the conversion. The other one I would tell you is we're going to have a slight uptick in CapEx, particularly, as we need to invest in places like India. I mean you look at the volume over the last 5 years in India, it has been stellar, and we are very happy. But we are at a point where we need to put down a little bit more capacity. Same goes for Latin America and OREO. And obviously, we integrate platforms like Ricolino, et cetera. The other one that will come into play in terms of capital expenses for '24 is SAP HANA. And so I think that's another element you have to consider. I think, look, the number I would like you to focus on is what we deliver in '23, which net of the taxes we paid for coffee, is around about [$4 billion]. And so there might some onetime payment coming our way. And so we need to make sure that we have enough headroom. But we want to reassure you that in terms of free cash flow, we are very happy. We have a best-in-class, I believe, cash conversion cycle. We continue to be very disciplined in terms of lowering overdue across the board. And inventories are coming down, and so we feel good about the cash flow generation of the company."", 'Stephen Robert R. Powers', ""Very good. And it sounds like you're going to talk a little bit more about this at CAGNY, but to the extent you can talk about it now, the prospects for volume recovery and organic growth acceleration in North America. I guess, how quickly do you think that is likely to manifest in '24? Is that going to be a slower build? Or do you think we should expect some results sooner as you leverage some of the commercial investments, it sounds like, you made in the fourth quarter?"", 'Dirk Van de Put', ""Yes. I think you said it right at the end there. In the fourth quarter, if you think about it, on one hand, we had a good year, and we were coming with a price increase, which, by the way, has been agreed in the U.S. in the beginning of the year. So no need to push in volumes from our side. Then we had the Clif system integration changeover. And so we needed to bring our inventory down and manage it very tightly. And then we talked about the Give & Go holiday kits that we stopped selling because the margins were not interesting for us. So if I exclude those and then look at the rest of the business, the volume/mix performance in Q4 was, in fact, quite good. So we're expecting a good volume/mix performance right away in Q1 of next year. It is really a one-off situation in Q4. So we don't really necessarily feel like there is a slowdown in North America. It's not going to be massive volume growth, but it's going to be positive volume growth in the beginning of the year. So that's where we are. It's not going to be a slow buildup. We will continue where we are without the exceptionals that we had in Q4."", 'Operator', 'Our last question comes from Alexia Howard, Bernstein.', 'Alexia Jane Burland Howard', ""So two questions. First of all, on innovation. I'm just wondering if you can give us a quick status update on whether the pace of innovation is likely to pick up going forward. It feels like with the pandemic and the supply chain disruption, it's been very hard to do innovation over the last several years. Do you anticipate a pickup going forward? And then I have a follow-up."", 'Dirk Van de Put', ""Yes. We are going through a bit of a change in the way we look at innovation. If you think about our business around the world, we have quite a rhythm of small innovation, new flavors, new sizes of packs as we do PPA and RGM. But that leads to hundreds of small projects, which do drive our business. But we are gradually eliminating probably close to half of those small projects because, in fact, over time, they don't have that much of an impact on the business. Since overall, our business is doing well, we can afford to do so, and we are shifting our focus to bigger innovation projects. And so the ones that I would mention is, first of all, making healthier versions of our mainstream products. So I'm referring to, for instance, what you've seen so far in OREO Gluten Free or OREO Zero Sugar in China; Gluten Free in the U.S. doing quite well. And you can expect that we will continue to expand those efforts across other brands. And then we are entering quite significantly in cakes and pastries. And there, you can expect us to push quite hard. And so you could see the OREO Cakesters or the Oreo Airy Cake in China. And these are all significant innovations that have the potential OF tens of millions of dollars of net revenue per country. We're pushing hard on premium chocolates. So we launched, for instance, the Toblerone pralines or we have done some big innovations on our core chocolate tablet. So these are bigger innovations that require more work and higher potential, but we are reshifting our efforts towards those. So I don't know if I would call it what you were asking, Alexia, do we see a pick-up in the pace of innovation. I think the impact of innovation on our growth will increase in the coming years. But it's not driven by more innovation. It's driven by better innovation, I would say."", 'Alexia Jane Burland Howard', ""Very helpful. And then can I just follow up finally, do you have any observations about the state of the American consumer? I think we've heard from other companies that they've been down trading. There's vulnerability. There's channel shifting. I'm just wondering whether some of the challenges being in North America are being driven by this consumer dynamic."", 'Dirk Van de Put', ""Yes, everything you're saying is true. Let me explain it a little bit. I would say the consumer, as it relates from a behavior standpoint, as in the fourth quarter, showed the biggest shift. And I can explain a little bit the shift that we've seen. But from a mindset perspective, from a confidence perspective, in North America, probably the best in the last 2.5 years. So what they're doing is still reflecting sort of the tension they're under, but they are expecting the economy to improve and that better times are ahead for them. So what are they doing? We see a little bit more of an elasticity effect. And the way they react to that is they're waiting more. We see particularly light buyers waiting for promotion, so not buying with the same frequency but buying more when it's on promotion. We see them downsizing, going to smaller formats and buying more of those. We see shift in channels. They go to club channels, e-commerce channels. That's the one we see winning. And then we have a number of sort of mechanical effects that we're seeing, particularly the SNAP reduction in the U.S. And so we see less disposable income for a certain group of consumers. But overall, I would say, we expect that, that gradually will improve because of that mindset change that I was saying. So the overall volume expectations as the year goes by in the U.S. we are expecting to accelerate to get better. That's a little bit our view on the consumer at the moment."", 'Alexia Jane Burland Howard', ""Great. I'll hand it back to you."", 'Dirk Van de Put', ""Well, thank you. I think that was the last question. As we said, we feel very good about '23. It was a great year for us. We are entering '24 with good momentum. I think we're prepared for everything that we are seeing ahead of it. And as I said, there is some issues that we have to look at. But despite all that, and including those effects into our forecast for the year, we think that we're going to have a strong year. We'll see how the client disruption goes in Europe. So we have to wait a little bit to see how the first quarter goes by. But overall, we think we will have and on to the higher side of our algorithm year at this stage that we can forecast. Again, thank you, and happy to answer any other questions that you would have through our IR department."", 'Luca Zaramella', 'Thank you, everyone.', 'Operator', ""This does conclude today's program.

Its operating ratio for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 73.7%, a significant deterioration from the 63.5% it posted a quarter earlier.', 'NS’ quarterly earnings report and the subsequent earnings call with analysts did not mollify Wall Street critics, two of whom took quick action: TD Cowen and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) cut their ratings on the East Coast-focused railroad, Cowen to market perform from overperform, and Morgan Stanley to underweight from equal weight.', '', 'Bank of America Merrill Lynch kept its buy rating, but reduced its earnings-per-share estimates for this year and 2025.', 'NS stock was trading at about $242.50 at the close Thursday. Earnings were released Friday, and the stock price immediately plummeted to about $227. The intraday high Tuesday was $237.75.', 'The irony is that in the past three months, Norfolk Southern stock has had a good run, up about 26.8%, per Barchart data. But for both the last month and the full year, it’s essentially flat.', 'In its comments to analysts, Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw said the company was targeting OR improvements of 100 to 150 basis points per year for the next three years. And the end result of that, according to several analysts clearly disappointed by that pace of change, is that NS would still have a lower OR than its peer Class 1 railroads.', 'On the earnings call Friday, Amit Mehrotra, the head of the transportation research team at Deutsche Bank, was blunt about the disappointment analysts felt about a projection they did not see as particularly aggressive.', '\xa0', '“If we look at the three-year plan, I think if you ask every railroad in North America, they tell you that they also would expect to improve margins by 100 basis points to 150 basis points a year from where we are today,” Mehrotra told Shaw, according to a transcript of the call. “So, I guess the negative implication of that outlook is that you’re not actually narrowing the gap, you’re just improving your position from where you are, but the gap actually stays intact.”', 'In a similar vein, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Ken Hoexter, discussing the three-year projection for reforms to have their full impact, said on the call: “I’m still surprised by that time frame. Should seem like there’s still moves that would get you that leverage a bit quicker, I guess, just compared to some moves we’ve seen on some other rails.”', 'Shaw, in response to an analyst question about the pace of change, said the three-year projection is “not an end point.”', '“We have talked about continuous productivity improvement as one of the three components of our balanced strategy of safe service, continuous productivity improvement and smart growth,” Shaw said.', 'In the Morgan Stanley downgrade, the transportation research team led by Ravi Shanker noted that the Norfolk Southern earnings missed consensus forecasts. Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $2.83, below a consensus forecast of $2.87.', 'Morgan Stanley said the shortfall “was similar to other rail prints in the quarter.” Guidance for 2024 on volume and cost inflation “was also consistent with what we have heard from other rails thus far.”', 'But as Morgan Stanley noted, given that NS was the worst-performing stock in 2023 of all the Class 1 railroads, analysts had hoped that Norfolk Southern would “drive the rail mean reversion trade going into 2024 (noting the big three-month surge in the price) given the easy comps once the February 2023 Ohio accident was lapped and given very negative sentiment on the Street around the name in 2023.”', 'Morgan Stanley’s report also focused on the OR gap with other railroads. As a point of comparison, Norfolk Southern’s OR north of 70% stands in stark contrast to the 60.9% posted by Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) and the 64.1% at CSX (NASDAQ: CSX).', 'TD Cowen’s Jason Seidl was scathing in his review. “If they just hit … the high end (of the 100-150 points per annum) every year for the next three years, NSC’s OR would still be below where [CSX] was in 2023,” Seidl wrote. “We do not view new financial guidance as closing the gap with competitors as management suggested given both other Class 1s are expected to see margin improvement off a much lower (better) 2023 base.”', 'Investors “[have] been looking at NSC’s lagging OR as a potential for easier and better rate-of-change as well as stronger operating leverage when volumes returned,” the Morgan Stanley report said. “While all rails that have reported thus far likely disappointed on 4Q operating leverage (or lack thereof) despite improving volumes and implied constraints in 2024, the fact that NSC’s OR gap vs. peers actually grew, the more removed we have been from the Ohio accident, leaves the management team with more heavy lifting to do.”', 'NS did use the occasion of the earnings release and the analyst call to say it planned to cut management head count by 7% “to help offset increases in critical operating areas.” The railroad came under heavy criticism after the East Palestine, Ohio, derailment, with accusations that it had cut too deeply into operating and safety expenses; the head count cutbacks do not include any reductions in staff out on the railroad.', 'Shaw, in response to another analyst question, said the company was “entering the third year of a freight recession, and with the investments that we’ve made in safety and service that are delivering meaningful results, it’s clear that our cost structure is too high for our revenue base entering 2024.”', 'That view on costs was similar to what was expressed by TD Cowen in its downgrade of NS stock. “While the U.S. Class I rails struggle to find the next growth lever for top line growth, NSC’s cost structure should continue to notably underperform its peer group for this year,” TD Cowen wrote.', 'More articles by John Kingston', 'EBITDA at TriumphPay, its key metric, turned positive in Q4', 'Teamsters rack up late-2023 wins, stage significant strike in ’24', 'Court rules CRST team drivers must be paid for some hours in sleeper berth', 'The post Norfolk Southern’s weak Q4, deteriorating OR draw Wall Street criticism appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

You could certainly do worse. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) boasts a market-beating long-term track record, proving that his methods pay off for patient investors."", ""That doesn't necessarily mean every Berkshire holding is a must-have name, however. Even the best of the best aren't perfect. The Oracle of Omaha and his acolytes are guilty of the occasional misread, too."", ""With that as the backdrop, here's a look at two Berkshire holdings you might want to scoop up for yourself and one name currently held by Berkshire Hathaway that you may want to steer clear of."", ""It's been a tough couple of years for banks and, by extension, for bank stocks. Although higher interest rates improve the profitability of lending, they also slow the economy, crimping demand for loans. Delinquencies and defaults are also on the rise."", ""Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) hasn't been immune to this challenge. Share prices are down more than 30% from their early 2022 peak. However, you don't buy stocks based on where their underlying company has been. You own stocks based on where that company is going. And where BofA is going is somewhere much better than most of the market at this time."", ""We caught a glimpse of this reality with the bank's recently reported fourth-quarter numbers. For the three-month stretch that ended in December, revenue and income were both down year over year, but the bulk of that decline is linked to changes in interest rates and the current credit and lending environment. Income stemming from services like investment advice, trading, investment banking, and credit cards was healthy, even if it was lower than it's been in recent quarters."", 'This slight improvement suggests the domestic and global economy is healing faster than it feels like it is. Bank of America\'s CEO Brian Moynihan said he expects a relatively pain-free ""soft landing"" for the economy, easing back into sustained growth. The U.S. economy\'s Q4 GDP growth rate of 3.3% underscores Moynihan\'s optimism; economists predicted growth of 2%.', ""Buffett and his team are holding onto their shares as the economy recovers. Berkshire Hathaway holds a little over 1 million shares of BofA, collectively worth over $28 billion. If you jump now, you'll get it while the stock's priced at less than 11 times this year's expected per-share earnings of $3.15. The dividend yield of 2.9% isn't too shabby, either."", 'Warren Buffett has several well-known investment tips. Only invest in businesses you understand, limit your picks to high-quality companies, and look for real value -- even if that value comes in the form of cash dividends.', 'The Oracle of Omaha practices what he preaches.', ""There's arguably no Berkshire holding that better exemplifies Buffett's advice than Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and the 400-million share position Berkshire has maintained since 2006. The business model is easy to understand; the company's brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juices, and of course Coca-Cola's sodas are, of course, all leading names, and the stock provides plenty of reliable and tangible value. Not only has the company paid a quarterly dividend for decades, but it has raised its annual dividend payout for an incredible 62 consecutive years! Its yield right now is a solid 3.1%."", ""Granted, Coca-Cola faces some headwinds at the moment as it works to fully absorb or pass along rising commodity and freight costs in an increasingly competitive environment. There is also the fact that technology has made it easier not only for consumers to find alternative products but also for Coca-Cola's rivals to snag market share."", ""However, this company's got an edge you may not be aware of."", ""Coca-Cola doesn't do much of its own bottling anymore. Several years ago it sold off most of its U.S. bottling operations to localized franchisers who ultimately take on the burden and cost risk of bottling and distribution. The core of the company's business model now is selling concentrated flavor syrups to these bottlers and then marketing the daylights out of the product. While this approach generates less revenue, it's also a business model with less risk and much higher profit margins."", ""In other words, Coca-Cola's cash flow and subsequent dividends are well protected -- a detail that Warren Buffett and Berkshire's other chiefs certainly recognize."", ""While most of Berkshire Hathaway's picks make sense, there's also the occasional clunker. Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA) is arguably one of them. Berkshire's position began raising eyebrows as soon as the holding company established it in early 2022. It has since raised its stake and even more eyebrows as it now totals 93.7 million shares and is valued at $1.2 billion."", 'Yes, this is the same Paramount that used to be ViacomCBS -- parent to the CBS network, Viacom Studios, cable channels like Comedy Central, MTV, and Nickelodeon, streaming platform Paramount+, and free-to-watch television service PlutoTV.', ""While they're all respectable entertainment brands, nearly every aspect of these media businesses is on the defensive. Revenue is more or less stagnant, as are operating earnings. Its streaming operations remain in the red despite demonstrated revenue growth. Meanwhile, it's seeing declines in its TV and film revenue. The company is reportedly hunting for a media partner to merge with -- or even shopping around for a potential buyer -- as a means of saving itself while it still has some marketable value left to tap. Although that's arguably the smart move to make at this time, it's also a clear sign that Paramount Global is far from thriving."", ""So, why did Berkshire Hathaway buy it? Again, nobody's perfect. The misstep is even a bit understandable, in fact, given the circumstances at the time the position was first established."", ""Think back to the way things were in early 2022. The dust from a frenzy of launches and expansions of streaming services around that time (during the COVID-19 pandemic) had yet to settle. It wasn't clear what the future of the streaming market would look like then. It was just clear that the pandemic had cemented consumers' interest in streaming into place. Berkshire wanted a promising stake in the business; Paramount appeared to be a solid bet. It's only been recently that the grim realities of streaming are coming to light. That is, it's an expensive, competitive business to be in. And cable TV isn't in any better shape."", ""That's not to say Paramount is doomed. It likely will find a partner or buyer. It's looking for this strategic alternative from a position of weakness, though. You should be looking for companies operating from a position of strength."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bank of America wasn't one of them.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR)."", ""Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Whirlpool ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Whirlpool is:', '19% = US$488m ÷ US$2.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.19 in profit."", ""Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Whirlpool has a similar ROE to the average in the Consumer Durables industry classification (17%)."", ""That isn't amazing, but it is respectable. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 3 risks we have identified for Whirlpool."", ""Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same."", ""It's worth noting the high use of debt by Whirlpool, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.85. While its ROE is respectable, it is worth keeping in mind that there is usually a limit as to how much debt a company can use. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it."", ""Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", 'But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

(Operator Instructions) With that, I'll turn the call over to Marc."", 'Marc Robert Bitzer', ""Thanks, Korey, and good morning, everyone. Today marks our first earnings call in the new year, and I do appreciate that everyone's attention will be on our perspective for 2024. However, I want to take the opportunity to reflect and look back at last year. During this past year, there have been a number of achievements we're proud of. One, we gained more than 1 point of market share in North America. This is a clear testimony of success of our great products and brands in the marketplace. Two, we were able to reduce our net cost base by $800 million, which is what we had in mind when we started the year. And three, the signing of our EMEA transaction with Arçelik marked a major milestone in our portfolio transformation and is expected to provide significant opportunities to unlock value. At the same time, there are a number of areas where we fell short of our own expectations. The promotional environment, which reversed back earlier than anticipated to pre-COVID intensity put pressure on our EBIT margins. And while our full year EBIT margin of 6.1% is solid, it is still more than 1 point short of where we wanted to be. And we were not able to reduce our inventories fast enough, which negatively impacted our full cash flow. Obviously, these results were impacted by a still unfavorable housing cycle in 2023. The rapid and steep increase of U.S. mortgage rates led essentially to a freeze of existing home sales. Ultimately, this resulted in the lowest existing home sales in almost 3 decades. And given the strong historical correlation between existing home sales and appliance sales, the discretionary appliance sales which are margin attractive slowed down significantly. This was mitigated by strong replacement demand which tends to be less margin attractive. These strong replacement sales confirmed our view of more intensive use patterns of appliances leading to shorter replacement cycles, a favorable trend which we expect to continue in foreseeable future. Now the key question is what does this all mean for 2024? Let me start on the housing macro cycle. We remain bullish on the mid- and long-term housing cycle. The market has been undersupplied for over a decade by 3 million to 4 million units. The long overdue rebalancing of demand and supply will occur at one point, but not in the very short term. While we already see a gradual and steady recovery of new home orders and starts, we all know that these trends typically need 6 to 9 months to turn into appliance sales. The existing home sales market, on the other hand, will need a catalyst to unfreeze. That catalyst can only be a return to lower mortgage rates which we expect to moderate as the year progresses. So how will we position ourselves in 2024? Essentially, it will be all around cost discipline and margin expansion. On the cost side, we have put actions in place to deliver $300 million to $400 million in cost savings. While this number may appear lower than in 2023, we're not factoring any raw material savings. So with $300 million to $400 million are all structural cost takeout actions. The margin expansion will essentially be driven by the benefits of a refocused portfolio after the completion of EMEA transaction as well as a very disciplined approach focused only on value-creating promotions and product mix. You will see later in our presentation a full year negative impact of pricing, but this is entirely related to carryover pricing effects. Lastly, as it relates to our portfolio transformation, we continue to expect to close our EMEA transaction by April. And in anticipation of this transaction closure, we are changing our reporting segments. We will not only highlight our major domestic appliance business in North America, Latin America and Asia, but also provide visibility to our KitchenAid small domestic appliance global business. With strong margins, the KitchenAid small domestic appliance business is a critical component of our brand and product portfolio, improving life at home for our consumers. I am confident that our refocused portfolio cost actions and improving free cash flow generation positions us for continued shareholder value creation in 2024. Now turning to Slide 6. I will provide an overview of our fourth quarter results. We delivered over 3% of revenue growth, including over 1 point of year-over-year share gains in North America, coupled with $350 million of reduced costs. Working capital conversion and free cash flow of $366 million was impacted by shipments occurring later in the quarter than expected. We exited 2023 with elevated trade customer inventories, which we expect to normalize mostly in the first quarter of 2024. Ultimately, we delivered ongoing earnings per share of $3.85, supported by tax benefits related to the Europe transaction. And now I will turn it over to Jim to review our Q4 regional results and perspective on 2024, including our plans for the proceeds of a recently announced EMEA transaction."", 'James W. Peters', ""Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, I'll review fourth quarter results for our North America business. We delivered 1% of revenue growth and 260 basis points of margin expansion. Sales growth was driven by over 1 point of year-over-year share gains resulting from new product introductions and improved supply chain execution. While this was partially offset by a normalized promotional environment, additionally, resilient replacement demand lifted the U.S. industry 2%. Fourth quarter margin expansion was driven by significantly reduced cost, partially offset by negative price mix from a normalized promotional environment and lower consumer discretionary demand due to higher mortgage rates in 2023, slowing down existing home sales. Overall, the region delivered 8.4% margins for the quarter. Turning to Slide 8. I'll review our results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa business. Revenue was down 3% year-over-year as the region continues to see demand weakness from negative consumer sentiment. Strong cost takeout actions and held-for-sale accounting benefits drove nearly 400 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year to approximately 3%. We continue to expect the Europe transaction to close by April 2024, and later in the call, I will provide additional insights into the expected impact to our 2024 guidance and free cash flows. Turning to Slide 9, I'll review the results for our Latin America business. With strong industry demand throughout the region and share gains in Brazil, net sales, excluding currency, increased to approximately 13%. The Overall, the region delivered solid EBIT margins of 6%, flat to last year as cost actions were offset by negative price mix and losses in Argentina from currency devaluation and costs related to ramping up our new laundry factory. Turning to Slide 10, I'll review the results for our Asia business. The region saw growth of 9% and driven by share gains and improving industry. EBIT margins of 1.3% with cost takeout actions more than offset by negative price mix. As you may have seen, we recently announced our intention to sell up to 24% of Whirlpool India's outstanding shares while retaining a majority interest. We truly believe in the long-term trajectory of India. It is one of the strongest growth opportunities for Whirlpool. Whirlpool of India's long-term outlook for growth and margins are both in the high single digits, making India very attractive to operate in. At the same time, this financial profile has created a very strong local public market valuation. Turning to Slide 12. I will review our 2024 guidance, which includes the Europe major domestic appliance business only for the first quarter of the year. We have provided a reset baseline for 2023 results, excluding our Europe major domestic appliance business from Q2 through Q4 of 2023. The reset baseline excludes approximately $2.6 billion net sales and approximately $33 million of EBIT, creating a like-for-like comparison for 2024. On a like-for-like basis, 2023 net sales were approximately $16.9 billion with ongoing EBIT margin of 6.8%. We expect flat 2024 net sales, including $700 million of sales from the EMEA major domestic appliance business in Q1 and flat the EBIT margin year-over-year on a like-for-like basis. We expect 2024 free cash flow of $550 million to $650 million, a 50% to 75% increase driven by improved earnings and working capital reduction. We expect full year ongoing earnings per share of $13 to $15, including an adjusted effective tax rate of 0%, an increase compared to 2023 and which impacts 2024 earnings per share by approximately $1. Turning to Slide 13, we show the drivers of our full year 6.8% ongoing EBIT margin guidance. We expect a negative impact of 150 to 175 basis points from price mix. This reflects the first half of 2024 carryover effect as the promotional environment normalized in the second half of 2023. We also expect continuing softer mix and discretionary demand in the first half of 2024 from historically low existing home sales, partially offset by new product introductions. As we drive further reductions to our cost structure, we expect approximately 175 basis points of net cost margin benefit from $300 million to $400 million of cost takeout actions. We expect minimal to no impact to EBIT margins from raw materials this year based on recent commodity trends and executed supply agreements. We plan to continue a strong cadence of new product introductions with investments in marketing and technology impacting margins by approximately 25 basis points. Finally, we expect our portfolio transformation to provide approximately 75 basis points of margin improvement as we contribute the margin-dilutive European major domestic appliance business to the newly formed company. On Slide 14, I will provide context on our significant cost takeout opportunity. We experienced unprecedented cost inflation of approximately $2.5 billion in 2021 and 2022. In 2023, we were able to drive $800 million of cost takeout which is a significant step in resetting our cost structure. We expect to further reduce our costs by $300 million to $400 million this year. 2024 will benefit from $100 million of cost actions taken last year. We expect $100 million to $200 million of additional cost takeout with our manufacturing and supply chain operations, benefiting from ongoing productivity initiatives and reduce complexity as we enter 2024. And we also expect $100 million of second half benefit as our ongoing portfolio transformation allows us to simplify our organizational operating model. Turning to Slide 15. I will introduce our new segment reporting structure effective January 1, 2024. We have updated our reporting structure with the anticipated closure of the Europe transaction. Our regional operating segments historically included the results of our KitchenAid small domestic appliance business in the geographical regions they operated in. We will now only report the major domestic appliance businesses within their respective regions. We will now report our global KitchenAid small domestic appliance business, also known as SDA as a separate segment. This business has an iconic brand and premium products with a reputation for performance and quality, perfectly fitting our vision of being the best kitchen and laundry company. We will continue to have strong brand synergies between the small domestic appliance and major domestic appliance product portfolio. The regional MDA businesses will have margin profiles, 30 to 40 basis points lower than the previously reported figures due to SDA reporting as its own segment. On our Investor Relations website and yesterday's 8-K, we have provided recast quarterly results for 2021 through the third quarter of 2023 and reflecting our $1 billion SDA business with its strong 15%-plus margins. Turning to Slide 16, I will review our new segment guidance. Starting with industry demand, we expect a dynamic global industry to be flat to up 2%. We expect to see similar demand trends in the U.S. that we saw in the second half of 2023, with resilient replacement demand creating a solid footing for industry volumes and consumer discretionary demand continuing to be impacted by elevated mortgage rates driving down existing home sales. Overall, we expect MDA North America to be flat to slightly positive as well as we expect the MDA Latin America industry to also be flat to slightly positive. India has one of the fastest growth rates globally, and we expect MDA Asia industry volumes to accelerate by 4% to 6%. While we expect the SDA global industry to be up 2% to 4%, we want to preface this guidance with the fact that KitchenAid is largely present in the premium segment and also not in all SDA categories. Finally, we expect demand contraction of negative 8% to 6% in the first quarter for MDA Europe from continued negative consumer sentiment. For MDA North America, we expect to deliver full year margins of approximately 9%, with promotional carryover negatively impacting first half margins and elevated channel inventories impacting first quarter demand. We expect approximately 50 to 75 basis points of sequential margin expansion every quarter and to exit 2024 with EBIT margins of approximately 10%. For MDA Latin America, we expect EBIT expansion and strong margins of 6.5%, with cost takeout actions and improved consumer sentiment. For MDA Asia, we expect margin expansion to approximately 3% EBIT margins. For SDA Global, we expect very attractive EBIT margins of approximately 15.5%. Lastly, we expect MDA Europe to deliver approximately 1.5% margins in the first quarter and overall expect an ongoing total EBIT margin of 6.8%. Turning to Slide 17. Let me provide you with additional detail on our U.S. industry expectations. Replacement demand drove industry growth in 2023, and we expect this trend to continue into 2024. The last 4 years of elevated usage is shrinking the historical average life of appliances, coupled with an installed base from 2015 through 2017 that grew 4% to 5% and is nearing replacement. This is driving replacement demand to approximately 60% of industry volumes. We expect to continue to drive value-creating share gain in 2024. With housing starts trending higher in the second half of 2023, Whirlpool is disproportionately positioned to benefit from new construction demand. Forecast for 2024 are calling for low to mid-single-digit growth in housing starts, most likely benefiting Whirlpool in the second half of 2024 or 2025. For every 5% increase in new construction, we could see approximately $100 million impact with our leading builder share. Finally, discretionary demand, which accounts for approximately 25% of total industry volumes is driven by existing home sales which are coming off their worst year since 1995 and are expected to improve in the back half of 2024 as interest rates moderate. Turning to Slide 18. I will share further perspective on 2024. We expect soft discretionary demand and higher retail inventory levels to weigh on total industry expectations in the first half of 2024, with a more pronounced impact on Q1. We expect 2024 promotional activity to be at similar levels as the second half of 2023, creating a margin headwind to the first half of the year. We expect cost actions from 2023 to benefit the first half of 2024, while additional cost actions ramp up. Additionally, the demand and earnings seasonality of our SDA global business varies from our major domestic appliance business. It delivers approximately 75% of its demand and profitability in the second half of every year with consumers favoring small domestic appliances as gifts and increased baking activities in the fall and holiday season. Overall, we expect to deliver approximately 35% to 40% of our earnings in the first half of the year. Turning to Slide 19. I will provide the drivers of our free cash flow guidance. We expect improved cash earnings of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. We expect approximately $600 million of capital expenditures as we continue to invest in our products and fund organic growth, including our plans to launch over 100 new products in 2024. We plan to improve our working capital conversion by approximately $100 million, largely through inventory reductions. We expect approximately $50 million of restructuring cash outlays related to previously executed actions and complexity reduction with our simplified organizational model after the Europe transaction. Overall, we expect to deliver free cash flow of $550 million to $650 million or approximately 3.5% of net sales, including approximately $200 million to $300 million of cash consumption for MDA Europe business operations prior to the closure and onetime charges. Turning to Slide 20, I will review how we are well positioned to deliver our 2024 capital allocation priorities. We have a solid balance sheet with $1.6 billion of cash on hand coupled with $550 million to $650 million of 2024 expected free cash flows plus anticipated $400 million to $500 million of proceeds from asset sales as we previously announced our intention to sell a portion of our interest in Whirlpool of India and recently signed an agreement to divest of our Brastemp branded water filtration business in Brazil. As you can see, we are well positioned to deliver our clear capital allocation priorities for 2024. Last year marked the 68th consecutive year of steady or increasing dividends from Whirlpool. Subject to Board approval, we expect a dividend of approximately $400 million. We are committed to maintaining our strong investment-grade credit rating and reducing our debt by at least an additional $500 million. We expect limited share buybacks to offset share dilution. Finally, we are committed to funding innovation and growth with capital expenditures plus research and development of approximately 6% of net sales. Turning to Slide 21. You can see our commitment to deleveraging our balance sheet. As a reminder, in 2022, with the acquisition of the value-creating InSinkErator business, we increased our debt by $2.5 billion in term loans. Compared to 2022, we expect at least $1 billion of debt reduction by the end of this year. With the combination of strong free cash flows expected in 2025 in the first full year following the close of the Europe transaction and our product innovations delivering earnings expansion and beginning to realize the free cash flow benefits of our adjusted effective tax rate, we are confident in our ability to further reduce our net debt leverage to approximately 2x by 2026. Now I will turn the call back over to Marc."", 'Marc Robert Bitzer', ""Thanks, Jim. Turning to Slide 23. Let me provide an update on our Europe transaction. As I mentioned in our third quarter earnings call, we passed major regulatory milestones with the approvals from the European Commission, Germany, Austria and China. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority is in the process of conducting a Phase 2 review of the transaction. We are continuing a constructive dialogue with the CMA about the newly formed company that will benefit consumers. And we continue to expect the transaction will close by April. Turning to Slide 24. Let me recap what you heard today. We will further improve our cost structure and are confident in our ability to deliver $300 million to $400 million of cost takeout. Our portfolio transformation to a higher-growth, higher-margin business continues to progress. The Europe transaction will meaningfully accelerate our structural free cash flows by approximately $200 million to $300 million in 2025. We have clear capital allocation priorities, including strong dividends and reducing debt leverage, supported by a flexible balance sheet with $1.6 billion of cash on hand, along with strong 2024 cash generation. We're confident in the trajectory of our business and our portfolio transformation to deliver sustained shareholder returns. Finally, I will close on Slide 25 with an invitation to join us at our 2024 Investor Day on February 27th at the New York Stock Exchange. We look forward to hosting our first Investor Day since 2019, and we plan to review how our portfolio transformation is creating a very different Whirlpool, positioning us towards higher growth and higher-margin business. We're excited to review our growth and margin expansion opportunities for our MDA North America business. We will highlight the rich history of our Premium KitchenAid SDA business in addition to introducing the remainder of our 2026 value-creation goals. We hope to see you there. Now we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.', 'Samuel John Darkatsh', ""Two questions. The first around the raw material assumption and the second question will be around North America major appliance margins. So first, around raw materials, the -- you're saying it's going to be neutral on a year-on-year basis. Obviously, we can see that cold-rolled steel is up meaningfully of late and on a year-on-year basis. So how much of your steel spend is on contract this year? And is there an assumption that steel prices fall from here baked into your guidance? Or what sort of offsets are there to steel? Just help reconcile what we're seeing in the markets versus what you're seeing on your RMI."", 'Marc Robert Bitzer', ""Sam, it's Marc. Let me first maybe take the raw material question, then we can come to the NA margin question. First of all, I know you're well aware but more for the broad audience. Our #1 raw material steel; #2 is resins in all forms and then it can split up in smaller elements. As you know, in '23, we got a tailwind from raw materials. And right now, we're guiding pretty much for almost no effect of this one. Raw material, again, as I mentioned, steel is the #1 driver. And there is no -- you don't have formal hedging contracts with steel, you basically have a contract with individual steel suppliers, which are regional. And they typically are on an annual basis, certainly for U.S., less so in Latin America but also in Europe, you have pretty much annual contracts. These annual contracts, and that's why we have a very high degree of confidence in raw material assumption, they are largely locked in now. So typically, these negotiations happen November, December, in that time line. And they're not done of a kind of on-the-spot CRU spot price, they're kind of done more on rolling averages and certain assumptions about flow and color. So with all of these contracts, the majority of these contracts fully in place, again, with the exception of Latin America, the variation, which we expect from a steel price is very, very little. So that's why on the #1 component, we have a very high degree of certainty. The #2 component, resins, they're more on a quarterly base. And obviously, there is an element about oil price assumptions in there, which you have a little bit more variation. But again, it's relative to steel, it's much smaller. So again, on these 2 components, Sam, we feel we're contractually protected or right now, we have, certainly in plastics, I think we have a reasonable assumption for full year."", 'Samuel John Darkatsh', ""Got it. And then the North American margin question. So what was the fourth quarter '23 North America margin, excluding small appliances? And what is your assumed '24 exit rate for North American major appliances versus the 9% annual guide?"", 'Marc Robert Bitzer', ""And so Sam, North America margin in Q4 where we posted the 8.4%, roughly -- and we referred to a full year base, KitchenAid typically has an impact of about 40 basis points on our margin business in North America. Now that's a little bit -- there's a little bit of seasonality in KitchenAid with a heavy skew towards Q3 and Q4. So you take that out of the equation, you're pretty much exiting in '23, where we're exiting around 8% roughly, North American margin, which, as we talked, that's about a good point below where we wanted to be in all transparency. We guide the full year excluding KitchenAid on 9%. And I think also in our prepared remarks, we were referring to -- we expect to exit '24 with around 10% North America margin."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan.', 'Michael Jason Rehaut', ""First, I would love to get a sense just of the -- how you're thinking about the promotional backdrop and cadence in North America MDA as '24 progresses. I know that you kind of highlighted that on a consolidated basis, and you expect price/mix to be negative in the first half and flat in the back half. But I was hoping to trying to get a sense of the interplay between how you expect '24 to play out in terms of managing share gains, which you kind of highlighted another point of share in the fourth quarter and how do you expect to manage the promotional backdrop as it progresses.And I guess part of the question here is to the extent that promotions continue to, let's say, increase in the near term, how you'd manage that versus your desire to continue to regain share."", 'Marc Robert Bitzer', ""Mike, it's Marc. So let me try to address it. And let me first take a little bit the Q4 in the rear mirror on North America, because I think that highlights a lot of challenges and opportunities which we have. And then as much as we can talk, I can give you a broader direction on '24.So if you look back at Q4 '23, in particular North America, ultimately, it comes down to the amount of -- the absolute amount of marketing and promotion dollars we've put in the market are not unusual compared to pre-COVID. The big difference was that the lift on discretionary demand was very limited. So ultimately, in hindsight, the ROI on some of the promotions did not work out the way we expected. So as you know, we repeatedly talked about, we focused on value creation promotions. And in hindsight, some of these promotions did not meet that benchmark. It's just because the discretionary demand of a pool of discretionary demand in the market was limited, so the whole equation got unbalanced and then led to some margin erosion in Q4. As I also said, as we look into '24, and as you know, we don't give any forward-looking comments on pricing, et cetera. But I said our focus is on margin expansion. I mentioned the exit margins are below where we want it to be. Right now, our focus is on margin expansion, obviously deploying all levers which are at our disposal. That's cost takeout, that's pricing, how we manage the mix, how we manage a new product introduction. But the focus is on margin expansion, and that is in the context of we feel good about our share gains. And right now, the level of share where we come from gives us a solid base, and we will, at least for foreseeable future, will -- are focused on margin expansion."", 'Michael Jason Rehaut', ""Great. I appreciate that. I guess -- and I apologize if this is something that I missed in maybe the supplemental or some of the other comments, but just love to get a little more detail on FDA for 2024 in terms of the overall size. I know you talked about the margin or the profit cadence, a quarter of profits in the first half, 3 quarters in the back half. But just how you're thinking about that segment and where the margins were in '23, just to get a comparable there."", 'Marc Robert Bitzer', ""Yes, Mike, I can take this. And first of all, apart from a supplement, that -- we will spend a lot of time -- a lot more time on February 27 at our Investor Day to show you a little bit of history of KitchenAid, the margin run rate, the seasonality. So there will be a lot more color to your question. So on a high level, right now, it's -- the seasonality is similar to what you described. So there is more skew towards the back half around the holidays. But even in the first half, there are some important holidays, which always matter for KitchenAid like -- and we manage accordingly. The broader margins, and again, we will show that in the supplement, which you will see soon are the 15.5%, which we guide to '24 is slightly higher than the '23 one. But even if I look at a multiyear KitchenAid SDA margin, it typically hovers around 15% EBIT. So it's a very solid and margin accretive business for us, which, of course, we want to grow significantly more going forward."", 'James W. Peters', ""Yes, Michael. I think the other thing to highlight, you'll see in all the supplemental materials we provided is really, if you look at the historical run rate of the business, it has been around $1 billion plus and 15.5%. And so some of the information that we did provide obviously showed a time period when that benefit -- or that business benefited from some of the trends that were going on during COVID. But I'd say today, what Marc highlighted in there in the size and all that is really more representative of the trend that business has been on and why we're excited about the growth and the margins we have within there."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs.', 'Susan Marie Maklari', 'My first question is you mentioned the $300 million to $400 million of cost actions that you expect to take this year. As you think about the ability to continue to reduce the cost structure, how are you balancing that relative to the growth initiatives that you have and the targets to get the business closer to those long-term goals?', 'James W. Peters', ""Yes, Susan. So this is Jim. And I think the thing you've got to look at there as we talk about the cost takeout is you saw this year to begin with, we significantly invested in technology and engineering and in our products, and you saw that in our overall walk. And so if you really look at how that $300 million to $400 million breaks down, the first $100 million of that is just cost savings we already implemented this year that are in areas that don't affect our ability to grow and drive innovation. Then we talk about maybe the next $100 million to $200 million within there, and that's really driving efficiency both within our supply chain, our factories and that comes from ongoing initiatives that we have that are just to become much more efficient in terms of how we manufacture or much more efficient in how we get product to our consumers in the end. And so again, those are not areas, those don't affect the investments that we make. And then if you think about the third bucket there that we've talked about is really SG&A reductions from a simplified organizational model. That also is just us looking at how we operate as a company and how we operated in the past with a much larger business, including EMEA, how do we simplify it, how do we make it more effective? Our investments within our products, whether it be engineering or capital will actually be relatively consistent to even up this year. So the areas where we're cutting costs are not the areas that affect our ability to deliver growth and innovation. We're actually investing -- what we are is we're reducing cost in other areas so we can invest more in those areas."", 'Marc Robert Bitzer', ""So Susan, just to echo what Jim is saying and to be really crystal clear, we will -- we have and we will continue to invest steadily in new products and brand investments. Last year, despite all the pressure, we invested 75 basis points more into new product marketing and technology. We will continue to do so in '24. And as you've seen also from capital plans, we are prepared to invest in new products. That's ultimately the lifeblood of our company and creates future growth. At the same time, we're also very mindful that we get a great fund for that. And these funds, to Jim's point, they come from carryover actions, they come from manufacturing efficiency. And frankly, after the Europe transaction is closed, we have a simpler business, and we will take advantage of relooking at our SG&A base in terms of how can we take advantage of now what is globally a much simpler and easier business where we don't need to have all the complexity in its current structure."", 'Susan Marie Maklari', ""Okay. That's very helpful color. And then my second question is thinking about the cash flows. You mentioned that you came into the year with inventories a bit higher than what you had anticipated. Any thoughts on the timing of working that back down and what that might mean for the cadence of the cash generation this year?"", 'James W. Peters', ""Yes. Susan, so this is Jim. And listen, here's what I would say, is we talked about within our numbers, the overall cash flow guidance for the year that will reduce working capital by about $100 million at a minimum. I think what you'll see is you'll see some of that come more probably within the second and third quarter as we just look at where things are because we did already talk about that retailer inventory levels at the beginning of the year were higher than we anticipated. And so obviously, we believe that will put some pressure on shipments in the first half of the year and our goal is to make sure we keep our inventories in line with the shipments, but then begin to reduce those inventories as we have the opportunity, but also then as we expect to see sales ramp up a little bit later in the year. So I would say not necessarily in the first quarter, but more in the middle half of the year is when you should expect to see us reducing inventories."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research.', 'David Sutherland MacGregor', 'Can you talk a little bit about the market share gains and at what price points? And was this really just a recovery of some of the share that you lost during the pandemic? Or do you think it might have been incremental with a different consumer or the different price point? And how does all this kind of mesh with what the consumer is doing right now in terms of mixing up or mixing down?', 'Marc Robert Bitzer', ""So David, I mean, first of all, the 1 point or 1.1 point to be precise, full year gains in North America were -- and the good thing is they're spread across multiple product categories. So there's basically not a single product category where we would point to share weakness. We grew across the board. Obviously, a number of new product introductions helped and supported that share growth. The other element, which partially helped, but is not yet fully visible, we had significant share growth in the national builder business. But obviously, because the broader market is still soft, that it's not yet fully showing, but that's a big source of share gains. So it's pretty much across the board. I wouldn't point to specific price point. Now against the context of a broader market, and this is coming back to what I think we mentioned also in the last earnings call. The nature of a market, which is now so heavily impacted by the replacement markets, and again, with 60% of our sales right now of the total market, which is much more than past, replacement market inherently comes with a slightly lower margin profile than discretionary demand. it's just what it is because consumers either look for specific dimensions or are in a rush, they only have 1 or 2 days to make decisions, so that typically comes at a lower margin profile. So I wouldn't point to specific price points where we gain market share but the broader market being so heavily replacement-driven, that doesn't necessarily help you from a price mix compared to previous periods."", 'David Sutherland MacGregor', ""Got it. And then just as a follow-up, I want to go back to the $300 million to $400 million cost reductions. I guess my question is really a clarification. This is a net number, right? It's net of any inflation in your non-raw material variable costs and fixed costs? In other words, your gross number..."", 'James W. Peters', 'Yes. This is a net number, like we always put on the net cost line. And so again, yes, it takes more in gross actions to get to this number as we have to offset inflation in certain areas and especially in some of our higher-growth emerging markets outside the U.S., but this is a net $300 million to $400 million.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets.', 'Michael Glaser Dahl', 'So a follow-up on the inventory comments. When you look at where retail inventory ended up, I guess, 2-part question. Is there any specific category that saw outsized inventory growth that you need to now work down? And then do you think Whirlpool was effectively in line with the industry as far as the inventory build? Is that kind of a Whirlpool-specific comment than an industry comment? How do you think you shake out versus the market in terms of where inventory position ended the year?', 'James W. Peters', ""Yes. So Michael, I'll start here, and I'll let Marc kind of add a little bit of color to it. But I would say, to begin with, across categories, I can't say that I could call out and differentiate any one category where it's significantly different. Again, as we kind of got through the year-end, saw where sell-through was from a holiday perspective, and then you look across the broader environment, I'd say it's in -- we see it in many of the categories. So I don't think that there's a big differentiation for us there. And then as you said, is it a Whirlpool-only issue? I think now as you look across the entire industry and you look across the retailers right now, this is not a Whirlpool-only issue. And again, as you've seen, many of our competitors have already started talking about things, you're hearing a similar story out there that everyone is seeing a retail environment that seems to have higher levels of inventory than expected. So just based on at least information out in the public, I don't believe that it's a problem that disproportionately affects us."", 'Marc Robert Bitzer', ""Mike, maybe just give you a little bit more color and coming back to what I mentioned before. Essentially, when you look back at Q4 North America, the industry sell-through was softer than most people expected, okay? And it comes back to, yes, the amount of discretionary demand out there was not as high as people expected. That led to both the return on investment and market promotions was just not attractive. And two, it also led to higher inventories of the retailers relative to what we had in mind in the industry sales through. And yes, as Jim mentioned earlier, I think that will impact somewhat the shipments, the industry shipments in Q1 and maybe to a lesser extent Q2, from everything. And of course, we don't have precise sellout data from competitors, but from everything which we see from a broader industry, it certainly was not a Whirlpool-specific issue. This was across the board. And right now, it just means a little bit of inventory overhang as we enter the industry in Q1, but again, that we will we work through."", 'Michael Glaser Dahl', ""Yes. That makes sense. Helpful. My second question, either Marc or Jim, is around the free cash flow guide. And specifically, if I look at cash earnings and operating items, the expectation is $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion in fiscal '24. You did -- you're expecting EBIT to be about flat at $1.15 billion. On that number, you did $910 million of cash earnings in 2023. It seems like your interest expense is unchanged year-on-year. Your cash tax is unchanged year-on-year. And so if your EBIT is unchanged year-on-year, what is the actual bridge in terms of which items are getting you to a higher cash earnings number in '24 higher cash earnings conversion relative to EBIT?"", 'James W. Peters', ""Yes. So Michael, this is Jim. And really, there's 2 components that go into that line. It's your actual earnings, which, as you pointed out, are relatively flat, and that does make sense. And then the other one that's always hard from the outside to really kind of look at is that we have a lot of other operating accounts that are on our balance sheet, such as accruals for promotional spend, such as accruals for employee compensation in other areas. And actually, when we look at the end of this year versus the end of 2023 versus the end of 2022, what we saw is that because 2022 was a really strong year, you had a lot higher payouts on some of those areas within the beginning of 2023 that negatively affects cash. And when you come through a negative year that you don't have as high a payout in some of those areas, it gives you a positive in the next year from an operating cash flow perspective. So it's a good question in that it doesn't really become apparent, but that's the biggest driver within that bucket that you will see. Then also throughout the year, there are just some noncash items that affect that differently here and there. But that's the biggest driver, the changes in those other types of accruals that don't necessarily sit in working capital."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Jason Haas from Bank of America.', 'Jason Daniel Haas', ""I'm curious if you could talk about what impacts, if any, you've seen from the disruptions in the Red Sea and just global container costs starting to increase here."", 'Marc Robert Bitzer', ""Jason, it's Marc. So obviously, in particular with our heavy footprint on the Americas, the impact for Americas is less Yes, there is some -- it impacts a little bit some of the East Coast shipments, not so much in cost, more in time. So there's 1 or 2 weeks later time. It could and will start impacting the European business. Right now, we're still in pretty good shape for Europe. But obviously, that brings uncertainty more in European supply chain, to much, much less extent of the North America supply chain. The container costs have been so far pretty stable for us. Again, also put a bit of context, they came from excessively high rates in the COVID and post-COVID environment and now to more normalized rates. And the broader impact of the mix is limited. Keep also in mind, compared to any of our competitors, we are much more North America and Americas production based. So relatively speaking, the container cost impact is a whole lot less than most of our competitors."", 'Jason Daniel Haas', ""Got it. And then as a follow-up question, I'm curious if you could remind us what your sourcing exposure is to China. And if you had any thoughts on if we were to see higher tariffs placed on China, what would be the impact to your business and the industry overall?"", 'Marc Robert Bitzer', ""Yes. So Jason, I mean, first of all, split into 2 pieces, there's finished products and there's components. On finished products, our exposure is relatively small. We import microwave food combination and some refrigerators into the Americas and into Europe and some dishwashers also into Europe. So on finished products, it's actually, frankly, in particular, Americas, not a very big number. Components in particular, in electronics, you have exposure like everybody else to China or broader Asia, I would say, because not just China, it's also Vietnam, Thailand, et cetera. Again, back to my earlier comments, in the competitive landscape, we're by a long shot, the least exposed to China. And it's just because of our historic strong footprint in Americas, our focus on producing in Americas and sourcing from Americas, except for electronics where you just have a limited supply base in the Americas."", 'Operator', 'Your final question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.', 'Eric Bosshard', ""Two questions. I'll give the both to you. The first is the other half of the free cash flow question, I understand the bridge within the cash earnings. Can you just give us a little bit of context of the $200 million to $300 million Europe cash usage that is alluded to in that slide? I just don't exactly know where that fits within the moving pieces.And then the second question relates, Marc, you talked a lot about the focus on margin progress, the flat margin in 6.8%. Related to that, I guess the core of it is that you still have this 11% to 12% long-term margin guide, and just wanted to see if that is the number that you're still aspiring to and aiming to."", 'James W. Peters', ""Yes. So Eric, this is Jim, and I'll start with your first question there on EMEA. And typically, if you'd looked within a full year EMEA over some of the past years has consumed around $200 million of cash and whether it's due to restructuring, it's due to some legacy liabilities and matters through the operations of the business. Now as we look to close the transaction in the quarter of the year, typically, that negative cash flow actually did occur much earlier in the year and then they would gain cash throughout the year. So to begin with, they start the year with a negative cash flow as they begin to build some working capital. The second piece of that, though, that comes along with it is that also within there, we have some various working capital financing type of programs that are related to accounts receivable and other things that we will unwind as we do this transaction. And then as we contribute this -- this business to the new company, there will be other things that might exist within there. But there are just some things we need to unwind as we go through the process. So right now, we look at it is possibly having an impact at least on our cash flow for the year of a negative $200 million to $300 million. But once we get closer to the close, we'll update that number."", 'Marc Robert Bitzer', ""And Eric, just maybe adding a comment on to Jim's point. To put it simply, the $550 million to $650 million cash flow, excluding Europe on a normalized basis will translate into $800-million-plus, that's essentially what it means, because we have to unwind these working capital financing activities and some other elements. So that's what it really means. Now to your second point about the margin progress. And again, I want to also highlight our upcoming Investor Day, where we give an update with the segment about our mid- and long-term value creation goals. But in short -- and Eric, that's consistent to what we said before, we absolutely don't see any reason why the margins which we have pre-COVID are not in sight. So i.e., and particularly for North America, we -- for years, we have been operating at 12% or 12-plus percent operating margin in North America, and that's certainly what we see absolutely possible. Right now, we're working through -- I mean, as you all can see, it's a very negative macro cycle. I mean our industry is heavily impacted by existing home sales and existing home sales in the course of 20 months went from 6-plus million units to 3.7 million. So that's impacting us. But we know how to work through the cycles, and that's why we're very confident that we, over time, can reestablish these margins as we were experiencing them before. But again, much more perspective on this one at our Investor Day. I guess with that, we've come pretty much to the end of our session. First of all, I want to thank you all for joining us today. And I think -- I mean really, hopefully, what you heard is we feel good about where we are from our market share perspective. We also feel good about our ability to take out costs as we demonstrate in '23 as we are comping for '24 and we frankly feel good about how we, step-by-step, restrengthen our balance sheet and where we are from a broader funding and balance sheet perspective. I think all these elements set us up very well for working through a macro cycle, which we -- we all see it. That's certainly going to impact the industry negatively in Q1 and probably also some extent Q2. But again, we come from a very strong platform. We know how to work through the cycles, and we have, I think, the right actions in place to -- particularly also as you look at the back half of '24, have a very attractive business. So with that in mind, again, I want to remind everybody, February 27. That's where you will see a lot more perspective, particularly about our North America business, in particular about our KitchenAid SDA business, which we historically didn't put a lot of light on or didn't show you a lot. And we will also talk quite a bit about balance sheet and cash flow development. So again, February 27, and we're looking forward to seeing you all. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.""]"

The top reasons propelling a growing number of American boomers to seek retirement havens beyond the borders of the United States are the triad of quality of life, cost of living, and healthcare accessibility.', 'From a financial perspective, the statistics paint a compelling picture. A healthy 65-year-old couple contemplating retirement in the United States may find themselves requiring a hefty sum of $300,000 in savings. This figure does not even factor in the high costs associated with assisted living, averaging around $4,500 per month as reported\xa0 by the Cost of Care survey by Genworth. Moreover, the United States consistently ranks among the most expensive places to live globally. Despite the median retirement savings for boomers standing at $152,000, a concerning one in five retirees claims they have yet to recover from the economic downturn of the recession.', ""The allure of retiring abroad gains further momentum when examining the healthcare landscape in the United States. Unquestionably, the U.S. leads in healthcare costs globally, creating a significant financial burden for retirees. In contrast to many industrialized nations boasting near-universal coverage, the U.S. relies on a non-universal, private insurance system. For this reason, many boomers are now preferring to retire outside the U.S. Moreover, even though 91.4% of Americans are covered by private healthcare insurance, a notable portion of the population remains without any coverage at all. The lucrative nature of the private healthcare insurance industry in the U.S. is underscored by its flourishing business within the country's 'dysfunctional' healthcare system, as outlined by The Economist. This dysfunctionality has contributed to the growth of several private insurance companies, perpetuating a situation where a substantial segment of the population is left grappling with inadequate or no coverage."", 'The situation gets even more concerning when the stark contrast between the financial gains of such private insurance companies and the struggles of the American people emerges. Major players such as UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV), and The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) are proudly reporting billions in profits. Specifically, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) achieved an astounding $22 billion in profits in the year 2023. Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV), a prominent player in the US private insurance sector, has not only exceeded its target growth range of 12-15% but has achieved a remarkable compound annual growth rate of nearly 16% since 2018. Their operating revenue also surpassed $170 billion in 2023, which reflects substantial financial success within the private health insurance sector.', 'Additionally, the way these companies operate, especially in denying or underpaying for care, raises ethical questions about their commitment to the well-being of patients. In 2021, a staggering 53% of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield’s medical bills for the second quarter went unpaid, totaling $2.5 billion. The tactic of requiring pre-authorization for routine and lifesaving care introduced in early 2023 by UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is another illustration of how health insurers navigate the delicate balance between profits and patient well-being. This announcement to require prior authorization for colonoscopies, a crucial screening tool for colorectal cancer, highlights the lengths to which insurers go to control costs.', 'Enter the appeal of retiring abroad – countries that promise a higher quality of life at significantly lower costs. For retirees, this becomes an enticing prospect, offering the potential to stretch their pensions further and enjoy a lifestyle that might be financially burdensome in the United States. As we explore the top 20 places preferred by American boomers for retirement outside the U.S., it becomes clear that financial considerations are a driving force in the quest for a fulfilling and economically sustainable retirement.', 'Arseniy Krasnevsky/Shutterstock.com', 'In order to come up with a comprehensive list of the top 20 places boomers prefer to retire outside the US, we made a list of countries from multiple sources (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) and picked our top countries using a consensus method. We then filtered them based on cost of living and the healthcare index sourced from Numbeo. To rank these countries, we employed further measures that determine the overall quality of life which include, but are not limited to, the visa requirements, climate, and the percentage of English speaking population and allotted points for each measure. When we encountered a tie, an additional measure was considered (quality of life) to reasonably rank the countries for maximum accuracy. Places have been ranked in an ascending order from the lowest to the highest scores.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

Despite facing challenges from inflationary pressures, Canadian stocks rebounded from the declines experienced the previous year, posting an 8% gain for the year. For 2024, there is renewed optimism among investors for a potential interest rate cut by the Bank of Canada. Apart from the general performance of the stock market, Canadian dividend stocks also demonstrated robust results in the previous year. The S&P/TSX Canadian Dividend Aristocrats Index is crafted to assess the performance of companies listed in the S&P Canada BMI that adhere to a consistent dividend policy of either maintaining or increasing dividends annually for a minimum of five years. In the year 2023, this index recorded a positive growth of 5.07%. This indicates that the selected companies, renowned for their commitment to stable or rising dividend payouts, collectively experienced a favorable performance over the course of the year."", 'Analysts predict that the impressive performance of dividend stocks is poised to persist into 2024. They express confidence in the outlook for dividend stocks in Canada, asserting that the current opportunities are unparalleled in recent history. A key factor contributing to this optimistic outlook is the presence of stable, low-volatility blue-chip companies that are currently providing enticing yields. These companies, characterized by their reliability and strong market position, are seen as a driving force behind the continued appeal of dividend stocks, making them particularly attractive to investors seeking both stability and attractive returns. Noah Solomon, who serves as the Chief Investment Officer at Outcome Metric Asset Management, discussed Canadian dividend stocks in a recent interview with Wealth Professional, an online information resource catering to Canadian advice and planning professionals. Here are some comments from the analyst:', '“Canadian dividend stocks are offering yields of between 6.5% and 7.5%, which are tax-preferred because they’re Canadian companies. That’s like a bond equivalent yield approaching 10%.”', ""Mr. Solomon's perspective on Canadian dividend stocks aligns with that of seasoned fund manager Tom Czitron, who remains optimistic about dividend stocks as a sound long-term investment. Czitron mentioned that the era of inexpensive capital costs and malinvestment is coming to an end, signaling potential challenges for flashy growth stocks. In this shifting landscape, Czitron emphasizes the increasing significance of dividends, suggesting that they will play a more pivotal role than before. He even provides specific recommendations for purchase during the ongoing market downturn."", 'Canadian dividend stocks have not only demonstrated robust performance in the recent past but have also maintained consistency over the years. As highlighted in a report from RBC Global Asset Management, investors benefiting from dividends experienced a significant boost in their purchasing power. Over the last two decades, dividends in the Canadian market have shown an annual growth rate of approximately 7.9%. In contrast, inflation has averaged an annual rate of 2.2%. When compounded over time, this has resulted in a remarkable 361% growth in dividends, while inflation has led to a comparatively modest 53% increase in prices. This data underscores the enduring strength and value that Canadian dividend stocks have provided to investors.', 'Although U.S. dividend stocks such as The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc.

The consumer staples giant in January announced good news regarding its sales and profits trends, sprinkled in with a few disappointing factors impacting returns.', ""Shares jumped in response to the quarterly update, yet the stock is still trailing the market over the past 12 months. Let's look at a few reasons why investors might want to take advantage of that discount, and one big reason to hold off for now."", 'A big concern heading into this report was that P&G might be approaching the limit of its pricing power. Shoppers have been dealing with rising prices for over a year and are increasingly looking for ways to cut spending. Yet P&G did a lot to ease that worry this past quarter. The company was able to pass along its rising raw material costs without a hitch in the fiscal Q2 selling period that ran through late December. In fact, Prices were up 4% overall thanks to big boosts in brands like Tide, Crest, and Bounty.', 'These gains powered a 4% organic sales increase, keeping P&G on track for good growth this year following last year\'s spike. Sales should rise by between 4% and 5% in fiscal 2024 on top of the 7% boost from fiscal 2023. ""We delivered strong results in the second quarter,"" CEO Jon Moeller said in a press release. Wall Street apparently agreed, as the stock is up following the report.', ""Earnings were pinched last year as costs rose faster than prices, but the reverse is happening right now. Raw material inflation slowed significantly in recent months even as P&G's 2023 price hikes continue to boost sales."", ""Toss in cost cuts, and you've got a recipe for strong profit expansion and continued positive returns for shareholders. P&G's gross profit margin jumped by nearly 6 percentage points last quarter, helping lift operating profitability by nearly the same amount. Earnings per share rose 18% after adjusting for currency exchange rate shifts. That's an impressive rate for any business to manage, especially one that generates over $20 billion of quarterly sales."", ""Investors will want to watch for more concrete signs of a demand rebound in the coming quarters. Sales volumes have been declining for several consecutive quarters, after all, and that's not a sustainable situation because it leaves P&G relying on price hikes to fuel all of its organic growth. While it's good to see pricing power at work, investors would prefer a healthier balance between rising prices and sales volumes."", ""It is likely that this balance will return over the next few quarters, especially if consumer spending trends continue improving. And in the meantime, P&G shareholders can patiently collect a dividend that will likely rise again this spring to mark its 68th consecutive boost. You don't put together a track record like that without having a few massive competitive advantages, including scale, dominant market share, and a stellar track record for innovative product releases."", ""These factors should keep boosting shareholder returns over time, even if P&G's sales volumes look sluggish over the next several quarters."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Procter & Gamble right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Procter & Gamble, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Procter & Gamble wasn't one of them.

High mortgage rates and rising raw material and labor costs prevented buyers from investing in new homes despite high demand.', 'However, the housing market is showing signs of a slow but steady rebound, as inflation continues to cool and mortgage rates are easing. Although inflation is still above the Fed’s 2% target, it kept its benchmark policy rate steady in the range of 5.25-5.5% in its last three FOMC meetings after hiking it by 525 basis points since March 2022.', 'Moreover, cooling inflation has finally made Federal Reserve officials change their stance from hawkish to dovish and indicate multiple interest rate cuts in 2024.', 'Expectations of a reduced risk-free market interest rate have led to a decrease in mortgage rates since November.

Aflac Incorporated AFL, Unum Group UNM, Employers Holdings EIG and Trupanion TRUP should continue to benefit from prudent underwriting standards. However, a rise in claims frequency could weigh on the positives.The industry has been witnessing soft pricing over the past several quarters, which is not expected to change any time soon. Nonetheless, a rise in claims, with business activities returning to normal levels, is likely to favor pricing for this industry. Also, the increasing adoption of technology in operations will help the industry to function smoothly.', 'About the Industry', ""The Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry comprises companies providing workers’ compensation insurance, mainly to employers operating in hazardous industries. These companies offer group, individual or voluntary supplemental insurance products. Workers' compensation is a form of accident insurance paid by employers without affecting employees’ pay. Claims are generally met by insurers or state-run workers’ compensation fund, benefiting both employers and employees. While it boosts employees’ morale and, in turn, productivity, employers stand to benefit from lower claim costs. As awareness about the benefits of having such coverage rises, the future of these insurers seems bright. Per reports published in IBISWorld, the size of U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry was $55 billion in 2023 based on revenues."", '3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Accident & Health Insurance Industry', 'Pricing Pressure to Continue: The worker compensation industry has been witnessing pricing pressure over the past several quarters. Efforts to retain market share will further increase pricing pressure, which might curb top-line growth. With commercial and industrial activities back on track, the demand for insurance coverage is likely to be on the rise. SpendEdge estimates workers’ compensation insurance pricing to increase at a five-year (2022-2026) CAGR of 5.3%. Also, per a CBIZ report, workers’ compensation pricing is expected to rise 2%.Claims Frequency to Improve: The accident and health insurance space has witnessed growth over the years, primarily driven by an increase in benefits offered by employers. The right kind of workers’ compensation policy translates into personal care for injured workers, increased productivity, higher employee morale, lower turnover, reduced claims costs and less financial worry amid rising medical costs. Increasing underwriting exposure, sustained decrease in claims frequency rates attributable to a better working environment and conservative reserve levels have been boosting the industry’s performance. Per U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data in an AmTrust Financial report, workers over the age of 55 will increase to about 25% in 2024 from 21.7% in 2014. Thus, claims could rise based on the degree of severity, the report states.Increasing Adoption of Technology: The industry is witnessing accelerated adoption of technology in operations, including artificial intelligence. Electronic applications, e-signatures, electronic policy delivery, cloud computing and blockchain should help insurers gain a competitive edge. Per a CBIZ report, industry data reveals that artificial intelligence could reduce workers’ compensation claim expense by about 45%. Nonetheless, higher spending on technological advancements will result in escalated expense ratios.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects', 'The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects.

If you want to skip our coverage of the latest stock market news and the current economic environment, then you can take a look at the 5 Stocks with Potential to Explode. ', ""As investors and markets make a slow start to 2024, the main question on everyone's mind is how far can markets go this year. 2023 was a topsy turvy ride that saw major indexes continuously fluctuate in response to the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. At the same time, the mega cap technology sector continued to perform well amidst optimistic estimates for A.I., and the U.S. economy did not tip into a recession. As a whole, 2023 was better than what many might have expected to lay in store at the start of the year, and now, it's time to take stock of expectations for 2024."", 'Talking about stocks, several investment banks and research firms are out with their predictions for the flagship S&P 500 index\'s performance in 2024. These predictions range from optimistic to cautious, and the analyst opinions range from believing 2024 to be an ""average"" year to increasing year end targets. Starting from the cautious one first, this voice belongs to Michael Wilson of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). The analyst outlines three scenarios for the market this year, and links all of them to the economy. Starting from best to worst, these assume a soft landing with accelerating growth, a standard soft landing, and a recession. To position a portfolio for the latter two scenarios, the investment bank outlines that a combination of defensive stocks and cyclical stocks can do well for a soft landing. For a recession, defensive stocks only can be a fruitful endeavor.', ""While Morgan Stanley is urging caution, others are far more optimistic. One such voice is from the teams at UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS). The UBS analysts set the S&P 500's highest year end target for 2024 in mid January, as they shared that the index can close at a level of 5,150 points. This marked an upgrade from their earlier estimate of 4,850, placing the firm firmly in the market camp that believes that interest rates will significantly reduce this year. This optimism is also met by teams at The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) and RBC Capital. Starting from RBC, like UBS, it also started the year by upgrading estimates for the S&P 500. These estimates now match the ones from UBS, and also mark an upgrade over RBC's previous value of 5,000 points. However, RBC's Lori Calvasina raised the firm's year end target for the S&P 500 to 5,150 earlier this month, and Calvasina added that when compared to RBC's 5,000 target in November that reflected a 10% gain from levels at that time, the new target is actually more conservative as it prices in an 8% appreciation."", 'Finally, one bank whose predictions in 2022 stood the test of time in 2023 is Goldman Sachs. While several big players on Wall Street were all doom and gloom in 2022 about the prospects of the U.S. economy, Goldman Sachs bucked the trend and wagered that if all went well, then the U.S. economy could very well avoid a recession. The topic of a recession is complex in itself when we consider the current monetary policy environment as the Federal Reserve has rapidly hiked interest rates to cull inflation and wages. A weakening economy increases the pressure on the Fed to cut rates and stimulate growth; however, if the economy is robust, then the central bank can feel comfortable knowing that its policies are not causing damage to businesses.', ""With this in mind, Goldman Sachs's latest prediction about America's economic future is in line with its previous sentiment. In a note released mid January, analysts upgraded their growth forecasts to predict 2.3% in GDP growth for the U.S. in 2024. The economic boost came roughly a month after Goldman had increased its S&P 500 forecast for 2024 to 5,100 points - just 50 points shy of estimates from RBC and UBS. One can speculate that perhaps robust economic growth is behind the 50 point divergence as it could mean that higher for longer rates prevent the stock market from fully spreading its wings this year."", 'So, as the economic and stock market tea leaves start to orient themselves for another 12 months, we decided to see if any stocks have the potential to explode.

Absent an economic or geopolitical event, S&P 500 large caps appear to be weathering volatility better, as the index is expected to post its 15th consecutive year of dividend increases.
