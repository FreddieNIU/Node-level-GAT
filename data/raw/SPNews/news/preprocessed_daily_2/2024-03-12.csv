These numbers are likely to wreak havoc on Social Security benefits, with its funds forecast to deplete by 2034. Since Social Security is funded by workers, and the working population is shrinking drastically each year, discussing the profound impacts that it has on the economy is crucial. So what will happen in the years to come considering the massive influx of retirees in the economy? According to the Wall Street Journal, it's a recession perhaps."", ""Before getting to why they think so, let's discuss this crucial trust fund that the majority of retirees in the US depend on. As of today, the average American worker is confused as to what will happen once Social Security benefits get exhausted. A Wall Street Journal Chief Economics Commentator explains that Social Security is an integral part of the Federal Government, and as long as the Federal Government isn’t bankrupt, Social Security won’t be either."", 'Robert Aruldoss, a senior financial planning analyst at the Schwab Center for Financial Research from the The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), states that even though Social Security is going to be there for Americans, there are surely going to be changes.

(NYSE:GS) reveals that retirees don\'t get to save much for their golden period anyway. Retirees, especially those who are on the lower end of the income spectrum, tend to spend less money due to their limited incomes as a result. Jason Fichtner, Executive Director of the Retirement Income Institute, explains how limited incomes mean limited spending, which eventually translates into lower economic activity. Less economic activity eventually leads to less employment, with employers having to lay off more people because less money is coming in. A ""senior induced recession"" is what could be in the works with all these seniors retiring in the years to come, notes Fichtner.', ""In conclusion, the economic situation is currently challenging, with retirees feeling the impact the most. With minimal retirement savings and so much to spend, retiring on a fixed income is getting harder and harder these days.

But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless blessed with Midas touch. When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style to be one of the most effective approaches. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that have good things going on for them, even at a time when they have been beaten down by some external factors.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis — the lower the number, the better. General Motors Company GM, Unum Group UNM, Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. AMG and Corebridge Financial, Inc. CRBG boast a low P/CF ratio.', 'Questions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.', ""An investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and also consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening.General Motors, which designs, builds and sells cars, trucks, crossovers and automobile parts globally, carries a Zacks Rank #2.

If you would like to skip our detailed analysis of the topic, you can go directly to the 10 Unhappiest Cities in America.', 'According to a 2022 report published by Oracle, 45% of people have not felt true happiness for more than two years, while 25% have forgotten what it means to feel truly happy. While happiness is subjective, several factors play a part in making people unhappy.\xa0', 'For instance, a research paper by NBER finds that the population density of an area and happiness in communities are closely linked. It finds that average population density in the 20% of most miserable communities in Canada was more than eight times greater than in the happiest 20% of communities. Therefore concluding that living in highly dense cities like metropolitan areas reduces average happiness levels.', 'Additionally, economic well-being has a major effect on happiness as well, especially in urban living. Although there is a common perception that cities offer amenities that lead to happiness, there’s evidence that urban living does not necessarily mean more happiness in individuals.\xa0', 'According to the NIH study, happiness and well-being increase as income increases. In the study, the researchers decided to look at incomes above and below $100,000 per year. They found out that those American participants making less than $100,000 per year get unhappier as income decreases. On the contrary, those making more than $100,000 per year are less miserable, and once incomes cross $100,000 per year and people make more money, the level of peak happiness grows even faster.\xa0', 'However, while higher income does buy you happiness, other mental-health deteriorating factors in cities, like high costs of living, greater inequality, social isolation, noise, and pollution, can offset the benefits of higher incomes. But for many people, especially Gen Z and Millennials, emotional and physical well-being is more important than job perks such as high salary. According to the Securian Financial survey, 73% of Generation Z and 74% of Millennial employees have utilized the mental health benefits that their employers offered.\xa0', 'People are realizing now more than ever before the importance of happiness and its effect on their emotional and physical well-being. Happiness brings out positive emotions, produces a pleasant mood, and makes your attitude soft towards yourself and others around you. Additionally, happiness protects the heart physically by lowering heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormone levels. Safe to say, happiness is not only a state of mind but also a crucial component for maintaining physical health.', 'However, many cities in the United States lack factors that would make residents happy, such as pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. The lack of such infrastructure discourages physical activity among the residents, and further hurts the air quality of the area by promoting high use of vehicles. Moreover, the lack of affordable healthcare services is also a significant factor contributing to unhappiness among the residents. Some of the leading healthcare companies that are actively investing in urban areas include Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).', 'Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is one of the leading companies in investing in diagnostics, and healthcare solutions. It made huge investments at the peak of COVID-19, such as opening a new cGMP plasmid DNA manufacturing facility in Carlsbad, California, in 2021. Earlier in the same year, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) announced more than $600 million in capital investments to expand its bioprocessing production capabilities through 2022. Moreover, in 2022, the company announced a $59 million investment in Kentucky’s healthcare sector, which will create 200 full-time jobs that will pay an average of $41 per hour.\xa0', 'Meanwhile, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), an American multinational health insurance and services company, made significant investments in cities in the United States, focusing on various initiatives to address community needs. One of the notable investments includes a $25 million commitment to the Healthy Neighborhoods Equity Fund II (HNEF II) in Boston to finance mixed-use developments that offer retail, housing, and social services. The aim behind this investment is to promote healthier communities. UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) recognizes that access to affordable housing will improve community health outcomes and help people live healthier and happier lives.', 'On the other hand, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has a strong reputation for various initiatives and healthcare investments.

These data were presented yesterday during a podium presentation and simultaneously published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC): Cardiovascular Interventions. In a second study presented during the late-breaking clinical trials session, small Edwards SAPIEN TAVR valves demonstrated equally excellent outcomes at 3 years as compared to larger SAPIEN TAVR valve sizes.', '""These real-world data further add to the robust body of evidence on the performance of Edwards SAPIEN TAVR and highlight the meaningful advancements of the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve, which provides patients with severe aortic stenosis the leading option for true lifetime management of their heart valve disease,"" said Larry Wood, Edwards’ corporate vice president and group president, transcatheter aortic valve replacement and surgical structural heart.', 'Real-World Results of the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA Valve', 'In a study of real-world evidence of patients from the TVT Registry, researchers compared the outcomes of more than 10,000 patients across more than 800 sites in the United States treated with the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve to those receiving SAPIEN 3 Ultra and SAPIEN 3 valves using procedural and hemodynamic data and clinical outcomes for propensity-matched cohorts.', 'The study found that all Edwards TAVR platforms demonstrated excellent PVL results. Notably, there was a statistically significant reduction in PVL for the 29 mm SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve as compared to the 29 mm SAPIEN 3, with 88.3% of patients exhibiting no PVL and only 10.7% of patients exhibiting mild PVL. The SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve was also associated with significantly lower echocardiography-derived mean gradients and larger effective orifice areas across all four valve sizes with low rates of all-cause mortality, cardiac death, all stroke, life-threatening bleeding, major vascular complications, and permanent pacemaker implantation in-hospital or at 30 days.', 'Late-Breaking Clinical Results Comparing Small Edwards TAVR Valves to Larger Valves', 'An analysis of 8,100 propensity matched patients across more than 800 sites in the United States found that patients treated with a 20mm Edwards SAPIEN valve demonstrated excellent all-cause mortality and stroke outcomes at 3-years, equivalent to those receiving 23, 26 and 29mm SAPIEN valve sizes. Among mortality indicators, researchers concluded that while PVL and new permanent pacemaker implantation were both associated with increased mortality, the relationship between post-procedural echo-derived mean gradients and clinical outcomes is nonlinear and more complex.', '""This examination of these real-world data gives us important insights into the actual performance of small Edwards valves and reaffirms the excellent outcomes for patients receiving SAPIEN TAVR, regardless of valve size,"" said Amr Abbas, MD, Professor of Medicine at Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine, Director of Structural Heart at Corewell Health East, William Beaumont University Hospital and principal investigator in the small SAPIEN valve study.', 'About Edwards Lifesciences', 'Edwards Lifesciences is the global leader of patient-focused innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring.

They are here today,”\xa0Rajashekhar told Omni Talk.\xa0', 'In January, Walmart announced it is expanding drone delivery powered by Wing and Zipline to up to 1.8 million additional households, linking the option to stores across more than 30 towns and municipalities in the Dallas-Forth Worth metroplex. Walmart noted that both on-demand drone delivery providers are approved by the Federal Aviation Administration to fly without a dedicated observer overseeing their drones at all times.\xa0', 'This clearance from the FAA, known as Beyond Visual Line of Sight, has become more frequent in the past year, according to The Wall Street Journal, noting that industry experts say regulatory restraints will decrease as communities become more familiar with the technology and delivery method.\xa0', 'The FAA is currently developing rules to make drone delivery “routine, scalable and economically viable,” a spokesperson for the federal agency told the newspaper.\xa0', 'At the end of February, city council members for North Richland Hills and Plano, Texas, approved changes that pave the way for drone delivery from nearby Walmart stores, according to Dronelife.com.', '“The way we think about any solution, whether it’s drone or any other solution is ‘How is it solving a customer problem?’ Customers told us that they want some deliveries to happen within less than 30 minutes, so drones solve that,” Rajashekhar said.', 'Drone deliveries can get items to customers in 30 minutes and sometimes as fast as 10 minutes, according to Walmart. Three-quarters of the 120,000 items in a Walmart supercenter are eligible for drone delivery, Rajashekhar said.', 'Walmart has said that it’s seen customers use drone deliveries for forgotten ingredients, snacks, beverages, over-the-counter medicines and cravings, like caffeine or sweet treats, noting that drones can even deliver fragile items like eggs. Drones are particularly handy for parents who are running late or traveling and need to order a microwaveable dinner for their children, Rajashekhar said.\xa0', 'Food is a key ingredient for drone delivery demand. When Wing unveiled in January a new aircraft in its drone fleet, the company noted that the new option would better handle larger orders for items like dinner ingredients such as pasta, marinara sauce, parmesan cheese, canned olives and garlic. Wing’s new aircraft can carry a payload of up to 5 pounds — nearly double the roughly 2.5-pound payload its existing ones handle.', 'Wing noted that in its first four months of service with Walmart, which started last August, it saw an “overwhelmingly positive” customer response with people using the service for quick meals, groceries, household essentials and over-the-counter medicines.', 'As more drone delivery hubs go live, customers in the eligible delivery radius will see drone delivery as an e-commerce fulfillment option, Rajashekhar said. Walmart is working to integrate drone delivery options into the retailer’s app so customers don’t have to place drone delivery orders from the drone partners’ websites, she added.', 'Walmart’s emphasis on drones comes at a time when competitor Amazon has ramped up its own drone deliveries. Amazon announced last fall that it will integrate Prime Air drones into its fulfillment network for faster delivery by deploying them at some same-day delivery sites.', 'This story was originally published on Grocery Dive.

Investors responded well to the news, as Walmart explained that it decided to split its shares to make it easier for employees to buy the stock."", ""It's important to understand that stock splits don't create any fundamental value for investors.

Its share price was recently approaching $800, and the company has a long track record of delivering steady gains to investors.', 'Like Walmart, Costco has not split its stock for roughly a generation. The last split came in 2000 when the stock was trading at around $100 a share and Costco implemented a 2-for-1 split.', ""Costco management has not commented on a stock split, and the company doesn't typically pay much attention to its share price. Still, it's possible that the company could follow Walmart and lower its share price to make it more affordable to employees and individual investors. However, the stock might need to post more gains before management considers a stock split."", ""Home Depot (NYSE: HD) has challenged Walmart as the No. 1 retailer by market capitalization in the past, and the home improvement retailer has a long history of stock splits. Like Walmart, it also hasn't split its stock since 1999 when it issued a 3-for-2 stock split when the stock was trading at $102 a share."", 'Home Depot currently trades at a $376 share price, but the stock is still down about 10% from its pandemic-era peak. The home improvement industry has run into challenges as mortgage rates have soared and the housing market has slowed substantially since the pandemic.', ""A stock split might also be worth pursuing for Home Depot because it's a Dow Jones Industrial Average member, and the index is price-weighted -- so a split would prevent it from having outsize influence on the blue-chip index."", 'The last remaining stock-split candidate in this retail group is Target (NYSE: TGT), the big-box multi-channel retailer that has differentiated itself with a focus on ""cheap chic"" branding and discretionary goods like apparel and home goods.', ""In recent quarters, Target has struggled due to weak consumer demand for discretionary goods and the company's own challenges with problems like theft. The stock is still down roughly a third from its peak during the pandemic."", ""Target is now trading at around $170 a share, but the company hasn't split its stock since 2000 like the other retailers in the group. With the retailer's stock still down substantially from its peak, a split for Target seems unlikely, but the potential is there if the share price continues to recover."", ""Stock splits are exciting milestones, but ultimately they do little to create long-term value for investors. While it's fun to speculate about the potential for a stock split, investors are better off buying stocks with strong fundamentals than trying to guess which stock will be next to split."", 'As for Walmart, the company looks as strong as ever coming off its recent earnings report, with solid growth across the board, improving margins, and new opportunities in e-commerce and advertising, including the Vizio acquisition. Looking ahead, the stock looks set to reward investors whether they bought shares because of the split or not.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walmart wasn’t one of them.

That was the biggest takeaway from the retail giant's early March earnings update which included other encouraging signs around demand and profit trends."", ""Target isn't out of its slump just yet. Management is simply calling for a return to comparable-store sales growth in 2024 following last year's decline. Peers like Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) are expanding much more quickly, too."", ""Yet there are some good reasons to be feeling bullish on Target stock right now. Let's dive right in."", ""Investors won't be thrilled by the headline growth number that Target just reported. Comps were down 4% in the key holiday shopping period, executives revealed on March 5. That result stacks up poorly against Walmart and Costco, which are expanding at a solid 3%-4% clip in the U.S. market. And Target reported declining customer traffic and lower spending, reflecting its exposure to the type of consumer discretionary purchases that shoppers are avoiding right now."", 'Look a bit closer at the report, though, and you\'ll see why Wall Street was pleased by the data. Target\'s customer traffic losses improved to below 2% from over 4% in the prior quarter. It nearly returned to growth in the digital sales channel following a 5% drop in Q3. The chain\'s holiday focus on innovation and affordability paid off and allowed sales to outpace the market in niches like toys and food. ""[W]e rallied to change our business momentum,"" management said.', ""Investors can immediately start benefiting from Target's financial strength while they wait for that growth rebound to take shape. The chain's operating margin already expanded to 6% of sales in late 2023 compared to 4% of sales a year earlier, effectively returning the business to the level of profitability that shareholders enjoyed before the pandemic volatility."", ""Sure, margins aren't approaching the 10% level that investors saw during parts of 2021. But that spike was clearly an aberration. For now, it appears Target will settle at a higher margin than national retailing peers like Costco."", ""And yet the stock is still valued as if its business won't recover its positive momentum anytime soon. Shares are trading for 0.75 times sales, or about the same premium that's been assigned to Walmart, which is less profitable. Investors were paying 1.5 times sales for Target at the 2021 peak and closer to 1 times sales before the pandemic struck."", ""That's a tempting discount for a business that should be setting sales and earnings records by late 2024. Cautious investors might want to wait until midyear when there will be more concrete signs that Target is on the rebound. But if you're OK with a bit more risk and are a fan of dividend stocks with long track records of growth, then consider adding Target to your watch list today. Its yield is sitting at 2.6% even following the recent share-price spike, making it one of the most generous retailers on that key metric. This income should help boost returns while you wait for business trends to accelerate in 2024 and beyond."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Target right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Target, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Target wasn’t one of them.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad."", ""So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Under Armour (NYSE:UAA). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing."", ' See our latest analysis for Under Armour ', 'If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Recognition must be given to the that Under Armour has grown EPS by 48% per year, over the last three years. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but it should be more than enough to pique the interest of the wary stock pickers.', ""Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Under Armour reported flat revenue and EBIT margins over the last year.

So it is good to see that Under Armour insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$467m. That equates to 13% of the company, making insiders powerful and aligned with other shareholders. Looking very optimistic for investors."", ""Under Armour's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest.

In addition, Li Auto plans to launch five brand new models this year, targeting up to 800,000 total vehicles sold. The company continued making progress in expanding its vehicle margins. Li Auto secured a strong vehicle margin of 22.7% — evidence that many other EV startups are failing to expand margins like Li can.', 'Li Auto confirmed in late December 2023 that it will start making deliveries of its newest electric vehicle product, the Li Mega multipurpose vehicle, in March 2024. When the company first unveiled the Li Mega EV at the Guangzhou Auto Show last year, Li Auto said the EV would cost consumers less than 600,000 Chinese Yuan ($84,500) and that it already received 10,000 reservations within the first two hours of reservations opening.', 'I am very bullish about Li Auto’s prospects, expecting it to accelerate much further in the quarters ahead. While Li Auto does not sell many vehicles in the U.S. yet, it can make significant inroads into European countries soon. With strong growth trends, reasonable valuation multiples and a robust EV product pipeline, Li Auto warrants a spot in growth-oriented portfolios — especially those looking to capitalize on coming Fed rate cuts.', 'Source: travelview / Shutterstock.com', 'Airline companies were arguably the hardest hit during the Covid-19 pandemic, racking up significant amounts of debt still left unpaid. These companies suffered tremendously in subsequent years, with the pain still ongoing despite a travel boom providing some lift. Even with higher demand, airline stocks have struggled to take off given lofty interest rates worldwide — causing heightened pain in servicing all the accumulated debt.', 'For example, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) is spending around $450 million per quarter on interest expenses alone. On the other hand, the company generated $600 million in quarterly net income in Q4. With rates set to decline, I believe United can free up significant cash in the coming quarters.', 'The stock already trades at a bargain 4.7x forward earnings. The airline recently forecasted $9 to $11 in EPS this year, with analysts predicting big jumps in future profits. Projections call for 2026 EPS to soar above $14 — all while the stock languishes around $45 currently. I see sizable upside from today’s levels as rate cuts bolster United’s earnings power.', 'The entire airline industry should experience multiple expansion in a lower-rate environment. And value-priced carriers like United Airlines stand to benefit most as earnings get an added boost from lower interest costs.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'As a smaller semiconductor equipment supplier, Aehr Test Systems (NASDAQ:AEHR) is at higher risk than larger-cap alternatives. However, I also see massive upside potential in AEHR once rate cuts take hold at full force.', 'A sizable chunk of Aehr’s sales stems from the electric vehicle industry, as the company produces key testing equipment for EV chips and sensors. Due to high interest rates putting a damper on EV sales volumes lately, Aehr stock has sunk 68% from its September 2023 peak. However, I expect a sharp rebound once EV sales pick back up.', 'Recent order activity backs up my bullish thesis. Aehr recently secured $23 million in new follow-on orders, pointing to strong customer demand. Moving forward, analysts forecast over 30% annual EPS growth. Yet the stock trades at just 22x forward earnings — a cheap multiple given the sizable growth anticipated.', 'As rate cuts spark an acceleration in the entire EV ecosystem, I expect Aehr Test Systems to be a major beneficiary. AEHR should deliver outsized returns as monetary policy pivots to supporting economic growth once again.', 'Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com', 'I believe PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) offers one of the best values in the entire market. Investors buying at today’s prices should be richly rewarded in the next 24 months, if not sooner, as the value proposition becomes clearer. The entire fintech space stays deeply undervalued, with PayPal standing out as the largest player. This household name wields tremendous global reach and has delivered consistent revenue and profit growth, bouncing back strongly from its post-Covid-19cooldown.', 'However, Wall Street fixates on one metric here — active user counts. While that tally has stagnated and recently turned negative, I don’t view it as a big enough problem to justify bargain basement pricing over the past two years. PayPal’s user base may have shrunk, but it’s squeezing more sales and profits from retained users as their transaction volumes climb. PayPal retains a sticky user base poised to drive nearly 8% annual EPS and revenue growth going forward — strong for a fintech firm.', 'It bought back $5 billion in stock last year. It also beat Q4 EPS estimates by 8.6% and revenue estimates by 2.6%, yet still no re-rating. Impressively, its net margin expanded 40% year-over-year to 17.5% last quarter. I believe PYPL looks criminally undervalued at around $60 per share — rate cuts should stimulate digital transactions and significantly more upside.', 'Source: Khanthachai C / Shutterstock.com', 'Vestas Wind Systems (OTCMKTS:VWDRY) is an offshore wind company. It has struggled the past two years as renewable energy got placed on the back burner — but I don’t expect that to persist forever. Down 46% from its peak, Vestas financials are recovering strongly. Its Q3 net income of $148 million turned 2023 profitable again, with $77 million in full-year profits.', 'Despite razor-thin 1.5% margins and ongoing industry headwinds, Vestas grew revenue and earnings in 2023. It achieved a record 18.4 GW order intake last year and aims to build on that momentum in 2024. Its Power Solutions segment should strengthen dramatically in 2024, while the Services segment remains a steady, non-cyclical grower.', 'Vestas holds a hefty $3.7 billion debt load equal to its cash position, compressing profitability and margins via interest expenses. But sustained rate cuts coupled with Europe’s desire to wean itself off Russian oil and gas could massively improve margins over a multi-year frame. That would unlock substantial share price upside. With asset values and earnings power skewed by high rates, Vestas should catch a bid as policy pivots to economic stimulus.', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com', 'Bitcoin (BTC-USD) keeps climbing thanks to spot ETFs and upcoming “halving” tailwinds. However, one overlooked catalyst is how rate cuts could supercharge further upside. By making traditional assets less rewarding, lower rates should stimulate investor demand for alternative stores of value like Bitcoin. Banks and hedge funds are already jumping in, so cuts would be rocket fuel.', 'Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) rapidly expands operations ahead of sector appreciation, stockpiling a trove of 7,648 Bitcoins as of January. It recently ordered 31,500 next-gen miners from MicroBT for $97.4 million. Riot’s early re-positioning for recovery provides leverage while Wall Street still fixates on halving headwinds. If Bitcoin runs, miners will follow. With mines scaling aggressively and its balance sheet gaining leverage to crypto, substantial upside exists for Riot.', 'Source: 2p2play / Shutterstock.com', 'Under Armour (NYSE:UA) develops and distributes athletic apparel and accessories, may not be as rate-sensitive as other picks here. However, it can still deliver outsized returns as discretionary markets awaken. Lower rates should stimulate apparel spending. After years of stagnation, the stock rallied 25% off its November lows as Under Armour lifted profit guidance.', 'Long-term expectations call for robust growth. EPS is forecast to double from 49 cents in fiscal 2024 to $1 in fiscal 2027, making its forward P/E ratio just 8X three years out. Sales growth should also persist in the mid-single-digits over the next decade, combined with EPS expansion to drive 2033 EPS above $2.30 by estimates.

Let’s examine Salesforce’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Salesforce ', 'Good news, investors! Salesforce is still a bargain right now. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $408.58, but it is currently trading at US$305 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that Salesforce’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future.

Motley Fool Money starts now. Welcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm Deidre Woollard here with Motley Fool analysts David Meier. David, how're you today?"", 'David Meier: Am doing very well, how are you?', ""Deidre Woollard: Good. It seems like this is a tech Thursday, a SaaS Thursday. Want to dive in on the companies that are really making the news today, which are Salesforce, Snowflake, and Okta. Let's start with Salesforce. Dividend, we're starting to see dividends pop-up. Meta did it, now Salesforce is doing it. Forty cents a share. That's all right, it's a start. But to me, I'm looking at this as a signal. How should we be thinking about this? Last quarter we definitely had Salesforce being more cautious, they're not going off in buying things anymore. Is this company growing up?"", ""David Meier: Definitely. The dividend, if you go back 10 years, there's no way a dividend was anywhere near anyone's radar and that's a function of Marc Benioff quite frankly, being Marc Benioff. He's a visionary, he's a technologist. He wanted to put together all these pieces and create a great company, which he did. But I think that where the credit needs to really go is CFO Amy Weaver. In 2021, she became the CFO and she had the unenviable task of trying to rein Marc Benioff in to bring more fiscal discipline to the company. To say, hey, if we're going to do an acquisition, it really has to meet these certain requirements for not only from a strategic standpoint, but from a fiscal standpoint. With Salesforce generating significantly more profit and cash flow than it ever has before, it's able to not only invest for growth and do it in a disciplined way, but now being a bigger, more mature company, it can actually fulfill its promises of returning excess capital to shareholders in different ways. We're seeing it in buybacks, we're seeing it in dividends. And quite frankly, this is exactly the trajectory the company needs to go on."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, good on her for doing what a couple of co-CEOs were not able to do. I wanted to talk just as quick sec about that buyback because sales stock-based comp always been an issue with Salesforce. They're going after it, $10 billion buyback program. They bought back about 7.7 billion last year. It's going in the right direction."", ""David Meier: Again, this is a complete change in the way the company operates. Look, stock-based compensation for a company like Salesforce is going to continue to be an important part of attracting and keeping the talent that they need in order to take the company in the direction they want to go. Again, it's good that they have this excess cashflow where at a minimum they can offset the dilution and hopefully they're making opportunistic purchases with that capital at times when the stock price looks attractive."", ""Deidre Woollard: And it's interesting because they bought a lot of things and now they've been trying to figure out how to knit them all together. So looking at that, it's not just a maturing company, it's still looking for growth. The big swing that Benioff spent so much time talking about on the earnings call was the Einstein platform. Sees it as this AI ecosystem. Platform keeps coming up in the conversations that you and I are having. We talked about it with Palo Alto Networks. We're going to talk about it a lot today. So is this a true Platform? Because I worry that people are using the word Platform and maybe as a catch-all, that's not necessarily a Platform. Benioff talked about islands of trap data. I'm not quite sure what that means, but maybe you can explain."", ""David Meier: Yes. Like we did with Palo Alto, let's step back and think about where Salesforce came from real quickly. So again, Salesforce, it's in the ticker, CRM, Customer Resource Management. That was what they were focused on helping salespeople become more effective by giving them tools to figure out how to manage all of their contacts to land new customers and talk to prospects, et cetera. But we've added, you got sales, you got the CRM component, you have marketing component, you have Slack, you have productivity component, you have all these different components. And what they want to do is to, again, bring them together and say, hey, if you want your business to run efficiently and effectively on the customer-facing side of things, come to us. That is now the Platform. It's not just CRM. It's how do I do all of that well? And the thing that they want to stitch it together is Einstein, which is the AI machine learning, all the analytics that can basically say, hey, you're doing all these things from a sales perspective, from a marketing perspective, communications perspective, what can we learn from all that data that we're creating?"", ""So becoming even more of a platform is what they are doing and it is the right thing for them to do. So let's talk about these islands of trap data. So essentially, there are many ways in which many places where businesses store data. It doesn't all just go to Salesforce. There's so many different areas that where data can be. And the idea is for AI to work efficiently and effectively, we would like all the data to be in one place. So it makes the computations more efficient. If I can bring in more diverse groups of data, let's say sales data, marketing data, operations data, things like that, maybe I'll get a better insight. So what they are trying to do is a very worthwhile problem to go find a solution for. And they believe that their platform, although services they have as well as the Data Cloud says, hey, if you want, you can bring all of your data to Salesforce and that will actually make the job easier. Those are all going in the right direction as long as we assume that AI is going to continue to be an important part of it. I think that's true. So I like all the things they are communicating about Einstein Data Cloud, the Platform, et cetera."", ""Deidre Woollard: I like the vision. I think there is something that so many companies are wrestling with is that they're generating more data than ever. Generative AI is pushing out more data. Everybody's got too much data. A few years ago there was the whole data is the new oil thing. We don't know what to do with the oil. So what I'm curious about is how does it play into the sales? Because you're selling the CRM, you're selling Slack and other things. How does Einstein factor into the future?"", ""David Meier: So an excellent question. Early on when they were first borough rolled out Einstein, again, it was a way to basically get more out of the tools that you were already using. And I don't know the specific pricing structures, but maybe you paid a little bit more for your CRM and you got Einstein on top of it. Maybe you didn't sell Einstein directly early on. You just had to pay to unlock it, let's say. But now if you take this different approach, it's not necessarily the software underneath the CRM, the marketing, et cetera. That's important, but if I can get customers to essentially aid for the value add as opposed to just access that's a different way of selling things and a different way of pricing things. So I don't think they've quite figured out how all their business processes to basically put Einstein front and center, how to use this incentivize the Salesforce? How do I make sure that all my billing software can handle these things? I think they're working on that. That's the way I would say, hey, maybe Einstein is not factored into the guidance yet. I think they're still trying to figure out how they're going to do it. And if I had to really guess, I would say maybe that might be a little upside surprise either later in fiscal 25 or into fiscal 26."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, let's move on to the big wow moment after market close yesterday, which is that Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake he's retiring. He's not leaving the company. He's going to stay on as the Board chair. But this really shocked people. You've got Sridhar Ramaswamy, he was the Senior President of AI. Spend with the company a couple of years, came in through an acquisition. This feels like a signal that AI is running the show, but the market cap pretty riled up by this one."", 'David Meier: [laughs] I have a little bit of a different thought here.', 'Deidre Woollard: Good.', ""David Meier: Again, we talked about it with Salesforce. There's no question that AI is front and center and that a lot of what Snowflake is trying to do is basically be an enabler of AI for businesses all over the world. But I don't think Sridhar became president just because of what he's done in the AI segment. We have to remember he actually came from Google [Alphabet's], where he spent many years in both commercial leadership roles as well as engineering leadership roles. Snowflake is a complicated technical company. Not only do you need someone who understands the changing commercial landscape, but you also need someone who understands the changing technological landscape. I believe that's the big reason why Sridhar was promoted. He has all the chops and it's going to be a big challenge going forward. This stuff's going to only get more and more complicated. Having somebody with his background as well as his ability, given he was an entrepreneur to have a vision as well. I think those are the qualities they were looking for in a CEO to take Snowflake to the next level, so to speak."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, one of the things I've heard people talk about is that Slootman more of a sales guy, Ramaswamy, more of a technologist as you put it. But this is a company that seems to be in an interesting spot. Growth is still strong but slowing a little bit. They talked about changing the forecast process to be more receptive to current trends. That seems like some double speak for things aren't going to get better. What's happening with this?"", ""David Meier: That's a whole lot of words [laughs] Here's my interpretation, and we're seeing this across a number of larger SaaS oriented companies. This idea that customers are still optimizing their spending. What that's meaning is, we know the things that we want to do from the technological standpoint are important and we customers are willing to make these investments. But how do we ensure that we get the right return on the investment? How do we make sure that our spending levels don't get out of control? What I think that word solid is trying to say is they don't have enough evidence to say, customer buying behavior has flipped back to a times when they were more willing to spend. As a result, it's you're not confident that that's happening. You can't really put that in your guidance. To show that the demand levels are changing, the buying habits are changing, and as a result, we're going to resume faster growth. That's what I think that means. Growth is expected to slow on a quarterly basis for Snowflake across calendar year 2024. I think that statement basically was necessary as a justification about why that's going to happen."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, I think we're hearing a different type of reasoning for this slowdown than we were a couple of quarters ago. Because we were hearing before, the sales cycle is slow, this is what we're experiencing. Now, I feel like with Snowflake and with Okta too. I'm hearing more about the customer base isn't going to grow dramatically, but we're going make more products. We're going to get more out of each customer. On the Okta call, they talked about this, the hunter and farmer models. Hunter goes out, gets new clients, farmer basically gets more out of the land. Is this a theme we're seeing? Is this a next trend of what we're possibly going to see from some of the SaaS companies?"", ""David Meier: It's very interesting from an Okta standpoint that that's what they brought out in their call because this model has actually, is already being used by lots and lots of different SaaS companies."", 'Deidre Woollard: Yes.', ""David Meier: The reason is just as you said, once you get through that big push of adoption and you become a mainstream product, customers are going to come in. Yes, we want it. But investing in sales and marketing that gets your customers to buy more is potentially a way to get more return on those dollars. Good companies have figured out how to do both. It's good that both of these companies have recognized it. Okta brought it to the conference call with some fanfare. But as a SaaS company, you needed to be doing this a couple of years ago. Let's put it that way. This should have been your model from Day 1."", 'Deidre Woollard: It seems like the platform amortization is part of a way to bundle that up as a sales tool, but also as a framework.', ""David Meier: A 100%. Because if you can figure out, let's say a customer has a need for one product, you can get them in the door that way. But once you learn more about that customer, once you develop a relationship with them, once you've figured out more about what their needs are. That's the perfect opportunity to say, hey, by the way, we also have product X and product Y, and product Z and we can bundle them together and you can get them on our platform. It's seamless in terms of since we're a SaaS company, we can flip a switch and you can get access. That's spot on"", 'Deidre Woollard: Well, thank you for breaking it down with me today, David.', ""David Meier: You're very welcome, Deidre. Thank you."", ""Deidre Woollard: We talked about a lot of stocks on the show, but it's just a peak. The Motley Fool's investing universe. This year we're rolling out a new offering.

I caught up with Gary Stevenson, author of the trading game about his time at Citibank and the disconnect between traders and the real economic world."", ""Deidre Woollard: I want to get a little bit into your story because there are these moments in the story where you're trading and there's that tension. You had a few like I'd call them stomach flip over our moments. One from me is when you realized these fresheners no banks offering -4.5% interest on three-month swaps. There's just a moment where I think people who have less tolerance for risk might've pulled out their money. You went the opposite way. It reminds me of this, there's a saying from the Economist Keynes about the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. Tell us a little bit about what happened there."", ""Gary Stevenson: Yes, it's a very big learning experience. That was my second full-year trading. I started working as a short-term registrar in 2008, which is obviously the Lima crisis. It became enormously profitable business because we were making short-term loans of dollars, everybody needed dollars. Basically, we could borrow them from the Central Bank at zero and lend them out at 2%. It was a lot of easy money, basically. When you do it in the ethics swap, you have to lend one currency and borrow another currency. At that time I was a Swiss franc trader, I was lending dollars and borrowing Swiss francs. It was an easy ride, to be honest, everybody was making a lot of money. I made a lot of money in my first year when I was extremely young, didn't know what I was doing and I was just copying everybody really lending dollars, borrowing but unlike experts Swiss francs, every trader has their own currency. Then suddenly one day I have nowhere. I refresh my P&L, it's my PNS profit and loss for those who don't know, and it shows down half $1 million and I'm thinking what's going on here? I'm trying to look for the reason. I just wanted to brokers and the brokers says Swiss National Bank has put something up on their website. I look on the website and the Swiss National Bank is offering this unbelievably cheap foreign exchange swap, where they essentially lend out Swiss francs for -4.5%, which is, I don't need to tell you, an extremely negative rate. The Swiss franc position was an incidental part of my dollar position. I had an FX swap, I was lending dollars. You have to borrow Swiss francs against it, that's the way the FX swap works. Suddenly I was just getting absolutely hammered."", ""Then I lost something like $1 million that first day basically. I described it to you before when you trade interest rates is realizable. You do the trade now, you wait a year and you see, was I right or not? Then immediately, instinctively, again we discussed in the book whether this is real, whether it was an emotional reaction. I thought -4.5% is an impossibly low interest rate. You simply cannot keep rates at -4.5%. If you charge the banking system -4.5%, they'll start trying to charge that to their customers, their customers will take the money out of the bank because you can get 0% with your money under your pillow. I just thought it's wrong, it's never going to stay at 4.5%. In the first couple of days, I lost a couple of million dollars and instead of stepping out, I stepped in and backed it up. It turns out I was right. In the long run, those interest rates were not sustainable and they came all the way back relatively quickly. But because I was stepping into the position quite aggressively despite losing money, I managed to lose $8 million P&L within a week, which is an enormous amount. At the time, that was only 2010 so I would've been 23 still."", ""It was enormous amount of money for me to lose and I eventually ended up getting stocked up by my management. I went from up $4 million for the year to down $4 million for the year, and then obviously I had to watch the trade come all the way back. Anyone who has been trading for long time will know this. It's not enough to just be right. You need to be able to survive. You need to be there by the time you're actually right. Sometimes being right is the easier part of the trade. Sometimes the tricky part is knowing how much to do. Especially if you're basically certain you're right because if you're certain you're right, you want to do everything. But if you do everything, then even if it goes against you for a month or maybe even a week, if it's a big move, you'll get stocked up and it doesn't matter whether you're right. I think that's described in the book as, basically two rules for life, be right in the end, be alive at the end. It's super-important. I tried to stand up to the Swiss National Bank."", ""Deidre Woollard: One of the things I found interesting in the book that I feel like sometimes people who come in from the outside, like you did, they're often able to see beyond the status quo. One of the things in the book, it's this juxtaposition of institutional and university knowledge and economic theory versus the ability to rest, go the opposite way, follow your gut, which it seems like it's an advantage when the economy doesn't perform the way that everybody expects it will. During the time period where you just keep betting on interest rates staying suppressed. You were very young. Was your youth, your outsider's data an advantage at that point?"", ""Gary Stevenson: It definitely was in the end because I think one of the beautiful things about trading is there's not many spaces in this world that rewards you for turning around to all of the people around and saying, you guys, you're all wrong. Human societies are not generally built to reward those people. If you turn around and said to everybody around you, you're all wrong, then you'll become quite unpopular very quickly and I think this causes problems of intellectual groupthink. It causes problems in politics, it causes the problems in academia, it cause problems in economics because we as humans don't like it when we're called wrong. We tend to punish people who say we're all wrong. We can end up with situations like where we are now, where the economy just gets worse year after year and the economists are wrong year after year and nobody can basically call them out. I tried to be in academia and it's basically impossible to challenge these people. Whereas in trading, if everyone around you is wrong and you notice it, you are going to make an absolute fortune. It's music to my ears as a trader, when everybody around me says, no Gary, you're wrong because I know everybody thinks I'm wrong. I'm going to make an absolute fortune."", ""I think this is where we talk about class a lot in the book. Here in London, there's a stereotype of the cockneywide boy market boy trader. This artful dodger-type character because back in the '80s and '90s, the financial areas in the east of London, which is where these people used to live. And in the '80s and '90s, there are a lot of these people going into trading. In the early 2000s, things massively changed. By now, basically, unless you are from a very rich family and went to elite schools, it's almost impossible to get in there. Once you're in there, there is actually a massive sameness about these people. They might have come from the same countries, very international, but they will come from rich families, elite schools, elite universities, elite jobs, and they basically don't know anyone who is poor. This guy's job is economic analysis. How much can you realistically know about the economy if you don't know a single person in an average financial situation? This is a situation, both in the universities and in most of politics, and in the trading floor. After 2008, markets predicted that interest rates would go up in 2009 and they didn't, and then in 2010, and they didn't, and then '11, and then '12, and then '13, and then '14. Every year, these guys predicted essentially an economic recovery. After two-and-a-half years of this, you start thinking, these guys are just clueless, they're just wrong. But the big advantage I had, is I could go out and ask people. I studied economics at their own School of Economics. I know the theory. The theory is basically low interest rates are supposed to get you spending."", ""Go out at the time when rates are very low, you go out and ask people why don't you spend everyone will say exactly the same thing. We don't have any money. Then you sit there, pondering this idea, we know that hundreds of billions are being poured in and nobody's got any money. I was bouncing this around in my head and I was trying to work out, where is this money going? Then one day you look around and you realize, everyone in this room is a multimillionaire. [laughs] You know where the money is going and it's not going to get to ordinary people. I think that was the penny drop moment for me and I realized what we have is a fundamental crisis of inequality. Nobody's seriously talking about fixing that. Everybody wants growth and productivity. The problem is inequality. Nobody's fixing that. I realized this is not a recession. This is not one one-week year, there's not two-week years. This is a downhill slope all the way to hell and I started betting on that and by the end of the year, I was Citibank's most profitable trader in the world. You said when you went above that?"", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, that's the turning point in the book is you're trading all the time. You're betting on this situation. As you said, one of the top traders in the world. These are just massive numbers shifting back and forth on your profit and loss sheet. At that point were you still aware of the numbers, the money behind it, or did it just become pure numbers for you?"", ""Gary Stevenson: This is the thing about games. We've spoken about the positive side of the games and I love games. I still love games now. Game theory was my big subject at university and I still play games when I have a little bit of time and I want to zone out. Games are very engrossing and they can suck you in and they can become addicted. The big game that we play, all of us in this world is the game of money. We're all trying to make money. I've got a YouTube channel and I'll put videos every week saying, listen, if we don't deal with this growing inequality, our society will collapse and your kids will be heartbreakingly poor. The number 1 most common message I get sent on that channel is Gary, how do I make money? This is the dark side of games. I've put us through the epigraph, the quote in the beginning of the book of quote from my friend's Grandad, he used to wander around his house when we were kids, he was Indian and he didn't speak much English. He used to just say, life is life, game is a game. We never really understood what he meant. But I think I've come to understand. I think what it means is, if you focus too much on the game, then you can easily forget about what's important. The book, I think, has that comment about society but it absolutely definitely has that comment about me, and you've read the book."", 'There is without a doubt, I became so engrossed with this game and so obsessed with this game, and I was very good at the game but it absolutely consumed me and overwhelmed me and it just became everything that I did. Games are great [laughs] but if you lean too much into them, that is obviously a downside as well.', ""Deidre Woollard: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about.

Except for Tesla, each Magnificent Seven stock has a market cap over $1 trillion.', ""However, I'd argue that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the most influential among megacap tech companies at the moment. Nvidia specializes in manufacturing semiconductor chips called graphics processing units (GPU)."", 'Over the last year, demand for GPUs skyrocketed, given their role across a variety of generative AI applications including machine learning and accelerated computing. As such, shares of Nvidia have gone parabolic -- rocketing up to 284% in the last year.', 'In terms of dollars, consider that as of market close on March 7, Nvidia has added $1 trillion of market cap to its value since mid-January. The best part? I think the ride is just getting started.', ""Let's dig into how Nvidia gained access to the exclusive $2 trillion club, and why further gains could be on the horizon."", ""Nvidia generates revenue from several sources including graphics processors, compute networking, and data center operations. During the company's fiscal 2024, ended Jan. 28, Nvidia's largest revenue stream was from its data center business -- which grew 217% year over year."", ""This is undoubtedly impressive, but what investors may not totally understand is that Nvidia's data center business has been steadily rising for quite some time. In fact, revenue from the broader compute and networking division (which includes data centers) has increased more than 1,000% in just four years."", ""This is an important data point because in a way it undermines that Nvidia has been at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI) for a while. Given the company's first-mover advantage as it pertains to AI-powered chips and quantum computing, Nvidia has amassed significant pricing power over its peers."", ""Unsurprisingly, Nvidia's accelerating revenue led to significant margin expansion and is dropping to the bottom line. For the year ended Jan. 28, Nvidia grew its free cash flow by more than sixfold over the prior year to $27 billion."", ""Now, with an arsenal of capital and interest in AI rising, Nvidia looks well positioned to keep dominating. Here's a preview of what the company has been exploring beyond its GPU and data center businesses."", 'With so much cash at its disposal, Nvidia has quietly been deploying capital into other areas that could unlock further sustained growth.', ""Back in September, Nvidia participated in a $500 million funding round in artificial intelligence (AI) start-up Databricks. At first glance, this may look like a bit of a head-scratcher. But during the fourth quarter earnings call, Nvidia investors learned about the company's latest billion-dollar business -- enterprise software."", ""While Nvidia has been hard at work investing in its core chip business, the company also quietly built a software platform that it hopes will complement the semiconductor operation. Indeed, software services have myriad applications in the realm of AI. And while the partnership with Databricks is exciting, Nvidia isn't stopping there."", 'Another unique area that Nvidia is investing is voice-recognition software. The company holds a small stake in a company called SoundHound AI.', ""I found this particularly interesting because many of Nvidia's big tech cohorts have been investing in this technology for years. Since Apple's acquisition of voice-assistant Siri, the technology has become integrated throughout the company's hardware ecosystem. Furthermore, both Amazon and Alphabet use voice-powered AI for their respective lines of smart-home appliances."", 'Meanwhile, Microsoft acquired smart assistant Nuance a few years ago for a whopping $20 billion. Given that the market for voice-powered software services is expected to reach $50 billion by the end of the decade, I can see why Nvidia followed its counterparts.', 'The last area that Nvidia is showing interest is humanoid robotics. For years, Tesla has garnered most of the attention surrounding this technology due to its Optimus bot. But recently, Nvidia joined Intel Capital, OpenAI, and Jeff Bezos in a funding round for Figure AI. Robotics is a particularly subtle area in which Nvidia could disrupt both the hardware and software applications.', ""As a long-term investor, I am encouraged by Nvidia's aggressive pursuits beyond GPUs and data center operations. While the software business is still relatively small and these investments are still in nascent phases of their potential, Nvidia's AI roadmap looks enticing."", ""At a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 74, Nvidia stock isn't cheap. However, the company's revenue and profits are soaring -- and I don't see that stopping anytime soon."", 'It took over two decades for Nvidia to reach a $1 trillion dollar market cap. It took less than a year to get to $2 trillion.', ""While I can't say definitely where Nvidia is headed next, I'm confident further gains are in store in the long run. Given the company's investments into various new markets, Nvidia is quickly differentiating its business from the competition."", 'In the long run, I see Nvidia becoming a full-spectrum AI platform connected by a unique combination of both hardware and software. Despite its premium valuation, I think now is a terrific time to scoop up some shares.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Well over 50% of global foundry revenue is generated by TSMC, a consequence of the company's significant manufacturing lead over its rivals. Chip designers like Apple and Nvidia have little choice but to choose TSMC to maximize the performance and efficiency of their chips."", 'Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and its nascent foundry business generates little in the way of revenue, but the chip giant is starting to make plenty of noise. The company now has $15 billion worth of deals locked down, spread across manufacturing and advanced packaging. Notably, Intel recently scored Microsoft as a customer for an unnamed future chip.', 'In a recent interview, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger didn\'t mince words when speaking about the importance of the upcoming Intel 18A process node, which Microsoft and other foundry customers will use, saying, ""I\'ve bet the whole company on 18A.""', ""Intel expects the Intel 18A process to top TSMC's best in terms of performance and efficiency, capping an incredible turnaround that will see five process nodes launch in four years. Intel 18A is still on track to be ready for volume production by the end of the year."", 'While Intel offers other manufacturing processes through its foundry, Intel 18A will be the star of the show. A deal with Arm Holdings will optimize the process for Arm-based chips, opening the door for Intel to manufacture chips for smartphones, servers, and everything in between. The Intel 18A process will also be used by the U.S. Department of Defense as part of the effort to bring critical chip manufacturing to U.S. soil.', ""While the Intel 18A process will deliver plenty of performance and efficiency improvements over Intel's current manufacturing tech on its own, one critical technology will help it stand above the competition from TSMC and Samsung. Intel will be the first foundry to offer backside power delivery, a huge deal for customers seeking high-performance, power-efficient chips."", ""Intel's take on backside power delivery is called PowerVia. Traditionally, the tiny wires used to deliver power to a chip have sat on top of all the layers that make up a modern semiconductor. This was fine in the past, but as chip technology has advanced, this approach has reached its limit. The wires that deliver power end up competing with the wires that connect components, creating a mess that wastes power and leads to lower efficiency."", 'PowerVia moves the power interconnects to the backside of the chip, removing this conflict. The company has said that this change enables a 6% increase in clock speed, which translates into higher performance. This performance gain is on top of the performance benefit gained from moving to a more advanced process node.', ""PowerVia will actually debut with Intel's 20A process, which will be used for the company's Arrow Lake PC chips later this year. Intel 18A will then improve on Intel 20A and be available to foundry customers in 2025."", ""Intel will be about a year ahead of TSMC in implementing backside power delivery, giving the Intel 18A process a critical advantage as it ramps up production next year. TSMC is expected to introduce the technology in its N2P process node, which won't be coming until sometime in 2026."", ""Meanwhile, Samsung is reportedly racing to implement the technology. Reports indicate that the company is moving up its plan to use backside power delivery in a process node due to launch sometime in 2025, although this hasn't been confirmed by Samsung. Regardless, Intel will still be the first to market with the technology."", 'Intel is playing catch-up in semiconductor manufacturing after rampant delays in the past enabled TSMC to pull ahead. For the first time in a long time, Intel will beat TSMC to the punch with a critical new technology. The company has already won over Microsoft, and more major customer wins are likely in the cards as Intel 18A, boosted by backside power delivery, nears completion.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Intel, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

Had you invested $10,000 at its initial public offering, you'd have over $3.4 million today. But even winning stocks fall into slumps, and Starbucks is currently in one, down roughly 28% from its former high."", 'So what gives? Starbucks has dealt with several issues, including new CEO leadership under Laxman Narasimhan. Additionally, the company has been trying to put out fires and persuade its workers not to unionize.', ""But history shows that now could be the time to buy the dip. I'll explain why you should consider buying Starbucks and holding the stock forever."", ""Coffee is a cultural staple worldwide, allowing Starbucks to grow from a regional coffee chain into a global juggernaut with over 38,000 stores. It's a brilliant business model. Coffee is a profitable beverage to produce and sell, and Starbucks has thrived by building fantastic brand loyalty."", ""The company's loyalty program has a whopping 34.3 million Americans enrolled, with $3.6 billion on their Starbucks cards. Those funds are essentially an interest-free loan to the business, which management uses to open new stores or repurchase shares. That's helped drive years of solid revenue and earnings growth with little disruption along the way (aside from the pandemic)."", ""As profits grow, Starbucks returns more money to shareholders. The company has raised its dividend for 13 consecutive years and has repurchased enough stock to lower its share count by 25% over the past decade. Excellent investment returns are achieved when you take consistent, strong growth and juice it by lowering the share count. It's a formula that keeps working."", ""Starbucks has also worked through some adversity. Shares were down nearly 40% from their highs in 2022, the stock's most significant decline since the late 2000s. The company had struggled to find a suitable replacement for former CEO and founder Howard Schultz. Ultimately, the company hired Laxman Narasimhan, formerly Chief Commercial Officer at PepsiCo. He has been the CEO of Starbucks for less than a year."", 'It will take time to see how Narasimhan performs. Notably, he may have scored an early win.

Labor peace is a win for everyone, including investors.', 'Interestingly, Starbucks has been quite volatile over the years, routinely falling 30%. However, losing more than 30% from its high is pretty rare. As you can see below, there have been many declines, but most that extended past 30% were driven by significant stock market crashes, like in 2008 and 2020. If that trend holds, Starbucks might not fall much further than where it currently is.', ""Fundamentally speaking, the stock is attractively valued today as well. Shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22; analysts believe the company's earnings will compound by more than 15% annually over the next three to five years. Using a P/E-to-growth (PEG) ratio to compare the stock's valuation to its anticipated growth, the current ratio of 1.4 signals Starbucks is a solid buy, assuming it delivers the growth that analysts expect."", ""Shares are deep into on-sale territory, and there's no indication that Starbucks can't keep delivering on the formula that's made millionaires out of some long-term investors. Investors should do their homework, but it's hard not to like Starbucks as a stock to snap up and hold on to for the long term at today's prices."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Starbucks right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Starbucks, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Starbucks wasn’t one of them.

You can skip our detailed analysis of NASDAQ stocks and the performance of dividend stocks over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy.\xa0', ""The NASDAQ, which primarily consists of technology-related stocks, has been experiencing upward momentum since the previous year. In 2023, it saw remarkable growth, achieving its strongest performance since 2020 with an increase of over 43%. As of March 7, it has gained 10.21%, surpassing the broader market's gain of 8.72% this year so far. Notably, according to Jonathan Krinsky, a leading market analyst at BTIG, the NASDAQ-100, which is heavily concentrated in tech, has endured 303 consecutive trading sessions without experiencing a decline of 2.5% or more as of March 5, marking it as the third-longest period without such a significant pullback since 1990. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of the best dividend stocks listed on the index."", ""The impressive performance of NASDAQ can be largely attributed to the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, which has driven up the prices of major technology stocks and boosted the overall market throughout 2023 and into the current year. Additionally, the easing of inflation and the Federal Reserve's indication of potential rate cuts later in 2024 have further supported NASDAQ's rebound from the challenges it faced in 2022. Despite the prevalence of technology companies in the NASDAQ index, many companies offer dividends to shareholders. A notable recent addition to the list of dividend-paying companies in the index is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), which made headlines in February of this year by declaring its inaugural dividend. This move marks a significant milestone for the technology sector, which has long been dominated by a select few companies for more than a decade."", ""Meta's decision to offer a dividend serves as evidence that investors are increasingly interested in dividend-paying stocks for their capacity to provide consistent and reliable income. This trend was evident in 2023 when companies in the US distributed record dividends to their shareholders. According to a report by Janus Henderson, the S&P 500 paid out an all-time high of $70.30 per share last year, a notable increase from $66.92 in 2022. This resulted in a total payment to shareholders reaching a record $588.2 billion, surpassing the previous year's figure of $564.6 billion. The report also mentioned that there were 707 instances of dividend increases reported in the fourth quarter of 2023. These increases amounted to a total of $17.5 billion for the quarter, showing an uptick from the $16.3 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022."", ""Furthermore, dividend-paying stocks have historically delivered robust returns. Since 1960, dividends have contributed to approximately one-third of the market's total return. Dividend stocks offer a degree of stability during periods of increased market volatility. According to a report by Perkins Coie, a Washington-based law firm, dividend-paying stocks exhibit 30%-33% lower volatility compared to non-dividend-paying stocks. This stability has been particularly notable during turbulent decades like the 1930s and 2000s, where dividend-paying stocks served as a buffer against significant declines in market prices. In addition to this, dividend-paying companies that consistently increase their dividends can provide better protection against inflation than bonds in an inflationary environment."", 'In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks listed on NASDAQ.', 'Photo by nick chong on Unsplash', 'Our Methodology:', 'For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 933 hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2023 and selected companies that are trading on the NASDAQ exchange and also pay dividends to shareholders.

Gains of that scope aren\'t unheard of, but they\'re hardly the norm. To make those sorts of picks generally requires a ""right time, right place"" scenario.', ""With that in mind, I view these three names as having the potential to turn a $1,000 investment now into $5,000 by 2030. Just bear in mind you're taking above-average risks for the chance to reap above-average rewards."", 'You may not be familiar with Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) yet -- but give it time. By the early 2030s, the chain of coffee shop drive-thrus aims to be more than four times bigger than it is right now.', ""There were 831 Dutch Bros locations up and running as of the end of last year, thanks to the 159 new sites it opened in 2023. That's just the beginning, though. The longer-term goal is as many as 4,000 stores within the next 10 to 15 years. The company plans to add between 150 and 165 new locations this year alone."", 'This sounds ambitious, particularly given the dominance of Starbucks, which already manages more than 16,000 coffee shops in the United States alone. How can Dutch Bros realistically expect to grow that quickly in the shadow of such a well-established player?', ""The answer is by being everything Starbucks isn't. Not only is Dutch Bros strictly a drive-thru operation, but in contrast with Starbucks' companywide uniformity, each Dutch Bros has its own unique personality. The company is also community-oriented -- it's not uncommon for its stores to participate in local fundraisers. Employees' attire is casual as well."", ""There was a time when this less-than-consistent, un-uniform presence wouldn't have been marketable. Consumers' tastes and expectations are changing, however. Authenticity sells, and there's no denying Dutch Bros is authentic."", ""The kicker: This young coffee chain has one extra competitive advantage. Its CEO, Christine Barone, held a variety of leadership positions with Starbucks. She most definitely knows the business, and how Dutch Bros' top competitor operates."", 'Given that the stock is already up nearly 300% from its late-2022 low, it might be difficult to believe DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG) has room to quadruple in value by 2030. Sports betting is already legal in most U.S. states, after all. How much more growth is left to tap?', 'That line of thinking, however, ignores a handful of important details.', ""First, while the American Gaming Association reports that at least some forms of sports wagering are now legal in 38 states, that doesn't necessarily mean that online or mobile sports betting -- DraftKings' core business -- is permitted in all of those states. The DraftKings app is only legal in 24 states so far. However, seven more states are considering expanded sports wagering legislation right now. Online legalization tends to follow offline legalization, and mobile follows that."", ""In the meantime, the U.S. sports wagering market (in any form) is still relatively immature wherever it's allowed. The Supreme Court only struck down the sweeping federal ban on sports wagering in 2018. Even in states where the legalization hurdles have been cleared, there's still a lot of marketing and consumer education that needs to be done."", ""Second, while a great deal of attention has been given to the ongoing legalization efforts within the United States, this country isn't DraftKings's only market. It has an operating presence in a handful of European countries as well, for instance, where interest in wagering is just as strong, and may soon be entering more international markets."", ""Third, while its roots are in the fantasy sports arena and it has made a name for itself as a sportsbook in the meantime, sports wagering isn't the whole of DraftKings' business any longer. It's also easing into conventional online casino games, leveraging its respected brand as well as its ever-growing user base, with 7.1 million regular users of its app at last report."", 'Whatever the mix, the backdrop is decidedly bullish. Straits Research forecasts that the worldwide online sports betting market will grow at an annualized pace of 11% through 2032.

Some of you might view this business as a possible opportunity today.', ""Let's look at the bull and bear arguments for this leading restaurant stock. Then you'll come away with some basic knowledge that can inform your decision-making process."", ""To be as successful as Starbucks has for such a long time, there needs to be a strong competitive advantage. In this case, it's the company's powerful brand."", ""This not only results in significant pricing power, but it also helps differentiate Starbucks' offerings versus rivals'. And I'm confident that because of the brand's relevance, this business will still be dominating the industry decades from now."", ""Investors can't ignore just how financially successful Starbucks is. In the last decade, the company's operating margin has averaged 14.9%. Credit goes to its massive scale, which has resulted in consistent profitability."", ""Starbucks produced $6 billion of operating cash flow in fiscal 2023 (ended Oct. 1), which is a usual occurrence. Management directs this capital to dividends and stock buybacks. In fact, since Q1 2019, the company's outstanding share count has been reduced by 9%, a move that boosts earnings per share."", ""What has helped Starbucks maintain its position in an intensely competitive industry is its focus on bolstering its digital capabilities. Perhaps no other restaurant chain does it better. It's all about increasing accessibility and convenience for its customers, which includes its thriving mobile app. It boasts 34.3 million 90-day active members in the U.S."", 'Starbucks is able to collect comprehensive data from its customer base that can be used to drive marketing campaigns and menu introductions. The coffee titan also does a good job of engaging consumers. In the latest fiscal quarter, Starbucks had the second-most gift card activations of any brand in the U.S.', ""Despite Starbucks' well-known brand and its impressive mobile app, industry dynamics should always be on the top of every shareholder's mind. The entire restaurant sector, including the retail coffee industry, is extremely competitive. This means that Starbucks can't rest on its laurels. It will constantly have to focus on finding ways of better serving its customers to maintain its position. "", ""In the U.S., the business goes against heavyweights like McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts, plus the vast number of independent coffee shops that have a more premium feel. In the company's fastest-growing market, China, Starbucks must worry about the more dominant Luckin Coffee."", ""I applauded the company's consistent profitability earlier. But it's discouraging to know that operating margin in fiscal 2023 of 16.3% was lower than the 16.5% it was in fiscal 2013. The business hasn't been able to expand margins lately."", ""The leadership team wants to drive greater efficiencies going forward, which could help the bottom line rise faster than sales if strategies are executed properly. However, given the huge increase in revenue in the last decade, without a corresponding lift in margin, it's hard to be optimistic."", ""Even though Starbucks currently has 38,587 stores across the globe, management sees there being 55,000 locations open by 2030. A lot of this growth will come from China, but there's considerable potential even in the U.S. Further penetrating existing markets with digitally enabled smaller-format stores is vital."", ""However, it's totally unreasonable to expect Starbucks to register much faster revenue growth in the years ahead than it did historically.

That's not due to any recent price spike, of course. The coffee titan's shares sat out of the 2023 stock market rally and are down over the past full year. But the business is clearly past its big expansion phases now that Starbucks operates nearly 40,000 locations around the world."", ""Don't assume this stock is done producing strong shareholder returns, though. Let's look at a few reasons why it's not too late to make Starbucks a key part of your growth-focused portfolio."", ""Owning Starbucks doesn't mean you have to settle for sluggish revenue growth. Comparable-store sales were up 5% in the most recent quarter, matching the gains that investors recently saw in Dutch Bros, which is much earlier on in its growth story."", ""It's also great news that Starbucks is achieving its sales gains through a balance of rising customer traffic and increased average spending. It stands out from McDonald's in this area, which has been posting declining traffic into early 2024."", 'Starbucks is finding room to expand its store footprint at the same time. It added 550 restaurants to its base last quarter. Management is targeting international markets like China but also pushing into more rural areas in the core U.S. geography. These wins helped overall revenue rise 8% last quarter to $9.4 billion.', ""There are challenges facing the business, though. Starbucks' growth has slowed in recent months, for example, just as it has for most of its restaurant and fast-food peers. That's because shoppers are spending more cautiously after prices spiked in 2023. It will be harder to grow sales in that environment, especially now that price increases are slowing."", 'Most Wall Street pros are looking for sales to rise by about 8% this year, which isn\'t particularly exciting, compared to what you might find in the tech industry. Management said in late January that ""headwinds"" are pressuring demand into early 2024 but the outlook is still bright around profits and cash flow.', ""Speaking of profits, Starbucks' earnings prospects haven't looked this strong in a while. Operating profit margin is approaching its high of 16% of sales, even though revenue growth is slowing. That boost suggests that the chain can hit a record once the next cyclical upturn starts."", '""I am proud of the significant margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth we delivered...as it underscores our multiple paths to earnings growth,"" CFO Rachel Ruggeri told investors back in January.', ""Those paths include innovative drink releases, the Starbucks loyalty program, and a bigger push into the drive-thru and delivery niches. Combined with steady improvements to the in-store experience, these initiatives should keep the chain near the top of the industry when it comes to comps growth over the next several years, even as the store base lifts global revenue. Toss in even modest profitability increases, and you've got all the ingredients you need for market-thumping returns."", ""It's true that Starbucks is a mature business that's unlikely to grow at the over 20% rate that investors are seeing with, say, Dutch Bros.

Countless companies have already increased their payouts, with many hiking them by 10% or more. Several others will likely give their investors a big raise this year.', ""Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX), and MPLX (NYSE: MPLX) appear poised to hike their payouts in 2024. Here's why that makes them appealing options for dividend growth investors."", ""Microsoft might not offer a big dividend yield (it's currently around 0.8%). However, the tech titan has done an exceptional job of growing its payout over the years. It has grown its dividend at around a 10% compound annual rate over the past 10 years, including giving investors a 10% raise last September. At its current 10% compound annual growth rate, Microsoft's dividend will double every seven years. "", ""The company is in an excellent position to continue growing its payout at a strong annual clip. It's a cash flow machine. It produced a whopping $49.4 billion of net cash from operations over the last six months and $29.8 billion of free cash. That easily covered its $10.6 billion in dividend payments. Microsoft also has a cash-rich balance sheet ($81 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments at the end of its last fiscal year). "", 'Microsoft has lots of growth drivers, including its investments in gaming (Activision acquisition) and AI (OpenAI partnership). These and other catalysts should enable the tech titan to continue growing its cash flow at a healthy clip. Because of that, it seems likely that the company will hike its dividend again later this year.', ""Starbucks delivered its 13th annual dividend increase last fall, hiking its payout by another 7.5%. With that raise, the coffee giant has grown its payout at an impressive 20% compound annual rate since initiating its dividend in 2010. It currently yields 2.5%, which is well above average (considering the S&P 500's 1.4% dividend yield). "", 'The company launched its Triple Shot Reinvention strategy last fall to recharge its growth. It plans to accelerate store expansion to 55,000 global locations by 2030 (up from 38,000) while unlocking efficiency gains to save $3 billion annually. ', 'Starbucks believes this strategy will drive 10% to 12% revenue growth in fiscal 2024 and 15% to 20% earnings growth. Meanwhile, it sees revenue rising 10%-plus and earnings growth of more than 15% over the long term. Because of that, the company could reaccelerate dividend growth by giving its shareholders an even bigger raise this year. ', ""MPLX has increased its distribution every year since its formation in 2012. The master limited partnership (MLP) has hiked its payout by 10% in each of the last two years. That's impressive, considering its monster yield of 8.4%. "", 'That big-time payout is on an extremely firm foundation. MPLX generated enough cash to cover it by a comfy 1.6 times last year. That enabled it to retain all the money needed to fund its expansion projects with over $800 million to spare. It used that excess cash to make an opportunistic acquisition (it bought the remaining 40% interest in a gathering and processing joint venture for $270 million in December) and strengthen its already fortress-like balance sheet. MPLX ended the year with $1 billion in cash and a low 3.3 times leverage ratio (well below the 4.0 times its stable cash flow could support). ', ""The company's cash flow is growing at a solid clip (more than 7% last year), fueled by organic expansion projects. It expects to complete several this year, which, along with last year's acquisition, will give it more cash to grow its payout. Add its growing cash flow to its robust financial capacity, and the MLP could easily hike its payout by another 10% this year. "", ""Microsoft, Starbucks, and MPLX have grown their payouts at above-average rates over the years. That seems likely to continue in 2024.

No one can blame them for this either, as after inflation and interest rates set records, 2024 has also been a record setting year for the stock market."", ""The artificial intelligence fueled mania, exacerbated by the earnings season in January that confirmed to investors that the demand for AI products was real and not just hype has pushed the S&P 500 index to cross the coveted 5,000 point mark for the first time in history. This comes after the NASDAQ's record setting spree last year and follows the second half of 2023 that had seen investors wonder whether the soaring S&P 500 in H1 2023 would continue its upward trajectory in the second half."", ""This surge in the stock market, even as the Federal Reserve remains worried about inflation, has made NVIDIA one of the most valuable companies in the world and made it surpass the market volumes big ticket mega cap names the likes of Amazon.com, Inc.

Interest rates are still too high to be considered easy for business, and most investors expect that the first cuts will come in June - a percentage that increases for a July cut. The last week of February is also quite important because of the data that will become available. This will come in the form of the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index reading for January. The PCE is one of the most important data to judge the Fed's future actions since it is the central bank's preferred inflation metric. If officials believe that inflation is on a sufficiently downward trend to not raise its head again after an interest rate cut, then rates might start dropping before June.

While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away."", ""Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Sysco (NYSE:SYY).

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Most Reliable Dividend Stocks To Buy.\xa0', 'During times of economic turmoil, investors often shift their attention toward dividend stocks, which provide regular income streams. The reliability of these stocks depends on factors such as their historical growth performance, cash flow stability, payout ratios, and overall financial health reflected in their balance sheets. Among these, dividend growth emerges as the most important factor when considering investing in dividend stocks. Moreover, historical returns have shown the outperformance of dividend growth strategies over an average dividend stock. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, outperformed the broader market with lower volatility over the long run. The report also mentioned that the index demonstrates its capacity to offer downside protection through its upside and downside capture ratios. The index surpassed the performance of the S&P 500 in down months 69.34% of the time and in up months 43.61% of the time.', 'Dividend stocks that offer both a substantial yield and a track record of consistent dividend growth strike a balance between distributing dividends to shareholders and reinvesting capital into future growth endeavors. Nuveen reported FactSet data which showed that dividends per share rose by 5% in the S&P 500, and it is anticipated that there will be similar growth in 2024 based on consensus estimates. In addition to this, over 325 companies within the index either raised their dividends per share or introduced a dividend over the past year.', 'As mentioned earlier, the payout ratio holds a significant importance when assessing the dependability of dividend stocks. Companies with high payout ratios may face challenges in future growth, which could jeopardize both stock price appreciation and dividend growth. Fortunately, the S&P 500’s dividend payout ratio remains below its long-term average. Consensus estimates also indicate an 11% growth in earnings per share for 2024, which should support attractive returns for shareholders. Moreover, companies are maintaining substantial cash reserves on their balance sheets, with cash totaling roughly $2 trillion as of September 2023, nearing the highest levels in two decades.', ""Though dividend stocks didn’t perform as well as the broader market in 2024, analysts have given a positive stance about dividend equities this year. Goldman Sachs has raised its forecast for dividend payouts in the S&P 500. The firm stated that there has been a surge in investors' attraction towards dividend-paying stocks following Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s recent announcement of its inaugural quarterly dividend. The firm’s analysts noted this heightened interest and consequently revised their forecast for the S&P 500's dividend-per-share payout, increasing it from 4% to 6%. Another reason contributing to the optimism regarding dividends among Goldman's team is the trend of major US corporations consistently exceeding Wall Street's earnings expectations during the last quarter of 2023. Considering investors’ inclination toward dividend stocks, companies are steadily increasing their payouts. Goldman reported that since the beginning of 2024, 56 companies within the S&P 500 index have increased their dividends, with a median increase of 6%. Among these, financial firms and industrial companies, totaling 10 and nine respectively, have played a significant role in driving the overall increase."", 'Some of the best dividend stocks that have raised their dividends for decades and have strong balance sheets include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc.

Adjusted earnings per share were $1.36. Lower pricing and execution margins led to a decline of $0.21 per share versus the prior year period, largely reflecting the impact of lower crush and origination margins. Improved manufacturing costs, primarily related to lower input and energy costs, led to an increase of $0.18 per share versus the prior year.

Higher manufacturing costs, partially related to unplanned downtime at the Decatur complex, led to a $0.41 per share decrease versus the prior year. Increased corporate costs related to higher interest rates and 1ADM implementation, partially offset by higher ADMIS, drove a decrease of $0.30 per share versus the prior year. Lower equity earnings, primarily related to Wilmar, attributed a $0.46 per share decrease versus the prior year.

BAT deserves consideration from income investors open to tobacco stocks, but here we'll focus on just Altria and Philip Morris, two companies with similar product portfolios and who have a history of working together."", ""When the old Philip Morris split in 2008 into Philip Morris International and Altria, which is the parent of Philip Morris USA, PMI took the territory outside the U.S., while Altria retained domestic operations, and the two companies have evolved since. Let's take a look at how the two stocks stack up in various categories to see which is the better buy today."", 'Both tobacco stocks are subject to similar industry trends, including declining cigarette consumption. In its fourth-quarter earnings report, Altria reported a 7.6% decline in cigarette shipment volumes to 18.2 billion, and overall revenue, excluding excise taxes, fell 2.4% to $4.35 billion.', ""Historically, Altria has made up for falling cigarette volumes by raising prices, and it's also looked to new businesses to deliver growth. However, most of those attempts have fallen flat. In 2018, it spent $12.8 billion to acquire a 35% stake in Juul Labs, though a regulatory crackdown erased nearly all the value of that investment, and what's left of it now is some heated tobacco intellectual property rights."", 'An investment in Canadian cannabis grower Cronos Group also led to write-downs and losses, as that industry has underperformed since Canadian legalization.', ""Now, Altria is pinning its hopes on NJOY, which it acquired a year ago for $2.75 billion in cash. NJOY brings a diverse portfolio of both disposable e-cigarettes, branded Daily, and a vape with reusable pods, Ace. NJOY's revenue is believed to be a fraction of Altria's, so its value is in its own growth potential. Altria also sold the commercialization rights in the U.S. for Philip Morris International's heat-not-burn system IQOS back to PMI, showing that it's solely focused on NJOY as its next-gen product."", ""By comparison, Philip Morris seems to have several advantages over Altria. It reported a decline in cigarette volume of just 1.9% to 151.1 billion, as international markets have faced less tobacco regulation as the U.S. has. Philip Morris has also done better at developing its next-gen business as sales of its heated tobacco units (HTUs), largely IQOS, rose 6.1% to 34 billion, which is more cigarettes than Altria sold in total. PMI's purchase of IQOS rights for the U.S. from Altria for $2.7 billion indicates confidence that it can make that product successful in the U.S."", ""Because of its success in HTUs, Philip Morris's overall product shipment volume is nearly flat, and it is on the verge of driving positive growth as HTUs, which were up 6.1% in the latest quarter, replacing cigarettes. More than any other tobacco stock, Philip Morris has found success with next-gen products. That's led to solid revenue growth as well, with adjusted revenue up 8.3% to $9 billion in the fourth quarter."", ""While Philip Morris is growing revenue faster than Altria, it's the more profitable of the two companies based on margins, which is likely a reflection of much of its sales coming from the premium Marlboro brand, and the increased disposable income in the U.S. Altria recorded an adjusted operating income margin of 59.9% last year, compared to 33% for Philip Morris."", ""Still, Philip Morris managed to grow adjusted operating income by 3.7%, while Altria's was flat."", 'Altria currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.3 and offers an impressive dividend yield of 9.6%. Philip Morris, on the other hand, offers a P/E of 17.2 and a dividend yield of 5.8%. That gives Altria a clear edge here.', ""Altria might be more appealing to dividend investors strictly looking for yield, but Philip Morris is the better choice. The company has a much brighter future as its next-gen business has reached scale and cigarette volumes are declining more slowly, and it doesn't face the same regulatory restrictions that Altria does."", ""Altria's dividend does look safe for now, but it can't rely on raising cigarette prices forever. While the NJOY acquisition could pay off, it could also take years for it to positively impact the bottom line. Only one of these stocks offers growth, stability, and high yield, and that's Philip Morris."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Philip Morris International right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Philip Morris International, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Philip Morris International wasn’t one of them.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Thus, you can purchase Western Union's shares before the 14th of March in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 29th of March."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.235 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$0.94 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Western Union has a trailing yield of 6.7% on the current stock price of US$14.04. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether Western Union can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow."", ' See our latest analysis for Western Union ', 'Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Western Union is paying out an acceptable 56% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies.', 'When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable.

If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That explains why we're not overly excited about Western Union's flat earnings over the past five years. We'd take that over an earnings decline any day, but in the long run, the best dividend stocks all grow their earnings per share."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Western Union has lifted its dividend by approximately 6.5% a year on average."", ""Is Western Union worth buying for its dividend? Western Union's earnings per share have been essentially flat, and the company is paying out more than half of its earnings as dividends to shareholders. All things considered, we're not optimistic about its dividend prospects, and would be inclined to leave it on the shelf for now."", ""Although, if you're still interested in Western Union and want to know more, you'll find it very useful to know what risks this stock faces. For example, Western Union has 2 warning signs (and 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) we think you should know about."", ""Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Accordingly, Packaging Corporation of America investors that purchase the stock on or after the 14th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of April."", ""The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.25 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$5.00 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Packaging Corporation of America stock has a trailing yield of around 2.7% on the current share price of US$186.08. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing."", ' See our latest analysis for Packaging Corporation of America ', ""Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Packaging Corporation of America is paying out an acceptable 59% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Dividends consumed 53% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations."", ""It's positive to see that Packaging Corporation of America's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies that aren't growing their earnings can still be valuable, but it is even more important to assess the sustainability of the dividend if it looks like the company will struggle to grow. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That explains why we're not overly excited about Packaging Corporation of America's flat earnings over the past five years. It's better than seeing them drop, certainly, but over the long term, all of the best dividend stocks are able to meaningfully grow their earnings per share. Earnings per share growth has been slim, and the company is already paying out a majority of its earnings. While there is some room to both increase the payout ratio and reinvest in the business, generally the higher a payout ratio goes, the lower a company's prospects for future growth."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Packaging Corporation of America has increased its dividend at approximately 12% a year on average."", ""Has Packaging Corporation of America got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share have barely grown, and although Packaging Corporation of America paid out over half its earnings and free cash flow last year, the payout ratios are within a normal range for most companies. In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy Packaging Corporation of America today."", ""So if you want to do more digging on Packaging Corporation of America, you'll find it worthwhile knowing the risks that this stock faces.

Three Motley Fool contributors, who focus on tech and media investing, have joined forces to explore the advancements in digital advertising, content streaming, and interactive platforms. Let's take a closer look at three exciting investment ideas in widely separate corners of the entertainment sector."", 'Billy Duberstein (Sphere Entertainment): Sphere Entertainment (NYSE: SPHR), formerly known as MSG Entertainment, was formed when MSG Entertainment split into two companies, Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. and Sphere Entertainment, in April 2023.', 'Sphere seems to be the more interesting of the two remaining companies, as it includes the new-age concert venue The Sphere in Las Vegas. Additionally, Sphere also holds the MSG cable networks, which are profitable but face growth headwinds due to cord-cutting. Sphere also held the Tao restaurant/club business, but Sphere has since divested that business, leaving just The Sphere and MSG Networks.', ""The company just reported the first full quarter of operating results for The Sphere Las Vegas, and they were encouraging. Featuring a residency by the band U2 and showings of director Darren Aronofsky's Postcard from Earth, the venue hauled in $167.2 million in revenue and $14.1 million in non-GAAP (adjusted) operating income. While that may not seem like much profit, it seems as though the venue will be able to get more efficient with its showings of both movies, concerts, and dance parties going forward, packing more events into the schedule while also getting more efficient with costs."", 'In fact, The Sphere only had $67.3 million in ""direct"" operating expenses, with the majority of costs taken up by selling, general, and administrative costs. Going forward, it\'s probably a decent bet The Sphere won\'t need as much marketing investment as it becomes more of a well-known destination. Jam bands Phish and Dead & Co. have already announced residencies this spring, so the venue seems like it\'s becoming a trendy destination for entertainers and customers alike.', ""The company also plans to franchise The Sphere to other cities internationally. But the company won't have to undertake the immense costs that were associated with building the owned venue in Vegas. In fact, The Sphere owns the construction company that will build future Spheres, so the company will rake in construction revenue while future Spheres are built, then capital-light franchise fees going forward."", ""Meanwhile, the company's valuation seems compelling. The consolidated company raked in $51.4 million in total operating income last quarter, annualizing to $205 million. The Sphere's $1.67 billion market cap goes for just about 8 times those adjusted profits."", ""Management seems to agree, with chairman and CEO James Dolan buying around $2.4 million worth of stock on Feb. 26, then another $3.1 million worth of stock on Feb. 28. Those buys were made around $40 to $41 per share, not much lower than today's $48 share price."", ""Overall, The Sphere is a new consumer entertainment franchise investors shouldn't ignore."", ""Anders Bylund (The Trade Desk): Imagine if Madison Avenue's ad execs had a matchmaking service, but for ads and eyeballs. That's what The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) does, connecting advertisers to consumers across many different channels, optimizing the living daylights out of the marketing budget."", ""Billboards and TV ads are going digital in a big way, and The Trade Desk is there to help ad buyers make the most out of digital ad channels. It's not just about placing ads; it's about making meaningful, long-lasting connections."", ""That's not as easy as it sounds. The identity of each potential ad viewer is protected by many layers of privacy protections nowadays, and their privacy will only grow more robust when Alphabet removes support for third-party tracking cookies in the ubiquitous Chrome web-browsing engine later this year."", ""But The Trade Desk stands ready to roll with that incoming punch, equipped with a new system for tracking anonymized user behavior. Unified ID 2.0 (UID2) provides an encrypted, user-consented identifier that enables personalized advertising while respecting user privacy. In this system, the web user's online content consumption patterns are blended into anonymous cohorts of people with similar habits, giving ad buyers the data they need and connecting viewers to ads that should feel relevant to them."", ""UID2 is an open system, available for any marketing project manager or ad buyer, but The Trade Desk invented it and remains the driving force behind it. By making UID2 accessible to all, it's not just leading by example; it's inviting the entire industry to elevate its game. This approach not only cements The Trade Desk's position as a pioneer, but also challenges the market to adopt higher standards of privacy and personalization."", ""It's a bold move, indicative of a leader that's confident not just in its innovation but in the positive ripple effects it can create across the digital landscape. Against that audacious backdrop, it's not surprising to see The Trade Desk coming back from the inflation-based digital ad market downturn stronger than before. The company is outpacing the revenue growth of every digital advertising player worth mentioning while generating $543 million of free cash flows in the last four quarters."", ""Remember, the ad market's downturn is still going on, albeit with brighter days ahead. The Trade Desk has already started its return to business as usual while most of its rivals are lagging behind. I can't wait to see how this innovative marketing expert will perform when the digital cookie jar goes away. The stock is richly valued at 230 times trailing earnings and 21 times sales, but for all the right reasons. You should consider picking up a few shares before the stock runs any higher."", ""Nicholas Rossolillo (Netflix): For years, I've been content to sit on the sidelines and watch the Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) party from afar. Part of the reason was discomfort with the company's in-house production strategy. Just over a decade ago, Netflix went down the original content creation rabbit hole, and began making its own TV shows and movies, funded with debt (House of Cards was its first foray in 2013). I was unclear how producing content, much of which has limited shelf life, with long-term debt, would pan out."", 'Also influencing my decision to sit it out with Netflix, Walt Disney\xa0was in my portfolio, and I thought I was already sitting on a long-term winner in the media and entertainment industry. Turns out, not so much. I recently exited my longtime market-losing position in the House of Mouse (and house of Marvel, and Star Wars, making things all that more confounding), and re-allocated much of the proceeds to Netflix.', ""But why buy Netflix now? After all, Netflix now has a market cap of nearly $260 billion (much larger than Disney's), as the TV streaming leader has been on a hot streak in the last year. However, it looks like the hot streak could keep going."", 'You see, after funding years worth of content using debt and steadily picking up millions of sticky subscribers along the way, Netflix turned an important corner in the last couple of years. The company is now profitable by all metrics -- both on a GAAP net income and free-cash-flow basis. In the past, I was skeptical of the negative free cash flow in particular, as it was reflective of the current outflow of money to fund productions. GAAP net income was positive, though, because video content expenses are amortized over time in this profit metric.', ""Granted, the recent big jump in free cash flow will moderate in 2024 as Netflix will ramp up productions in the U.S. once again after writer and actor strikes in 2023 hampered its efforts. Nevertheless, the trend is quite clear. Netflix has grown up, and it's looking like a highly profitable media business with a long runway ahead. Building a digital ads business, expanding to more places around the globe, and gradually increasing its reach with more content (self-funded with profit now) are all levers Netflix can pull to keep things moving higher."", ""None of this is groundbreaking insight. Many investors have known this for years, and it shows in the premium valuation (nearly 50 times trailing-12-month earnings per share, and 35 based on earnings estimates for 2024). But with Netflix now a highly profitable enterprise, I'm finally ready to hop aboard the bandwagon and hold for the long term, as the good times for shareholders could just be getting started."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Sphere Entertainment right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Sphere Entertainment, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sphere Entertainment wasn’t one of them.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$5.89b', 'US$5.62b', 'US$5.51b', 'US$5.36b', 'US$5.62b', 'US$5.65b', 'US$5.71b', 'US$5.79b', 'US$5.89b', 'US$6.00b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x6', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ 0.49%', 'Est @ 1.03%', 'Est @ 1.41%', 'Est @ 1.67%', 'Est @ 1.86%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% ', 'US$5.4k', 'US$4.8k', 'US$4.4k', 'US$3.9k', 'US$3.8k', 'US$3.5k', 'US$3.3k', 'US$3.1k', 'US$2.9k', 'US$2.7k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$38b', ""We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period.

Wait, I thought electric vehicles were the future? Well, it turns out that this narrative may be getting a reality check.', 'Earlier this year, mainstream headlines noted that EV sales have been dropping. As well, momentum has been slipping, with consumers souring on the technology. To be sure, insiders are putting on a brave face, stating that now is the time to get into electric-powered transportation. Unfortunately, the directive might not be that simple.', 'For one thing, EVs remain more expensive than their combustion-powered counterparts. Consumers who have weathered the storm of high inflation and high borrowing costs are in no shape to pay up. Indeed, delinquency rates on consumer loans soaring since the fourth quarter of 2021 demonstrate that those who did make the transition are finding it difficult to keep pace.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Further, the extreme winter weather that left many EV drivers stranded has many folks questioning the proposition. On the flipside, the infrastructure already exists for the traditional combustion route. And that bodes very well for these oil stocks to buy.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'Frankly, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) doesn’t seem to be getting a whole lot of respect. Per Bloomberg, the integrated oil and gas giant beat earnings estimates and raised dividends after posting record hydrocarbon production.

On the other end, it’s down almost 14% from its 52-week high. Adding to the perplexing narrative, Chevron now pays a forward dividend yield of just over 4%. Also, the company posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 28.6%. So, what gives?', 'Analysts on average believe that the oil giant will post sales of $185.03 billion. That’s slightly less than 2023 results, explaining the lackluster performance of CVX stock.

If so, it’s one of the top oil stocks to buy.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com', 'As a midstream energy operator, Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) is primarily involved in the “intermediary” service of storage and transportation. Per its public profile, the company’s crude oil system consists of 28,661 kilometers (about 17,809 miles) of pipelines. With EV demand slowing and possibly some customers returning to their electric cars, Enbridge should be one of the viable oil stocks to buy.', 'Unfortunately, that hasn’t exactly panned out. Since the start of the year, ENB lost more than 4% of equity value. In the trailing year, it’s down almost 11%. After Monday’s close, Enbridge shares finished the day at $34.72, 12% higher than its 52-week low but almost 14% lower than its 52-week high. Still, this underperformance might not last indefinitely.', 'First, ENB stock is looking more attractive. Trading at 16.63X trailing-year earnings, it’s not undervalued relative to other oil stocks to buy. However, this multiple has significantly dropped since the second quarter of 2023.

Sure enough, PSX has been one of the stronger candidates for oil stocks to buy. Since the start of the year, shares gained more than 7% of market value.

When this happens, investors sometimes push stock prices to levels that, in hindsight, appear unrealistic.', 'TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX) is currently trading near all-time highs after posting strong fiscal 2024 results. Are investors too optimistic here about the future performance of this discount retailer?', ""In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, TJX managed to grow same-store sales by 5%. That was above even the company's own internal expectations. It was, without question, a strong showing. Notably, the majority of the increase was driven by an increase in store traffic. In other words, more people were looking for the bargains that TJX offers its customers in its multiple brands of off-price stores, including T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, HomeSense, Winners, and Sierra."", ""Clearly, the company's business model is resonating with people right now. Now add in the company's plans for new store openings, and the future does, indeed, look pretty bright. Wall Street has gotten behind the story, pushing the shares of this retailer up toward all-time highs."", ""There's a potential problem here, however, when you start to look at valuation. For example, the price-to-sales ratio is near the highest level in the company's history. The only time it was higher was during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic when stores were shut down, sales fell dramatically, and valuations got materially distorted. Basically, Wall Street is placing an increasingly higher valuation on TJX shares when you examine this metric. Elevated price-to-earnings, price-to-book-value, and price-to-free cash flow ratios also suggest that the stock is fully valued, if not expensive, today."", ""If Wall Street is overly optimistic about TJX's prospects, then everything has to go right for the shares to simply maintain the current elevation. To go higher might actually require outright improvements in the retailer's already strong performance."", 'That could be a problem. For starters, TJX is itself telling investors to temper expectations as fiscal 2025 gets underway. Specifically, management is looking for same-store sales to moderate from 5% growth to something between 2% and 3%. Taking the midpoint of that guidance, same-store sales growth could fall as much as 50% during the current fiscal year. That might be enough to make investors question the valuation they have afforded this retailer, even as it works to aggressively open new locations.', ""There's another subtle issue here, as well. As noted above, most of the same-store sales growth was driven by new customers. Why? The answer is most likely that people are trying to stretch their buying power and, thus, shopping at off-price stores more than they have in the past. That's great for now, but if consumers begin to feel more confident again, they are likely to revert to their normal spending habits. That would mean returning to full-price stores, a change that could put downward pressure on TJX's same-store sales."", ""The bigger problem for investors is that a little negativity can go a long way on Wall Street once a stock's valuation gets stretched. TJX's business is doing well, and the company has proven that it knows how to execute. There's nothing inherently wrong with the business at all. But that doesn't mean that the stock can't fall, since even good companies can go through hard times at some point in their lives. Add in a lofty valuation, and you have a recipe for a material stock market decline. To that end, it is worth pointing out that the stock has seen multiple 25% or larger price pullbacks in its history."", ""Given the valuation of TJX's stock right now, it is hard to suggest that investors should run out and buy it. High valuations can linger for long periods of time, but it is probably best to be patient and quell the feeling that you have somehow missed out."", 'You would be better off waiting until the current run of strong business performance runs its course (which is highly likely at some point) and investors move on to more exciting stories. That will probably lead to a material stock pullback and an opportunity to buy a growing retailer with a solid business at an attractive price point.

Thanks for joining us for an update on CytomX, its continued progress, the promise of masking and conditional activation strategies to improve the therapeutic window for potent biologics like ADC. T cell engagers and Cytokinetics continues to be an important and exciting frontier in cancer R&D and our leadership in this field as Cytomedix derives from more than a decade of innovation with the Probody therapeutic platform. Our foundational clinical work with the Probody platform has achieved many firsts in demonstrating how marketing strategies can be effective in cancer patients. So we have opened a broad field in which progress continues to accelerate. The cytokines team is highly focused on delivering on the promise of conditional activation for the benefit of patients. We're currently advancing a generation of product candidates that span multiple modalities, leveraging validated oncology targets, potent effector mechanisms and tailored marketing strategies. Each of our candidates is designed to address large commercial markets and major unmet medical need in cancer, we've had a highly productive start to 2024. We remain on track for initial CX nine oh four Phase Ia dose escalation data in the second half of this year. And we're busy launching Phase one clinical trials for our newest therapeutic candidates, CX 2051 and CX. 81, with initial Phase Ia data anticipated in 2025. Let me now provide additional context and detail for our lead programs. I'll start with our with CX nine oh four, our Probody T-cell engager targeting EGFR and CD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies have enormous potential for the treatment of cancer and first demonstrated meaningful clinical benefit in hematologic malignancies. Looking across the T cell engager landscape for solid tumors has taken time to see meaningful clinical results, but we're now starting to see important breakthroughs generating great excitement for whom successes include immune, of course, debenture first in uveal melanoma, the first approved T cell engager for solid tumors and more recently Amgen style at I-Mab targeting DLL3, which has demonstrated impressive results in small cell lung cancer. The development of these and other programs has not only provided long awaited proof of concept, but this important work has also helped to increasingly define a road map and key considerations for how to optimally develop this emerging class of potent therapies, including optimization of dosing paradigms. However, for this modality to fully breakthrough in solid tumors, there are still significant challenges to overcome T-cell engagers, bring very high potency and this potency can lead to toxicities in normal tissues where the tumor antigen of interest may also be present. In fact, this is very often the case on normal tissue target expression is widely acknowledged to be a limitation on the development of T cell engagers with solid tumors. Furthermore, another well acknowledged limitation for T cell engagers cytokine release syndrome, resulting from systemic binding to CD3 on T-cells. At CytomX, we have a broad based program focused on masking T cell engagers to decrease tumor antigen binding in normal tissues and CD3 binding in the periphery, thereby improving therapeutic index. We're working with partners, Amgen, Astellas, Regeneron and Bristol-Myers Squibb in this exciting space. Our lead program is CX nine oh four. The targets that you've ratcheted EGFR and CD3 on T-cells. It's nine oh four is designed to address the principal challenges of developing an EGFRCD. three T cell engager with the goal of delivering antitumor activity at tolerable systemic doses. This program is partnered with Amgen on a global co-development collaboration. The market opportunity for CX nine oh four is broad. There are hundreds of thousands of EGFR positive patients with metastatic tumors across a wide range of cancer types that could potentially be addressed by this therapy. Cytomx is currently conducting an ongoing Phase 1a study in late-stage unselected patients with advanced solid tumors generally known to have EGFR expression. Our principal goal for this Phase Ia study is to evaluate safety and to identify doses and schedules for detailed evaluation in specific EGFR positive cancer types in Phase Ib. More specifically on safety, we're looking to keep CRS and the typical EGFR mediated toxicities at manageable levels in order to achieve doses in the predicted therapeutically active range. The selection of Phase Ib tumor types will be driven by a combination of factors, including observations from Phase 1A, unmet medical need and commercial potential, including fit with our partners' strategic interests. We're making steady progress in the clinic, having now advanced through multiple dose cohorts and above those levels that would be expected to be tolerated with an unmasked EGFR T-cell engager in late 2023. We also began to backfill certain dose levels to more fully explore the profile of this drug candidate. We expect to share initial Phase 1a dose escalation data in the second half of 2024 with our partner, Amgen and also to present these data in an appropriate setting externally, these data will inform a potential decision to initiate Phase Ib in 2025. Moving now to our continued work in the antibody drug conjugate space. There's a tremendous progress in ADCs in the past few years, and the impact for patients has driven significant strategic interest in this field. Cx 2051 is our first-in-class EpCAM directed Probody ADC our IND application for CX 2051 was cleared by the FDA in January clinical study. Start-up activities are in progress, and we expect to initiate Phase one dose escalation in solid tumors generally known to have EpCAM expression, including colorectal cancer in the near term outcome as a high-potential oncology target due to its high cell surface expression in many cancer types indeed at Cabela's, what are the first tumor antigens to be characterized more than three decades ago. And it has has been implicated in many roles in cancer progression and the EpCAM therapeutic strategies have shown potent anticancer activity in preclinical models, and this has been translated into clinical activity. But to date, clinical success has been limited to local administration because EpCAM is present in so many normal epithelial tissues. It was to generate a systemically administered. Anticancer therapeutics have not been successful to date due to toxicities at epithelial tissues, including the GI tract our innovative drug candidate, CX. two zero five one is tailored to optimize the therapeutic index for Abcam expressing epithelial cancers by masking the antibody to reduce binding in normal tissues but to allow activation in tumor tissue, we have on the antibody with a cytotoxic payload based on capital season. So if I summarize one inhibitor, a class of drug that has shown potent clinical anticancer activity in the ADC context, but multiple targets leading to dramatic advances for patients. Cs 2051 has demonstrated a wide predicted therapeutic index and strong preclinical activity and tolerability in multiple preclinical models, including colorectal cancer like EGFR discussed previously, CS 2051 could also potentially address a large patient population that TAM is highly expressed across many indications, including colorectal, gastric, endometrial and ovarian cancers. Our Phase one trial will follow an adaptive design and is intended to demonstrate rapid clinical proof-of-concept to inform a potential decision to move into dose expansion studies in 2025. We're really excited to see what this unique and first-in-class ADC can do for patients. Turning now to CH. eight oh one, our Julie masked conditionally activated interferon alpha 2B, which we believe has the potential become a cornerstone of combination immunotherapy for a wide range of tumor types. The INDEPCFH. one was cleared by the FDA in January, and we expect to initiate Phase one dose escalation in solid tumors, including melanoma, renal cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in the first half of 2024. Interferon Alpha is a powerful cytokine with the ability to potently drive tumor antigen presentation and activate antitumor immunity. He's demonstrated clinical activity and gained regulatory approval many years ago in multiple cancer types, including melanoma, renal cancer and bladder cancer. However, interferon therapy is well known to be associated with significant systemic side effects and its use has been superseded by checkpoint inhibitors and other therapeutic approaches. It's also been shown that interferon can potentiate the clinical effects of PD-1 in metastatic melanoma, but again, this approach has been limited. Why systemic toxicities, interferon therapy has recently returned to focus with Ferring Pharmaceuticals approval in 2022 of us delivering an interferon alpha 2b and coding gene therapy indicated for the treatment of localized BCG nonresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, reaffirming that this potent cytokine could indeed achieve robust antitumor responses in patients based on the preclinical profile of Series eight oh one as well as prior clinical experience with interferon therapies. We see eight oh one as a potential new centerpiece of combination cancer immunotherapy. Our preclinical data and most recently presented at 60 2023 demonstrates synergy for our mass interferon alpha with PD-1 inhibition, both in terms of antitumor activity and in activation of the tumor inflammatory microenvironment. Moreover, we've also shown the systemic activity of our mass and Spirit is significantly reduced and overall tolerability is markedly improved compared to the unmatched cytokine in animal models. We anticipate the opportunity. The opportunity for CX data one will be in combination with checkpoint inhibition where it could serve as a potent immune modulator to both increase the frequency and durability of responses in IO sensitive tumors, but potentially to establish or restore efficacy in IO resistant for cold tumors. Our Phase one dose escalation trial being initiated in the first half of 2024 will utilize an adaptive design to evaluate safety and signs of clinical activity for eight of our monotherapy and advanced rapidly combination with checkpoint inhibition. Before moving to financials, I'd like to provide updates on our partnerships and starting with an update on our long-standing collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. We were informed on March sixth of BMS intention to discontinue BM S nine eight six two eight, the CTLA-4 program. This unexpected decision followed a broad internal portfolio review at BMS. We continue to work with BMS to gain more visibility on the data from this program and the factors that led to this decision moving forward. The BMS collaboration continues to be very active and will now focus primarily in the field of T-cell engagers where together we have initiated several new programs over the last two years. Notably, this shift in focus within the BMS alliance now means that the majority of our partner programs are now focused on T cell engagers, reflecting strong strategic interest in this area and showing that this modality modality is emerging as a key application of masking and conditional activation continuing the T-cell engager theme. Given our ongoing progress with enrollment to the CX nine oh four Phase 1a study, I'd like to outline some of the key terms of our strategic alliance with Amgen. Under the terms of our agreement, Cytokinetics and Amgen are co-developing CX nine oh four. Cytomx is responsible for early-stage development, and Amgen will be responsible for late-stage development with the transition occurring after completion of Phase Ib by Cytomedix within the CX nine oh four agreement, Cytokinetics has an option to participate financially in the global co-development of CX nine oh four with Amgen. If we exercise our co-development option, we opt into a significant US profit share and we are eligible for up to $460 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and ex U.S. royalties in the low double digit to mid teen percentage. We see this collaboration as having substantial potential to build long-term value for Cytokinetics and we look forward to making additional progress with our partner on this program. Moving now to our other drug discovery stage partnerships. We continue to make progress in our alliances, including with our newest partners, Regeneron and Moderna across our alliances. We have more than a dozen active discovery programs. Cytomedix holds significant commercial rights on a number of these assets, and we have multiple near and long-term milestones that we're working towards. Chris will review in a few moments the financial benefits that continue to accrue to us from our partnerships as we run the Company in a very capital efficient way. With that, I'll hand over to Chris to provide a financial update."", 'Chris Ogden', ""Thank you, Sean. I'm pleased to be able to share an update on our 2023 financial results with everyone today, electronics entered 2024 with a strong balance sheet with $175 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2023, compared to $194 million at the end of 2022. We expect our cash balance will fund the operations of the company well into the second half of 2025. This cash guidance does not assume any additional milestones from existing collaborations or any new business development, both of which like Tomax has a strong track record of attaining our cash position reflects our focus on controlling costs and efficient capital allocation as well as our consistent track record of funding the Company through a mix of both strategic business development and equity financing. Over time, our partnerships have consistently been a strategic pathway for value creation and financing opportunities that allow us to generate non-dilutive capital while increasing the reach of our platform. Our partnerships continue to advance and have generated more than $500 million of incoming cash to date, and we see near term opportunities for additional milestone payments in 2024 and 2025. Despite a challenging macro environment in 2023, we maintained a strong balance sheet position and executed executed efficiently to position the Company to create potentially significant value inflections that will be realized over the next 12 to 18 months. Now moving to revenue and operating expenses for the year. Total revenue was $101.2 million for 2023 compared to $53.2 million for the corresponding period in 2022. We saw an increase in revenue due to a higher percentage of completion for research programs in the Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration and the recent collaborations with Regeneron and Moderna operating expense for Q4 2023 was $27.2 million compared to $29.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. R&D expenses decreased by $34.3 million from last year to $77.3 million compared to $111.6 million in 2022. General and administrative expenses decreased by $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, to $29.8 million compared to $42.8 million ffor the corresponding period in 2022. Overall, our prudent financial management company and focused capital allocation priorities has resulted in continued balance sheet strength as we progressed our pipeline. Now I'll hand the call back to Sean for closing remarks."", 'Sean McCarthy', ""Thank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for your time this afternoon. And for your interest in Cytokinetics 2024 promises to be an exciting year for us. And the longer-term outlook for 2025 and beyond is also very compelling as we make progress across our multimodality pipeline, the field of antibody masking and conditional activation is continuing to accelerate, and we remain very well positioned to build on the depth of our experience as a leading innovator in this area, we are leveraging our multimodality Probody therapeutic platform to discover and develop new cancer therapies based on T cell engagers, ADCs and cytokines, each of which represents a highly relevant and timely area of strategic interest across the industry. The Cytomedix team is intensely focused on delivering an innovative pipeline for the benefit of people living with cancer.

One moment."", 'Chris Ogden', 'Operator, maybe we can we can put Peter back in the queue and go to the next question.', 'Operator', 'Yes, thank you. Our next question will be coming from Joe Cotara of Piper salmon. Your line is open.', 'Joe Catanzaro', ""Everybody, and hopefully you can hear me. Okay. Thanks for taking the questions and the update here. So I know we saw recent data from a competitive masking program and they showed looks like near zero detectable unmasked antibody in circulation. Just maybe can you remind us what you've historically seen with Probody programs around this metric, whether you're tracking it for nine oh four and what your expectations would be? And then maybe my follow-up question is on the safety side in preclinical tox work for nine oh four. I know you've reported some data around CRCR., but in GLP work with it was the CD. three mediated talks or EGFR mediated talks that showed up first and which was dose limit?"", 'Sean McCarthy', ""Yes. Yes, Joe, thanks for the questions. And yes, so we're tracking obviously all innovations in the field and all progress and ARM. I think I think we conclude we can conclude from multiple recent datasets from several companies that, first of all, something that I think we've shown quite some time ago, that market works masking antibodies and other modalities is clearly having shown the ability to decrease systemic target engagement and depending upon target and format to also improve tolerability. So we're excited to see this progress across across the field. What we've shown over the years pretty consistently with multiple programs, whether it was our PD-L1 Probody or up 29 to 18 nine, some of our earlier programs, which we've learned. So much. And we've shown that the vast majority of the circulating entity, the Probody therapeutic is is in masked form. And that again, it has translated into what we interpret as the successful decreasing of target engagement. So that builds come a long way, and we're excited to see now in the hands of others, these types of approaches also beginning to gain some traction in terms of our work on on EGFRCD. three and 9.04 a.m. We have presented quite honestly, we haven't presented a lot of data on this program for various competitive reasons, but we did share an early iteration of our EGFRCD. three program with pretty extensive characterization in syngeneic animal models and in Cyno. And we focused in large part on the cytokine induction in those monkey studies showing a dramatic shift with the masking a dramatic shift in terms of the ability to induce cytokine, but we haven't shared a whole lot of data on the actual CX. nine oh four molecule yet that will come in the future."", 'Joe Catanzaro', ""Okay, thanks. That's helpful. Thanks for taking my questions."", 'Sean McCarthy', 'Feel very welcome.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from Japan Rama of JPMorgan. Your line is open.', 'Anupam Rama', 'Thank you so much for taking the questions is actually Malcolm cooler on for auto parts. So what is the size and scope of the Phase one dose escalation data that we should be thinking about in in 2H 24 for CX nine oh four. And on that winter, we get a better sense of more a more granular time. Thank you.', 'Sean McCarthy', ""Yes, thanks, for the question, um, so we remain on track with nine oh four to share data in the second half. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our principal objective at this moment in time is to build the dataset to share with our partner Amgen in the second half of the year. And then that would result in presentation externally in an appropriate setting. We were not so on guiding to any specifics at this point in time.

AVANGRID said in a statement that it has received the proposition but not a formal offer and that its board will review it.This proposal came after AVANGRID abandoned its plan to acquire PNM Resources PNM, another U.S. utility, in December. The all-cash deal of $4.3 billion would have given Iberdrola and AVANGRID access to a state where more solar and wind energy could be produced and exported to bigger markets.The deal was scrapped after years of negotiating with authorities over the acquisition.

Amid the company's dominance in artificial intelligence (AI)-ready chips and the insatiable demand for the technology, its stock has risen by close to 300% over the last 12 months."", ""With the stock approaching $1,000 per share, investors may wonder whether a stock split is imminent. Despite the fact that such a move will not directly influence Nvidia's valuation, investors should expect one soon. Here's why."", 'The history of Nvidia stock is arguably the most compelling reason for expecting a near-term split. The company has split its stock five times since 2000, one of which has occurred since AI and data centers renewed investor interest in GPUs.', ""That previous split occurred on July 19, 2021, when Nvidia carried out a 4-for-1 stock split. Interestingly, it closed at a pre-split price of around $744 per share that day, a level lower than today's current price."", ""Still, investors should remember that these gains came quickly, as Nvidia stock is up about 85% this year and nearly 30% over the last month alone, indicating that a need for a split could have caught the company's board off guard."", ""Moreover, the most significant question surrounding a split is likely where the company will set the split ratio. The most recent 4-for-1 split was the largest ratio in the company's history, with the company having approved three 2-for-1 splits and one 3-for-2 split in the 2000s."", 'However, as mentioned before, the more recent growth has probably exceeded expectations. While future growth may not match the 126% revenue increase in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31), analysts forecast 81% revenue growth in fiscal 2025 and 22% the next fiscal year, indicating the massive profit increases should continue for the foreseeable future.', ""That could possibly mean the stock price is not done rising. Conversely, slowing growth could soon dampen enthusiasm for the stock, and the company's board will have to consider the massive drops in the stock price in past years. Hence, the company has to be ready for any potential price movement when it decides the split ratio."", 'Investors may want also to consider another possible factor -- inclusion as one of the 30 stocks making up the Dow Jones Industrial Average.', 'The S&P Dow Jones Indices, operated by S&P Global, has not telegraphed any intention to add Nvidia to the Dow 30. Also, the index already includes two semiconductor stocks, Apple and Intel.', ""However, Intel has struggled in recent years, increasing the chances of its removal. Also, AI's influence over the economy could lead to more tech stocks in the index, and Nvidia's $2.2 trillion market cap makes it a likely choice."", ""Furthermore, the Dow 30 is a price-weighted index. Since the nominal share price determines a stock's weighting on the Dow, companies have often initiated stock splits to reduce their influence over the index. Should Nvidia seek a place on the Dow 30, it may alter the split ratio to increase its chances of inclusion."", ""Given the company's history of stock splits, investors should expect such a move sooner rather than later. Also, since the previous split occurred less than three years ago at a lower price, the split ratio is likely the most significant question surrounding such a move."", ""Indeed, Nvidia's board will need to consider the stock's price history in deciding the ratio, both in a positive and negative sense. Also, assuming Nvidia seeks to become a Dow 30 stock, it will have to become more sensitive to its nominal share price."", ""Ultimately, the stock split changes nothing for Nvidia on the surface. However, given the company's history, shareholders should anticipate a split and, possibly, increased interest in the stock from some unexpected parties."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Instead, it designs integrated systems for IT architecture, including storage clusters and server racks.

After trading hours on Friday, news broke that Supermicro will be joining the S&P 500. Shares surged 12% post-market and are now nearing all-time highs."", 'While this is quite an impressive achievement, does this make Supermicro stock a buy?', ""While estimates vary, some Wall Street research suggests that Nvidia in 2023 held 98% of the data center GPU market. Demand for its A100 and H100 GPUs is extraordinarily high. Given Supermicro's close ties to Nvidia, it's not surprising to see that it, too, experienced steep sales growth in recent quarters."", 'Indeed, in light of its critical role in integrated data center services, George Tsilis of TD Ameritrade has labeled Supermicro a ""stealth Nvidia."" However, there is much more to the investment case than just its top-line growth.', ""For its fiscal 2024 second quarter, which ended Dec. 31, Supermicro reported a gross margin of 15.4%. That was a decline from both the prior quarter and the same period in the prior year. Moreover, the company's current margin profile is in line with its 10-year average -- not growing in tandem with revenue."", 'Management attributed margin deterioration to more aggressive investments in IT design and market share acquisition. This approach should be OK for now. But in the long run, Supermicro needs to demonstrate that it can expand its margins and cash flows. Otherwise, a liquidity crunch could arise.', ""One threat that could continue putting strain on Supermicro's margin profile is competition in the semiconductor space. Other AI leaders, including Microsoft and Amazon, are entering the AI chip market. Nvidia's near-total dominance in the market could start eroding sooner than later."", ""It would behoove Supermicro to foster relationships with other chip designers, as its growth cannot hinge solely on demand for Nvidia's products in the long run."", ""One of the things I've warned about regarding Supermicro is that the stock often trades in tandem with Nvidia. While this may seem like it makes sense, it could eventually become dangerous. They are entirely different businesses. Moreover, Nvidia's top line is growing at much faster rates than Supermicro's -- and the chipmaker is far more profitable."", 'Supermicro as a business is not really comparable to Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices. Rather, it competes with the likes of Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, and even IBM to some degree.', ""At a price-to-sales ratio of 5.6, Supermicro is trading at a noticeable premium to that of its peers. This is not to say that Supermicro is a poor investment choice, per se. Many investors have made a lot of money from the stock over the last year. But that doesn't mean you should follow the crowd at this point."", ""Given Supermicro's pending addition to the S&P 500 on March 18 (when S&P Global conducts its standard quarterly rebalance), I suspect the company will now get much more attention from institutional investors. This would be a good thing for shareholders in the long run, as a more diverse set of opinions will enter the discussion around Supermicro and its long-term prospects."", ""I think it's going to take years to get a concrete idea of which companies will emerge as long-term winners in artificial intelligence. For this reason, I think a prudent strategy would be to keep an eye on Supermicro's operating performance and see if the company can maintain its momentum.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating retirement living in the US, you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in Hawaii.\xa0', 'Is retirement always about the cheapest possible option? For a large majority of retirees, yes. The average American retiree often sets out in search of the most affordable places to retire in the U.S. In a Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) report, data from the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances states that median retirement savings for Americans aged 65 to 74 are a meager $164,000. While Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) does give tips that senior citizens in their 60s can use to extend their retirement savings - such as working a few extra years or monetizing assets - this is not always an option. For many senior citizens, there are no assets to monetize.\xa0', 'As for working longer, the US economy is not always supportive. NerdWallet reports an excess of 34,000 layoffs within the first two months of 2024, with big names such as Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) among the culprits.', '“It’s just more difficult for media to be profitable, and so you’ve had a pullback and a decline in employment in that sector of the economy” -Nick Bunker, Economic Research Director for North America, Indeed Hiring Lab', 'Adding to this, companies often have a trend of hiring younger employees. For instance, just 10% of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)’s workforce is in the 40 and above range, reports Zippia. The same percentage also holds true for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s employee age demographic.\xa0', 'With numbers like these, it becomes difficult to think about little else but finances during retirement. That being said, there are some retirees who manage to save up for a comfortable - even luxurious - retirement. According to Smart Asset, about 10% of American retirees are millionaires when it comes to their retirement savings.\xa0 With a larger budget in hand, this gives senior citizens a more varied choice when it comes to their retirement location.\xa0', 'Senior citizens often search for warmer weather, peaceful communities, and beachside living when deciding on where to retire. The best place to offer all this, of course, is the Aloha State. You might wonder, ‘Is retiring in Hawaii a good idea?’ After all, Nasdaq states that Hawaii is the most expensive states, with an amount as high as $3.1 million needed to retire. However, for retirees who possess the financial means, Hawaii can prove to be a great choice. There’s nothing quite as relaxing as spending one’s Golden Years in a tropical haven. The state offers a moderate climate with low temperatures and mild humidity, a welcome break from the intense cold found in other states such as Alaska, Minnesota, and Wyoming.\xa0', 'The winning factor, however, remains to be Hawaii’s natural beauty. The state is dotted with stunning beaches, hiking trails, waterfalls, and tropical forests - the perfect escape for nature-loving retirees.\xa0', 'To facilitate retirees who are pondering the move to Hawaii, we have compiled a list of the 15 best places to retire in Hawaii.', 'Sorin Colac/Shutterstock.com', 'To compile this list of the 15 best places to retire in Hawaii, we consulted several sources including Niche, Dewitt Move, New Home Source, Movoto, Royal Hawaiian Movers, Unbiased, Investment U, and Haven Lifestyles.\xa0 Once a list of places was compiled using these sources, we then ranked them across multiple factors, namely, their cost of living, their livability scores, and their median house price. For this article, cost of living indices were taken from Best Places, livability scores were taken from Area Vibes, and median house prices were taken from Redfin Corp (NASDAQ:RDFN). A cumulative score was then assigned to each place, with the 15 highest-scoring places making our list of the 15 best places to retire in Hawaii. For places that gained an equal score, their cost of living index and median house price was used as a tie-breaker. The resulting list is presented in ascending order, with the highest-ranked place being presented last.\xa0', 'It is important to remember that personal preference plays a big part. The best course of action is to visit the place you plan to move to, converse with locals, take advice from a financial consultant, and only then make your final decision.\xa0', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

From its stylish design to its powerful performance and long-lasting battery, it’s hard to top what Apple has to offer. Well, except if you’re looking for a Windows laptop.', 'But if you’re an Apple fan, or are curious about switching to the other side, the MacBook Air is, generally, the way to go. And that’s no different with the company’s newest 15-inch variety. After spending a few days with the 2024 MacBook Air 15-inch, I can say it’s better than ever. But it still has one nagging downside: a lack of connectivity ports on its right side.', 'Available March 8, the latest Air lineup gets a processor bump from Apple’s M2 processor to the newer M3. The smaller 13-inch model starts at $1,099, while the 15-inch starts at $1,299.', 'Both are available in a midnight color that features the same anodized seal that helps cut down on fingerprint smudges, something I wish my 2023 15-inch midnight MacBook Air had. I know it’s not that big of a deal, but when you’re spending north of $1,000 on something you touch every day, you want it to keep looking as clean as the day you bought it.', 'My review unit came equipped with Apple’s 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU M3 chip, 16GB of memory, and 512GB of storage for $1,699. And if you’re in the market for the 15-inch Air, that’s the exact configuration I’d recommend you buy. It’ll get you enough performance to last a long time thanks to its 16GB of memory, and 512GB of storage should be enough for a game here and there, as well as your photos and videos.', 'If you want to go all out, though, you can boost the memory to 24GB and storage to 2TB for $2,499. That said, for the same price, you could get a 16-inch MacBook Pro with a more powerful M3 Pro chip, 18GB of memory, and 512GB of storage.', 'If you want to do some basic photo and video editing and light gaming, stick with the Air. But if you’re interested in heavy-duty photo and video work, gaming, and working on 3D modeling software, the Pro is the way to go.', 'As far as overall performance goes, Apple says the latest Air outpaces last year’s model with 20% faster CPU performance than the M2 Air and 35% better performance than the M1-equipped model. Graphics also get a boost, with the M3 Air beating out the M2 and M1 models with 20% and 65% better performance, respectively.', 'I’m writing this review with the M3-powered Air, and I haven’t seen any slowdown or hiccups. It opens apps quickly, springs to life when I lift the lid, and manages to run the game “Baldur’s Gate 3” relatively well on low to medium graphics settings. It doesn’t look as good as it would on, say, a dedicated gaming desktop or console, but if you’re looking to toss fireballs at goblins on the go, the Air will get the job done.', 'The latest MacBook Airs also now support two external displays when you close their lids. So if you want to just use your Air as more or less a computing box and work off of those separate screens and a bluetooth keyboard and bluetooth mouse, you can do just that. Disconnect your Air from the setup and you can get going with ease.', 'Battery life is as fantastic as you’d expect from an Air running on one of Apple’s chips. The company says it managed to ring out 18 hours of battery life from the Air while playing back 1080p video via iTunes. I’ve used this review unit to write, browse the web, check out some video games, and more, and the battery never touched the red line.', 'Of course, I kept recharging it every time I sat down at my makeshift workstation in my apartment’s kitchen/living room/dining room area, but when I did take it for a spin to another room, I never felt the need to bring a charger with me.', 'One of the things that stands out about the M3-powered MacBook Air is the way Apple is positioning it as an AI machine. The company refers to the Air as the “world’s best consumer laptop for AI,” thanks to the M3’s built-in neural engine. It’s important to note that Apple has included neural engines in its chips for quite some time already, so the neural engine in the M3 isn’t exactly some kind of new development.', 'It’s more that by highlighting it, Apple is telling the world that it’s been building AI-capable laptops, desktops, and smartphones for years, while Windows laptops are only just beginning to embrace AI via Microsoft’s (MSFT) Copilot and AI-enabled chips from Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) on or coming to market this year.', 'My only real critique of the MacBook Air is that it only has two Thunderbolt 4 ports on its left side. It seems like a minor complaint, but having the ports, which are compatible with rounded USB-C connectors, on only one side can make cable management difficult, especially if you’re used to having a connector on your system’s right side. I had to rearrange my home setup to get comfortable with my review unit, for instance.', 'Overall, Apple’s latest MacBook Air builds on the success of its prior offerings and continues to carry the torch as one of the best laptops you can buy. If you’ve already got an M1 or M2-powered Air, you’re fine holding on to your unit for a while longer. If you’re still working with an Intel-based Air, though, it’s time to ditch that dinosaur for an Air with one of Apple’s chips.', 'It’s worth keeping in mind that Apple is continuing to offer last year’s 13-inch MacBook Air with an M2 chip at a starting price of $999. You don’t get the slick fingerprint-reducing paint job or the ability to use two external monitors, but it’s still a fantastic laptop.', 'If you’d rather grab an M3-powered MacBook Air, though, you won’t be disappointed.', ""Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

That's because tech companies tend to introduce the world's most revolutionary products and services. Think mobile phones, or high-speed internet, or augmented reality."", ""With that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three fantastic technology stocks with lots of upside ahead. Each one of these names is not only a leader in its respective arena, but also offers products or services everyone is going to need."", ""When most investors think of chip companies, Nvidia and Intel likely are the first ones to come to mind. And understandably so. Nvidia's tech is at the heart of most chip-related products and services. Meanwhile, Intel's processors are still found in most of the world's conventional computers."", ""These aren't the only chipmakers we would struggle to suddenly live without, however. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) is in the mix, too, and perhaps even more important to you than Intel or Nvidia."", 'See, Qualcomm makes or owns the rights to a technology that powers just about every mobile phone on the market. One of its core products is its powerful Snapdragon processor, giving your handheld device computing power that nearly rivals that of your laptop or desktop, but at a fraction of the size. It\'s not just your smartphone\'s CPU (central processing unit), though. Qualcomm\'s wares are found inside 5G and Wi-Fi antennas, within audio equipment, onboard smart cars, and even within security cameras, just to name a few. None of it is super-high-profile stuff. What Qualcomm lacks in ""wow"" factor, however, it more than makes up for in the breadth and depth of its product portfolio. The world\'s not simply going to stop using its technologies now. It can\'t.', ""The company is also positioning itself for what could be a massive opportunity. That's the next chapter of the ongoing advent of artificial intelligence (AI)."", 'To date, most AI work has been handled by data centers far away from your computer, phone, or even an enterprise-level customer\'s premises. That\'s changing, though. This heavy-duty data management effort is increasingly able to be done by the devices at users\' fingertips. Qualcomm is leading that charge. As CEO Cristiano Amon explained at the recent annual shareholders\' meeting, ""We are bringing Gen [generative] AI capabilities to smartphone users worldwide. Our leadership in premium and high-tier Android devices continues with our latest Snapdragon mobile platforms, which now feature significantly enhanced AI processing performance.""', 'It remains to be seen exactly what this will mean; plenty of people are still searching for practical uses of this tech. Qualcomm is prepared for whatever future may be in store, however.', ""While some companies -- and many people -- may still not see much need for AI solutions, don't be too quick to jump to this same conclusion. In many cases, enterprises simply need to be shown how AI can make a positive impact on their business's bottom line."", 'Enter Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR).', ""In simplest terms, Palantir turns artificial intelligence into a valuable, practical tool. For instance, the company's platform helps biopharma companies design and better manage clinical drug trials, allows energy companies to optimize their operational assets, and even helps retailers forecast specific inventory needs."", ""Perhaps Palantir Technologies' bread and butter, however, is its ability to serve government agencies, and the military in particular. Its Gotham software enables front-line soldiers to be more effective by giving them better information about their opponents, for example. Just this week the company announced it's been awarded a $178 million contract by the U.S. Army's Contracting Command to provide a total of 10 TITAN (Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node) ground station systems. TITAN systems provide actionable targeting information for long-range precision fires."", ""This is just a taste of what's in the cards. The analyst community is calling for top-line growth of nearly 22% this year as more prospects better understand what Palantir can do, and become paying customers as a result. Next year's revenue is projected to grow another 19%. And even beyond that point, there's reason to remain optimistic. Precedence Research suggests the AI software market alone is on pace to grow at an average annualized pace of 23% through 2032."", 'Finally, add software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to your list of potential millionaire-maker stocks.', ""OK, there's no denying Microsoft's massive size makes it difficult for the company to log massive growth rates now. Much of next year's projected revenue growth of 14% reflects a reacceleration from this year's expected relatively slow sales growth of only 6%. Anything above 10% is actually pretty good here."", 'Where Microsoft really shines is with its bottom line. This business scales up very nicely -- even if a bit inconsistently -- widening profit margin rates as it does.', ""Credit the nature of its business. Once the code for software is written, its core cost is incurred. Sales of that software then end up mostly being turned into gross profit. The business model itself works to its advantage as well. Much of Microsoft's software is now rented rather than outright purchased, generating reliable recurring revenue."", ""More than anything, though, Microsoft is just good at doing several things, each of which makes its digital ecosystem easier to wade into. GlobalStats says its Windows operating system is installed on more than two-thirds of the world's computers, for example, while its Office productivity apps work seamlessly with Windows. Its Bing search engine is now more than a mere search engine, too. It's become a full-blown AI assistant, incorporating tech from ChatGPT into a platform called Copilot, bringing revenue-bearing traffic to the site. Its cloud computing arm is now growing faster than Amazon Web Services largely because its interface offers all the tools a corporate customer might want, yet it's also simple to use."", ""Is it the fastest-growing tech stock you can buy? No. But it's one of the most consistent technology companies, and there's never going to be a time when the world won't need what Microsoft brings to the table."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has\xa0more than tripled\xa0the market.*', 'They just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Microsoft made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.', 'See the 10 stocks', '*Stock Advisor returns as of March 8, 2024', ""John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

All sorts of brand new space stocks followed the trail first blazed by Virgin Galactic -- conducting special purpose acquisition company (SPAC)-sponsored IPOs, giving investors their proverbial chance to ""dabble a little bit in a spaceship company, own a little bit of a spaceship company.""', 'Many investors took that chance -- and paid the price in 2022 and 2023, as the stock market taught the dangers of investing in SPACs. Stocks that had come public at $10 a share, rocketing many times in value in the days after their IPOs, plummeted to mere fractions of their IPO prices.', ""Here's the thing: As recently as last year, a lot of these space stocks were still too expensive.\xa0But what about now?"", 'Now that irrational exuberance has given way to investor regret and prices have finally returned to Earth, are there any values to be found in the space sector?', 'As space stock prices began to rightsize last year, I asked myself this very question. I ultimately concluded that, after surveying the prices that established space companies were paying to acquire upstarts over the past few years, it seemed the ""right"" price to acquire an unprofitable space start-up should be no more than 4x annual sales.', ""Granted, the cheaper a space stock gets below 4x sales, the more likely I'd be willing to buy it. But the most I'd pay is 4x sales -- tops. And it turns out Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) agrees with me."", ""On Friday last week in a Scheduled 13G filing with the SEC, Lockheed Martin revealed that it has offered to acquire all outstanding shares of satellite manufacturer Terran Orbital (NYSE: LLAP). If you recall, Terran Orbital already has a significant relationship with the aerospace and defense giant -- it's Terran Orbital's biggest customer. What's more, in 2022, Lockheed arguably saved Terran from going bankrupt, investing $100 million to bring the satellite company into its own orbit."", ""Now, Lockheed is ready to take the next logical step -- and swallow Terran Orbital whole. To accomplish this, Lockheed is offering to pay $1 per share for each of the 181 million shares of Terran Orbital stock that it doesn't already own. (Between participating in Terran's SPAC IPO and making its additional investment in 2022, Lockheed Martin already owns 13.5 million of Terran Orbital's 194.5 million shares outstanding, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.)"", 'Additionally, Lockheed will spend ""over $70 million"" to acquire all of Terran Orbital\'s outstanding warrants. And Lockheed will take on Terran Orbital\'s outstanding debt of $313 million.', ""Add up those three amounts -- $181 million plus $70 million plus $313 million -- and then subtract Terran Orbital's current cash reserves of $39 million, and you wind up with a total deal value of $525 million. Divide that sum by the $134.2 million in sales that Terran Orbital did over the past year, and Lockheed will be paying almost exactly 4x the final enterprise valuation of Terran Orbital -- or 3.9x sales to be precise."", ""Notably, Terran Orbital doesn't appear 100% convinced that it wants to sell out to Lockheed Martin -- but it may not have much choice."", 'On Monday, Terran quickly swallowed a poison pill to give it some time to consider the offer. But Terran carries significant debt, has little cash with which to pay that debt down, and is burning cash at the rate of $150 million a year -- so the company could be out of cash as soon as one quarter from now. It also has a weak stock price that would make raising new cash from a stock offering unattractive.', 'On top of all this, Terran\'s biggest claim to financial independence from Lockheed Martin -- last year\'s $2.4 billion contract to build 300 satellites for ""Rivada Space Networks"" -- looks a whole lot like vaporware to me. I\'m not at all convinced that anything\'s ever going to come of it.', ""For Lockheed, meanwhile, this deal looks like a no-brainer. For one thing, it needs Terran Orbital alive and financially healthy to build the satellites that Lockheed has ordered from it. For another, with $6.9 billion in annual profits and $1.4 billion in cash already, Lockheed can fund this acquisition with the loose change found between its couch cushions. It's offering Terran Orbital a fair price and a way to put questions about its financial solvency to bed once and for all."", 'This is a good deal for both parties.

Investors have been given confidence as prospects of lowered rates serve to boost the major indexes to swing upwards. For example, the S&P 500 is up more than 8% in the past two months, the NASDAQ Composite is up close to 9%, and the Dow Jones has registered gains of around 3%. This is quite extraordinary given the contraction of the indexes in the past few months as rates went up.\xa0', 'There are several other reasons for investors to be optimistic about the health of the US stock market. Inflation figures have started showing signs of slowing down, consumer spending is holding steady, the labor market remains resilient as ever, and financial experts have come together to predict that the US will be able to avoid a major recession.

We also expect a further 15 assets to have the potential for $1 billion to $5 billion in peak year sales. In 2024, we expect data readouts for many of these assets, including Phase 3 trials for Tremfya in IBD; Erleada in early stage prostate cancer; our targeted oral peptide, JNJ-2113 in psoriasis; nipocalimab in myasthenia gravis; as well as aticaprant and seltorexant in major depressive disorder.', ""We also expect Phase 2 readouts for our combination therapy guselkumab and golimumab, JNJ-4804, in psoriatic arthritis; nipocalimab in Sjogren's disease; and TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. In medtech, we shared that we expect to grow at the upper range of our markets, which are anticipated to grow by 5% to 7% between 2022 and 2027.

First, we're excited at the prospect of bringing our lead therapy CARVYKTI to more multiple myeloma patients in Europe. As many of you have heard, CARVYKTI received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use to expand into earlier lines of treatment. CARVYKTI is the first CAR-T therapy to receive a positive CHMP opinion in the second-line setting for patients with relapsed and lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma. The formal European Commission decision is expected in April. As for the approval of CARVYKTI in the United States in the second-line, we are scheduled to meet with the FDA's oncologic drugs advisory committee this Friday, the 15th, to answer any outstanding questions they have."", ""We are preparing for a potential launch in this expanded indication on the PDUFA date of April 5th, and we will, of course, keep you posted. Now I'd like to turn to other achievements and activity since our last earnings call. Our work to bring CARVYKTI to more patients globally resulted in total net sales for the fourth quarter of 2023 of $159 million. For the full year, total sales for CARVYKTI were $0.5 billion. The increase in our fourth quarter performance versus the third quarter was a result of the ongoing launch of CARVYKTI and share gain from capacity expansion and manufacturing efficiencies. We've now been market in for seven full quarters, and we are the fastest launched CAR-T therapy. We anticipate continued quarter-over-quarter growth throughout 2024 as well."", ""We believe our cash balance of $1.3 billion provides us with financial runway through the end of 2025. In order to serve more patients and meet our revenue targets, we've expanded our supply of lentiviral vectors significantly through a large reactor in Switzerland, operated by our partner Johnson & Johnson. In addition, Johnson & Johnson has another factory under construction in the Netherlands. We also continued to expand our internal manufacturing capacity in partnership with Janssen. Our cell processing side in Ghent, Belgium called Obelisc, produced the first batches of CARVYKTI for clinical use in January 2024. We hope to start commercial production in the second half of the year. Construction progressed on our second manufacturing site [Tech Lane] (ph) in Belgium."", 'And it is expected to be complete at the end of the year. We have increased capacity at our Raritan, New Jersey facility, doubling cell processing capacity since the beginning of 2023. The increases to our production capacity will help ensure we meet our target of supply in CARVYKTI to 10,000 patients by the end of 2025. I am excited to announce we have the new veteran leader with more than 25 years of experience now overseeing our manufacturing sites. Our own Birk Vanderweeen has been promoted to Senior Vice President, Global Manufacturing and Technical Operations. Our previous Head of Global Tech Op, Liz Gosen, has stepped aside from full-time work for personal reasons and is now serving as a Senior Advisor for us. Birk joined us in 2021 to start our European organization and the manufacturing facilities I just mentioned.', ""The site in Ghent that has just came online and second one under construction. Before joining Legend, he served that Janssen, Teva and AstraZeneca. Birk has earned the trust and respect of our global manufacturing teams and he's already made a big impact. The increase in production capacity, enabling us to meet growing patient demand comes in parallel with new data we presented at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December. In an oral presentation, we unveiled the data is showing improvements in patient outcomes as early as second-line treatment in our pivotal Phase 3 CARTITUDE-4 study. The results demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in health-related quality-of-life measures and reductions in symptoms following treatment with CARVYKTI compared to standard-of-care."", ""In other news from the fourth quarter, we continue to bring more hospitals online and we now have a total of 65 US hospitals certified to treat with CARVYKTI patients. Additionally, about 30% of patients are not administered in an outpatient setting. Turning to the pipeline. We're investigating the potential of our cell therapies in blood cancers beyond multiple myeloma and also in solid tumors. We've started dosing patients in our DLL3-targeted program, the Phase 1 clinical trial LB2102 in lung cancer. The armoring using LB2102 can also be deployed in other pipeline programs if validated in the clinic. After Phase 1, Novartis will takeover and conduct any further development, including manufacturing and commercial activities. To sum up 2023, we closed the year with accomplishments on several fronts."", 'Now I would like to turn the call over to Lori to walk you through the financials for 2023, Lori?', 'Lori Macomber: Thank you, Ying, and good morning, everyone. As Ying mentioned, we generated approximately $159 million in total net sales for CARVYKTI during the fourth quarter, an increase of 189% year-over-year, driven by the progress we have made with ongoing market launches, expanding market share, and capacity improvements. As a reminder, we share equally in all profits and losses of CARVYKTI ex-China with our partner Janssen. Turning to our revenue. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $79.5 million consisting almost entirely of collaboration revenue from the sale of CARVYKTI. Net loss for the quarter ended December 31st, 2023 was $144.8 million or a loss of $0.40 per share compared to a net loss of $135.9 million or a loss of $0.41 per share for the same period last year.', ""For the year ended December 31st, 2023, net loss was $518.3 million or a loss of $1.47 per share compared to a net loss of $446.3 million or a loss of $1.40 per share for the year ended December 31st, 2022. Moving on to expenses, collaboration cost to revenue for the fourth quarter 2023 was $32.5 million compared to $23 million for the same period last year. These are Legend's portion of collaboration cost-of-sales in connection with the collaboration revenue under the Janssen agreement along with expenditures to support the manufacturing capacity expansion. Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter 2023 were $105.7 million compared to $80.8 million for the same period last year. The increase of $24.9 million for the three months ended December 31st, 2023, compared to three months ended December 31st, 2022 was due to -- primarily due to continuous research and development activities cilta-cel, including higher patient enrollment for Phase 3 clinical trials for cilta-cel and an increase in research and development activities for other pipeline items."", ""Administrative expenses for three months ended December 31st, 2023 were $28.7 million compared to $26.7 million for the same period last year. The increase of $2 million year-over-year was primarily due to the expansion of administrative functions to facilitate continuous business growth and continuing investment in building Legend Biotech's global information technology infrastructure. Selling and distribution expense for three months ended December 31st, 2023 was $33.7 million compared to $25.8 million for the same period last year. The increase of $7.9 million year-over-year, due to costs associated with the commercialization of CARVYKTI. To summarize, our spending remains on track and we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. As of December 31st, we had $1.3 billion in cash and equivalents, deposits and investments."", 'Additionally, as we enter the new year, we received a $100 million upfront payment in early January in connection with our global license agreement with Novartis for certain CAR-T therapies targeting DLL3. Thus, we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our operating and capital expenditures through the end of 2025. Thank you. I now pass it back to Ying for closing remarks.', ""Ying Huang: Thank you, Lori. 2023 was an impressive year for Legend. CARVYKTI has proven to be the fastest launched CAR-T therapy. The achievements of our global teams have set us up for great success in 2024 and we're poised to provide more therapy to even more patients around the world.

While happiness is subjective, several factors play a part in making people unhappy.\xa0', 'For instance, a research paper by NBER finds that the population density of an area and happiness in communities are closely linked. It finds that average population density in the 20% of most miserable communities in Canada was more than eight times greater than in the happiest 20% of communities. Therefore concluding that living in highly dense cities like metropolitan areas reduces average happiness levels.', 'Additionally, economic well-being has a major effect on happiness as well, especially in urban living. Although there is a common perception that cities offer amenities that lead to happiness, there’s evidence that urban living does not necessarily mean more happiness in individuals.\xa0', 'According to the NIH study, happiness and well-being increase as income increases. In the study, the researchers decided to look at incomes above and below $100,000 per year. They found out that those American participants making less than $100,000 per year get unhappier as income decreases. On the contrary, those making more than $100,000 per year are less miserable, and once incomes cross $100,000 per year and people make more money, the level of peak happiness grows even faster.\xa0', 'However, while higher income does buy you happiness, other mental-health deteriorating factors in cities, like high costs of living, greater inequality, social isolation, noise, and pollution, can offset the benefits of higher incomes. But for many people, especially Gen Z and Millennials, emotional and physical well-being is more important than job perks such as high salary. According to the Securian Financial survey, 73% of Generation Z and 74% of Millennial employees have utilized the mental health benefits that their employers offered.\xa0', 'People are realizing now more than ever before the importance of happiness and its effect on their emotional and physical well-being. Happiness brings out positive emotions, produces a pleasant mood, and makes your attitude soft towards yourself and others around you. Additionally, happiness protects the heart physically by lowering heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormone levels. Safe to say, happiness is not only a state of mind but also a crucial component for maintaining physical health.', 'However, many cities in the United States lack factors that would make residents happy, such as pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. The lack of such infrastructure discourages physical activity among the residents, and further hurts the air quality of the area by promoting high use of vehicles. Moreover, the lack of affordable healthcare services is also a significant factor contributing to unhappiness among the residents. Some of the leading healthcare companies that are actively investing in urban areas include Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).', 'Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is one of the leading companies in investing in diagnostics, and healthcare solutions. It made huge investments at the peak of COVID-19, such as opening a new cGMP plasmid DNA manufacturing facility in Carlsbad, California, in 2021. Earlier in the same year, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) announced more than $600 million in capital investments to expand its bioprocessing production capabilities through 2022. Moreover, in 2022, the company announced a $59 million investment in Kentucky’s healthcare sector, which will create 200 full-time jobs that will pay an average of $41 per hour.\xa0', 'Meanwhile, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), an American multinational health insurance and services company, made significant investments in cities in the United States, focusing on various initiatives to address community needs. One of the notable investments includes a $25 million commitment to the Healthy Neighborhoods Equity Fund II (HNEF II) in Boston to finance mixed-use developments that offer retail, housing, and social services. The aim behind this investment is to promote healthier communities. UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) recognizes that access to affordable housing will improve community health outcomes and help people live healthier and happier lives.', 'On the other hand, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has a strong reputation for various initiatives and healthcare investments.

The last payment made up 87% of earnings, but cash flows were much higher. Since the dividend is just paying out cash to shareholders, we care more about the cash payout ratio from which we can see plenty is being left over for reinvestment in the business.', 'The next year is set to see EPS grow by 42.3%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 67%, which would make us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend, despite the levels currently being quite high.', ""Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.12 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.76. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 9.4% per annum over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios."", ""The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. In the last five years, Medtronic's earnings per share has shrunk at approximately 2.4% per annum. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this can turn into a longer term trend."", ""Overall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. The company has been bring in plenty of cash to cover the dividend, but we don't necessarily think that makes it a great dividend stock. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income."", 'Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Given that earnings are not growing, the dividend does not look nearly so attractive.

(NYSE: MDT),\xa0a global leader in healthcare technology, today shared a robust set of new clinical and real-world evidence on the MiniMed™ 780G system from around the world including the largest set of data from early users in the United States. The data was presented at the 17th International Conference on Advanced Technologies and Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) in Florence, Italy. These results build on the 3-year data published in Diabetes Technology & Therapeutics showing over 100,000 real-world users achieving a Time in Range (TIR) of 78% with the use of recommended optimal settings, outperforming international targets of 70% TIR.', ""New data sought to evaluate the MiniMed™\xa0780G system's ability to help users achieve Time in Tight Range (TITR) goals, a new and emerging supplementary metric being discussed amongst experts, which more closely mirrors the glucose levels of individuals without diabetes.

Results showed users (n=13,461) achieved a TITR of greater than 56% with the use of recommended optimal settings (100 mg/dL set target with an active insulin time of 2 hours). This data adds to a growing body of evidence that a TITR goal of 50% or greater is a reasonably achievable goal with the right therapeutic option."", '""Since the landmark DCCT study, numerous retrospective studies have demonstrated the association between increased Time in Range and a reduction of diabetic complications.1-12 There\'s no doubt elevated glucose is harmful and the average blood sugars of those living with type 1 diabetes are higher than we should accept as a clinical community,"" said Robert Vigersky, MD, Chief Medical Officer, Medtronic Diabetes. ""The preponderance of data across randomized controlled trials and real-world studies show that the MiniMed™ 780G system is maximizing Time in Range far surpassing international targets and is taking it a step beyond by getting people closer to euglycemia.13,14 In the absence of a cure, our goal is to relentlessly innovate therapies to help people maximize their health without adding burden, which our newest AID system has proven to do.""', 'MiniMed™ 780G System Early Success in the U.S. \xa0In an oral presentation, Dr. James Thrasher, MD, Founder, Arkansas Diabetes and Endocrinology Center, shared data on early real-world users with type 1 diabetes of the MiniMed™\xa0780G system in the U.S. (n=7,499). Results showed users achieved over 80% TIR when employing the recommended optimal settings, exceeding international glycemic targets (ADA guidelines recommend 70% time in range between 70-180 mg/dL), with closed loop exits occurring less than once per week on average. The enhancements\xa0introduced in this latest system have resulted in high satisfaction and improved quality of life benefits.15,16\xa0Indeed, the latest dQ&A U.S. Pump Patient Survey (n=1,997), found that among pump users, the MiniMed™ 780G system scored first in overall pump satisfaction.*,17 The survey also showed that among people with type 1 diabetes using CGM, the Guardian™ 4 sensor mirrored competitor sensors in overall satisfaction.*,18', '""The results demonstrate that when the MiniMed™ 780G system is optimized with recommended optimal settings, it helps people with diabetes far exceed the ADA recommended goal of 70% Time in Range,*"" said Dr. Thrasher.

This data reinforces that the determinant of choice for AID systems should be first and foremost the power of the algorithm."" ', 'About Time in Tight RangeThe development of continuous glucose monitoring enabled the development of Time in Range (TIR), a metric used today to determine whether an individual with type 1 diabetes is meeting blood sugar management goals. Since 2019, the goal of diabetes management has been to maintain the highest TIR for as long as possible while also minimizing hypoglycemia. The introduction of automated insulin delivery (AID) systems has transformed diabetes care by enabling a wider range of individuals to safely achieve blood-sugar goals with less burden and effort. AID systems are helping people achieve more ambitious goals with glucose management, prompting the emergence of a new supplementary metric that mirrors blood sugar levels of individuals without diabetes (normoglycemia or euglycemia). The MiniMed™ 780G system is demonstrating that a Time in Tight Range above 50 percent is achievable and serves as a powerful tool for those seeking more time in euglycemia.', ""About the Medtronic Diabetes (www.medtronicdiabetes.com)Medtronic Diabetes is on a mission to alleviate the burden of diabetes by empowering individuals to live life on their terms, with the most advanced diabetes technology and always-on support when and how they need it.

In a note written by analyst Andrew Garthwaite and his team, they clarified that the predictions outlined carry long odds and are not reflective of the bank's base-case scenario or market consensus. One of the noteworthy surprises highlighted by UBS involves the possibility of China's nominal GDP experiencing a slowdown to 3%, contrary to expectations of acceleration. Additionally, the forecast includes a potential steepening of the yield curve to 2%, challenging current market expectations. Moreover, the UBS team envisions a scenario where a candidate other than Joe Biden or Donald Trump emerges as the victor in the November election, adding an element of unpredictability to the political landscape.\xa0"", ""Among the bold predictions outlined in UBS's report, a particularly interesting insight is the transformative impact of generative artificial intelligence tools on productivity. The strategists suggest that these tools are already making a substantial impact and expect that the existing infrastructure could facilitate a 2.5% increase in productivity growth. Drawing parallels to the IT revolution in the late 1990s, such an uptick in productivity could potentially ignite a significant rally for equities. The UBS team forecasts that instead of productivity staying around 1.5%, it could increase to 2.5%. They believe this could lead to lower inflation and a slow decrease in unemployment. If this happens, the central bank might be able to cut interest rates more quickly than what people in the markets expect. The UBS analysts also say that if productivity grows by 2.5%, it could cause a big 20% increase in the S&P 500 throughout the year."", 'The United States economy is currently experiencing what some experts are categorizing as a ""Goldilocks"" moment.

The NABE now predicts a 2.2% rise in gross domestic product (GDP) for 2024, a more optimistic forecast compared to just two months ago. Inflation, a key concern impacting multiple spending categories, is expected to continue decreasing this year.

On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 33% , including dividends ."", ""Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Williams Companies ', 'There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.', 'During three years of share price growth, Williams Companies achieved compound earnings per share growth of 150% per year. The average annual share price increase of 16% is actually lower than the EPS growth. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat.', 'You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).', ""We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Williams Companies' earnings, revenue and cash flow."", ""When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Williams Companies, it has a TSR of 82% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""Williams Companies provided a TSR of 33% over the year (including dividends). That's fairly close to the broader market return. That gain looks pretty satisfying, and it is even better than the five-year TSR of 12% per year. Even if the share price growth slows down from here, there's a good chance that this is business worth watching in the long term. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Instead, they slice the DNA into short fragments of about 500 base pairs that are easier to work with and faster to read."", ""DNA samples, in the form of a small amount of tissue or fluid, usually contain many cells, and thus many copies of the organism's genome-so once the system captures images of the fragments, it reassembles the data for one complete sequence by comparing where the fragments overlap."", ""Think of it like tossing several identical copies of a book into a paper shredder, each one at a random angle. You can't reassemble any individual copy like you would a puzzle, because all the pieces are the same shape. (Especially if you don't have an intact book to reference.) But, since each copy of the book was shredded in different random locations from the others, you can match up fragments from different copies based on where the text overlaps."", 'If the species of interest has never been sequenced before, scientists must rely on these overlaps, known as contiguous regions, or ""contigs,"" to build a reference genome. Fortunately, human reference genomes are available thanks to The Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, and the ongoing work of the Genome Reference Consortium. Every individual human shares 99.99% of the same base pairs, so scientists can identify an individual\'s genetic variants by comparing them to existing references.', 'Unfortunately, in many regions of the human genome, the sequence of base pairs is highly repetitive. Entire genes-many thousands of base pairs long-may be duplicated multiple times, with only a handful of base pair variations to differentiate the copies. Furthermore, the number of duplications of given genes, and the specific differences between the copies, frequently varies from person to person.', 'These regions of ""high homology"" are notoriously difficult to analyze, even with a reference genome available. Fragments from them are likely to ""fit"" in several possible locations, leaving the system with low confidence that it\'s aligned them correctly.', 'Unfortunately, many genetic diseases result from having an atypical number of copies of specific genes, or a variant in just one gene of a multigene family with many copies-so in order to screen for these diseases, sequencing systems and data analysis pipelines must be sophisticated enough to accurately detect variants even in high-homology regions.', 'One way to tackle this is to perform longer reads. If the fragments are long enough to bridge the homologous region, reads can be mapped unambiguously to different copies of that region in the reference genome. For example, Illumina Complete Long Reads can create reads up to about 10,000 base pairs. But some homologous regions are still longer than that.', 'Luckily, Illumina scientists have developed solutions to this problem even for short reads. Targeted callers are tailor-made to quickly and accurately detect the copy number (and other variants) of genes associated with specific diseases. Read on to learn about three of them-congenital adrenal hyperplasia, alpha thalassemia, and atherosclerosis-and how DRAGEN Secondary Analysis software version 4.2 pierces the fog to locate their genetic origin.', 'CYP21A2 and congenital adrenal hyperplasia', 'Our adrenal glands, located atop our kidneys, help regulate the levels of sodium and potassium in our blood. They do this by synthesizing the hormones cortisol and aldosterone, with the help of the protein 21-hydroxylase.', 'That protein is coded by the gene CYP21A2, which unfortunately sits in just one of two copies of the highly homologous RCCX region. The other copy of RCCX contains a very similar ""pseudogene,"" CYP21A1P, which has no function. This homology confuses not just gene sequencing, but human reproduction: When parental chromosomes recombine to form their child\'s DNA, they might mistakenly mix genetic material between the functional CYP21A2 and the nonfunctional CYP21A1P, impairing the resulting gene\'s ability to code for 21-hydroxylase… or they might delete the gene entirely.', ""As with many inherited diseases, a child usually shows no symptoms as long as they have one functioning copy of CYP21A2-they're only a carrier for the condition. But having two nonfunctional copies leads to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)."", 'CAH caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency occurs about once in 10,000 to 15,000 live births. If a developing fetus\'s adrenal glands have a decreased level of 21-hydroxylase, they can\'t synthesize as much cortisol and aldosterone as their body needs. Then, the excess materials they would\'ve used for synthesis accumulate and instead form androgens, or male sex hormones. This is called ""simple virilizing CAH."" Girls with excessive androgens may develop ambiguous genitalia; boys may not show any external signs and require targeted screening to diagnose.', 'Children born without either functional CYP21A2 gene-and thus a complete lack of 21-hydroxylase-can\'t synthesize cortisol and aldosterone at all, and their kidneys can\'t retain salt. This severe ""salt-wasting CAH"" causes dehydration, diarrhea, vomiting, and adrenal crisis within days or weeks of birth, and is often fatal.', 'The CYP21A2 targeted caller in DRAGEN 4.2 is a research-use-only tool specially geared to detect a wide range of variation in the gene: It can discern the number of copies of the RCCX region, gene deletions, gene conversions, and 33 different small variants in the gene or the pseudogene. Illumina scientists tested the caller on a large selection of publicly available data from The 1000 Genomes Project, including healthy individuals, CAH carriers, and 16 CAH cases. The caller successfully detected the RCCX copy number, full gene deletions, and small variants in every case.', ""To learn about how the CYP21A2 caller works and the methods used to test it in greater detail, read this article by Jonathan Belyeu, Fabian Klötzl, Eric Roller, Emma Newman, Vitor Onuchic, and Mitchell Bekritsky on Illumina's Genomics Research Hub."", 'HBA and alpha thalassemia', 'By weight, human red blood cells are composed of about 35% hemoglobin, which is responsible for transporting oxygen. (Most of the rest is water.) There are a few different combinations of hemoglobin proteins, but an essential ingredient of them all is alpha hemoglobin, encoded by the genes HBA1 and HBA2.', ""People typically have four total copies of these genes, two on each copy of chromosome 16. Children who inherit only three copies will be carriers-they still produce enough alpha hemoglobin and don't generally need treatment. But children who inherit two or fewer copies of HBA1 and HBA2 will have some form of alpha thalassemia, an autosomal recessive blood disorder."", 'Insufficient hemoglobin causes anemia, in which red blood cells are undersized or disintegrate entirely-and the number of missing copies of HBA1 and HBA2 directly affects alpha thalassemia\'s severity. A person with two missing copies has ""alpha thalassemia trait,"" which causes mild anemia. Three missing copies entails ""hemoglobin H disease,"" or HbH, which requires blood transfusion therapy. A person without any copies has ""hemoglobin Bart\'s hydrops foetalis,"" which is usually fatal.', 'According to the Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases, alpha thalassemia ""is probably the most common monogenic disorder in the world and is especially frequent in Mediterranean countries, South-East Asia, Africa, the Middle East and in the Indian subcontinent."" In some regions, more than 30% of the population may be carriers. Some scientists theorize that this prevalence arose because it actually confers an evolutionary advantage in these regions, since carriers are less susceptible to malaria.', ""In all, the CDC estimates that about 5% of the world's population has some variant of alpha thalassemia, and both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American College of Medical Genetics recommend screening for the condition in people who are pregnant or who plan to reproduce."", 'The genomic region containing HBA1 and HBA2 is highly homologous, making copy number detection and accurate read alignment difficult for gene sequencing systems. So Illumina scientists developed the research-use-only HBA targeted caller for DRAGEN 4.2, which estimates HBA copy number genotype based on several nearby regions that are not homologous. They tested the caller on hundreds of samples from The 1000 Genomes Project and found that it accurately detected 14 copy number genotypes-variations based on exactly which region of the HBA genes was deleted.', 'In the article linked below, these scientists report being confident that this research tool will be able to aid large-scale population studies, and in turn ""help guide decisions about how to best deploy carrier and newborn screening tests.""', ""To learn about how the HBA caller works and the methods used to test it in greater detail, read this article by Shunhua Han, Vitor Onuchic, Massimiliano Rossi, Eric Roller, and Daniel Cameron on Illumina's Genomics Research Hub."", 'KIV-2 and atherosclerosis', 'We humans require cholesterol as a vital component of our cell membranes, and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) are the main vehicle our bodies use to transport cholesterol-containing fats. However, elevated LDL levels are a major factor in atherosclerosis-a buildup of fats along arterial walls-and subsequently of cardiovascular disease (CVD). According to the World Health Organization, nearly a third of all deaths are due to CVD, 85% of which involve heart attack and stroke.', ""Lipoprotein a (LPA) is one kind of LDL. The concentration of LPA in a person's blood is highly heritable from parent to child and varies widely from one population to the next-for instance, an article in JAMA Cardiology estimates that 20% of individuals of European ancestry have elevated LPA levels. These elevated levels can be traced to a genetic cause: the number of copies of the kringle-IV 2 domain (KIV-2) in the LPA protein."", 'Named after the twisted Danish pastry, kringle domains are sections of a protein that fold together into loops and help it bind to other proteins. KIV-2 has an astounding range of occurrence: human reference genomes usually record fewer than six copies of it in the LPA gene, but some people have 50 copies or more.', ""Why does this region get copied so much? For now, scientists are unsure. The more copies of KIV-2 a person has, the longer their LPA proteins are… but here's the catch: The longer these proteins are, the longer they take to synthesize, so-counterintuitively-a person with more copies of KIV-2 actually has lower levels of LPA in their blood."", 'Regardless, the extremely variable copy number of this region makes it a huge challenge for a gene sequencer to accurately describe and quantify.', 'Working with colleagues at eight universities and laboratories across the United States, Illumina scientists developed a targeted caller that generates a highly accurate copy number measurement for this difficult region. They tested the research-use-only caller on the genomic data of 120 Mendelian trios (a child and both their parents) recorded in The 1000 Genomes Project, and the results correlated extremely closely with those generated by other methods. In the article linked below, the Illumina team presents these results as evidence that the LPA targeted caller in DRAGEN software ""will provide a valuable tool for enhanced LPA and CVD research.""', ""To learn about how the KIV-2 caller works and the methods used to test it in greater detail, read this article by Jonathan Belyeu, Vitor Onuchic, and Mitchell Bekritsky on Illumina's Genomics Research Hub."", 'DRAGEN 4.2 software includes several targeted callers for detecting copy number variants in high-homology regions.

For instance, one of the most well known engineering stocks in the U.S. is the industrial giant General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). It makes a wide variety of advanced products such as turbines and jet engines, and with a market capitalization of $167 billion, the stock is just a couple of catalysts shy of transforming itself from a large cap to a mega cap.', 'Another example of an engineering stock is the diversified engineering and construction company Fluor Corporation (NYSE:FLR). Headquartered in Texas, the firm provides a wide variety of engineering services to the energy industry and includes other sectors such as construction in the mix as well.', ""As you might be starting to understand, the nature of engineering stocks means that they are exposed to a specific set of tailwinds and headwinds. For firms such as Fluor Corporation (NYSE:FLR), these can include those involving their businesses. Since a large portion of Fluor's revenue comes from oil exploration, should the world's appetite for the black gold start to shrink, then the firm's shares will drop as well Additionally, since a lot of engineering stocks provide services to the construction industry, any drop in construction activity or housing starts will naturally not bode well for the shares."", 'Building on this, construction activity in the U.S. is also facing the heat from high interest rates. These make it difficult for builders to raise capital for new projects and also make it harder for prospective buyers to make pricey purchases. For instance, data from the Census Bureau shows that construction activity in the United States grew moderately annually in 2023 but did mark a double digit jump in December. In 2023, the total value of construction activity was worth $1.9 trillion to mark for a small 1% annual growth while in December 2023, a total of $2 trillion was spent on construction for a more noticeable 13.9% annual growth.', ""Before we get to our list of the best engineering stocks, it's quite important to see what investors believe will be the timeline for U.S. interest rate cuts.

In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$2.53b', 'US$2.39b', 'US$2.49b', 'US$2.71b', 'US$2.75b', 'US$2.79b', 'US$2.83b', 'US$2.89b', 'US$2.95b', 'US$3.01b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x6', 'Analyst x6', 'Analyst x4', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ 1.48%', 'Est @ 1.72%', 'Est @ 1.89%', 'Est @ 2.01%', 'Est @ 2.10%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% ', 'US$2.4k', 'US$2.1k', 'US$2.0k', 'US$2.0k', 'US$1.9k', 'US$1.8k', 'US$1.7k', 'US$1.6k', 'US$1.5k', 'US$1.4k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$18b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.

Do keep this in mind.', ""The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows.

The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at TE Connectivity as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.157. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

The company has carved out a sizeable niche in the market with its high-end products, fostered brand loyalty with free yoga classes and other events, and expanded its direct-to-consumer business to curb its dependence on wholesale retailers."", ""From fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2022 (which ended last January), Lululemon's revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26% as its net income grew at a CAGR of 25%."", 'That past performance was incredible, but can Lululemon keep it going and mint even more millionaires over the next two decades?', ""Lululemon's growth was driven by the rapid expansion of the athleisure market, which blurred the lines between athletic and everyday apparel. It also established itself as a premium brand by selling its products at high prices and limiting its markdowns, and it's expanding beyond its core market of female shoppers with more products for men."", ""It's also one of the few retailers that continues to expand its brick-and-mortar footprint as many of its industry peers shut down their struggling stores. It ended the third quarter of fiscal 2023 with 686 stores, compared to just 254 locations at the end of fiscal 2013. That brick-and-mortar expansion, along with the growth of its e-commerce platform, enables it to now generate more than 40% of its revenue from its direct-to-consumer channels."", 'In 2019, Lululemon rolled out its ""Power of Three"" growth plan to double its digital revenue, double its men\'s revenue, and quadruple its international revenue from its fiscal 2018 levels over the following five years. It cleared its digital and men\'s goals ahead of schedule in fiscal 2021 -- even as it temporarily closed some of its stores during the pandemic -- and it quadrupled its international revenue by the end of fiscal 2022.', 'In 2022, it launched a new ""Power of Three x2"" plan with the exact same goals: It plans to double its digital and men\'s revenues again, as well as quadruple its international revenue, from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2026. It expects that plan to nearly double its annual revenue from $6.3 billion in fiscal 2021 to $12.5 billion in fiscal 2026.', ""Analysts expect Lululemon's revenue to rise 19% to $9.6 billion in fiscal 2023, and they will find out if they were right when it posts its full-year earnings report on March 21. That gain would represent a slowdown from its 30% growth in fiscal 2022 -- but it isn't too surprising since most apparel makers have been grappling with tough inflationary headwinds for consumer spending."", ""A lot of Lululemon's growth in fiscal 2022 was driven by markdowns, but it reined in those discounts throughout fiscal 2023. Its growth in China also accelerated and outpaced the North American market. As a result, its gross margin expanded 230 basis points year over year to 57.8% in the first nine months of fiscal 2023."", 'During its third-quarter conference call last December, CEO Calvin McDonald said the company was still ""well positioned"" to meet its Power of Three x2 goals. From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2025, analysts expect Lululemon\'s revenue to rise at a CAGR of 13% to $12.3 billion -- which suggests it should easily exceed its target of $12.5 billion in fiscal 2026.', ""Lululemon's business is maturing, but the expansion of its direct-to-consumer channels, the introduction of new men's products, and its rising sales in China could drive its evolution into a more diversified athletic brand like Nike."", ""If it meets analysts' expectations and continues to grow at a more modest CAGR of 10% from fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2040, it could generate $50 billion in revenue by the final year. That would nearly match Nike's revenue of $51 billion in fiscal 2023 (which ended last May). Assuming its valuations hold steady, its stock would rally about five times from its current levels. That would turn a $20,000 investment into $100,000 -- but it probably won't make you a millionaire on its own."", ""Lululemon probably won't replicate its dizzying gains from the past 17 years over the next two decades. But it's still a solid play on the growth of the athleisure market -- and it still seems reasonably valued at 31 times next year's earnings."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Lululemon Athletica right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Lululemon Athletica, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lululemon Athletica wasn’t one of them.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.', ""Over the past month, shares of this biggest U.S. mortgage lender have returned +18.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, which Wells Fargo falls in, has gained 8.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'Wells Fargo is expected to post earnings of $1.10 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -10.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of $4.72 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -13.1%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.', 'For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.28 indicates a change of +11.7% from what Wells Fargo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.', ""Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

For example, the S&P 500 is up more than 8% in the past two months, the NASDAQ Composite is up close to 9%, and the Dow Jones has registered gains of around 3%.

Let's consider two companies that fit the bill: Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Viatris (NASDAQ: VTRS)."", ""Last year, Pfizer's revenue dropped by 42% year over year to $58.5 billion. The decline was due to the receding pandemic. Demand for Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty, and its related medicine, Paxlovid, dropped off a cliff. Still, the drugmaker's current slump won't last forever."", ""Pfizer already has a plan to turn over a new leaf. Last year, it earned approval in the U.S. for seven brand-new products, more than double any of its competitors' total for 2023.These products will eventually help Pfizer's revenue start moving in the right direction."", ""It's also worth noting that Pfizer's underlying business, excluding its coronavirus portfolio, isn't performing that badly: Revenue increased by a solid 7% year over year in 2023. Pfizer's decision to join the COVID-19 market has been a net positive despite its current declining top-line. It became the company in the pharmaceutical industry to hit $100 billion in sales in 2023 thanks to it. The money it generated allowed it to invest in the future."", 'Pfizer made important acquisitions, including that of cancer specialist Seagen, for $43 billion. Seagen was already a successful oncology-focused biotech before having access to the kinds of funds Pfizer has. The newly formed entity under Pfizer should speed up innovation compared with what it would have been able to accomplish by itself. Pfizer plans on increasing the number of blockbuster cancer medicines in its portfolio to eight by 2030, up from five today.', ""Of course, Pfizer is also active in many other areas, from immunology to infectious diseases. It's developing an influenza vaccine to help address the low efficacy of currently available options. The drugmaker is also working on a combined COVID/flu vaccine. Both are in late-stage studies. Pfizer boasts 112 candidates in its pipeline. The company should significantly improve its lineup in the next few years, even more than it already has."", ""As for the dividend, the company has increased its payouts by just under 17% in the past five years. It offers a forward dividend yield of 6.18%. Lastly, Pfizer's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is just 12, compared with a forward P/E of 18.4 for the pharmaceutical industry. So Pfizer looks like an attractively valued dividend stock by this popular metric."", ""Viatris hasn't been a standalone, publicly traded corporation for very long. The company was created when Pfizer's former subsidiary, off-patent drug specialist Upjohn, merged with the corporation then known as Mylan N.V., which focused on developing and marketing generic drugs, back in late 2020."", ""The company's position in the market for generic and branded pharmaceutical products is enviable. It owns several popular brands that should continue attracting customers for a long time. These include Viagra, Xanax, Lipitor, and more. This business creates a somewhat stable source of revenue for the company."", ""Viatris has also significantly changed its operations recently by shedding lower-growth opportunity segments. For instance, it got rid of its biosimilar and women's healthcare units. Besides cutting off low-growth opportunities, Viatris planned to pay off debt while investing in more potentially lucrative avenues."", 'The company created a new eye care division through acquisitions and announced a research and development partnership with Switzerland-based pharmaceutical company Idorsia.

Since then, shares have turned a $10,000 investment into over $82,000. The company rode blockbuster sales from Humira for years, but that patent expired last year.

The company uses genetic engineering to create microbes that perform specific functions. Potential uses span many sectors, including vaccine manufacturing, cannabinoids, and even probiotics in plant foods. This synthetic biology opens up a massive market opportunity for Ginkgo Bioworks.', ""The company generates revenue upfront when it launches a program, but long-term profits will primarily stem from royalties and fees from successful product development. Ginkgo Bioworks is still a very young company with just $250 million in annual revenue and it trades at a $2.6 billion market capitalization. There's far more risk in Ginkgo than these first two stocks, but the potential reward is also far greater.

The market usually sells off their stocks to levels more than warranted when the underlying business hits a lean patch, or fails to meet the market's baked-in expectations, over the short term. But if the long-term prospects are fundamentally intact, such market actions merely make the stocks cheap, making them ripe pickings for value investors."", ""However, it's also true that many investors have lost their shirts by betting on fallen winners from yesteryear in hopes of a recovery that never arrived."", ""Undoubtedly, it's hard to distinguish which stocks are in which of the two categories above. So, let's examine one example of each."", ""Despite its high-profile work in developing a coronavirus vaccine at the start of the pandemic, the total return of Pfizer's (NYSE: PFE) shares over the last three years is down by 11%, badly underperforming the market.

With $64 billion in debt and repayment at the pace of the fourth quarter, when it repaid $1.3 billion of its long-term borrowing, that project will take some time."", 'But with the benefit of Seagen and a few other acquisitions, the future looks bright. In total, by 2030 Pfizer is aiming to gain $45 billion in new revenue. Few other businesses can say that their next six years will see as much additional sales in absolute terms, and with a world-class management team, Pfizer is more likely to succeed with its goal than stumble.', ""In that context, its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12 looks inexpensive, presuming you're willing to be patient."", 'Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) is struggling to find its home in the U.S. healthcare market.

Despite its recent strategic entry into the primary care segment, its top line is not expanding rapidly, and its expenditures are up, causing its free cash flow (FCF) to fall significantly over time.

That isn't the situation one would expect of a well-functioning business that has historically been competing primarily in a relatively stable industry like retail pharmacies."", ""What's more, Walgreens Boots Alliance has no trump card to play in its hand at this point; it faces a grueling combination of slashing costs necessary to generate revenue by closing stores and the need for major new outlays to capture market share. Shareholders already paid the bill for the dilemma once when the dividend was cut, and they might need to pay for it again, too."", 'The company has been selling off hundreds of millions of dollars of its investments to cover its near-term costs.

And I was asking, we're still down pretty meaningfully from pre-pandemic?"", ""GITESH PANDYA: Yeah, we're, down from pre-pandemic times. There's a lot of times in February and March have some big films before 2020, when the box office would do pretty well in the first quarter. And then even the last couple of years during post-pandemic times, you had a couple of big films coming out."", 'So put it this way. Two years ago, right around now, you had a brand new Batman film opening. And it opened right after Omicron was happening.', 'And people still came out to over $130 million opening weekend. Now, this last weekend, we had Dune Part 2, $82.5 million. Nothing to sneeze at. More than double what the first dune made.', ""And so with the right content, people are coming out. One of the problems is that because of the strikes, a lot of the supply line has been delayed. And so we don't have as many films out there and ready to go. Right now in the first half of the year first quarter of the year that we normally do."", ""So there's a lack of volume in the marketplace right now that will get corrected by the time we reach the second quarter into the summer when you have a lot more films coming out. Normally, you have a big film every week or two. And we haven't had much of that this year. It's been a very poor first quarter. But now, with dune coming out and more sequels, it's starting to get better."", ""JULIE HYMAN: So we've got the Oscars this weekend. And given that backdrop of the waning box office, the increase of streaming, obviously, also a factor of that. What role does the Oscars now play? What role does the prestige picture now play in the age of streaming?"", ""GITESH PANDYA: Well, certainly, it's a PR bonanza because you get so much attention. The world's media is on the Oscars at least for that one night. Most of these films, the bigger films have already played out. And they've made most of their money anyway."", ""Oppenheimer, for example, has grossed about $960 million since last July when it first came out.

It's really-- isn't it just that much harder to get people off the couch?"", ""GITESH PANDYA: Well, that's why the movies have to be engaging. They have to be kick ass movies that you leave the couch for, that you go to the movie theater for. Streaming and the box office can coexist."", ""It's like the restaurant business. You can eat food at home. You can go out to a restaurant. Both can succeed. But they have to be good."", ""So with the movies, people have a different threshold now. And so if a movie looks interesting, I do want to see it. I'll wait to see it at home. That's what the studios have to fight against."", ""And so when they're making a film, and when they're marketing a film, they have to have something that is completely engaging, exciting, that you must see right away on the big screen right now and not wait six weeks, eight weeks later to watch at home. That is the big challenge. And the studios that can solve that are going to be the big winners."", 'Because, again, in this pandemic time, you have so many reasons for people not to go out to the movies.

These are among the 10 highest grossing movies of all-time during this post pandemic era.', ""So people will go out with different challenges. It's just got to be the right thing at the right time."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And are we getting that? That's the other big question, right? There's been a lot of complaints about.

Not only is the stock now down 80% from the pandemic-bolstered peak it touched in 2021, but the shares are back to their 2017 levels. The stock's also gone nowhere for nearly a year now. It just still seems like there are too many competitive threats."", 'That line of thinking, however, ignores a couple of important details about PayPal.', ""One of these details is that even with all the alternative payment platforms that have appeared, PayPal is still the dominant player in the business. Data compiled by Statista suggests PayPal accounts for nearly half of the worldwide web's payment processing activity (when including payment gateway activity), while numbers from Cornerstone Advisors confirm PayPal remains the single-most-used P2P (peer-to-peer) digital payment service, particularly among the all-important 21- to 42-year-old demographic. That matters, because once consumers become comfortable with a brand, they tend to stick with it."", 'There are some dents and bruises here, to be sure. For instance, the number of active PayPal users slipped 2% to 423 million in the final quarter of 2023, extending a contraction that first took hold at the beginning of last year.', ""Just keep things in perspective, though, those periods are being compared to a time when many people were still taking precautions to reduce their potential to be exposed to the coronavirus, and were not quite as willing to shop in person as they are now. Also, while the total number of active PayPal accounts ebbed a bit last year, total payment volumes actually increased 13% last quarter and 12% last year.

Rocket Lab USA is one of these entities. To date, it has launched 177 satellites, and is currently sitting on a backlog of more than 40 more. Expect that backlog to grow. Analysts are modeling for revenue growth of nearly 80% for this year, and another 44% growth for 2025.', ""It's still just the beginning, though."", ""See, for all the effort that's been made on the satellite front so far, we've only scratched the surface of this tech's potential. Aircraft navigation, enterprise-level broadband connectivity, the reduction of carbon emissions, the creation of new pharmaceuticals, and stronger defense systems are all on the radar now that launches are more affordable and feasible. That's why Straits Research believes the satellite communications market will grow from 2021's total of nearly $72 billion to more than $160 billion by 2030. Rocket Lab stands ready to capture at least its fair share of this growth."", ""This might help bolster the bullish case for the stock: Analysts' current consensus price target stands at $8 per share -- about 75% above the current price. Most analysts keeping tabs on Rocket Lab USA also consider the stock a buy, if not a strong buy."", 'Fintech company SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI) has its roots in the student loan consolidation business, but it has become so much more.

The key difference between SoFi Technologies and most of its peers, however, is that its operation is 100% online. There are no physical branches.', 'There was a time when consumers might have been leery about using such a bank. Even though most customers rarely (if ever) visit a brick-and-mortar branch these days, they still like knowing an in-person interaction is an option.', 'But that era is coming to a close. The American Bankers Association reports that last year, 71% of U.S. consumers surveyed said they preferred to bank online -- or through an app -- while only 9% preferred to handle banking business at a branch. And the younger they are, the more likely they are to embrace digital options. Numbers compiled by Chase Bank say 98% of millennials and 99% of the Gen Z crowd regularly use mobile banking apps for a variety of reasons.', ""These younger generations' children will, of course, be even more digitally native, leaving them even less interested in in-person banking. Once consumers develop a habit based on convenience, it tends to stick."", 'As of the end of 2023, SoFi had 7.5 million customers, up 44% year over year, and more than twice as many as it had at the end of 2021.', 'To be sure, traditional brick-and-mortar banks are expanding their digital offerings.

While Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) does give tips that senior citizens in their 60s can use to extend their retirement savings - such as working a few extra years or monetizing assets - this is not always an option. For many senior citizens, there are no assets to monetize.\xa0', 'As for working longer, the US economy is not always supportive. NerdWallet reports an excess of 34,000 layoffs within the first two months of 2024, with big names such as Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), PayPal Holdings, Inc.

That being said, there are some retirees who manage to save up for a comfortable - even luxurious - retirement. According to Smart Asset, about 10% of American retirees are millionaires when it comes to their retirement savings.\xa0 With a larger budget in hand, this gives senior citizens a more varied choice when it comes to their retirement location.\xa0', 'Senior citizens often search for warmer weather, peaceful communities, and beachside living when deciding on where to retire. The best place to offer all this, of course, is the Aloha State. You might wonder, ‘Is retiring in Hawaii a good idea?’ After all, Nasdaq states that Hawaii is the most expensive states, with an amount as high as $3.1 million needed to retire. However, for retirees who possess the financial means, Hawaii can prove to be a great choice. There’s nothing quite as relaxing as spending one’s Golden Years in a tropical haven. The state offers a moderate climate with low temperatures and mild humidity, a welcome break from the intense cold found in other states such as Alaska, Minnesota, and Wyoming.\xa0', 'The winning factor, however, remains to be Hawaii’s natural beauty. The state is dotted with stunning beaches, hiking trails, waterfalls, and tropical forests - the perfect escape for nature-loving retirees.\xa0', 'To facilitate retirees who are pondering the move to Hawaii, we have compiled a list of the 15 best places to retire in Hawaii.', 'Sorin Colac/Shutterstock.com', 'To compile this list of the 15 best places to retire in Hawaii, we consulted several sources including Niche, Dewitt Move, New Home Source, Movoto, Royal Hawaiian Movers, Unbiased, Investment U, and Haven Lifestyles.\xa0 Once a list of places was compiled using these sources, we then ranked them across multiple factors, namely, their cost of living, their livability scores, and their median house price.

But this just isn't true."", ""Look at PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL). As of this writing, its shares are 81% below their all-time high from July 2021. The company has a new chief executive officer who's trying to right the ship and hopefully reward investors in the process."", 'But before you buy this fintech stock on the dip, here are three things you must know about PayPal.', ""You wouldn't be able to tell by the poor performance of its share price, but PayPal's fundamentals are still in good shape. The business generated $4.2 billion of free cash flow in 2023. And it had $6 billion of net cash on the balance sheet as of Dec. 31. These aren't signs of a fiscally troubled enterprise."", ""Management has done a good job of returning capital to shareholders via stock buybacks. In the past 12 months, PayPal's share count outstanding has declined by nearly 5%. And this year, the executive team plans to spend $5 billion or more on buybacks after spending $5 billion in 2023. This type of strategy helps to boost earnings per share."", ""When it comes to growth, PayPal has hit a bit of a rough patch. Revenue was up 8% in both 2022 and 2023, down from double-digit percentage gains in past years. Macroeconomic headwinds reduced consumers' propensity to spend on discretionary items. Analysts expect revenue to rise 6.9% in 2024."", ""The payments industry is notoriously competitive. That's not surprising, given how lucrative finding success at scale is in this market. Just look at Visa and Mastercard. They are two outstanding businesses, with incredible operating margins and powerful network effects."", 'Given that it has been at the forefront of digital payments for more than two decades, PayPal deserves credit for what it has achieved thus far. With its successful two-sided platform of 426 million active users, the business also benefits from network effects that help protect it from the threat of competition.', ""However, there are many players all vying for a bigger piece of the growing electronic payments pie. On the merchant side, PayPal's Braintree goes up against scaled rivals like Stripe, Adyen, Worldpay, and even Block's Square."", ""And on the consumer side, there are many digital-wallet providers going up against PayPal's flagship app, as well as it Venmo peer-to-peer payment app. The big tech companies like Apple and Alphabet have popular payment services. Block's Cash App is catching on with tens of millions of active users. And this doesn't include all the banks and brokerage services out there. "", ""PayPal shareholders haven't been rewarded historically as they had hoped. The stock is up 59% since being spun-off from eBay in July 2015. That meaningfully lags the 249% total return of the Nasdaq Composite Index. That's certainly a discouraging result."", ""But for investors who have conviction that PayPal can get back to sustainably strong revenue and earnings growth, there's a rare opportunity to buy the stock on the cheap right now. The shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 11.4, which is a ridiculously low valuation for a competitively advantaged business that is benefiting from the e-commerce and digital-payments trends, and that generates lots of cash."", 'Investors who now understand more about this business can make a more informed decision about the stock.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This trend can be corroborated by the fact that Bitcoin became a recognized currency in the Central African Republic and El Salvador in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Both countries expressed interest in the benefits of doing so which included the augmented financial opportunities and diminished expense of cross-border remittances.', 'On March 5, Forbes reported\xa0that the cryptocurrency market is undergoing a prominent shift, especially after the dip of 2023 caused by the overall macroeconomic situation. Bitcoin itself underwent a high of $45,208 at the beginning of 2024, with the world crypto market reaching $1.74 trillion on January 3, 2024.

Out of the 580 million people who bought cryptocurrency in 2023, Ethereum ownership increased by 39%, while a 33% increase was attributed to Bitcoin users.', 'This surge holds even more importance since it materialized against various global macroeconomic challenges, including the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Europe, financial constraints imposed by central banks in the West to combat inflation, and the ripple effects of the pandemic still evident.', 'Bitcoin users went from 222 million to 296 million between January 2023 and December 2023, while Ethereum users increased from 89 million to 124 million between the same time frame. Primary factors that fueled this growth include the rise of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as the role of Bitcoin Ordinals protocols which allow for the seamless minting of fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin network. An increased interest from institutional investors is further driving the popularity of cryptocurrencies.', 'The world’s most dominant cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, made history by reaching an all-time high of $70,000 on March 8, 2024. With a 2% uptrend, Bitcoin surpassed this benchmark for the first time in history, albeit momentarily.

It has only gained about 60% since it split from eBay in 2015. That's a meager 5.6% annual return. It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, which is up nearly 150% (11.1% annualized). "", 'What makes that underperformance worse is that at its peak in 2021, PayPal stock had surged more than 600%, only to lose nearly all its gain over the last two years. ', ""That prior surge suggests that PayPal could have lots of upside potential if it can recover its lost momentum. Here's a look at what it would take for the fintech company to double in value over the next five years."", ""One of the things weighing on PayPal in recent years is sluggish profitability. PayPal's non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income declined from nearly $5.5 billion in 2021 to $4.8 billion in 2022. While its earnings bounced back in 2023, rising to $5.6 billion, its profits only grew about 4% during that three-year period. The company's profitability has been under pressure due to rising costs. "", 'Meanwhile, its free cash flow has declined from $4.9 billion in 2021 to $4.6 billion last year. Free cash flow would have fallen even further without the positive $1.7 billion impact of selling its European buy now, pay later (BNPL) receivables. Weighing on free cash flow was higher cash taxes and changes in working capital. ', 'PayPal has taken several steps to reinvigorate growth and boost its profitability. Last year, the company cut 7% of its workforce. It recently revealed another round of job reductions, aiming to reduce its head count by another 9% in 2024. ""We are doing this to right-size our business, allowing us to move with the speed needed to deliver for our customers and drive profitable growth,"" stated CEO Alex Chriss in a letter to employees. ', ""The company's initial round of cost reduction paid some dividends last year. PayPal's operating income and margin steadily improved after bottoming in the second quarter. Non-GAAP net operating income grew from nearly $1.6 billion in that quarter to almost $1.9 billion by the fourth quarter, while its margin improved from 21.4% to 23.3%. "", 'PayPal has also taken steps to reinvigorate its revenue growth. In early 2024, it unveiled six innovations to revolutionize commerce that it hopes will ""solve real customer pain points"" while ""changing the world of payments and commerce,"" according to Chriss. ', 'PayPal has also been using its copious free cash flow to gobble up its shares. The company spent $5 billion on share repurchases last year, which helped reduce its outstanding shares by 4%. ', ""Despite all the positives, PayPal hasn't got its growth engine back on track. After rising 24% last year, the company expects its non-GAAP earnings to flatten out at $5.10 per share this year, despite continued cost reductions and share repurchases. It expects stock-based compensation expenses, related payroll taxes, and restructuring charges to hold back earnings growth. "", ""PayPal needs to start delivering sustained earnings growth. Ideally, its organic growth drivers will help reaccelerate earnings growth. As mentioned, the company has launched several innovations to revolutionize commerce that will hopefully reinvigorate its earnings growth rate. It's also streamlining operations, which should help boost its bottom line."", ""Another potential way PayPal could reaccelerate growth is by making an acquisition. PayPal has a cash-rich balance sheet ($17.3 billion of cash against $11.3 billion of debt) and a business that generates strong free cash flow. Because of that, it certainly has the financial flexibility to make a needle-moving deal. If PayPal can acquire a complimentary company that's growing fast, it could help supercharge its earnings growth. "", ""PayPal's sinking stock price has it trading at about 11.5 times forward earnings. That's dirt cheap compared to the broader market indexes (the S&P 500 sells for 21 times forward earnings, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq trades at more than 30 times forward earnings). The main factor driving those higher-valuation multiples is that companies in those indexes are growing their earnings. "", 'If PayPal can reinvigorate its earnings growth rate, its stock price could double on multiple expansion alone, since investors pay a much higher valuation mulitple for growth stocks. Returning to a growth trajectory seems doable over the next several years, since the company is working to boost growth. On top of that, it has the financial flexibility to potentially make an acquisition that could accelerate growth. Because of that, it certainly seems possible that PayPal stock could double within the next five years.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Spun off from parent company eBay in 2015, the company has amassed more than 400 million global users. From e-commerce transactions to paying back friends, almost everyone has either used PayPal personally or knows someone who has.', 'PayPal the stock has a more volatile history.', 'After its split from eBay, PayPal stock zoomed in value, from $40 per share to $300 per share in just three years. Since those all-time highs, however, the share price has cratered. PayPal shares now trade at 2017 prices.', ""PayPal stock now trades at just 2.2 times sales -- a popular valuation metric for growth stocks. That's the cheapest shares have ever been."", 'Management has noticed the decline in valuation, opting to invest $5 billion in share repurchases. By buying back its own stock at discounted prices, the company hopes to double down on a turnaround.', ""There's only one problem: PayPal has been here before. The company has already spent $15 billion in share repurchases since going public in 2015. These buybacks were executed at prices much higher than today, meaning they destroyed shareholder value."", ""PayPal isn't going anywhere as a company, but don't be fooled into thinking the cheap valuation multiple is a clear buy signal. The reason the shares are cheap is that the company's best days of growth probably are behind it. In fact, its user base has been shrinking the past two years."", ""The shares might be a worthwhile value at today's depressed prices, but there's a better choice for growth investors -- a stock with a turnaround story already in action."", 'Block has faced its own struggles. The company -- traditionally a payment processor, but more recently an investor in other areas like the peer-to-peer payment service Cash App, music platform Tidal, and a host of blockchain-related ventures -- has similarly seen its stock price crater after a slowdown in growth and a drop in profitability.', ""On a price-to-sales basis, Block stock is actually cheaper than PayPal, trading at 2.1 times sales. But as we'll see, the underlying business is much stronger."", 'The first advantage that Block has over PayPal is higher growth rates.', ""Whereas PayPal's business is shrinking according to some metrics, most of Block's segments are experiencing strong growth. Block, for example, has 56 million monthly users on its Cash App. While growth has slowed significantly in recent quarters, the company continues to increase this user base."", 'Continued user growth has allowed Block to maintain revenue gains that are much bigger than what PayPal has achieved, even during its\xa0 days as a hot stock after becoming an independent company.', 'Block is also better positioned for future growth.', ""As the company's name suggests, Block has made big bets on emerging blockchain technologies like Bitcoin. Users of its Cash App can already buy, sell, and transact in Bitcoin. Its Square payment processing platform, meanwhile, is poised to bring cryptocurrency transactions to the masses. Whereas PayPal is defending a plateauing business model, Block is positioned to capitalize on growth trends like the adoption of cryptocurrencies."", 'Why then is Block stock cheaper than PayPal?', ""For most of PayPal's public history, the company has been profitable, racking up billions in free cash flow -- the reason it has been able to fund its historical share buyback programs."", 'Block, meanwhile, has been unprofitable in recent years. When the shares spiked in 2020, however, the company had posted several quarters of profitability. This is what the market came to expect, until a string of quarterly losses sent the stock price tumbling.', ""As a whole, Block is less profitable than PayPal, but that's palatable as long as growth rates remain high. The market, after all, is willing to fund a rapidly growing company. When growth rates slow, however, the market suddenly becomes less willing to cover losses."", ""Last September, Block co-founder Jack Dorsey rejoined Block as the chief executive officer with one mission: return the company to profitability. It didn't take long for this vision to be realized. In February, the company posted its first net profit in two years, albeit a small one."", ""With a return to profitability, expect Block's valuation multiples to pick up, especially if this feat is repeated in subsequent quarters. A high-growth stock that's profitable, no matter how small, deserves a higher multiple than 2.1 times sales in this market."", 'Between PayPal and Block, Block stock is the clear winner for investors right now.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Block right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Block, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Block wasn’t one of them.

Number of payment transactions has also solidly grown, as has revenue. Now everything hasn't been perfect, as the company has seen its number of active accounts stop growing."", ""More recently, PayPal came under pressure due to its 2024 guidance. The company forecast Q1 revenue growth of 6.5%, but didn't issue full-year revenue guidance, while it said it expected adjusted EPS to be in line with the $5.10 it reported in 2023."", ""So why didn't investors like this? Because analysts were looking for 2024 adjusted EPS of $5.53. Stock performance is often tied to future projections and how companies perform versus expectations, so when a company forecasts earnings below analyst expectations, the stock falls."", ""Now while PayPal didn't shock the world at its Innovation event, it did introduce some promising AI-powered offerings. One area of focus for the company is speeding up the checkout process and removing friction for consumers. On this end, the company introduced two new offerings: PayPal Checkout and Fastlane. The former replaces having to type in passwords with biometrics, such as face and fingerprint recognition, while the latter allows for one-tap purchases."", 'Increasing customer engagement and personalization are two other areas that PayPal is targeting. With its Smart Receipts offering, PayPal will provide customers a receipt as well as personalized product recommendations from the same merchant.', 'Along the same lines, the PayPal advanced offers platform will analyze transaction data via AI to deliver personalized offers to customers. This is largely an advertising tool, and merchants only pay when a customer buys the recommended product. Meanwhile, with PayPal CashPass, consumers will be able to earn cash back on purchases as well as rewards.', 'None of these innovations by themselves are exactly groundbreaking. However, they are solid offerings that should help drive engagement and transactions growth.', ""With the fall of its stock price over the past few years, PayPal's valuation has greatly shrunk. It also trades at about half the EV/EBITDA multiple as rival and fellow payment processing company Block (NYSE: SQ). Given PayPal's strong cash position, I prefer using this common valuation metric, as Enterprise Value (EV) takes into consideration a company's balance sheet, while EBITDA removes the impact of any non-cash impacts."", 'PYPL EV to EBITDA (Forward) data by YCharts', ""Given its cheap historical and relative valuation, what investors need to see from the company is innovation and growth. While these new offerings didn't shock the world, they do look like they should provide exactly that."", ""What about PayPal's disappointing guidance?"", 'Ahead on its Innovation event, CEO Chriss overpromised and undelivered, which is never a good thing for stocks, as investors are always looking for companies to exceed expectations. Meanwhile, a few weeks later, management offered up some pretty tepid guidance for 2024.', 'While that may seem bad, there is a good possibility that Chriss quickly learned his lesson and when the company issued its 2024 guidance, the plan was to underpromise and overdeliver. Given all the new promising offerings that PayPal is set to introduce, guidance appears to be conservative.', 'One of the best setups for stocks is a cheap valuation and low expectations.

If you want to skip our discussion on the edge computing market, head over to 5 Best Edge Computing Stocks To Buy.\xa0', 'Edge computing focuses on bringing computing power closer to where data is generated, rather than relying on a centralized cloud-based system. In simple terms, edge computing involves relocating a part of storage and computing capabilities from the central data center to close proximity of data sources. Rather than sending raw data to a central facility for analysis, computation is performed at the location where the data is generated and only the computed results, like real-time business insights or equipment maintenance predictions, are transmitted back to the central data center. Devices such as smart speakers, watches, and phones, which engage in edge computing by locally collecting and processing data, are already a part of our daily lives.', 'Contrary to what some may think, edge computing doesn\'t need a separate ""edge network."" It can work on single devices or routers. If a separate network is used, 5G is important, offering fast wireless connections. This enables cool applications like autonomous drones, remote surgeries, and smart cities. The edge network is useful when on-site computing is too expensive or complex, but fast responses are needed, and the cloud is too distant. Edge networks enable local computation, allowing devices at the edge (like sensors, cameras, or IoT devices) to process data and make decisions without the need to send all information to a centralized cloud for analysis.', 'The Intelligent Edge aims to provide faster, more reliable, and efficient processing for quicker decision-making and reduced dependence on centralized cloud systems, which may face issues like latency and bandwidth. However, deploying and managing edge computing infrastructures pose challenges due to technological complexity, overwhelming data volume, and interoperability issues. Gartner predicts that by 2026, at least 50% of edge computing deployments will involve machine learning. AI algorithms are well-suited for the data-rich environments of edge computing, enabling quick and accurate analysis of vast data sets. Integrating AI allows edge devices to independently process and act on collected data without constant communication with a central server. This integration enhances decision-making speed, crucial for applications like real-time inventory management or industrial equipment calibration. ', 'According to Expert Market Research, the global edge computing market is anticipated to grow significantly from $15.54 billion in 2023 to $147.38 billion by 2032, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28.4% during the forecast period of 2024-2032. This growth is attributed to the rise of autonomous vehicles, connected car networks, and the demand for lightweight frameworks and applications to enhance edge computing efficiency, creating numerous market opportunities. PwC expects the global market for edge data centers to nearly triple, reaching $13.5 billion in 2024 from $4 billion in 2017. This growth is driven by the potential of locally located data centers to reduce latency, address intermittent connections, and enable data storage and computation in close proximity to end-users. Edge data centers are growing in popularity due to several key trends. The introduction of 5G is a big factor, as these smaller decentralized centers support high-density 5G applications with low costs and latency, especially in smart-city scenarios. Similarly, the increasing use of IoT devices requires quick data processing at the edge to handle the growing amount of information from sensors in homes and industries. Moreover, the adoption of software-defined networking and virtualization technologies allows software to replace expensive hardware in data centers. Lastly, the demand for video streaming and AR/VR is met by these cost-effective edge data centers, reducing latency and providing good performance for users.', 'Read also: Top 15 Edge Computing Companies in the World', ""On January 5, 2024, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) disclosed that it is partnering with American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), a global digital infrastructure provider, to accelerate the deployment of a hybrid, multi-cloud computing platform at the edge.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Marathon Petroleum's  ROE."", ""ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Marathon Petroleum ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Marathon Petroleum is:', '36% = US$11b ÷ US$31b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.36."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""First thing first, we like that Marathon Petroleum has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 21% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Under the circumstances, Marathon Petroleum's considerable five year net income growth of 49% was to be expected."", ""Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Marathon Petroleum's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 37% in the same period, which is great to see."", ""Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is MPC fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", 'Marathon Petroleum has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 11%, meaning that it has the remaining 89% left over to reinvest into its business. So it looks like Marathon Petroleum is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.', ""Moreover, Marathon Petroleum is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 28% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 22%) over the same period."", ""On the whole, we feel that Marathon Petroleum's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

We have also discussed the fluctuating unemployment rates in the EU zone in 2023. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 European Countries with the Highest Unemployment Rates.\xa0', 'In November 2023, the unemployment rates in Europe continued their downward trend, with the euro area at 6.4% and the EU at 5.9%. These figures represent a decline from the previous month and the same period in 2022. Eurostat data showed a decrease in the number of unemployed persons in both the EU and the euro area compared to October 2023 and November 2022, with 12.954 million individuals unemployed in the EU and 10.970 million in the euro area.', 'Youth unemployment remained a concern, with 2.814 million young people unemployed in the EU, of which 2.321 million were in the euro area. Although the youth unemployment rate decreased slightly from the previous month, it saw an increase compared to November 2022. Unemployment rates for men and women showed slight variations, with women experiencing a slightly higher unemployment rate in both the EU and the euro area. It is worth noting that Luxembourg and Austria are countries with the low unemployment rates in Europe.\xa0', 'During our research, we also observed the intricate dynamics of job creation and unemployment rates in Southern Europe, particularly in Portugal, Greece, Spain, and Italy. Despite a noticeable decrease in unemployment figures over the past decade, the underlying issues of job insecurity and low wages persist. Portugal, for instance, experienced a remarkable economic turnaround, with its unemployment rate dropping from a peak of 17.9% in 2013 to 6.6% by the end of 2023. Similarly, Greece saw a significant decrease from 27% in 2014 to below 10% presently. Italy recorded the creation of 456,000 jobs between 2022 and 2023, contributing to a decreased unemployment rate of 7.2% in December 2023. Spain also witnessed a noteworthy drop in unemployment, despite regional disparities, with the creation of 783,000 jobs in 2023.\xa0', ""However, despite these positive trends, challenges such as regional disparities and inadequate training persist as there are disparities in unemployment rates across regions, such as 6.3% in Spain's Basque Country compared to 17.6% in Andalusia. Additionally, a major proportion of the population lacks adequate education, with over 35% of individuals in Portugal, Italy, Spain, and Greece having an education level below the baccalaureate. Furthermore, job insecurity remains prevalent, compounded by the acceptance of low wages. It is worth highlighting that Malta was the country with the lowest unemployment rate in Europe in 2023.\xa0"", 'While unemployment rates continue to fluctuate, key employers in Europe like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) are actively participating in the region to improve the economic and technological landscape in these countries.\xa0', 'For example, in response to the growing demand for cloud infrastructure in Europe, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is making major investments to expand its capabilities. This expansion includes bolstering infrastructure at both new and existing data centres, incorporating cutting-edge AI accelerators from industry leaders like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD, and optimizing networking and storage solutions for enhanced performance. With over 60 datacenter regions worldwide, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) boasts the largest global cloud footprint, ensuring that businesses can access high-capacity networking infrastructure while adhering to data residency and compliance requirements.', ""Europe's dynamic economic landscape necessitates a robust cloud infrastructure that supports global scalability. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) investments in key European regions such as the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Germany underscore its commitment to providing customers with the necessary tools to harness the power of the cloud. These strategic expansions not only cater to burgeoning demand but also align with Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\xa0 sustainability goals, incorporating eco-friendly practices like free air cooling and renewable energy sources."", 'Choosing the right cloud architecture is pivotal for organizations embarking on their digital transformation journey. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure offers a plethora of regions worldwide, allowing customers to optimize costs, meet regulatory requirements, and achieve business growth seamlessly. Leveraging frameworks like the Cloud Adoption Framework and the Well Architected Framework empowers organizations to build reliable, secure, and performant workloads while maximizing the value of their investment in Azure infrastructure.\xa0', 'On the other hand, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is making a bold return to the European market with the launch of its electric Cadillac, the Lyriq SUV. After maintaining a low profile in the region for several years, the automaker has announced that it will start taking orders for the battery electric Lyriq in Switzerland, with deliveries expected to commence in the first half of 2024. Over the next couple of years, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) plans to introduce electric models in Sweden, France, and three additional European countries. This move marks a major shift for General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), which previously only imported a small number of vehicles into Europe and sold off its Opel and Vauxhall brands in 2017 to what is now Stellantis.', ""The Lyriq, powered by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)’s Ultium batteries with an impressive estimated range of 530km per charge, will be priced competitively, starting at CHF82,000 (US$89,705), comparable to premium German electric SUVs. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)\xa0 intends to sell its Cadillac EVs directly to European consumers through its websites and flagship stores, including one in downtown Zurich, importing the models from its US plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee. With plans to offer a complete range of fully electric models in Europe by the end of the decade, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is set to make a huge impact on the region's electric vehicle market."", 'FEMA/ Michael Raphael', 'To list the 17 European countries with the highest rates of unemployment, we utilized the unemployment rates provided by the World Bank, ensuring that the list is based on reliable and objective statistics. The unemployment rates were acquired from World Bank data for the year 2022, for all 17 European countries.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

Similarly, unemployment rose to 7.4% in Q3 2023 from 7.2% in Q2 2023, a concerning development blamed on the sluggish global economy. Analysts predict a gradual increase to 7.8% by 2025.

Authors suggest that while Sweden's labor force grew by an average of 1.1% annually over the past decade, it will decline to 0.3% in the future due to lower demographic growth and shifts in the age composition of the population."", 'It is one of the countries where its easy for Americans to find a job.\xa0', 'Unemployment Rate: 8.1%', ""In Italy, four out of five individuals from the youth consider emigration due to bleak prospects. Despite a drop in youth unemployment from 42.7% in 2014 to 21% in 2023, reforms like the Jobs Act failed to alleviate their plight.

And now Ford, GM, and even Tesla are warning about the slumping demand continuing into 2024.', 'Trump’s desire to see more “alternatives” is already happening because of this, with Ford pivoting deeper into its hybrids — the Maverick pickup and F-150 hybrids chief among them — and reports that GM is looking to add hybrids to its product portfolio ASAP. (It currently only has one: the Corvette E-Ray.)', 'Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares told Yahoo Finance at a roundtable meeting last month that the automaker was already game-planning for either a Trump or a Biden election win, with “multi-energy platforms” that can accommodate both fully electric or a more traditional gas-powered option with the same model. The upcoming Dodge Charger muscle car is an example of that strategy with two powertrains.', 'As for Tesla, going the hybrid route is not a possibility. But CEO Elon Musk still has a friend in the former president, at least for now.', '“I’ve been friendly with him over the years, I’ve helped [him] when I was president; I’ve liked him,” Trump said when asked about Musk and a meeting he had with the Tesla CEO at Mar-a-Lago this past weekend. “We obviously have opposing views on a minor subject I’ll call electric cars.”', 'Whether Trump carves out some kind of special treatment for his friend Musk or maintains the EV tax credit for fully electric vehicles like those made in the US by Tesla is anyone’s guess, but that scenario looks less and less likely as November approaches.', 'Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

314,dcb39d5b-0794-35e4-960f-509287ad5c92,GM,2024-03-12,4 Low Price-to-Cash Flow Stocks to Garner Superior Returns,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-low-price-cash-flow-115500120.html,1710158100,STORY,"['GM', 'AMG', 'UNM']","['We always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless blessed with Midas touch. When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style to be one of the most effective approaches. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that have good things going on for them, even at a time when they have been beaten down by some external factors.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis — the lower the number, the better. General Motors Company GM, Unum Group UNM, Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. AMG and Corebridge Financial, Inc. CRBG boast a low P/CF ratio.', 'Questions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.', ""An investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and also consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening.General Motors, which designs, builds and sells cars, trucks, crossovers and automobile parts globally, carries a Zacks Rank #2.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growth stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Kings To Invest In For Safe Dividend Growth.\xa0', ""Dividend stocks are investors’ favorites, particularly ones that demonstrate a capacity to raise their dividend payments over an extended period. Dividend kings stand out in this regard as these companies have increased their payouts for 50 consecutive years or more. This indicates that numerous companies are inclined to regularly increase their dividends due to investors' preferences. One of the main reasons for this growth is the strong cash position of many high-quality companies. As reported by Harvard Business Review, non-banking U.S. companies have substantially boosted their cash reserves, reaching a staggering $6.9 trillion, exceeding the GDP of nearly all countries worldwide. Despite rising interest rates, cash holdings now constitute a significant portion, with $1 out of every $5 in total assets held by non-banking U.S. firms."", 'When investing in dividend stocks, investors are often faced with the dilemma of dividend yields and dividend growth. Analysts advise not to fall for yield traps and consider stocks that offer yields between 3% to 4%. Yields above this range may sometimes signal that the dividend payout is unsustainable or that the company is facing challenges. Brian Bollinger, president of Simply Safe Dividends, spoke with CNBC about ideal dividend yields and their significance. He suggested focusing on excellent businesses that could offer a dividend yield of around 3% to 4%. He explained that these companies tend to increase their dividend payments consistently, which helps increase yearly income and counteract the impact of inflation. Here are some other comments from the analyst:', '“When stock prices fall, it’s so easy to panic, but dividend investing can overcome that because you’re just trying to stay focused on your income stream. You don’t care so much about the market’s short-term ups and downs anymore.”', 'S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has shown strong returns over the years, outperforming other asset classes despite market conditions. A ProShares report has presented a rather interesting take on investing in the index, particularly for income investors. The report mentioned that the index has consistently surpassed the performance of the S&P 500 while experiencing reduced levels of market volatility since its inception. This could mean that an initial investment of $10,000 made in May 2005 could potentially grow to over $61,000 by March 2023. The report further mentioned that the Dividend Aristocrats Index has demonstrated superior performance compared to the S&P 500 in eight out of the ten most significant quarterly downturns since 2005.', ""In 2023, dividend stocks encountered a phase of weaker performance due to a notable rise in yields, largely driven by the Federal Reserve's successive interest rate hikes. Nonetheless, expectations suggest a change in the outlook for income investing in 2024. Analysts at Lord Abbett predict that as the economy slows down, companies with solid balance sheets, good cash flow, and durable dividends will do better. Some of the best dividend kings include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). These companies have a long-standing history of consistently increasing their dividends over many years.

You can skip our detailed analysis of NASDAQ stocks and the performance of dividend stocks over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy.\xa0', ""The NASDAQ, which primarily consists of technology-related stocks, has been experiencing upward momentum since the previous year. In 2023, it saw remarkable growth, achieving its strongest performance since 2020 with an increase of over 43%. As of March 7, it has gained 10.21%, surpassing the broader market's gain of 8.72% this year so far. Notably, according to Jonathan Krinsky, a leading market analyst at BTIG, the NASDAQ-100, which is heavily concentrated in tech, has endured 303 consecutive trading sessions without experiencing a decline of 2.5% or more as of March 5, marking it as the third-longest period without such a significant pullback since 1990. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of the best dividend stocks listed on the index."", ""The impressive performance of NASDAQ can be largely attributed to the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, which has driven up the prices of major technology stocks and boosted the overall market throughout 2023 and into the current year. Additionally, the easing of inflation and the Federal Reserve's indication of potential rate cuts later in 2024 have further supported NASDAQ's rebound from the challenges it faced in 2022. Despite the prevalence of technology companies in the NASDAQ index, many companies offer dividends to shareholders. A notable recent addition to the list of dividend-paying companies in the index is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), which made headlines in February of this year by declaring its inaugural dividend. This move marks a significant milestone for the technology sector, which has long been dominated by a select few companies for more than a decade."", ""Meta's decision to offer a dividend serves as evidence that investors are increasingly interested in dividend-paying stocks for their capacity to provide consistent and reliable income. This trend was evident in 2023 when companies in the US distributed record dividends to their shareholders. According to a report by Janus Henderson, the S&P 500 paid out an all-time high of $70.30 per share last year, a notable increase from $66.92 in 2022. This resulted in a total payment to shareholders reaching a record $588.2 billion, surpassing the previous year's figure of $564.6 billion. The report also mentioned that there were 707 instances of dividend increases reported in the fourth quarter of 2023. These increases amounted to a total of $17.5 billion for the quarter, showing an uptick from the $16.3 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022."", ""Furthermore, dividend-paying stocks have historically delivered robust returns. Since 1960, dividends have contributed to approximately one-third of the market's total return. Dividend stocks offer a degree of stability during periods of increased market volatility. According to a report by Perkins Coie, a Washington-based law firm, dividend-paying stocks exhibit 30%-33% lower volatility compared to non-dividend-paying stocks. This stability has been particularly notable during turbulent decades like the 1930s and 2000s, where dividend-paying stocks served as a buffer against significant declines in market prices. In addition to this, dividend-paying companies that consistently increase their dividends can provide better protection against inflation than bonds in an inflationary environment."", 'In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks listed on NASDAQ.', 'Photo by nick chong on Unsplash', 'Our Methodology:', 'For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 933 hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2023 and selected companies that are trading on the NASDAQ exchange and also pay dividends to shareholders.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Royal Caribbean Cruises' (NYSE:RCL) returns on capital, so let's have a look."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business.

Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 11%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 25%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers."", ""In summary, it's great to see that Royal Caribbean Cruises can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers.

That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Royal Caribbean imply an improvement in the company's underlying business.

We think this is generally an attractive combination, as dividends can grow through a combination of earnings growth and or a higher payout ratio over time."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Ross Stores has delivered an average of 16% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."", ""From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Ross Stores? Earnings per share growth has been growing somewhat, and Ross Stores is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends. This is interesting for a few reasons, as it suggests management may be reinvesting heavily in the business, but it also provides room to increase the dividend in time. We would prefer to see earnings growing faster, but the best dividend stocks over the long term typically combine significant earnings per share growth with a low payout ratio, and Ross Stores is halfway there. There's a lot to like about Ross Stores, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it."", 'Wondering what the future holds for Ross Stores?

You can skip our detailed analysis of NASDAQ stocks and the performance of dividend stocks over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy.\xa0', ""The NASDAQ, which primarily consists of technology-related stocks, has been experiencing upward momentum since the previous year. In 2023, it saw remarkable growth, achieving its strongest performance since 2020 with an increase of over 43%. As of March 7, it has gained 10.21%, surpassing the broader market's gain of 8.72% this year so far. Notably, according to Jonathan Krinsky, a leading market analyst at BTIG, the NASDAQ-100, which is heavily concentrated in tech, has endured 303 consecutive trading sessions without experiencing a decline of 2.5% or more as of March 5, marking it as the third-longest period without such a significant pullback since 1990. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of the best dividend stocks listed on the index."", ""The impressive performance of NASDAQ can be largely attributed to the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, which has driven up the prices of major technology stocks and boosted the overall market throughout 2023 and into the current year. Additionally, the easing of inflation and the Federal Reserve's indication of potential rate cuts later in 2024 have further supported NASDAQ's rebound from the challenges it faced in 2022. Despite the prevalence of technology companies in the NASDAQ index, many companies offer dividends to shareholders. A notable recent addition to the list of dividend-paying companies in the index is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), which made headlines in February of this year by declaring its inaugural dividend. This move marks a significant milestone for the technology sector, which has long been dominated by a select few companies for more than a decade."", ""Meta's decision to offer a dividend serves as evidence that investors are increasingly interested in dividend-paying stocks for their capacity to provide consistent and reliable income. This trend was evident in 2023 when companies in the US distributed record dividends to their shareholders. According to a report by Janus Henderson, the S&P 500 paid out an all-time high of $70.30 per share last year, a notable increase from $66.92 in 2022. This resulted in a total payment to shareholders reaching a record $588.2 billion, surpassing the previous year's figure of $564.6 billion. The report also mentioned that there were 707 instances of dividend increases reported in the fourth quarter of 2023. These increases amounted to a total of $17.5 billion for the quarter, showing an uptick from the $16.3 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022."", ""Furthermore, dividend-paying stocks have historically delivered robust returns. Since 1960, dividends have contributed to approximately one-third of the market's total return. Dividend stocks offer a degree of stability during periods of increased market volatility. According to a report by Perkins Coie, a Washington-based law firm, dividend-paying stocks exhibit 30%-33% lower volatility compared to non-dividend-paying stocks. This stability has been particularly notable during turbulent decades like the 1930s and 2000s, where dividend-paying stocks served as a buffer against significant declines in market prices. In addition to this, dividend-paying companies that consistently increase their dividends can provide better protection against inflation than bonds in an inflationary environment."", 'In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks listed on NASDAQ.', 'Photo by nick chong on Unsplash', 'Our Methodology:', 'For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 933 hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2023 and selected companies that are trading on the NASDAQ exchange and also pay dividends to shareholders.

(NYSE:PFE), and The Proctor and Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are all performing exceptionally well.\xa0', 'These firms have been able to withstand inflationary pressures and emerge stronger than ever from the crisis of the past two years. Generally, the three firms mentioned above are considered safe stocks for a retirement portfolio since they have established businesses, a solid track record of dividend payouts, and a steady growth profile. Joaquin Duato, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), recently gave an insight into the future plans of his company, at the fourth quarter earnings call, that might be of interest to investors.', '“As we look ahead, I have never been more excited about the future of our business. At our enterprise business review, we shared that we expect our innovative medicine business to grow 5% to 7% from 2025 to 2030 with our industry-leading pipeline and portfolio delivering more than 10 assets that have the potential to generate over $5 billion in peak year sales by 2030. We also expect a further 15 assets to have the potential for $1 billion to $5 billion in peak year sales. In 2024, we expect data readouts for many of these assets, including Phase 3 trials for Tremfya in IBD; Erleada in early stage prostate cancer; our targeted oral peptide, JNJ-2113 in psoriasis; nipocalimab in myasthenia gravis; as well as aticaprant and seltorexant in major depressive disorder.', ""We also expect Phase 2 readouts for our combination therapy guselkumab and golimumab, JNJ-4804, in psoriatic arthritis; nipocalimab in Sjogren's disease; and TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. In medtech, we shared that we expect to grow at the upper range of our markets, which are anticipated to grow by 5% to 7% between 2022 and 2027. And that by 2027, we expect one-third of our revenue to be generated by new products.

The ""enemy"" of financial stocks is recessions. Financial companies are cyclical and usually rely on economic growth to expand their bottom lines. If select money-based metrics and predictive indicators are accurate, the U.S. economy could dip into a recession later this year, which would almost certainly curb spending and reduce the number of aggregate transactions by consumers and businesses.', 'However, it makes a lot of statistical sense to remain optimistic about the U.S. economy. Whereas three-quarters of all recessions since 1945 have resolved in under a year, the bulk of expansions over the same stretch have stuck around for multiple years, if not a full decade. Businesses like Visa are ideally positioned to take advantage of the natural expansion of the U.S. and global economy over time.', 'On a more company-specific level, Visa is the undisputed leader in credit card network purchase volume in the United States. It holds a nearly 42% share and was the only one of the major payment processors to enjoy significant share expansion following the Great Recession.', ""Furthermore, it has a lengthy runway to expand its payment infrastructure into overseas markets. Africa, Southeastern Asia, and the Middle East remain largely underbanked, and cross-border volume has been Visa's fastest source of consistent payment growth."", ""The final piece of the puzzle for Visa is that it's strictly remained a payment processor. During recessions, lending institutions have to set aside capital to cover loan delinquencies and potential loan losses. Since Visa doesn't lend, it has superior financial flexibility and few profit margin headwinds."", 'A second awe-inspiring growth stock you\'ll regret not scooping up with the Nasdaq in a relatively young bull market is furniture company Lovesac (NASDAQ: LOVE). Yes, I did just use ""furniture company"" and ""growth stock"" in the same sentence.', ""Generally speaking, the furniture industry is slow-growing, highly cyclical, and dependent on foot traffic into brick-and-mortar stores. It's an industry that's been ripe for disruption for a long time... and Lovesac has answered the call."", 'The most front-and-center differentiating factor for Lovesac is its furniture. Nearly 90% of the company\'s net sales trace back to its ""sactionals"" -- modular couches that can be rearranged dozens of ways to fit most living spaces. The yarn used in sactionals is made from recycled plastic water bottles, which speaks to the eco-friendliness of the product. Meanwhile, sactionals have more than 200 different cover choices, which ensures they\'ll match the color or theme of any room.', ""In addition to functionality, optionality, and eco-friendliness, Lovesac's price points provide a competitive edge. With the ability to add wireless charging and surround sound, sactionals tend to be pricier than traditional sectional couches. But this is precisely what management wants. Lovesac's targeted customer tends to have a higher income, and is therefore less likely to alter their spending habits during periods of minor economic disruption."", ""Lovesac's omnichannel sales platform is another reason for its success. Though it does have physical stores in 40 states, the company leans on its online presence, popup showrooms, and select brand-name partnerships to keep its inventory levels under control and lower its overhead expenses. The result has been superior margins among furniture stocks."", 'Lovesac looks to be a steal at 10 times forward-year earnings.', ""The third striking growth stock you'll wish you'd purchased during the early stages of the Nasdaq bull market is semiconductor stock Intel (NASDAQ: INTC)."", ""If there's a knock against Intel, it's the company's historic reliance on legacy central processing units (CPUs). With seemingly every investor focused on artificial intelligence (AI) at the moment, the slower growth rates and highly cyclical sales trajectory of CPUs in personal computers (PCs) has dragged on the performance of Intel's stock."", ""On the other hand, Intel's legacy segments are still cash cows. Even after losing some of its CPU market share in data centers and PCs to chief rival Advanced Micro Devices, Intel remains the dominant provider of CPUs for PCs. The cash Intel generates from these segments can be reinvested in higher-growth initiatives for the company."", ""One of these intriguing opportunities happens to be in AI. Intel unveiled its Gaudi3 AI chip in December, with the goal of rolling it out to customers in 2024. Gaudi3 will compete with Nvidia's flagship H100 graphics processing unit (GPU), which is used in AI-accelerated data centers to power generative AI software."", ""Intel is also diversifying its revenue stream by meaningfully expanding its foundry services segment. It plans to open two chip fabrication plants in Ohio by 2026 or 2027, as well as one in Germany in the latter half of the decade. By 2030, Intel could grow into the world's No. 2 foundry."", 'Despite being a stalwart among chipmakers, Intel is most definitely a growth stock. Between 2023 and 2027, earnings per share is expected to catapult from a reported $1.05 to an estimated $4.44.', ""A fourth awe-inspiring growth stock you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market is none other than social media titan Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)."", ""Similar to Visa, recessions tend to be Meta's biggest concern. Last year, nearly 98% of its $134.9 billion in total sales could be traced back to advertising. It's common for businesses to reduce their ad spending when the U.S. economy weakens or offers hints of weakness to come. Thankfully, periods of economic expansion last substantially longer than recessions, which allows ad-driven businesses to thrive."", ""Meta's foundational operating segment is its basket of leading social media sites. Facebook is the world's most visited social destination, with 3.07 billion monthly active users (MAUs). Adding in other highly popular sites, including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Threads, Meta's family of apps attracted just shy of 4 billion MAUs during the December-ended quarter. Since Meta provides businesses with access to more eyeballs than any other social platform, it's often able to command strong ad-pricing power."", ""Another reason investors can be confident about Meta Platforms' future is its superior cash position and cash flow. The company closed out 2023 with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which comes atop the $71.1 billion generated in net cash from operating activities for the year. Meta's cash-cow advertising platform allows the company to take risks that few other companies can afford to."", ""One of the growth initiatives CEO Mark Zuckerberg is especially excited about is the development of augmented/virtual reality devices, as well as supporting almost anything to do with the metaverse. Though Meta's Reality Labs segment is losing money hand over fist, Zuckerberg is positioning his company to be an on ramp to 3D virtual environments by the latter half of the decade."", ""Last but not least, Meta Platforms is still cheap. Despite more than quintupling from its 2022 bear market low, shares can be purchased for less than 14 times forward-year cash flow, which represents a modest discount from the company's average multiple to cash flow over the trailing-five-year period."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

UBS strategists expect this trend to persist, citing recent data and a favorable macroeconomic environment. The rally is supported by robust labor market strength and GDP growth, which surpassed expectations. UBS sees potential for further gains, especially if a ""Goldilocks"" economic scenario unfolds, where strong US growth and low inflation allow for aggressive rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The market is already pricing in such cuts, and UBS remains optimistic about the stock market outlook.', 'The 2024 stock market rally is gaining momentum as investors assess whether recent economic data will impact the Federal Reserve\'s anticipated interest rate cuts. There is growing optimism that the Fed will achieve a soft landing for the U.S. economy. Companies are effectively managing rising costs and historically high interest rates, with fourth quarter earnings surpassing expectations. March is expected to focus on inflation, interest rates, and the labor market. Rob Swanke, a senior equity strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network, expects the first Fed rate cut to occur in June. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in a February ""60 Minutes"" interview, acknowledged that the Fed\'s monetary policy tightening might cause some discomfort but emphasized the need for confidence in controlling inflation before interest rate cuts.\xa0', 'The stock market has had an exceptional beginning in 2024, witnessing frequent record highs as investors eagerly engage in the surge driven by artificial intelligence, particularly in companies like Nvidia and Microsoft. Bank of America highlighted the significance of a technical indicator signaling an ""overbought"" market condition, where stocks trade above fair value. This indicator has been active for four months and may play a crucial role in determining whether the bullish momentum in equities will continue throughout the rest of the year. In cases where the indicator remains ""overbought"" for an entire calendar year, the S&P 500 has seen positive returns 100% of the time, with average and median returns at 19.0% and 16.8%, respectively. However, there were average and median pullbacks of 6.4% and 6.9% during those years. Conversely, when the S&P 500 is initially overbought in January but later loses this status on a monthly closing basis, the market becomes more unpredictable and less robust, especially when the indicator remains out of ""overbought"" for three consecutive months or more.', 'BofA analysts commented:\xa0', '""A persistent overbought above -20 on the 28-month Williams %R is a bullish overbought for the S&P 500 (SPX).

Over the past year, the energy major has seen its stock price decline more than 10% compared with the S&P 500's increase of 21%.The supermajor – with 60% liquids-weighted production – is highly exposed to the perils of oil price fluctuations. The drop in downstream segment earnings as a fallout of lower margins is a concern too while reserve replacement ratio remains weak, indicating challenges in replenishing produced energy.Moreover, it has been experiencing an increase in costs as a percentage of revenue. Finally, Chevron has been a laggard compared to its European peers to jump into the clean energy bandwagon. Considering these factors, the company is unlikely to return to favor anytime soon.

Amid the company's dominance in artificial intelligence (AI)-ready chips and the insatiable demand for the technology, its stock has risen by close to 300% over the last 12 months."", ""With the stock approaching $1,000 per share, investors may wonder whether a stock split is imminent. Despite the fact that such a move will not directly influence Nvidia's valuation, investors should expect one soon. Here's why."", 'The history of Nvidia stock is arguably the most compelling reason for expecting a near-term split. The company has split its stock five times since 2000, one of which has occurred since AI and data centers renewed investor interest in GPUs.', ""That previous split occurred on July 19, 2021, when Nvidia carried out a 4-for-1 stock split. Interestingly, it closed at a pre-split price of around $744 per share that day, a level lower than today's current price."", ""Still, investors should remember that these gains came quickly, as Nvidia stock is up about 85% this year and nearly 30% over the last month alone, indicating that a need for a split could have caught the company's board off guard."", ""Moreover, the most significant question surrounding a split is likely where the company will set the split ratio. The most recent 4-for-1 split was the largest ratio in the company's history, with the company having approved three 2-for-1 splits and one 3-for-2 split in the 2000s."", 'However, as mentioned before, the more recent growth has probably exceeded expectations. While future growth may not match the 126% revenue increase in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31), analysts forecast 81% revenue growth in fiscal 2025 and 22% the next fiscal year, indicating the massive profit increases should continue for the foreseeable future.', ""That could possibly mean the stock price is not done rising. Conversely, slowing growth could soon dampen enthusiasm for the stock, and the company's board will have to consider the massive drops in the stock price in past years. Hence, the company has to be ready for any potential price movement when it decides the split ratio."", 'Investors may want also to consider another possible factor -- inclusion as one of the 30 stocks making up the Dow Jones Industrial Average.', 'The S&P Dow Jones Indices, operated by S&P Global, has not telegraphed any intention to add Nvidia to the Dow 30. Also, the index already includes two semiconductor stocks, Apple and Intel.', ""However, Intel has struggled in recent years, increasing the chances of its removal. Also, AI's influence over the economy could lead to more tech stocks in the index, and Nvidia's $2.2 trillion market cap makes it a likely choice."", ""Furthermore, the Dow 30 is a price-weighted index. Since the nominal share price determines a stock's weighting on the Dow, companies have often initiated stock splits to reduce their influence over the index. Should Nvidia seek a place on the Dow 30, it may alter the split ratio to increase its chances of inclusion."", ""Given the company's history of stock splits, investors should expect such a move sooner rather than later. Also, since the previous split occurred less than three years ago at a lower price, the split ratio is likely the most significant question surrounding such a move."", ""Indeed, Nvidia's board will need to consider the stock's price history in deciding the ratio, both in a positive and negative sense. Also, assuming Nvidia seeks to become a Dow 30 stock, it will have to become more sensitive to its nominal share price."", ""Ultimately, the stock split changes nothing for Nvidia on the surface. However, given the company's history, shareholders should anticipate a split and, possibly, increased interest in the stock from some unexpected parties."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

In reality, 3iQ Corp's director of research, Mark Connors, expects the price of Bitcoin to reach the $100,000 mark before the halving event, which is expected around Apr 20."", ""So, what's propelling the price of Bitcoin higher? Of course, the halving event will act as a boon for the price of Bitcoin. This is because the supply of Bitcoin is lowered during the halving event, eventually leading to an uptick in price. During the halving event, the supply of Bitcoin has a cap of 21 million."", 'However, the price of Bitcoin has already started to gain momentum as its investor base has broadened since Bitcoin ETFs began trading on Jan 11. There was already optimism among crypto market aficionados after the regulator approved 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs in January.', ""Those 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a net inflow of $7 billion combined from mid-Jan through the end of February, per data from Morningstar Direct. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust witnessed the highest inflow, per Dow Jones Market Data."", ""The Federal Reserve's dovish stance is also partly responsible for lifting the price of Bitcoin. The Fed has kept its interest rates unchanged in its latest policy meeting and expects to trim rates later this year. Notably, higher interest rates are bottlenecks for Bitcoin as it weighs on high-risk assets like digital coins."", ""Hence, it makes sense for astute investors to place bets on stocks that are well-positioned to capitalize on the price of Bitcoin's present upsurge.

There's a lot of times in February and March have some big films before 2020, when the box office would do pretty well in the first quarter.

Two years ago, right around now, you had a brand new Batman film opening. And it opened right after Omicron was happening.', 'And people still came out to over $130 million opening weekend. Now, this last weekend, we had Dune Part 2, $82.5 million. Nothing to sneeze at. More than double what the first dune made.', ""And so with the right content, people are coming out. One of the problems is that because of the strikes, a lot of the supply line has been delayed. And so we don't have as many films out there and ready to go. Right now in the first half of the year first quarter of the year that we normally do."", ""So there's a lack of volume in the marketplace right now that will get corrected by the time we reach the second quarter into the summer when you have a lot more films coming out.

Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad."", ""So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Under Armour (NYSE:UAA). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing."", ' See our latest analysis for Under Armour ', 'If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Recognition must be given to the that Under Armour has grown EPS by 48% per year, over the last three years. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but it should be more than enough to pique the interest of the wary stock pickers.', ""Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Under Armour reported flat revenue and EBIT margins over the last year. That's not bad, but it doesn't point to ongoing future growth, either."", 'In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.', ""While we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Under Armour?"", ""It's pleasing to see company leaders with putting their money on the line, so to speak, because it increases alignment of incentives between the people running the business, and its true owners. So it is good to see that Under Armour insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$467m. That equates to 13% of the company, making insiders powerful and aligned with other shareholders. Looking very optimistic for investors."", ""Under Armour's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching Under Armour very closely. Once you've identified a business you like, the next step is to consider what you think it's worth. And right now is your chance to view our exclusive discounted cashflow valuation of Under Armour. You might benefit from giving it a glance today."", 'While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.', 'Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.', 'Have feedback on this article?

However, I believe cuts could materialize in the second quarter or sometime thereafter. Regardless of the exact timing, consensus holds that rates will fall at some point this year. As details on the pace and scale of cuts emerge, investors can position themselves accordingly by looking into these rate cut stocks.', 'In my view, one smart approach is to buy stocks in companies hampered by high rates, but poised to thrive when the cost of capital declines. Many profitable firms are having trouble expanding margins amid lofty interest expenses. Additionally, debt loads seem disproportionately burdensome when rates spike, worrying investors. With cuts on the way, these companies could see earnings and valuation multiples expand.', 'We can also target sectors known to lag in high-rate environments but lead when the tide turns.

The company delivered nearly three times as many vehicles versus last year, mainly led by surging demand for Li Auto’s large, premium SUVs. Quarterly profit also doubled YOY and hit $810 million, capping a standout 2023 where Li Auto generated its first-ever annual profit.', 'Bullishly looking ahead, management issued rosy guidance for 2024 in its recent earnings report. In addition, Li Auto plans to launch five brand new models this year, targeting up to 800,000 total vehicles sold. The company continued making progress in expanding its vehicle margins. Li Auto secured a strong vehicle margin of 22.7% — evidence that many other EV startups are failing to expand margins like Li can.', 'Li Auto confirmed in late December 2023 that it will start making deliveries of its newest electric vehicle product, the Li Mega multipurpose vehicle, in March 2024. When the company first unveiled the Li Mega EV at the Guangzhou Auto Show last year, Li Auto said the EV would cost consumers less than 600,000 Chinese Yuan ($84,500) and that it already received 10,000 reservations within the first two hours of reservations opening.', 'I am very bullish about Li Auto’s prospects, expecting it to accelerate much further in the quarters ahead. While Li Auto does not sell many vehicles in the U.S. yet, it can make significant inroads into European countries soon.

This household name wields tremendous global reach and has delivered consistent revenue and profit growth, bouncing back strongly from its post-Covid-19cooldown.', 'However, Wall Street fixates on one metric here — active user counts. While that tally has stagnated and recently turned negative, I don’t view it as a big enough problem to justify bargain basement pricing over the past two years.

Earnings also came in well below the year-ago profit of $1.25.The underperformance can be attributed to lower Brent prices and rising pre-salt lifting costs that resulted in weak upstream profitability, plus higher refining outlay.Recurring net income, which strips one-time items, came in at $8,288 million compared with $8,322 million a year earlier. Petrobras’ adjusted EBITDA fell to $13,470 million from $13,903 million a year ago.The Brazil's state-run energy giant reported revenues of $27,107 million, which plunged 10.2% from the year-earlier sales of $30,171 million but topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26,454 million on strong production.While PBR plans to shell out RMB 14.2 billion or roughly $2.9 billion in total year-end payouts, the company did not pay special dividends for the full year, which disappointed investors.Coming back to earnings, let's take a deeper look at the recent performances of PBR’s two main segments: Upstream (Exploration & Production) and Downstream (or Refining, Transportation and Marketing)."", 'Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras Quote', ""Upstream: The Rio de Janeiro-headquartered company’s average oil and gas production during the fourth quarter reached 2,935 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d) — 81% liquids — up from 2,646 MBOE/d in the same period of 2022.Compared with the year-ago quarter, Brazilian oil and natural gas production — constituting approximately 99% of the total output — increased 11.1% to 2,901 MBOE/d. The upside primarily reflected the ramp-up of certain offshore platforms in the Itapu and the Búzios fields.In the October to December period, the average sales price of oil (or the average Brent crude price) dropped 5.3% year over year to $84.05 per barrel. However, the decrease in crude prices was more than offset by the improvement in production, thereby having a positive effect on upstream unit sales. Overall, the segment’s revenues improved to $18,506 million in the quarter under review from $16,973 million in the year-ago period.But as far as the bottom line is concerned, an uptick in pre-salt lifting costs (which rose 7.5% from the year-ago period to $6.13 per barrel) meant that the upstream unit recorded a net income of $4,734 million, down 17.7% from fourth-quarter 2022 earnings of $5,751 million.Downstream (or Refining, Transportation and Marketing): Revenues from the segment totaled $25,278 million, 8.2% lower than the year-ago figure of $27,542 million due to a decline in domestic sales volumes. Petrobras' downstream unit recorded a profit of $711 million, which compared unfavorably with earnings of $1,474 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Apart from volume issues, the dip was due to higher unit refining costs."", 'During the period, Petrobras’ sales, general and administrative expenses were $1,783 million, 6.8% higher than the year-ago quarter. Selling expenses also rose from $1,293 million a year ago to $1,329 million. Moreover, surging ‘other expenses’ and an impairment loss of $2,198 million led to a $3,172 million increase in total operating expenses.The jump in costs and lower revenues meant that PBR reported an operating income of $8,022 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with $11,119 million a year ago.', 'During the three months ended Dec 31, 2023, Petrobras’ capital investments and expenditures (excluding signature bonus) totaled $3,558 million compared with $2,876 million in the prior-year quarter.Importantly, the company generated a positive free cash flow for the 35th consecutive quarter, with the metric coming in at $8,073 million, which, however, dropped from $9,280 million recorded in last year’s corresponding period.At the end of 2023, Petrobras had a net debt of $44,698 million, up from $41,516 million a year ago and $43,725 million as of Sep 30, 2023. The company ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $12,727 million.Meanwhile, Petrobras’ net debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA ratio deteriorated to 0.85 from 0.63 in the previous year.

The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it.

However, certain companies and industries should be able to withstand the pressure better than others. In particular, consumer staples stocks to buy offer a viable platform because of their everyday relevance. Undergirding this sector are the essential products that consumers buy frequently: food, beverages, household goods and even alcohol and tobacco.', 'Again, it’s not the most exciting arenas to play in.

As well, the company enjoys robust margins across the board, leading to consistent annual profitability.', 'To be fair, analysts estimate on average that Kellanova’s revenue will land at $12.81 billion at the end of this year.

By the end of this fiscal year, they believe that the tobacco firm can generate revenue of $37.17 billion. If so, this tally would represent sales growth of 5.4% from last year’s haul. Looking out to 2025, sales might reach $39.56 billion. That would mean a growth rate of 6.4% against projected 2024 sales.', 'Also, covering experts believe that EPS may reach $6.4.

You can skip our detailed analysis of NASDAQ stocks and the performance of dividend stocks over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy.\xa0', ""The NASDAQ, which primarily consists of technology-related stocks, has been experiencing upward momentum since the previous year. In 2023, it saw remarkable growth, achieving its strongest performance since 2020 with an increase of over 43%. As of March 7, it has gained 10.21%, surpassing the broader market's gain of 8.72% this year so far. Notably, according to Jonathan Krinsky, a leading market analyst at BTIG, the NASDAQ-100, which is heavily concentrated in tech, has endured 303 consecutive trading sessions without experiencing a decline of 2.5% or more as of March 5, marking it as the third-longest period without such a significant pullback since 1990. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of the best dividend stocks listed on the index."", ""The impressive performance of NASDAQ can be largely attributed to the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, which has driven up the prices of major technology stocks and boosted the overall market throughout 2023 and into the current year. Additionally, the easing of inflation and the Federal Reserve's indication of potential rate cuts later in 2024 have further supported NASDAQ's rebound from the challenges it faced in 2022. Despite the prevalence of technology companies in the NASDAQ index, many companies offer dividends to shareholders. A notable recent addition to the list of dividend-paying companies in the index is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), which made headlines in February of this year by declaring its inaugural dividend. This move marks a significant milestone for the technology sector, which has long been dominated by a select few companies for more than a decade."", ""Meta's decision to offer a dividend serves as evidence that investors are increasingly interested in dividend-paying stocks for their capacity to provide consistent and reliable income. This trend was evident in 2023 when companies in the US distributed record dividends to their shareholders. According to a report by Janus Henderson, the S&P 500 paid out an all-time high of $70.30 per share last year, a notable increase from $66.92 in 2022. This resulted in a total payment to shareholders reaching a record $588.2 billion, surpassing the previous year's figure of $564.6 billion. The report also mentioned that there were 707 instances of dividend increases reported in the fourth quarter of 2023. These increases amounted to a total of $17.5 billion for the quarter, showing an uptick from the $16.3 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022."", ""Furthermore, dividend-paying stocks have historically delivered robust returns. Since 1960, dividends have contributed to approximately one-third of the market's total return. Dividend stocks offer a degree of stability during periods of increased market volatility. According to a report by Perkins Coie, a Washington-based law firm, dividend-paying stocks exhibit 30%-33% lower volatility compared to non-dividend-paying stocks. This stability has been particularly notable during turbulent decades like the 1930s and 2000s, where dividend-paying stocks served as a buffer against significant declines in market prices. In addition to this, dividend-paying companies that consistently increase their dividends can provide better protection against inflation than bonds in an inflationary environment."", 'In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks listed on NASDAQ.', 'Photo by nick chong on Unsplash', 'Our Methodology:', 'For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 933 hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2023 and selected companies that are trading on the NASDAQ exchange and also pay dividends to shareholders.

And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events."", ""Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra."", ""Safra Catz: Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another excellent quarter with third-quarter revenue coming in as expected and EPS $0.02 above the high end of my guidance range. Now, before I get into the results of the quarter I wanted to touch on the strength of our infrastructure cloud business. OCI has emerged as the largest driver of our overall revenue acceleration growing much, much faster than our cloud competitors. Customers have figured out that by moving to OCI they can really get more while paying less, but it's not just the cost that matters to our customers. Beyond the superior price performance of OCI customers are choosing Oracle and Oracle services for multiple reasons. First, we know better than anyone what it takes to run the full stack of technology that goes into mission-critical workloads."", ""I'm talking about running at enterprise scale with comprehensive security and unparalleled support and that's from decades of experience running the world's most important workloads and optimizing clustering technology, which is critical to artificial intelligence, workloads, and database services. Secondly, our AI capabilities are unique as they're built-in to help customers drive business outcomes. This is more than integrating generative AI across our Fusion and Industry Cloud applications and autonomous database, which we have done. It's also about enabling and refining these AI models with the customer's own data to better understand and serve their operations without them losing control of their own data. Third, we provide deployment flexibility for customers based on how they want to run in the cloud."", ""In addition to offering public cloud services, we remain the only vendor which also offers a dedicated and complete cloud of customer, dedicated regions, sovereign clouds, and Alloy, our partner cloud so customers don't have to compromise the services they receive while meeting their deployment needs. And finally, we provide multi-cloud offerings so customers can consume our cloud services in the public cloud of their choice. We offer Oracle database at Azure with Microsoft as well as MySQL HeatWave through multiple clouds and you can expect more multi-cloud services to come. Now to Q3 results, which I'd like to point out I had the actual results on day five and signed off with my auditors days ago. So I'm just bragging a little bit but I couldn't help it, I know a lot of CFOs are pretty jealous."", ""As I mentioned earlier, total revenue came in at the midpoint of my constant-currency guidance and EPS was above the high-end of guidance. As was the case when I gave guidance last quarter, currency had little effects in Q3. But I'll still discuss our results using constant currency growth rates in the few areas that the rates are slightly different. So here we go. Cloud revenue that's SaaS and IaaS excluding Cerner was $4.4 billion, up 26%. Including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 24% at $5.1 billion with IaaS revenue of $1.8 billion, up 49%, and SaaS revenue of $3.3 billion, up 14%. This quarter marks the first time our total cloud revenue is more than our total license support revenue. So we have crossed over total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter with $10 billion, up 11% driven again by our Strategic Cloud Applications, Autonomous Database, and OCI."", 'Application subscription revenues, which includes product support were $4.6 billion and up 10%. Our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $7.4 billion and were up 18%. Infrastructure revenues which includes license support were $5.4 billion and up 13%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 49%. Excluding Legacy Hosting Services, OCI Gen2 infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 52% with an annualized revenue of $6.7 billion. OCI consumption revenue was up 63%. Where if not for some continuing supply constraints, consumption growth would have been even higher. Database subscription revenues, which include database license support were up 5%. And highlighted by cloud database services, which were up 34% and now has annualized revenue of $1.9 billion.', 'Very importantly, has on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, we expect these cloud database services will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside strategic SaaS and OCI. Software license revenues were $1.3 billion, down 3%. So all in, total revenues for the quarter was $13.3 billion, up 7% including Cerner and up 9% excluding Cerner. Now to margins, the gross margins for Cloud Services and License Support was 77%. This is as before a result of the mix between support and cloud in which cloud is growing much faster than support. Support and SaaS gross margin percentages are consistent with last year while IaaS gross margins improved substantially year-over-year. While we continue to build data center capacity, overall gross margins will go higher as more of our cloud regions fill up.', 'We monitor these expenses carefully to ensure gross margin percentages expand as we scale. And to that point, gross profit dollars of Cloud Services and License Support grew 8% in Q3. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.8 billion, up 12% from last year. Operating margin was 44%, up from 42% last year as we continue to drive more efficiencies in our operating expenses, which continue to trend down as a percentage of revenue. Looking forward, as we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud and drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards, we will not only continue to grow operating income but we will also expand the operating margin percentages. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was very close to my guidance at 18.9%, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.41 in USD, up 16% in both USD and constant currency.', 'GAAP EPS was $0.85. At quarter-end, we had nearly $9.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. And short term deferred revenue balance was $8.9 billion, up 4%. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $18.2 billion, up 18% and free cash flow was $12.3 billion, up 68%. Capital expenditures were $6 billion over the same time period as we continue to see cash-flow benefits from our cloud transformation. Our remaining performance obligation or RPO is now over $8 billion with the portion excluding Cerner up 41% in constant currency. We signed several large deals this quarter and we have many more in the pipeline. Approximately 43% of our total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. And this reflects the growing trend of customers wanting larger contracts as they see first-hand how Oracle Cloud Services are benefiting their businesses.', 'And we expect to have some very nice joint announcements with NVIDIA next week. Now while we spent $2.1 billion on CapEx this quarter, the $1.7 billion in the cash-flow statements is slightly lower just due to the timing of payments. So the $2.1 billion is actually what we spent and will pay for. We are working as quickly as we can to get the cloud capacity built out given the enormity of our backlog and pipeline. I expect the CapEx will be somewhere around $7 billion to $7.5 billion this fiscal year, meaning our Q4 CapEx should be considerably higher. To that point, we now have 68 customer-facing cloud regions live with 47 public cloud regions around the world and another eight being built. 12 of these public-cloud regions interconnect with Azure and more locations with Microsoft are coming online soon.', ""We also have 11 dedicated region slots and 13 more planned. Several national security regions in EU sovereign regions live with increasing demand for more of each. And finally, we already have two Alloy cloud regions live with five more planned where Oracle Partners become cloud providers offering customized cloud services alongside Oracle Cloud. And of course, we have also many, many, many clouded customer installations. As I mentioned earlier the sizing, flexibility, and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continues to be incredible advantage for us in the marketplace. And as we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend."", ""And this quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for a total of $450 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $4.4 billion over the last 12 months. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share today. Now, before I dive into Q4 guidance, I'd like to share some thoughts on what I see for the next 12 months or so. As demand for our Cloud Services continues getting stronger, our pipeline is growing even faster and our win rates are going higher as well. As our supply constraints ease revenue growth rates will accelerate higher as our capacity expands and we get into fiscal year '25. I should also say that we continue to expect the FY '24 of which we are now in the fourth quarter, total revenue excluding Cerner will accelerate from last year as it has for the past three years and will likely be significantly higher in FY '25."", ""In addition, Cerner, which is a significant headwind this year, we expect to return to growth next year. And final - and I remain firmly committed to our FY '26 financial goals for revenue, operating margin, and EPS growth. However, some of these goals might prove to be too conservative given our momentum. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q4, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis as always. And if currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have little effect on total revenue and EPS. However, of course, actual currency impact may be different. So, at least right now, all the numbers are the same for constant currency and USD. Total revenues including Cerner are expected to grow from 4% to 6%. Total revenue excluding Cerner are expected to grow 6% to 8%."", ""The total cloud revenue excluding Cerner is expected to grow from 22% to 24% as more capacity comes online in Q4. The EPS growth rate will be affected by the compare as our Q4 tax rate last year was 9.2%, which I believe most of you have already accounted for in your models. And my EPS guidance for Q4 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. As always, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary from my guidance as stated last year. So with that, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be down 2% or to flat and be between a $1.62 and $1.66. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."", ""Larry Ellison: Thank you, Safra. Well, Oracle signed another big Generation 2 cloud infrastructure contract with NVIDIA in Q3. Oracle's Gen2 AI infrastructure business is booming. That's become pretty clear to everybody. But in addition to selling infrastructure for training AI large language models, Oracle is also completely re-engineering its industry-specific applications to take full advantage of generative Artificial Intelligence. The best example of this is in Healthcare where Oracle did not just add a bit of AI around the edges of the existing applications. Instead, we developed completely new applications using our Apex Application Generator and our Autonomous Database. These all new applications use generative AI throughout the application."", ""The best example is in Healthcare where our new Ambulatory Clinic System is being delivered to customers this Q4. This completely new application features a voice interface called the Clinical Digital Assistant. The Clinical Digital Assistant listens to a doctor's consultations with a patient and automatically generates prescriptions, Doctor's orders, doctor's notes, then automatically updates the patient's electronic health records. The Clinical Digital Assistant's voice interface makes our new healthcare systems dramatically easier to use and saves hours of doctors precious time every day which now can be spent with patients rather than typing into a computer. The delivery of our new AI-centric healthcare cloud applications, including the Ambulatory Clinic System, the Clinical Digital Assistant, and the Health Data Intelligence System will enable the rapid modernization of our customers' healthcare systems and transform Oracle Health and Cerner into a high-growth business for years to come."", 'Ken, back to you.', ""Safra Catz: We don't hear you, Ken."", 'Ken Bond: Thank you.

During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry, which Micron falls in, has gained 15%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'Micron is expected to post a loss of $0.28 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +85.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of -$0.43 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +90.3%.

So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'For Micron, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.32 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +44.1%.

Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance."", ""While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price."", 'The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.', 'Micron is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers.

Thanks, guys for being here. Cory, I want to start with you, because usually we think of growth and value as sort of being diametrically opposed. But when does it make sense for investors to look for value in tech traditionally, a sort of growth-ey sector?', ""CORY JOHNSON: Well, yeah. I mean, there are classical definitions of these types of names. And historically, we haven't seen-- we've seen tech as growth. And indeed a lot of tech companies without any profits are hard to value as value stocks. But I think a lot of that has changed over time."", ""And we've seen-- I mean, you know, the king of all value investors, right, Warren Buffett with his giant holdings in Apple and then this notion that technology can't be value is just wrong. And then there's timing. And that's when investors have to think about what they're investing for, what kinds of returns and when they need them. And to understand if it's worth a long wait, if there are some things that are willing to be more speculative and what the timing is for those investments, to figure out what the market is favoring at that moment."", ""There are times when the market loves value stocks. And there's times when the market hates it."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Doug, I want to bring you here in as well. And it's great to see you. As you note, Doug, you're finding deep value in tech can be a challenge. But you have some names for us. One is SK Hynix. Why would that name, Doug, maybe fit the bill here?"", ""DOUG CLINTON: Josh, if you rewind the clock a year, Nvidia probably wasn't the greatest value in tech. It might have been the greatest value stock period over the last year in hindsight, because if you had a crystal ball, the stock at one point, probably traded below 10 times forward actual earnings. The business is growing so fast."", ""To your question about Hynix, Hynix is a memory supplier to Nvidia. So Nvidia uses Hynix's high bandwidth memory in their chips that are in huge demand right now from hyperscalers and now potentially sovereign nations and other industrial companies that are building their AI infrastructure. So we see Hynix, which is a holding in our Deepwater frontier tech index, that powers the loop ETF. We see Hynix as a potential beneficiary of continued demand for those Nvidia chips."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Doug, Something I'm curious to get your take on when it comes to something like an SK Hynix, which, you know, as we know, semiconductors traditionally have been a commodity business and memory chips particularly so. Do you see the AI cycle smoothing that out, making that business less commoditized?"", ""DOUG CLINTON: I think in the medium term, yes. And so there is some nuance to this answer. I think that the AI cycle that we are just entering into right now will last likely longer than many of the other cycles that we've seen in the Past. I think we're going to have a very long road of infrastructure build to support AI, because right now the way that AI models work, intelligence is wholly dependent on electricity and chips."", ""And so as long as that is true with these models, and I think it will be true for several years from now, we're going to have to continue to build data centers that house thousands of these chips. And even though memory has been a little bit commoditized in the past, there's really only three big memory vendors. It's Hynix, it's Micron, it's Samsung. And I think Hynix has been on the front end of really aggressive development of new memory products. And that's why I think they'll stay in the lead."", 'JOSH LIPTON: And one more quick one for you, Doug, would you prefer SK Hynix dug over its big rival, Micron?', ""DOUG CLINTON: I think you can own both. And here's the thing that's actually a challenge, just a nuance for US investors. Hynix is a Korean-listed stock, so it's a little bit hard to get access to it. You can't get access in the loop ETF I mentioned a little bit earlier. For Micron, obviously, that's a US-listed stock. If you want to play just memory broadly and you want direct exposure, Micron's the easier route to go."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And so, Corey, I'm going to take it to you and see what you might be looking at here in the sort of given the parameters of what we're talking about here, value in this market."", ""CORY JOHNSON: Well, it's somebody's thoughts, right? So DRAM is DRAM. And the DRAM manufacturers have always told us that their DRAM special. And the market has always told us that that's not the case. And I think what we really know, you know, so whether it's Samsung or Hynix or Micron, DRAM prices are extraordinarily volatile, because they are-- it is easier to swap out DRAM than it is a CPU. It is a graphics processor is so difficult to swap out. That's why you've seen such fantastic topline growth from NVIDIA."", 'You know, and I think to Doug\'s point about value, I mean, I\'ve been kicking myself for not owning NVIDIA in my personal accounts and in my portfolio. And yet I looked the other morning. And one of my biggest holdings for years has been Comfort Systems, which is not a stock recommendation. But it\'s just an observation that I was-- to try to stop from kicking myself-- was looking at this company, the Comfort Systems. That is HVAC repair, right? Nothing less sexy, nothing more ""valuey,"" than this notion of fixing HVAC. And yet the performance in three years is almost identical to that of NVIDIA.', ""So-- and my point is that this market is actually a little more kinder to value investors than it has been for years and that we really are seeing winners separated from losers within technology and outside of technology. If you look at just today, right, look at CrowdStrike and how well that stock is performing compared to what's happening with Palo Alto Networks, Palo Alto Networks came out a few weeks ago and told us that they were seeing-- was it a week ago-- the time is flying-- telling us that they were seeing customer fatigue. And yet you see CrowdStrike going out to the same kinds of customers, saying those customers are happy to buy."", ""It suggests that the companies are performing differently and the market is able to determine winners from losers. A stock picker's market is a necessary element to a value stock performing. And what we see right now is, yeah, there-- while we are at all-time highs, or in and around, in the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ and beyond, what we're seeing is the market really is distinguishing between winners and losers. And NVIDIA has been a fantastic winner and, to Doug's point is, still on a PEG ratio, on a price to earnings growth ratio, a lot more affordable than many other companies, even in the same sector."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And Doug, I'll bring it to you and get you out of here on this one. I'm going to switch gears here, Doug, just because I'm very curious about your answer. Your firm, Doug-- it owns Alphabet. And there's a stock where, listen, it's in the red so far this year, Doug. There's been this real criticism, and you've heard it, of the company. It's just not moving fast enough when it comes to AI. As a shareholder, Doug, there, do you share that worry?"", ""DOUG CLINTON: We've been super frustrated, I would say, Josh, in terms of the speed of development with AI. Google, Alphabet-- they have all the tools, all the components they need to be the real runaway leaders in AI. They have the data. They have the team. They have the distribution through products like Android and Chrome. They just haven't had the pace that OpenAI has had."", ""And that's what you see when startups like OpenAI disrupt incumbents. And that's a worry for us. They still have all those ingredients. That's why we haven't sold the stock yet and why we're still optimistic. But it has been frustrating for shareholders. And I think you're hearing more of that."", 'I think eventually, the company needs to make a statement, make a move, have some sort of almost a Meta-like moment a year ago, where they moved into a year of efficiency. They need something to light the fire again to put those assets into motion.']"

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period."", 'While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.', "" See our latest analysis for McDonald's "", ""Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President, Christopher Kempczinski, for US$1.6m worth of shares, at about US$280 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$293, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 16% of Christopher Kempczinski's holding."", ""All up, insiders sold more shares in McDonald's than they bought, over the last year.

In total, insiders sold US$2.7m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap."", ""For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that McDonald's insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$260m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders."", ""Insiders haven't bought McDonald's stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. But since McDonald's is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

Of this total, 58.5% are male, while 41.5% are female. Women, in particular, are often employed in low-paid and low-skilled jobs. One of the most common reasons for immigration is the limited job opportunities in the labor market. Many people relocate to developed nations in pursuit of a better quality of life, seeking improved and higher-paying jobs, even in cases of lower education and no special skills.', 'Low-skilled or unskilled labor/workers are typically defined as individuals employed in jobs that require little or no experience or training, often involving routine tasks. However, their role in the economy should not be underestimated. Many companies value unskilled labor as it constitutes a significant portion of their workforce. The immigration of unskilled or low-skilled workers also has far-reaching implications globally. While the increase in international migration has been associated with higher economic gains for the global GDP, ranging from 20% to 60%, unskilled immigration itself can contribute to elevated labor productivity and GDP per capita in host countries. The resulting gains can be distributed across populations in both immigrant and emigrant countries.', ""While immigration remains a politically contentious issue in the US, opinions on encouraging skilled and discouraging unskilled immigrants are also sharply divided. Some, particularly economists, advocate for a more lenient policy towards unskilled labor, contrasting with those who argue that such individuals may displace native workers. A recent study on the US low-skill work visa lottery supports the economists' perspective, revealing that firms forced to reduce their foreign low-skill hires by half experienced an 18% decrease in production and did not increase native hiring either."", ""It is, therefore, not surprising that large organizations persist in hiring unskilled or low-skilled immigrants aspiring to obtain citizenship in developed countries like the US. These companies span various industries, including hotel chains like Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAR), fast-food giants like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD), and even tech conglomerates like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG)."", ""One method is the EB-3 Unskilled Visa Program, allowing low-skilled immigrants to replace Americans who are unwilling to take entry-level jobs on a permanent full-time basis, with the desire to gain US citizenship. The Congress has allocated approximately 10,000 visas annually for such jobs. The food sector, in particular, offers multiple low-skill level jobs (entry level) continuously filled by immigrants through the EB-3 Unskilled Visa program. Companies like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD), for instance, utilize this program to hire foreign workers. Currently, 72 US McDonald's Corporation's (NYSE: MCD) franchises are participating in this program, resulting in 3,200 employees obtaining their green cards."", 'EB-3 visas have also proven successful for tech companies such as Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), 3M Company (NYSE: MMM), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). These companies have utilized the program to fill positions during periods of domestic labor shortages since the 1990s.', '13 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to', ""To compile the list of 13 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to, we referenced our article on the 20 Countries with the Highest Minimum Wage in the World as a starting point.

Recently, the Israeli government implemented a more lenient unskilled labor hiring policy. This change, aimed at addressing labor shortages in the country, permits industrial companies to now recruit unskilled labor from previously unauthorized countries, including nations like India and Sri Lanka.', 'For immigrants seeking better job opportunities, particularly from emerging or developing nations, Israel emerges as a promising choice. The labor market mobility score indicates a moderately favorable environment, granting immigrants immediate access to the job market, albeit under less favorable conditions than those for nationals. The employment rate for foreign-born individuals in low-skilled jobs in the country is 8.5%, compared to 5.7% for native-born individuals. This suggests that immigrants are more likely to secure low-skilled jobs making Israel an attractive destination for unskilled workers seeking opportunities.', 'Labor Market Mobility Score: 52', 'Lithuania is another country offering a competitive minimum wage of $6.16 per hour to its residents. With an economy centered around finance, tourism, and luxury goods, Lithuania presents numerous job opportunities. Popular positions for foreigners without a degree include roles such as event staff, recreational attendant, hotel bellhop/porter, and more.', 'Similar to Israel, Lithuania offers a somewhat favorable situation for immigrants in the labor market. While most immigrants can readily access the job market, they may encounter challenges in finding opportunities for skill advancement or vocational education. Nevertheless, given the higher percentage of foreign-born individuals in low-skilled jobs compared to native-born residents, the country presents a potential opportunity for unskilled immigrants to secure a place in the labor market.', 'Labor Market Mobility Score: 52', 'As an advanced economy, France offers a globally competitive minimum wage of $12.35 per hour. Unskilled workers can find a range of job opportunities in the service sector, including restaurants, bars, and hotels. The thriving tourism industry also presents ample possibilities for individuals without specific skills or experience. Additionally, those with proficiency in English can explore employment opportunities in call centers or as nannies.', ""France's labor market mobility score indicates a favorable environment for immigrants, making it relatively easy for them to find jobs, with some restrictions in more regulated job sectors. However, similar to the previously mentioned countries, accessing training and skill education may pose challenges for immigrants. The country predominantly offers low-skilled jobs to immigrants, evident in the disparity between foreign-born (18.7%) and native-born (9.2%) employment rates in low-skilled positions."", 'Labor Market Mobility Score: 56', 'As a developed European country offering its residents numerous benefits, including a high minimum wage, Belgium stands out as a potential destination for unskilled workers seeking immigration. With a minimum wage per hour at $12.94, Belgium provides opportunities for individuals desiring to move to the country and secure employment. Various unskilled jobs are available, ranging from positions in food service to construction labor and house cleaning, among others.', 'The labor market mobility for newcomers in Belgium is reasonably favorable, allowing non-EU immigrants access to public employment and training opportunities, albeit with some delays. Notably, a significant proportion of low-skilled jobs in the country (21.6%) are filled by foreign-born individuals, surpassing the native-born employment rate of 8.7%. Consequently, Belgium emerges as a viable option for unskilled immigrants seeking job opportunities and a place to settle down.', 'Labor Market Mobility Score: 59', 'Effective from April 1, 2024, the minimum wage in New Zealand is expected to be set at $14.12 per hour. While the country, like many others, is streamlining rules to attract skilled labor, there are ample opportunities for unskilled workers as well. Various industries, including hospitality, manufacturing, retail, supermarkets, and construction, actively employ a significant number of unskilled workers. Immigrants entering the country on job visas in these sectors can not only enjoy competitive salaries in this developed nation but also access many other associated benefits.', 'While new immigrants in New Zealand may experience some delays in complete labor market integration, the labor market mobility score indicates that they can still access the market and benefit from targeted support. Notably, 9.2% of foreign-born residents in New Zealand are employed in low-skilled jobs, showcasing opportunities for newcomers to participate in the workforce.', 'Labor Market Mobility Score: 59', ""Japan, as a developed nation with a robust economy and a relatively high minimum wage set at $7.46 per hour since October 1, 2023, has undergone significant changes in its immigration policies. In late 2018, the country revised its immigration laws to attract both low-skilled and high-skilled workers to address labor shortages in specific sectors. From April 2019, this initiative aimed to encourage the immigration of 350,000 new individuals—comprising both types of workers—over a consecutive five-year period. Additionally, the country's growth in the agriculture and construction sectors has led to increased employment opportunities for low/unskilled workers."", 'Japanese immigrant integration policies prioritize equal treatment for permanent residents alongside other citizens. Temporary workers are also granted the opportunity to secure basic subordinate-level jobs. The foreign-born rate of employment in low-skilled jobs is notably higher at 12.5%, compared to the native-born rate of 9%, indicating increased opportunities for unskilled workers to find employment in low-skilled roles within the country.', 'Labor Market Mobility Score: 65', 'As one of the strongest economies in Europe, the Netherlands emerges as a promising destination for unskilled workers seeking immigration. The country offers a wealth of diverse job opportunities, particularly in manufacturing, retail, and food service. Notably, the Netherlands provides a highly competitive minimum wage of $14.46 per hour.', 'The Netherlands also secures a place in the slightly favorable category of the MIPEX integration index, indicating the ease with which new non-EU migrants can find employment in both public and private sectors. Long-term migrants and families staying in the country also enjoy equal access to education, training, and study grants. Additionally, the proportion of foreign-born individuals in low-skilled jobs surpasses that of the native-born population (15.2% compared to 8.2%), underscoring increased opportunities for unskilled individuals to secure these positions.', 'South Korea stands among the nations with a high minimum wage, currently set at $7.40 per hour as of January 1, 2024. The Korean government actively promotes the influx of low-skilled foreign workers into the country, particularly in sectors such as hospitality, mining, and forestry. The goal is to attract and integrate 165,000 new immigrants into these industries.', ""South Korea's labor market mobility score suggests a generally favorable attitude toward immigrants, with long-term residents enjoying easy access to self-employment, public jobs, and general and targeted support. However, temporary workers may encounter some obstacles. Notably, there is a significant difference between the foreign-born and native-born populations in low-skilled level jobs. A substantial 32% of foreign-born individuals were found to be employed in unskilled worker positions, compared to only 9.9% of the native-born population holding such jobs."", 'Click to continue reading and see our 5 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to.', 'Suggested Articles:', ' 15 Best Places to Retire If You Have No Savings', '30 Countries with the Highest GDP in 2023', '20 Countries with Highest Income Tax Rates in Europe', 'Disclosure: None. 13 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to is originally published on Insider Monkey.']"

Since TRIP is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock.

This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.', ""The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system."", 'Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.', 'Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for NetApp basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.', 'Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices', ""The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""For NetApp, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher."", 'Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions', 'Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.', ""The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock\'s price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at NetApp (NTAP), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.', ""It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. NetApp currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).

It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area."", ""For NTAP, shares are up 20.49% over the past week while the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry is up 18.11% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 17.24% compares favorably with the industry's 27.5% performance as well."", 'While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of NetApp have increased 16.86% over the past quarter, and have gained 64.43% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 12.82% and 31.04%, respectively.', ""Investors should also take note of NTAP's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, NTAP is averaging 2,457,513 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', ""The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with NTAP."", ""Over the past two months, 7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost NTAP's consensus estimate, increasing from $6.15 to $6.40 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period."", 'Bottom Line', ""Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that NTAP is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep NetApp on your short list."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Mondelez International, Inc.

Over the last twelve months the stock price has risen a very respectable 10%."", ""With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies."", ' See our latest analysis for Mondelez International ', ""To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested.

That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""Mondelez International provided a TSR of 13% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 11% per year over five year.

', 'Starbucks is in a strong position to continue growing its above-average payout at a strong clip. The company launched its triple-shot reinvention strategy last fall to accelerate growth and increase its profitability. The company aims to grow its already massive store count to 55,000 global locations by 2030 (up from over 38,000) while unlocking over $3 billion in cost savings. These catalysts should drive 10%+ annual revenue growth and 15%+ annual earnings growth over the long term.

The global snacking giant has delivered double-digit annual dividend growth over the last five years, including a 10% increase in 2023. ', 'The maker of Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers expects to continue growing at a solid rate. It sees its organic net revenue rising by 3% to 5% this year with high-single-digit adjusted per-share growth. It also expects to continue producing robust free cash flow ($3.5 billion), the bulk of which it will likely return to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. It aims to grow the dividend around the same rate as its adjusted earnings, suggesting a floor growth rate in the high single digits. ', 'Mondelez aspires to accelerate its already solid organic growth rate by making acquisitions. It has completed nine deals since 2018 that have added more than $3 billion in annual revenue. The company is in an excellent position to continue making acquisitions as promising opportunities arise. It has a strong balance sheet, which it recently bolstered by selling its gum brands in developed markets. Its acquisition focus in recent years has been on buying healthier and premium brands to increase its market share in core categories and expand into adjacent ones. Future deals could enable Mondelez to grow its earnings and dividend even faster. ', ""Four Corners Property Trust offers a very appealing dividend yield of 5.7%. The real estate investment trust (REIT) supports that payout primarily with rental income generated by its portfolio of restaurant properties. It owns over 1,100 properties leased to nearly 150 brands, led by Darden Restaurants concepts Olive Garden (37.1% of its annual base rent) and Longhorn Steakhouse (10.4%). It also owns restaurants leased to Brinker International (Chili's), Buffalo Wild Wings, and many others. On top of that, the REIT has a growing portfolio of nonrestaurant properties (20% are auto service, medical retail, and other retail properties). "", ""The REIT completes a number of acquisitions each year. It spent $333 million to buy 88 properties last year. Restaurants made up 39% of its volume in 2023, with the balance being nonrestaurant retail properties. The company's conservative financial profile gives it the flexibility to continue acquiring income-producing properties. "", ""Four Corners Property Trust's expanding portfolio has grown its income, enabling the REIT to steadily increase its dividend. It has boosted its payout by more than 40% since Darden spun off its real estate to form the REIT in 2015. That payout should continue rising as its portfolio and rental income grow.

Since Buffett became CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in the mid-1960s, he\'s overseen a greater than 4,900,000% aggregate return in his company\'s Class A shares (BRK.A), and practically doubled up the annualized total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500.', ""Patient investors have become financially independent mirroring the Oracle of Omaha's investments. This can be done by analyzing Berkshire's quarterly Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F details what Wall Street's brightest minds purchased and sold in the most recent quarter."", ""But while Berkshire Hathaway's 13Fs have clued investors into a number of businesses Buffett appreciates, the Oracle of Omaha's favorite stock to buy -- one which he's added to for 22 consecutive quarters -- won't be found on his company's 13F."", ""A quick glance at Berkshire's $361 billion portfolio would appear to suggest that tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is Warren Buffett's favorite business. After all, it accounted for 42.5% of invested assets as of the closing bell on March 6."", ""Innovation is a big reason Apple held the title of world's largest publicly traded company for so long (it only recently ceded this title to Microsoft). Since upgrading iPhone to handle 5G speeds in late 2020, the company's flagship smartphone has accounted for half or more of domestic smartphone market share. Even though Warren Buffett doesn't understand the mechanics of how an iPhone works, he fully understands consumer behavior and the exceptional loyalty of Apple's customers to its products."", ""But what investors may have overlooked is Apple's innovation beyond its physical products. CEO Tim Cook is overseeing an extended transformation that has Apple focused on various subscription services. Subscriptions should smooth out Apple's revenue recognition during iPhone upgrade cycles, steadily lift the company's operating margin over time, and encourage Apple's customers to stay within the company's ecosystem of products and services."", 'However, the best aspect of owning a lot of Apple stock for Warren Buffett might be its unbeatable capital-return program. Apple is returning $14.8 billion annually in dividends to its shareholders, and has repurchased in excess of $600 billion worth of its common stock since the start of 2013. Buffett is a huge fan of businesses that reward long-term-minded investors like himself.', ""The other stock in Berkshire's portfolio that you'd probably think is Warren Buffett's favorite to buy is energy juggernaut Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). Since the beginning of 2022, the Oracle of Omaha and his investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have purchased more than 248 million shares of Occidental -- a position with a market value of $15.2 billion."", ""Although energy stocks haven't played a big role in Berkshire's portfolio throughout much of this century, the past couple of years have represented something of a change of heart for Buffett and his team. Piling into Occidental the way Berkshire's investment team has signals that they believe the spot price of crude oil will remain above historic norms, or perhaps head even higher."", ""While it's tough to predict the directional movements of energy commodities with any certainty, there are factors working in Buffett's favor. For instance, capital underinvestment for multiple years from energy majors during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to tight global oil supply. When the supply of an in-demand commodity is constrained, it's not uncommon for the price of that commodity to rise."", ""A higher spot price for crude oil would be noteworthy for two reasons for Occidental. First, it generates the lion's share of its revenue from its drilling operations. If the price of oil climbs, it disproportionately benefits, when compared to other integrated oil and gas operators."", 'Secondly, Occidental is still digging itself out of debt. The company is counting on a higher spot price to fuel the steady paydown of its remaining debt.', ""Though it's abundantly clear that Apple and Occidental Petroleum are core holdings in the $361 billion portfolio Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway, neither stock has been purchased by the Oracle of Omaha for 22 consecutive quarters."", ""To find Warren Buffett's favorite stock, investors will want to peer beyond the company's 13Fs and take a closer look at Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly operating results. Contained within these operating results is a section on share repurchases. That's right -- the stock Buffett genuinely can't stop buying is shares of his own company."", ""Share buybacks at Berkshire Hathaway took a big turn in mid-July 2018. Prior to this point, repurchases could only be undertaken if the company's shares traded at or below 120% of book value (i.e., no more than 20% above reported book value in the most recent quarter). Since Berkshire Hathaway's stock never retreated to or below this preset threshold, the company went years without any share repurchases."", ""Everything changed on July 17, 2018, which is when Berkshire's board reworked the covenants governing share repurchases to allow Warren Buffett and the late, great Charlie Munger to work their magic."", 'Under the new criteria, as long as Berkshire Hathaway has at least $30 billion in aggregate cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet, and both Buffett and Munger agreed that shares of their company were intrinsically cheap, buybacks could continue with no preset cap.', ""During the fourth quarter of 2023, Buffett oversaw the repurchase of 3,623 Class A shares and 660,585 Class B shares (BRK.B) of Berkshire stock at a total cost of almost $2.15 billion. Since the criteria for buybacks changed in July 2018, Buffett has bought back more than $74 billion worth of his company's stock, with repurchases occurring every single quarter."", ""The reason the Oracle of Omaha and his team spend such a small fortune on buybacks is because it's the easiest way to reward investors who share their long-term vision. Since Berkshire doesn't pay a dividend, regular buybacks are incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of existing shareholders."", ""Furthermore, buying back stock can lift earnings per share (EPS) for businesses with steady or growing net income. As Berkshire's outstanding share count shrinks over an extended period, EPS should increase. Ideally, this makes Berkshire Hathaway appear even cheaper to investors."", 'Regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. economy and stock market are performing, Warren Buffett buying back shares of his favorite stock, Berkshire Hathaway, is a virtual given.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

When his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) first began investing in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in 2016, that stock traded at a steep discount to the market -- with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in the range of 10 to 14.5 that year. Back then, sentiment was negative -- there was a widespread view that Apple's growth was plateauing, its market expansion had played out, and its products were limited -- not to mention it didn't have the high-margin services segment it has today."", ""A lot has changed since then. But Apple has once again lost its market premium. Over the last six months, the S&P 500 is up 14.6%, while Apple stock is down 4.9%. On March 1, Apple sold off, and the S&P 500 rose. At one point, Apple's P/E ratio fell below the S&P 500's, but it ended up finishing the day at 27.9, which was, coincidentally, the same as the S&P 500."", ""Berkshire Hathaway's other top public equity holdings -- Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), American Express (NYSE: AXP), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) -- are all trading at discounts to the S&P 500. Combined with Apple, these six companies make up 78.4% of Berkshire's portfolio."", ""Let's consider why Buffett and his team like these companies, and the qualities that make them good long-term holdings."", ""In Berkshire Hathaway's most recent letter to shareholders, Buffett praised his longtime partner Charlie Munger for many things, including a key lesson he taught Buffett."", 'Charlie, in 1965, promptly advised me: ""Warren, forget about ever buying another company like Berkshire. But now that you control Berkshire, add to it wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices and give up buying fair businesses at wonderful prices. In other words, abandon everything you learned from your hero, Ben Graham. It works but only when practiced at small scale.""', 'Back then, Buffett was known for buying decent or bad businesses because their book values were higher than their market values. Munger taught Buffett that if he was going to be a great investor managing a larger amount of money, he would have to pivot away from that scrappy strategy toward something more sustainable.', ""Berkshire's top stock holdings today reflect this shift.

And Occidental Petroleum, commonly known as Oxy, is one of the most valuable exploration and production companies and, assuming its deal with CrownRock L.P. goes through, will become one of the top producers in the Permian Basin -- the largest onshore oilfield in the U.S.', ""In sum, Berkshire's biggest stock holdings are all among the top dogs in their respective industries. Many of them have another attribute that Buffett loves -- capital return programs."", 'Over the last five years, Apple, Bank of America, and American Express have all boosted their dividends and bought back stock at impressive rates.', 'Coke and Chevron have focused primarily on growing their dividends. Both have increased their payouts by more than 50% in the last 10 years. And Chevron has bought back a boatload of stock over the last two years. In 2023 alone, it spent a record $26 billion on dividends and buybacks.', ""Occidental Petroleum is a bit of an outlier. In 2020, Oxy cut its dividend from $0.79 per share per quarter to just $0.01 per share per quarter. It has since raised its quarterly payout several times, bringing it up to $0.22 per share, but it hasn't been exactly the type of consistent dividend payer Berkshire usually targets."", 'Oxy is also known for using debt and leveraging up its balance sheet, which it will do to pay for its pending CrownRock acquisition.', ""In Berkshire's 2023 letter to shareholders, Buffett praised Oxy's leadership and wrote of his confidence in the U.S. oil and natural gas industry. Oxy stands out as a specific play on a specific theme. It amounts to 4.1% of the public equity portfolio, indicating that Berkshire is taking care to manage the position to make sure it doesn't become too large."", 'You may be wondering, if these companies all have qualities that make them suitable investments, then why would they trade at a discount to the market? Part of the reason is simply the industries that these companies are in.', 'Financial stocks tend to trade at discounts to the market. So do consumer staples companies like Coca-Cola. The oil and natural gas sector is cyclical, so its P/E ratios tend to be low during growth periods and high during downturns. Investors tend to pay a premium for growth companies relative to slower-growing companies, and they tend to favor stability as opposed to cyclicality.', 'As for Apple, it has been largely unaffected by the artificial intelligence-induced tech bull market, and is facing slowing growth out of China and competition from Huawei. So its valuation has come under pressure as investors search for companies that are growing in the near term.', ""Berkshire's largest stock holdings showcase its highest-conviction names. Berkshire has owned some of these stocks for decades. Others, like Apple, Chevron, and Oxy, are more recent additions to the portfolio."", 'The key takeaway is that Berkshire knows what it is looking for, and targets companies that fit its criteria -- not simply those that are tied to whichever hot trend is sweeping Wall Street. Berkshire invests in companies that are good values and have attractive capital return programs through dividends and buybacks.', ""As an individual investor, it's important to find the types of companies and sectors you like. It's also vital to make sure you align your investments with your risk tolerance.

Another such indicator is seasonality, which checks to see if any stock market sectors deliver returns by the season."", ""When we talk about seasonality, then since spring has just started, it's best to see which Spring stocks are seeing interest from hedge funds. But before that, a look to see which stock market sectors perform well in spring. On this front, some research from CNBC and StockCharts can help guide us. Since the latter segregates stock indexes by their monthly performance, it makes sense to start our brief look at spring stock market performance by starting from it."", ""Taking a look at the flagship S&P 500, the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite, and the NYSE Primary, then the first three months of spring offer strong returns across all of these. Considering data for the twelve months of the year between 2005 to 2024, the S&P 500 closed higher in April 84% of the time - the highest for any month during the year. This is also the case for the NYSE's performance, with the same percentage for the same month."", ""Finally, when we look at how stocks on the NASDAQ Composite perform during spring months, then March and April saw the index close higher 68% of the time, each - for the second highest figure after its performance during July and November. Finally, spring's a good time for stocks especially when we consider that for the S&P and NYSE, May offers the third highest odds for a higher monthly close. Performance in May is particularly interesting when we remember a stock market 'proverb' that calls on investors to 'Sell in May and Go Away', referring to portfolio adjustments before the holidays. Combining this with the data, perhaps one reason why stocks do well in May is due to low liquidity also affecting prices through volatility."", 'The next step in our analysis of the best spring stocks is to see which sectors perform well. On this front, CNBC did some research and determined that the best spring stocks often include companies that operate in the financial services and energy industry. To quote the publication:', 'CNBC.com looked at stock performance over the past ten years and calculated the highest average gains during the spring months of March, April and May. Of all the stocks to achieve a gain of 20 percent or more, 27 percent were in the financial sector, while 21 percent were energy-oriented.', ""So, how are these sectors doing right now?

In 2023, the legendary investor was a net seller of stocks. Meanwhile, the cash position for Berkshire Hathaway has grown to nearly $168 billion."", ""Don't think for a second that Buffett isn't still interested in the stock market. Here's his main investing focus right now -- and how it could make him billions."", 'In the fourth quarter of 2023, Buffett bought only three stocks. None were new positions, and two of them operate in the energy sector -- Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY).', ""Buffett hasn't just nibbled at these two oil stocks. Chevron ranks as the fifth-largest position in Berkshire's portfolio, with a stake currently worth nearly $18.9 billion. Occidental holds the No. 6 spot, with Berkshire owning close to $15.3 billion of the company's shares."", 'Berkshire first initiated a position in Chevron in the fourth quarter of 2020. The stock had been beaten down considerably at the time due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel.', 'After some buying and selling over the next several quarters, Buffett went big in the first quarter of 2021, purchasing 121 million additional shares. Although Berkshire trimmed its position in Chevron beginning in 2022 Q4, the conglomerate boosted its position in the oil and gas producer by more than 14% in 2023 Q4.', ""Buffett's interest in Occidental began in 2019. However, by mid-2020, he had exited Berkshire's position completely."", ""The Oracle of Omaha didn't stay on the sidelines with Oxy for too long, though. He began buying the stock again in the first quarter of 2022 and has steadily added to the position in most of the quarters since then."", 'What does Buffett like so much about Chevron and Occidental? I suspect that he thinks Berkshire will make billions of dollars from both investments.', ""For one thing, these two stocks are valued attractively, while the broader market is trading at a premium. Chevron's forward earnings multiple is 11.6x, while Occidental's shares trade at 14.6 times forward earnings. As important as valuation is to Buffett, though, it's the growth prospects for these two companies that probably appeal to him the most."", 'Buffett holds Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub in high regard.

In February 2024, she told CNBC that the world will face a supply shortage of oil by the end of 2025.', ""There's a direct correlation between oil prices and the share prices of both Chevron and Occidental. If Hollub is right that a supply shortage is on the way, both stocks will likely soar as oil prices rise."", ""But Buffett is also looking beyond the near future. He knows that climate change is a serious concern and recognizes that the demand for oil and gas isn't likely to decline. As a result, he's supportive of efforts to develop and implement carbon capture technology."", 'Occidental has invested heavily in direct air capture, a method of sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Hollub told NPR a few months ago that ""there\'s no reason not to produce oil and gas forever"" if her vision for carbon capture pans out.', 'Chevron is focusing on carbon capture, as well.

Their curiosity for all kinds of creams, gels, face masks and facial peels has even earned them a viral moniker: “Sephora Kids.”', '“The Sephora Kid trend is a real phenomenon,” said Dr. Lauren Penzi, a New York-based dermatologist.', 'And skincare experts are applauding the fact that kids as young as eight years old appear to be invested in taking care of their skin. The evidence is all over social media. At the same time, they’re concerned these young consumers are going about it in a risky way – from what they are buying to where they are buying it – and causing unnecessary damage such as rashes, allergic reactions and even skin burns.', 'Scores of recent TikTok and Instagram videos have documented the so-called tween invasion of Sephora and Ulta stores, with many grown-ups bemoaning the Gen Alpha takeover of these popular beauty products chains.', 'Tweens gravitate to Sephora and Ulta for the same reason that adult shoppers do. Both stores offer customers the try-before-you-buy option for any beauty or fragrance product sold in their store.', 'At a Sephora store in New York City, a store employee told CNN that tweens are frequently flowing in, not really asking for advice or recommendations from staff, and making a beeline for trendy and pricey skincare brands, such as Drunk Elephant, Glow Recipe and Laneige, that are hyped up by influencers.', 'Drunk Elephant, whose products range from $38 for a 30 ml bottle of its uber popular “D-Bronzi” peptide face serum to $62 for 50 ml of its Lala Retro\xa0Whipped Cream, has an online FAQ section addressing younger customers asking, “Can Drunk Elephant be used by children?”', 'The response begins, “Yes, however not every product in our line should be used by younger fans, 12 and under. In general, we do not recommend using products containing high concentration of active ingredients, which address concerns that aren’t present at such an age,” and goes on to urge parental supervision.', 'Dr. Stacey\xa0Tull, a cosmetic dermatology specialist in Missouri, worries that preteens are falling for the hype without properly understanding popular skincare products, such as retinol, their usage and whether those products are actually suitable for younger skin. Retinol is a form of vitamin A and is a popular skincare ingredient that is used to improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on aging skin.', 'Tweens definitely don’t need to use retinol, said Tull.', '“Retinol came from retinoic acid, which is actually for acne but probably 20 years ago it took off as an anti-aging serum,” she said. “If tweens are having acne then they should see their doctors or dermatologist and get it prescribed rather than go for an anti-aging serum which does have some retinol, but the original intent is not to treat acne and it’s also in the wrong formulation to treat acne.”', 'The retinol products sold in beauty products stores, she said, are for mature skin of older consumers.', 'Dr. Penzi shared similar concerns and said she fears she’s already seeing the consequences among her younger patients.', '“This age is when skin issues do tend to arise. It’s a lot of hormonal changes, maybe stress, maybe hygiene isn’t as good. This is when they start to figure out what their skin type is like,” she said. “It is certainly a good thing that these young individuals have awareness of their skin type, but they need to learn how to properly take care of it.”', 'But rushing into Sephora and Ulta to find products might be overkill. The three products she encourages tweens to use are gentle cleansers and moisturizers that are suited for their skin and sunscreen. Any additional product should only address specific needs at this age, such as oily or acne-prone skin.', 'Among her recent younger patients, Penzi said she’s seen a number of cases of allergic reactions. “They come in with redness, burning, itching, scaling and rashes,” she said. “One of the ingredients they might be truly allergic to or it’s way too irritating for their skin barrier.”', 'She’s also seeing younger patients with worsening acne, “probably putting too many products and their pores are drowning in it. In the 10-to-12 age group I’m definitely seeing more frequent cases with these conditions than I have in the past,” Penzi said.', '“They are young and don’t want to be forthcoming with me and the mom’s always sitting in the back of the room mouthing to me that their kid is using things they shouldn’t be,” Penzi said.', 'Sephora, which is owned by French luxury group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, declined to comment for this story. The retailer operates more than 2,700 stores globally, including over 1,000 independent store locations in the United States. The beauty products chain also operates several hundred smaller format Sephora stores inside of Kohl’s department stores.', 'Ulta, which operates over 1,300 stores nationwide, told CNN in a comment that the retailer “wants to be a resource for guests at every age and stage of their beauty journey.”', '“While we love seeing teens and tweens embrace skincare and establish healthy rituals early on, we want everyone to engage with the category responsibly and have access to information on the best ingredients for their skincare needs,” according to an emailed statement.', 'Ulta said it provides educational guidance in store and on Ulta.com, which includes “dermatologist recommended offerings and brands formulated with tweens in mind. “Our store associates can help guests find products that are gentle and effective for all skin types, especially younger generations.”', 'Jennifer O’Brien celebrated her twin girls’ 12th birthday in January at a Sephora store in Long Island, New York.', 'The store offers birthday events before the store opens or after it closes for tweens and teens that include either a group beauty makeover or skincare 101 tutorial.', '“After the event, they had an hour to go shop in a closed store. They had the aisles all to themselves and they were filling up their goodie bags,” said O’Brien, who does offer advice to her daughters about the products they buy.', 'O’Brien said she understands Sephora’s appeal to tweens. “It’s like an aspirational brand to them, similar to the Stanley tumblers craze. They see people using products from Sephora on social media. So it’s almost like a status symbol to buy products from there even if they don’t even know how to use them properly, but they can show their friends that they have them.”', 'At the same time, O’Brien, who used to work in the cosmetics industry and managed a Sephora store inside of a JC Penney in New York City, harbors a few concerns.', '“My main concern is that when my girls go through those hormonal changes, they can’t be layering all these products on their face,” she said. “At a certain point they will see that their skin can break out from it.”', 'Penzi singled out social media for fueling the sense among pre-adolescents of not wanting to be left out. “Their friends are trying products, they want to do it and nobody wants to be left out at this age,” she said.', 'Market research firm Circana, which tracks point-of-sale data from retailers, said the most recent holiday season showed the popularity of skincare among Gen Alpha.', 'Receipt-based checkout data revealed that spending on higher-priced beauty products (including skincare) among higher income households (above $100,000) grew by 16% with children under 18 years of age, significantly higher than the 6% increase than households without children.', 'Sheryl Jorgensen Masowdi told CNN that she’s not opposed to her daughter shopping at Sephora.', 'Still, Masowdi has her limits on how much leeway she will give her tween daughter, who got a vanity for Christmas so she could display her skincare collection.', 'Masowdi said her 11-year-old is very knowledgeable about skin care, but sometimes still reaches for the wrong products. “She was looking at this skin tightening product and I said, girlfriend, I need skin tightening.

Ulta Beauty’s SG&A expenses have also been rising year over year for a while now.

Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$1.09b', 'US$1.16b', 'US$1.31b', 'US$1.32b', 'US$1.41b', 'US$1.49b', 'US$1.55b', 'US$1.60b', 'US$1.65b', 'US$1.70b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x7', 'Analyst x7', 'Analyst x4', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ 3.83%', 'Est @ 3.37%', 'Est @ 3.04%', 'Est @ 2.82%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% ', 'US$1.0k', 'US$1.0k', 'US$1.1k', 'US$1.0k', 'US$995', 'US$986', 'US$955', 'US$921', 'US$886', 'US$850', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.7b', ""The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage.

The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Ulta Beauty as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.055. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Valaris Ltd. VAL, Murphy USA MUSA and Sunoco LP SUN.', 'Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.', 'Textron, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is a global manufacturer of aircraft, automotive engine components, and industrial tools. The company continues to enjoy strong order flows for its commercial and defense products. The stock recently broke out to an all-time high and has been benefiting from a resurgence in the industrial sector. Textron shares are displaying relative strength as buying pressure accumulates in this market leader.', 'The company is part of the Zacks Aerospace – Defense industry group, which currently ranks in the top 34% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. This industry is also showing several favorable characteristics.', 'Historical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock’s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. It’s no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.', 'Textron operates in the aircraft, defense, and industrial businesses worldwide. The company manufactures and sells business jets, defense aircraft, and military and commercial helicopters. It also provides maintenance, inspection, and repair services, as well as sells commercial parts.', 'In addition, Textron offers advanced marine crafts, electronic systems and solutions, live military training, and armored and specialty vehicles. The multi-industry company was founded in 1923, employs 35,000 people and is headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island.', 'Solid order activities resulted in a $14 billion backlog to start this year, which strengthens the company’s revenue-generating capacity. A solid product pipeline along with high levels of innovation are expected to boost future operating results significantly.', 'Textron has established an impressive earnings history, surpassing earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters. Back in January, the company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.60/share, which marked a 4.58% surprise over the $1.53/share consensus estimate. Earnings improved 49.5% year-over-year.', 'The industrial manufacturer has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 13.5%. Consistently beating earnings estimates is a recipe for success.', 'Analysts covering TXT are in agreement and have been raising their earnings estimates across the board. For the current quarter, analysts bumped up earnings estimates by 7.32% in the past 60 days. The Q1 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $1.32/share, reflecting potential growth of 25.7% relative to the year-ago quarter. Revenues are projected to climb 11.6% to $3.37 billion.', 'TXT shares have started off 2024 on a strong note, advancing more than 12% year-to-date. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.', 'Notice how both the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages are sloping up. The stock has been making a series of 52-week highs and recently surpassed its former all-time high. With both strong fundamental and technical indicators, TXT is poised to continue its outperformance.', 'Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. As we know, Textron has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and TXT continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run this year.', 'Despite the impressive performance, TXT stock remains relatively undervalued.', 'As industrials rebound amid a broad market rally, the future looks bright for this highly-ranked, leading stock. Textron is ranked favorably by our Zacks Style Scores, with a second-best ‘B’ rating in each of our Growth and Value categories. This means that the stock is likely to move higher based on a promising combination of strong earnings and sales growth along with favorable valuation metrics.', 'Backed by a leading industry group and impressive history of earnings beats, it’s not difficult to see why TXT stock is a compelling investment. An appealing technical trend along with robust fundamentals paint a bullish picture for Textron.', 'RCI Hospitality Holdings owns and operates upscale adult nightclubs, dance clubs, restaurants, and sports bars in the United States. Its brands include recognized names in the industry such as Bombshells Restaurant & Bar, Rick’s Cabaret, Jaguars Club, Club Onyx, and Studio 80.', 'In addition, RCI Hospitality owns a national industry convention and tradeshow; two national industry trade publications; and two national industry award shows, along with approximately a dozen social media websites tailored to the adult retail products industry. The company was founded in 1983 and is based in Houston, Texas.', 'RCI Hospitality, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a component of the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry group. This industry ranks in the bottom 50% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months, just as it has over the past year.', 'Stocks in the bottom tiers of industries can often be potential candidates for short positions. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when they are part of a lackluster industry group, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.', 'Despite a rebound in stocks with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and more recently the Nasdaq hitting new all-time highs, RICK shares have not been participating lately. The stock has experienced considerable volatility over the past year.', 'RCI Hospitality has fallen short of earnings estimates in three of the prior four quarters. Back in February, the hospitality provider reported fiscal first-quarter earnings of $0.77/share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by -17.20%.', 'The company has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings miss of -26.5%. A history of missing earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance and exactly what the bears want to see.', 'Analysts covering RICK have been steadily decreasing earnings estimates across the board. Looking into the current quarter, analysts have decreased EPS estimates by -23.02% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $0.97/share, reflecting a -25.4% decline relative to the year-ago period.', 'Falling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that supports a bearish viewpoint.', 'As illustrated below, RICK stock is in a sustained downtrend and has witnessed considerable volatility, all while the general market reaches new heights. Notice how shares are trading below both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, signaled by the blue and red lines, respectively. The stock has been making a series of lower lows, widely underperforming the major indices. Also notice how both of the moving averages are sloping down – another good sign for the bears.', ""RICK stock has experienced what is known as a ‘death cross,' wherein the stock’s 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. The stock would have to make a surprising move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions. Shares have fallen more than 17% this year alone."", 'A deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to hit new highs anytime soon. The fact that RICK is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. A history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock’s downtrend.', 'Highlighted underperformance bodes well for the bears. Potential investors may want to consider including this stock as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of RICK stock until the situation shows major signs of improvement.', 'U.S. oil prices finished high on Wednesday after a weekly report from the Energy Information Administration (""EIA"") showed a smaller-than-expected increase in supplies, to go with bigger declines in fuel stocks. Saudi Arabia’s decision to raise the official selling prices of its crude for Asian buyers further supported the commodity.', 'On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures gained $1.60 (or 2%), to close at $79.75 a barrel yesterday.', 'We believe that oil’s current levels allow long-term-oriented market participants to buy shares in quality companies at attractive prices. Investors interested in the sector could benefit from having top-ranked stocks like Valaris Ltd., Murphy USA and Sunoco LP in their portfolio.', ""Let's dig deep into EIA’s Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the week ending Mar 1."", 'Crude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose 1.4 million barrels compared to analysts’ expectations of a 3.7-million-barrel increase per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Commodity Insights. The stockpile build with the world’s biggest oil consumer was largely thanks to higher imports and lower export shipments. However, the magnitude was lower than expected due to a pullback in production and strong demand.', 'Total domestic stock now stands at 448.5 million barrels — 6.3% lower than the year-ago figure of 478.5 million barrels and 1% less than the five-year average.', 'The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) rose 701,000 barrels to 31.7 million barrels.', 'Meanwhile, the crude supply cover edged down from 30.5 days in the previous week to 30.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 31.9 days.', 'Let’s turn to the products now.', 'Gasoline: Gasoline supplies decreased for the fifth time in as many weeks. The 4.5-million-barrel draw was primarily attributable to a surge in demand. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would drop 2.3 million barrels. At 239.7 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 0.7% more than the year-earlier level, while it is 2% lower than the five-year average range.', 'Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) fell for the seventh successive week. The 4.1-million-barrel drop mainly reflected healthy demand and exports. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply draw of 800,000 barrels. Following last week’s decrease, current inventories — at 117 million barrels — are 4.3% below the year-ago level, while it is 10% lower than the five-year average.', 'Refinery Rates:Refinery utilization, at 84.9%, rose 3.4% from the prior week.', 'Having gone through the Weekly Petroleum Status Report, investors interested in the energy sector might consider operators like Valaris Limited, Murphy USA and Sunoco LP.

Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will be engaged in the production and delivery of 96 Trailing Edge Flap R2 shipsets to support F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft retrofit efforts.', 'A major portion of work related to this contract will be executed in St. Louis, MO.', 'As nations across the globe continue to strengthen their defense structures, spending on military arms and ammunition that boast technologically advanced features continues to increase manifold. This also includes increased investments in military aircraft that play a critical role in air warfare missions.Boeing, a global leader in the development, production, maintenance and enhancement of manned and unmanned aircraft, stands to benefit from such increased demand. The company delivers the most digitally advanced, simply and efficiently produced, and intelligently supported solutions to its customers. Its product portfolio includes a range of combat-proven aircraft like the F/A-18 Super Hornet, P-8, C-17 Globemaster III, EA-18G, etc.', 'Its ability to develop, produce and mission-enabling upgrades of integrated solutions helps the company witness a significant order inflow for its military aircraft and associated upgrades, like the latest one. Such contract wins tend to boost the company’s operating results from the Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment, which generated a solid 9% year-over-year improvement in its fourth-quarter 2023 revenues.', 'Due to widespread geopolitical tensions worldwide, particularly the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, nations are rapidly augmenting their defense purchases to strengthen their warfare capabilities. This has led to an increased demand for fighter aircraft, both manned and unmanned, among other defense products, thereby bolstering the prospects for jet makers like Boeing.', 'To this end, Boeing expects approximately 30% of the worldwide fleet of military aircraft to be retired and replaced over the next 10 years, driving increased demand for services to maintain aging aircraft and enhance aircraft capability. This should also boost demand for new combat jets to replace the older ones, thereby ushering in orders for Boeing.', 'In line with this, the Mordor Intelligence firm projects the global military aviation market to witness a CAGR of 5.2% during the 2024-2030 period. Such projections indicate immense opportunities for Boeing to reap the benefits of the market’s expansion, with the company’s increased focus on franchise programs such as the MQ-25, the T-7A Red Hawk, KC-46A Tanker, VC-25B and the MH-139A Grey Wolf.', 'Apart from Boeing, other prominent defense majors involved in the manufacturing of military aircraft, like Northrop Grumman NOC, Airbus Group EADSY and Textron TXT, are also expected to gain from the military aviation market’s growth opportunities.', 'Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of military aircraft.

Despite its ups and downs, the average annual return from stocks over the very long-term handily outpaces other asset classes, including gold, oil, housing, and Treasury bonds.', 'While there is no shortage of strategies that can make investors richer on Wall Street, buying and holding dividend stocks tends to be head-and-shoulders above the pack.', 'Last year, the researchers at Hartford Funds published an all-encompassing report (""The Power of Dividends: Past, Present, and Future"") that examined the varying outperformance of income stocks over extended periods.', 'In particular, a collaboration with Ned Davis Research yielded just how powerful dividend stocks can be to wealth creation. Whereas non-payers have averaged a 3.95% annual return over a half-century (1973-2022), dividend stocks have more than doubled up the non-payers with an average annual return of 9.18%. Companies that regularly share a percentage of their earnings with investors and provide transparent long-term growth outlooks should be expected to outperform over long periods.', 'However, not all dividend stocks are cut from the same cloth. There are only around two dozen publicly traded companies that have been paying a continuous dividend for at least 100 years — and quite a few of these companies are some of the strongest and most well-known businesses on Wall Street.', 'Among the roughly two dozen publicly traded companies that have been dishing out an uninterrupted payout to their shareholders for more than a century are beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), energy titan ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), and pharmaceutical maven Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY).', ""Earlier this year, Coca-Cola raised its payout for a 62nd consecutive year. But looking back even further, it's been paying a continuous dividend since 1920. Since it provides a basic necessity product (beverages), Coca-Cola's operating cash flow tends to be highly predictable in any economic climate."", 'Coca-Cola has also taken advantage of its virtually unsurpassed geographic diversity. In addition to being the most-chosen brand from retail shelves for a decade running (as of 2022), according to Kantar\'s annual ""Brand Footprint"" report, it has operations in all but three countries (North Korea, Cuba, and Russia). This geographic breadth allows Coca-Cola to generate predictable cash flow in developed markets, while moving the organic growth needle in faster-growing emerging markets.', ""Oil and gas stock ExxonMobil has been paying a continuous dividend for decades longer than Coca-Cola. Records show it began sharing the wealth with its shareholders in 1882, and it's continued to do so in each of the following 142 years."", ""What's really helped ExxonMobil thrive — aside from the fact that demand for energy commodities like oil continues to increase — is its integrated operating model. Although it generates its best margins from its oil and gas drilling segment, ExxonMobil also operates refineries and chemical plants, which are able to take advantage of a decline in the spot price of crude oil. Having this hedge in place ensures steady cash flow and a robust dividend for the company's shareholders."", ""Although its dividend doesn't necessarily increase every year, drug developer Eli Lilly has been parsing out dividends without interruption since 1885. Since we can't control when we become ill or what ailment(s) we develop, demand for prescription medicines tends to be consistent regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. economy and stock market are performing."", ""What's made Eli Lilly an especially hot investment of late is the Food and Drug Administration approval of Zepbound. This once-weekly injection is a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist that's designed to help clinically obese patients lose weight."", ""But what if I told you that Coca-Cola, ExxonMobil, and Eli Lilly, don't come remotely close to surpassing the continuous dividend streak that one virtually unknown small-cap stock has amassed over the course of more than two centuries?"", 'Ladies, gentlemen, and income seekers of all ages and risk tolerances, say hello to water utility York Water (NASDAQ: YORW).', 'Whereas Coke, ExxonMobil, and Eli Lilly have global appeal and megacap valuations, York Water provides water and wastewater services in just 56 municipalities spanning four counties in South-Central Pennsylvania. It sports a market cap of only $508 million and typically sees about 58,500 of its shares exchange hands daily.', ""But one thing that's absolutely unique about this completely under-the-radar water utility is its dividend history. It's paid a consecutive dividend every year since its founding in 1816. Put another way, York has been sharing a percentage of its earnings with its shareholders since James Madison was president 208 years ago. That's 66 years longer than ExxonMobil has been paying a continuous dividend, 69 years more than Eli Lilly, and it exactly doubles up the length of time Coca-Cola has been doling out a consecutive dividend (104 years)."", 'York Water\'s not-so-subtle ""secrets"" to success are twofold. Firstly, it\'s providing a basic necessity service. If you own or rent a home, it\'s a practical certainty you\'ll need water and wastewater services. The company\'s customers don\'t change their consumption habits much from one year to the next, leading to transparent, predictable cash flow.', ""I'll also add to the above that water utilities almost always operate as monopolies or duopolies in the areas they service. This means York doesn't have to worry about a competitor swooping in and stealing its customers."", ""The other reason York Water has been such a dividend stud for more than two centuries is because it's a regulated utility. This means it can't raise rates on its customers without the approval of the state's public utility commission (in this instance, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, or PPUC)."", ""On the surface, being regulated might sound like a constraint for utilities; but it's quite the opposite.

Investors regularly turn to companies with long track records of dividend raises. A particularly elite cohort is Dividend Kings, which have paid and raised their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years.', 'Supporting a gradually rising dividend payment requires earnings growth, a strong balance sheet, and the ability to endure downturns and recessions. Illinois Tool Works (NYSE: ITW), Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) have these qualities in spades.', 'With an average yield of 2.63% among the three companies, investing $19,000 in each stock should produce $1,500 in passive income per year -- and likely more in subsequent years, considering these companies have raised their dividends every year for decades.', ""Here's why all three Dividend Kings are worth buying now."", 'Look no further than Illinois Tool Works for a near-perfect dividend stock. Commonly known as ITW, the company has put on an operational clinic by streamlining its business and achieving high margin, gradual growth.', 'Over the last decade, ITW has increased its dividend by 233%, raised its earnings by 139%, grown its operating margin to above 25%, and reduced its outstanding share count by 29% thanks to stock buybacks.', ""This is exactly what you want to see from a quality dividend stock. The dividend is steadily rising over time, the shares outstanding are slowly going down, and there's even margin expansion, which shows the business is improving in quality."", ""Not all Dividend Kings can repurchase stock and grow the dividend. ITW can do this because it operates seven highly successful segments, achieving diversification across cyclical industries. If it were too concentrated in a single industry, it would be far more challenging to steadily return capital to shareholders.\xa0ITW is trading near an all-time high, but it's a great business worth considering owning a piece of for the long term."", 'Despite being in a completely different industry, P&G is a similar investment to ITW. P&G has done an excellent job raising the dividend, buying back stock, and boosting its margin.', ""P&G hasn't repurchased stock or raised its dividend at nearly the pace of ITW. But that's mainly because ITW, as an industrial conglomerate, has more growth opportunities than P&G, which is a low-growth, stodgy consumer staples company."", ""Still, P&G's margin expansion is in a league of its own. The strategic shift came between fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2017 when P&G reduced its brand count from 170 to 65 and its product categories from 16 to 10. By focusing on its best brands (quality) instead of quantity, P&G has streamlined its supply chain and unlocked consistent pricing power. Its pricing power came in clutch over the last few years, as P&G was able to offset higher input costs due to inflation.\xa0Here's a look at P&G's operating margin compared to similar companies."", 'Having a high operating margin may not sound like a big deal. However, it can mean the difference between supporting sizable dividend raises and buybacks or maybe only negligible buybacks. P&G earned $14.8 billion in trailing-12-month (TTM) net income, spent $9.09 billion on dividends, and paid $3.9 billion on buybacks. It had repurchased $7.4 billion in stock in fiscal 2023 and plans to buy back $5 billion to $6 billion in fiscal 2024. So, some of its stock buybacks were front-loaded at the beginning of the last fiscal year, which is why the TTM buybacks look lower.', 'P&G is funding a massive dividend program and needs the high margins to support a sizable buyback program. This quality is what separates P&G from the competition.', ""Coke hasn't reduced its outstanding share count at nearly the rates of ITW and P&G. But it does have a higher yield, now at 3.3% thanks to its recent dividend raise."", ""Coke has raised its dividend at a faster rate than P&G. And despite being a smaller company, it is now paying nearly as much in dividends, with $8 billion in TTM dividends paid compared to $9.1 for P&G. Coke also has incredibly impressive margins for a beverage maker. For comparison, PepsiCo's margin is just 14.1% -- just half of Coke's margin."", 'Coke is one of the most reliable pure-play dividend stocks out there. While Coke has been and will probably continue to underperform in a market fueled by growth stocks, it does offer less downside risk than many companies. Of course, any stock could go to $0. But Coke has a recession-resilient business that tends to do well no matter the economic cycle.', ""In this vein, investing in Coke isn't necessarily about beating the market but preserving capital and generating passive income. It's a good pick if you are nearing retirement or are in retirement but may be unsuitable for investors early into their journeys or that have a high risk tolerance."", 'A common theme among ITW, P&G, and Coke is that they are high-margin, high-quality businesses that directly reward shareholders. But the market knows it. ITW and P&G both have price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios over 26.6, while Coke has a 24 P/E. Paying up for a stock sounds counterintuitive, but these companies have track records of growing into their valuations over time.', ""If you're looking for bargain-bin dividend choices, ITW, P&G, and Coke are not for you.\xa0But if you're OK with paying a premium, these three stocks are certainly worth a closer look."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Illinois Tool Works right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Illinois Tool Works, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Illinois Tool Works wasn’t one of them.

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$693.6m', 'US$692.9m', 'US$817.5m', 'US$970.7m', 'US$984.1m', 'US$999.5m', 'US$1.02b', 'US$1.04b', 'US$1.06b', 'US$1.08b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ 1.57%', 'Est @ 1.78%', 'Est @ 1.94%', 'Est @ 2.04%', 'Est @ 2.12%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.2% ', 'US$635', 'US$582', 'US$629', 'US$684', 'US$635', 'US$591', 'US$551', 'US$515', 'US$481', 'US$450', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$5.8b', ""We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period.

Relative to the current share price of US$122, the company appears quite undervalued at a 38% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.', ""Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mohawk Industries as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.493. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won\'t be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company.

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Intuit's TSR for the last 5 years was 161%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier.

Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 21% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.

Whirlpool (NYSE: WHR)\xa0and Owens Corning (NYSE: OC) match this description and I think they have the potential to do well through the year. Here's why."", ""As you can see below, the housing market (expressed here in terms of sales of existing homes) doesn't like higher interest rates, and Whirlpool's share price doesn't like a declining housing market."", 'As such, the uptick in interest rates (which push up mortgage rates) in 2024 on the back of hotter-than-anticipated inflation data is not good news for Whirlpool or, rather, sentiment over its stock.', 'During a recent presentation to investors, management outlined that a quarter of demand for appliances in the U.S. comes from discretionary demand guided by existing home sales, and a further 15% is from the construction of new homes. In other words, 40% of end demand is guided by housing market conditions.', 'As such, sentiment over the stock is going to be guided by interest rate movements. However, long-term investors should focus on the underlying improvement in the business coming from refocusing on its core North American market. Whirlpool is about to combine its European business with a subsidiary of a Turkish company, Arcelik, while taking a 25% stake in the new company -- a deal that will pull it out of Europe directly. Whirlpool also cut costs by $800 million in 2023, with a further $300 million to $400 million expected in 2024.', 'Moreover, history suggests that the interest rate cycle will turn, and so will the demand for housing. That will help management achieve its aim of growing earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin to 9% in 2026 from 6.8% in 2024. In addition, management thinks it can hit free cash flow (FCF) of $1.1 billion in 2026, representing 19.5% of the current market cap. If it gets anywhere near that figure, the stock will appreciate significantly.', ""Whirlpool's management believes that the slump in existing home sales and housing starts in the U.S. means the industry is set for a multiyear expansion."", 'If so, then investors should take a close look at roofing, insulation, and composites company Owens Corning, because its management has decided to double down on the U.S. housing market by agreeing to acquire interior and exterior door manufacturer Masonite International\xa0for an enterprise value of $4 billion.', ""While the deal comes at a hefty 38% premium to Masonite's share price, it makes sense for Owens Corning. It will strengthen its exposure to U.S. housing, making it a market leader in residential building materials. Owens Corning and Masonite sell to the same types of customers (builders, contractors, distributors, home centers, homeowners, etc.), so there's an obvious opportunity to generate revenue synergies -- meaning the combined company can make more sales than the two would as individual entities."", 'However, since it is harder to make assumptions about revenue synergies, acquiring companies usually outline cost synergies (e.g., sharing sourcing and supply chain and sales, general, and administrative costs), and here Owens Corning believes it can generate $125 million in cost synergy by the end of the second year.', 'Including those synergies means Owens Corning is buying Masonite at a value of 6.8 times earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) rather than the 8.6 times estimated Masonite 2023 EBITDA at the time of the deal.', 'Moreover, management believes the cash flow generated by the new company will enable it to reduce its net debt-to-EBITDA level to just 2 times EBITDA at the end of 2024. In the meantime, the company is conducting a strategic review of its industrial-focused glass reinforcement business, a move that could signal the sale of a non-core business.', 'If Owens Corning is right and the new company hits $2.9 billion in EBITDA, and the housing market returns to more normal conditions, such as in 2010-2020, the stock could have significant upside if it returns to the kind of enterprise value (market cap plus net debt) to EBITDA levels achieved in that period.', 'For example, 8 times EBITDA of $2.9 billion would give the combined company a market cap of $23 billion compared to the $13 billion that Owens Corning currently trades at and the enterprise value of $4 billion its paying for Masonite.', 'All told, Whirlpool and Owens Corning are highly attractive stocks for investors who believe a bull market in housing is coming around the corner.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Whirlpool right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Whirlpool, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Whirlpool wasn’t one of them.

According to one of Power’s representatives, people in Los Angeles are apparently paying less than the folks in America’s Finest City.', 'I know firsthand – it’s an ugly situation. At the same time, SRE could very well be one of the stocks to buy for a market downturn.', 'Like it or not, people will put up with this dynamic because you’re not going to find San Diego-like weather in say Cleveland. It’s the sunshine tax and Sempra will get its cut.', 'Source: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com', 'When it comes to stocks to buy for a market downturn, entities like Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) make much sense on paper. In a world of rising biological threats, pharmaceutical companies only become more relevant. Further, with chronic diseases imposing a major societal burden, people are desperately hoping for medical solutions. Here, PFE stock seems particularly compelling.', 'It’s not just about the science. We all know about Pfizer’s success with its Covid-19 vaccine. Moving forward, it can leverage the acumen gleaned in producing a messenger-RNA-based solution for therapeutics for other diseases and conditions. However, because PFE rose so much thanks to Covid, when the pandemic faded, so too did its share price.', 'Actually, PFE plunged. However, this circumstance could be a positive in that again, the bears may have moved on. If so, another downturn might not destroy its market value like it might for its lofty peers.', 'Presently, analysts peg shares a consensus moderate buy with a $31.88 average price target.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com', 'Since the doldrums of 2020 to late 2021, investors seemingly couldn’t get enough of NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE). As a utility giant pivoting aggressively to renewable energy solutions over the past several years, NextEra aligned itself with contemporary considerations. These days, seemingly everybody’s talking about green and renewable energy infrastructures. However, the inflation and subsequent rise in interest rates in 2022 onward did a number on NEE stock.', 'Further, the pain has continued into this year. Sure, there have been some signs of optimism, particularly with the Federal Reserve indicating that it may lower interest rates later this year. However, inflation has proven to be stickier than previously anticipated. Therefore, NEE has largely struggled. Still, the current frustration could make NEE one of the stocks to buy for a market downturn.', 'Again, the bears might see other companies as more compelling victims. With NEE already losing so much value, the risk-reward proposition might not favor short traders. Also, NextEra remains relevant, irrespective of market or economic fluctuations. Not surprisingly, analysts remain bullish with a moderate buy view and a $68.89 average price target.', 'Source: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock', 'As the world’s largest gold-mining corporation, Newmont (NYSE:NEM) commands substantial relevancies. If we’re talking about stocks to buy for a market downturn, it can’t be avoided that the underlying asset tends to perform well during periods of uncertainty. That’s called the fear trade. Further, with gold commanding intrinsic value, Newmont in an indirect fashion could act as an inflation hedge.', 'However, speculators may be able to buy NEM stock confidently ahead of a possible downturn. How so? Basically, Newmont has already lost so much. Since the beginning of the year, shares slipped almost 24%. Over the past one-year period, the security tumbled more than 29%. To be fair, the gold space has been choppy. Still, NEM has been unusually volatile.', 'Looking ahead, though, analysts foresee a recovery. In the current year, they project sales of $21.95 billion, up 37.3% from last year. In 2025, they believe revenue of $23.3 billion is possible. Overall, Wall Street’s experts peg shares as a consensus moderate buy with a $44.13 price target. That’s over 41% higher than current levels.', 'Source: Miriam Doerr Martin Frommherz via Shutterstock', 'An almost unique idea in the market, EZCorp (NASDAQ:EZPW) represents one of the few publicly traded pawn shops. Believe it or not, pawn shops do more than act as a backdrop for reality TV programs. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), an estimated 4.5% of the U.S. households (or about 5.9 million people) were unbanked in 2021. That means no one in the household had a checking or savings account.', 'Well, many folks who are unbanked turn to pawn shops for what is essentially credit. In a typical banking relationship, a customer may borrow money from the financial institution. Bad things – like getting your credit wrecked – occur when people fail to make good on their loans. In the case of pawn shops, patrons put up their physical possessions as collateral for loans.', 'It’s quite possible that if the economy takes a bad turn, pawn shop operators like EZCorp could thrive. Therefore, it ranks as one of the possible stocks to buy for a market downturn.

The segment mainly focuses on the U.S. markets. The end uses of Vulcan’s aggregates include public construction (such as highways, walkways, airport runways, parking lots and railroads) as well as private residential (single-family houses, duplexes, apartment buildings and condominiums) and private non-residential (manufacturing, retail, offices, industrial and institutional) construction. Aggregates inter-segment sales accounted for 6.8% of its total revenues.Asphalt Mix (14.7%): The Asphalt Mix segment produces and sells asphalt mix in Alabama, Arizona, California, New Mexico, Tennessee and Texas.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growth stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Kings To Invest In For Safe Dividend Growth.\xa0', ""Dividend stocks are investors’ favorites, particularly ones that demonstrate a capacity to raise their dividend payments over an extended period. Dividend kings stand out in this regard as these companies have increased their payouts for 50 consecutive years or more. This indicates that numerous companies are inclined to regularly increase their dividends due to investors' preferences. One of the main reasons for this growth is the strong cash position of many high-quality companies. As reported by Harvard Business Review, non-banking U.S. companies have substantially boosted their cash reserves, reaching a staggering $6.9 trillion, exceeding the GDP of nearly all countries worldwide. Despite rising interest rates, cash holdings now constitute a significant portion, with $1 out of every $5 in total assets held by non-banking U.S. firms."", 'When investing in dividend stocks, investors are often faced with the dilemma of dividend yields and dividend growth. Analysts advise not to fall for yield traps and consider stocks that offer yields between 3% to 4%. Yields above this range may sometimes signal that the dividend payout is unsustainable or that the company is facing challenges. Brian Bollinger, president of Simply Safe Dividends, spoke with CNBC about ideal dividend yields and their significance. He suggested focusing on excellent businesses that could offer a dividend yield of around 3% to 4%. He explained that these companies tend to increase their dividend payments consistently, which helps increase yearly income and counteract the impact of inflation. Here are some other comments from the analyst:', '“When stock prices fall, it’s so easy to panic, but dividend investing can overcome that because you’re just trying to stay focused on your income stream. You don’t care so much about the market’s short-term ups and downs anymore.”', 'S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has shown strong returns over the years, outperforming other asset classes despite market conditions. A ProShares report has presented a rather interesting take on investing in the index, particularly for income investors. The report mentioned that the index has consistently surpassed the performance of the S&P 500 while experiencing reduced levels of market volatility since its inception. This could mean that an initial investment of $10,000 made in May 2005 could potentially grow to over $61,000 by March 2023. The report further mentioned that the Dividend Aristocrats Index has demonstrated superior performance compared to the S&P 500 in eight out of the ten most significant quarterly downturns since 2005.', ""In 2023, dividend stocks encountered a phase of weaker performance due to a notable rise in yields, largely driven by the Federal Reserve's successive interest rate hikes. Nonetheless, expectations suggest a change in the outlook for income investing in 2024. Analysts at Lord Abbett predict that as the economy slows down, companies with solid balance sheets, good cash flow, and durable dividends will do better. Some of the best dividend kings include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).

Less than four and a half years later, it's the core strength of GE Vernova, a company set to be spun off on April 2. Here's a look at the business in light of the recent Investor Day presentation and what investors can expect from the company."", ""In a previous article on GE Vernova, I outlined the company's revenue breakout, earnings trajectory, importance of its wind business, and impressive financial profile. Now, it's time to turn to management's updated guidance for the company."", ""The first thing to note is that the company looks highly attractive based on management's guidance. Let's focus on earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the moment, playing with the guidance in the table below. We'll assume a 6% EBITDA margin in 2024 and then 7% in 2025 while using the midpoints of revenue guidance. That results in EBITDA rising from $0.6 billion in 2023, to $2.1 billion in 2024, and then $2.5 billion in 2025."", ""It's a similar story for strong free-cash-flow (FCF) growth from just $0.1 billion to $1.6 billion at the midpoint of 2025 guidance."", 'Metric', '2022', '2023', '2024', '2025', 'By 2028', 'Revenue', '$29.7 billion', '$33.2 billion', '$34 billion to $35 billion', 'Mid-single-digit organic growth', 'Mid-single-digit organic growth', 'Adjusted EBITDA margin', '(1.4%)', '1.7%', 'High end of mid-single digits', 'Low end of high single digits', '10%', 'Free cash flow', '($0.6 billion)', '$0.1 billion', '$0.7 billion to $1.1 billion', '$1.2 billion to $1.8 billion', '90%-110% conversion from net income', 'Data source: General Electric presentations.', ""There are the numbers, and then there's the level of belief in the numbers. The good news is there's reason to think GE can hit the numbers discussed above. Here's a look at the EBITDA for each of the three businesses in 2023."", 'Wind, notably offshore wind, is a business in recovery mode. I\'ll discuss it more in a moment; note that management believes it will be ""approaching profitability"" at the end of 2024 -- a significant improvement over 2023.', 'GE Business', '2023 EBITDA', 'Power', '$1.7 billion', 'Wind', '($1 billion)', 'Electrification', '$0.2 billion', 'Data source: General Electric presentations.', ""I'm focusing on power and electrification for now. The power business is expected to grow revenue by mid-single digits in 2024, with margin expansion in tow, which could lead to $1.95 billion in EBITDA."", ""One reason GE can get there comes down to its $73 billion backlog, containing 81% of higher-margin services. That's a significant success story for the overall GE turnaround effort, as management set about improving its services business in light of the need to adjust to lower gas turbine equipment demand growth rates."", ""In contrast, the electrification business is a growth business and a beneficiary of the electrification of everything trend. Its grid solutions and software help integrate renewable energy into the grid and improve the quality and stability of the grid in general. Management sees it as a low-double-digit growth business in 2024, and a conservative estimate of its EBITDA (based on management's guidance) sees it rising to $0.35 billion."", ""As previously noted, the wind business combines a now-profitable onshore wind business and a loss-making offshore wind business. The latter has been a tough place in recent years, as soaring raw material and logistics costs have crushed profitability on contracts won in less inflationary times. It's no coincidence that GE's rivals Vestas and Siemens Gamesa (part of Siemens Energy) have both suffered the same fate."", 'That said, management is working down the equipment backlog in offshore wind (from $6 billion at the start of 2023 to $4 billion at the end of it) while being highly selective over new contracts in offshore wind and continuing to improve profitability in onshore wind, notably in its core U.S. market.', 'Management believes the overall wind business will be profitable in 2025.', 'Culp and GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik took a pragmatic approach to deal with the slowdown in the gas turbine equipment business, focusing on gas services and restructuring the wind business in the face of severe cost pressures.', ""As such, GE Vernova is set up to increase profit significantly in the coming years. Based on the conservative estimate of $2.1 billion in EBITDA in 2024 shown above, assuming an enterprise value of 11 times EBITDA and $4.2 billion in cash, GE Vernova is fairly valued at around $27.3 billion. That's a number to look out for when it starts trading on April 2."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in General Electric right now?', 'Before you buy stock in General Electric, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and General Electric wasn’t one of them.

With so many stocks surging, investors might wonder if there are still opportunities in the market today.', ""Financial stocks can make a solid addition to investors' portfolios. They can provide diversification into companies with stellar cash flows and track records of success. Here are three top-notch finance stocks to buy this March."", ""When it comes to solid returns over the long haul, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) is one of the best. Under CEO Warren Buffett's leadership, the conglomerate has delivered annualized returns of nearly 20% over the past 59 years."", ""The stock has been a beacon of stability. One way to look at a stock's stability is its beta, which measures the stock's correlation with a benchmark index, such as the S&P 500. A beta over 1 means a stock is more volatile than the benchmark, while a beta under 1 is less volatile. Over the past decade, Berkshire's beta has been 0.63."", ""Although you don't want to get caught up in one metric, Berkshire's low beta is a testament to the stability of its business model. It owns numerous companies across retail, railroads, materials, construction, and insurance. These are a stellar source of cash flow for the conglomerate and help feed its growing cash pile. Today, Berkshire has a $371 billion portfolio across 45 stocks."", ""And Berkshire takes a prudent approach to managing its cash flow, which provides the business with strong stability. Today, it has a record cash pile of $168 billion. Given the stellar financial foundation and investing acumen of Buffett and his team, it's a solid stock to buy and hold."", 'Progressive (NYSE: PGR) is another excellent long-term performer that can provide stability to a portfolio. The insurance company has dominated the industry for decades, consistently posting industry-beating profitability with its policies.', ""One reason for Progressive's success is its long-term focus on writing profitable policies. When the company went public in 1971, CEO Peter Lewis prioritized turning an underwriting profit."", ""At the time, it was commonly accepted that insurers didn't profit from their policies but made money from their investment portfolios. Lewis eschewed that thinking and set a companywide goal to earn $4 on every $100 in premiums the insurer took in."", 'This profit motive set the foundation for Progressive underwriting the most profitable policies it could, even if it meant forgoing drivers who wanted lower-cost coverage. Over the past 23 years, the insurer has achieved its goal of $4 profit on every $100 in policies and delivered annual returns of 17.7%, crushing the S&P 500 in the process. The company is in good position to continue performing and can make an excellent addition to your portfolio.', 'Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ: IBKR) is a stock brokerage that has achieved stellar growth over the past few years. Since 2017, Interactive has grown its customer count from 483,000 to 2.56 million, a 430% increase.', 'Its growth is due to its appeal to tech-savvy customers and its low-cost trading platform. Many of its senior managers have a background in software engineering and focus on automating as much of its business as possible.', 'As a result, the company offers some of the lowest commissions in the industry. It has also done a good job attracting more customers amid higher interest rates because of its 4.8% yield on uninvested cash.', 'By automating its platform and leveraging its expertise, Interactive Brokers has achieved appealing profit margins and stellar bottom-line growth. Not only that, but the stock is priced reasonably at 19.3 times earnings and looks like another excellent stock to buy this March.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

If you would like to skip our detailed analysis of the topic, you can go directly to the 10 Unhappiest Cities in America.', 'According to a 2022 report published by Oracle, 45% of people have not felt true happiness for more than two years, while 25% have forgotten what it means to feel truly happy. While happiness is subjective, several factors play a part in making people unhappy.\xa0', 'For instance, a research paper by NBER finds that the population density of an area and happiness in communities are closely linked. It finds that average population density in the 20% of most miserable communities in Canada was more than eight times greater than in the happiest 20% of communities. Therefore concluding that living in highly dense cities like metropolitan areas reduces average happiness levels.', 'Additionally, economic well-being has a major effect on happiness as well, especially in urban living. Although there is a common perception that cities offer amenities that lead to happiness, there’s evidence that urban living does not necessarily mean more happiness in individuals.\xa0', 'According to the NIH study, happiness and well-being increase as income increases. In the study, the researchers decided to look at incomes above and below $100,000 per year. They found out that those American participants making less than $100,000 per year get unhappier as income decreases. On the contrary, those making more than $100,000 per year are less miserable, and once incomes cross $100,000 per year and people make more money, the level of peak happiness grows even faster.\xa0', 'However, while higher income does buy you happiness, other mental-health deteriorating factors in cities, like high costs of living, greater inequality, social isolation, noise, and pollution, can offset the benefits of higher incomes. But for many people, especially Gen Z and Millennials, emotional and physical well-being is more important than job perks such as high salary. According to the Securian Financial survey, 73% of Generation Z and 74% of Millennial employees have utilized the mental health benefits that their employers offered.\xa0', 'People are realizing now more than ever before the importance of happiness and its effect on their emotional and physical well-being. Happiness brings out positive emotions, produces a pleasant mood, and makes your attitude soft towards yourself and others around you. Additionally, happiness protects the heart physically by lowering heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormone levels. Safe to say, happiness is not only a state of mind but also a crucial component for maintaining physical health.', 'However, many cities in the United States lack factors that would make residents happy, such as pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. The lack of such infrastructure discourages physical activity among the residents, and further hurts the air quality of the area by promoting high use of vehicles. Moreover, the lack of affordable healthcare services is also a significant factor contributing to unhappiness among the residents. Some of the leading healthcare companies that are actively investing in urban areas include Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).', 'Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is one of the leading companies in investing in diagnostics, and healthcare solutions. It made huge investments at the peak of COVID-19, such as opening a new cGMP plasmid DNA manufacturing facility in Carlsbad, California, in 2021. Earlier in the same year, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) announced more than $600 million in capital investments to expand its bioprocessing production capabilities through 2022. Moreover, in 2022, the company announced a $59 million investment in Kentucky’s healthcare sector, which will create 200 full-time jobs that will pay an average of $41 per hour.\xa0', 'Meanwhile, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), an American multinational health insurance and services company, made significant investments in cities in the United States, focusing on various initiatives to address community needs. One of the notable investments includes a $25 million commitment to the Healthy Neighborhoods Equity Fund II (HNEF II) in Boston to finance mixed-use developments that offer retail, housing, and social services. The aim behind this investment is to promote healthier communities. UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) recognizes that access to affordable housing will improve community health outcomes and help people live healthier and happier lives.', 'On the other hand, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has a strong reputation for various initiatives and healthcare investments. A couple of days ago (March 7, 2024), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) announced a successful acquisition of a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, Ambrx Biopharma, Inc.

The program will likely be more limited than COVID-19 pandemic-era relief, and the regulator is considering requests for advance payments on a case-by-case basis.', 'Overall, providers’ credit impact will depend on how delays in payment affect cash flow needed to meet its expenses, Moody’s said. Providers with weak liquidity before the cyberattack are more likely to run out of cash, and those that rely on Change alone for filing claims are also at higher risk.', '“Providers with small scale, a weak financial profile, who only use Change and have little headroom in meeting debt covenants stand to suffer the most from the disruption,” Kailash Chhaya, vice president and senior analyst at Moody’s, wrote in the note. “Larger providers with more resources are in a better position to weather cash flow difficulties.”', 'Bigger and more geographically dispersed providers are more likely to use more than one clearinghouse, which would mitigate the impact of the courage.

You can skip our detailed analysis of NASDAQ stocks and the performance of dividend stocks over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy.\xa0', ""The NASDAQ, which primarily consists of technology-related stocks, has been experiencing upward momentum since the previous year. In 2023, it saw remarkable growth, achieving its strongest performance since 2020 with an increase of over 43%. As of March 7, it has gained 10.21%, surpassing the broader market's gain of 8.72% this year so far. Notably, according to Jonathan Krinsky, a leading market analyst at BTIG, the NASDAQ-100, which is heavily concentrated in tech, has endured 303 consecutive trading sessions without experiencing a decline of 2.5% or more as of March 5, marking it as the third-longest period without such a significant pullback since 1990. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of the best dividend stocks listed on the index."", ""The impressive performance of NASDAQ can be largely attributed to the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, which has driven up the prices of major technology stocks and boosted the overall market throughout 2023 and into the current year. Additionally, the easing of inflation and the Federal Reserve's indication of potential rate cuts later in 2024 have further supported NASDAQ's rebound from the challenges it faced in 2022. Despite the prevalence of technology companies in the NASDAQ index, many companies offer dividends to shareholders. A notable recent addition to the list of dividend-paying companies in the index is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), which made headlines in February of this year by declaring its inaugural dividend. This move marks a significant milestone for the technology sector, which has long been dominated by a select few companies for more than a decade."", ""Meta's decision to offer a dividend serves as evidence that investors are increasingly interested in dividend-paying stocks for their capacity to provide consistent and reliable income. This trend was evident in 2023 when companies in the US distributed record dividends to their shareholders. According to a report by Janus Henderson, the S&P 500 paid out an all-time high of $70.30 per share last year, a notable increase from $66.92 in 2022. This resulted in a total payment to shareholders reaching a record $588.2 billion, surpassing the previous year's figure of $564.6 billion. The report also mentioned that there were 707 instances of dividend increases reported in the fourth quarter of 2023. These increases amounted to a total of $17.5 billion for the quarter, showing an uptick from the $16.3 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022."", ""Furthermore, dividend-paying stocks have historically delivered robust returns. Since 1960, dividends have contributed to approximately one-third of the market's total return. Dividend stocks offer a degree of stability during periods of increased market volatility. According to a report by Perkins Coie, a Washington-based law firm, dividend-paying stocks exhibit 30%-33% lower volatility compared to non-dividend-paying stocks. This stability has been particularly notable during turbulent decades like the 1930s and 2000s, where dividend-paying stocks served as a buffer against significant declines in market prices. In addition to this, dividend-paying companies that consistently increase their dividends can provide better protection against inflation than bonds in an inflationary environment."", 'In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks listed on NASDAQ.', 'Photo by nick chong on Unsplash', 'Our Methodology:', 'For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 933 hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2023 and selected companies that are trading on the NASDAQ exchange and also pay dividends to shareholders.

Invest $19,000 Into Each of These 3 Dividend Kings",Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/2670fe42-481a-308a-ba18-1e4620dcdfa5/want-%241%2C500-in-passive-income.html,1710081240,STORY,"['PG', 'ITW', 'KO']","['Generating steady streams of passive income, no matter what the market is doing, is one of the simplest, low-stress ways to compound wealth over time. Investors regularly turn to companies with long track records of dividend raises. A particularly elite cohort is Dividend Kings, which have paid and raised their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years.', 'Supporting a gradually rising dividend payment requires earnings growth, a strong balance sheet, and the ability to endure downturns and recessions. Illinois Tool Works (NYSE: ITW), Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) have these qualities in spades.', 'With an average yield of 2.63% among the three companies, investing $19,000 in each stock should produce $1,500 in passive income per year -- and likely more in subsequent years, considering these companies have raised their dividends every year for decades.', ""Here's why all three Dividend Kings are worth buying now."", 'Look no further than Illinois Tool Works for a near-perfect dividend stock. Commonly known as ITW, the company has put on an operational clinic by streamlining its business and achieving high margin, gradual growth.', 'Over the last decade, ITW has increased its dividend by 233%, raised its earnings by 139%, grown its operating margin to above 25%, and reduced its outstanding share count by 29% thanks to stock buybacks.', ""This is exactly what you want to see from a quality dividend stock. The dividend is steadily rising over time, the shares outstanding are slowly going down, and there's even margin expansion, which shows the business is improving in quality."", ""Not all Dividend Kings can repurchase stock and grow the dividend. ITW can do this because it operates seven highly successful segments, achieving diversification across cyclical industries. If it were too concentrated in a single industry, it would be far more challenging to steadily return capital to shareholders.\xa0ITW is trading near an all-time high, but it's a great business worth considering owning a piece of for the long term."", 'Despite being in a completely different industry, P&G is a similar investment to ITW. P&G has done an excellent job raising the dividend, buying back stock, and boosting its margin.', ""P&G hasn't repurchased stock or raised its dividend at nearly the pace of ITW. But that's mainly because ITW, as an industrial conglomerate, has more growth opportunities than P&G, which is a low-growth, stodgy consumer staples company."", ""Still, P&G's margin expansion is in a league of its own. The strategic shift came between fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2017 when P&G reduced its brand count from 170 to 65 and its product categories from 16 to 10. By focusing on its best brands (quality) instead of quantity, P&G has streamlined its supply chain and unlocked consistent pricing power. Its pricing power came in clutch over the last few years, as P&G was able to offset higher input costs due to inflation.\xa0Here's a look at P&G's operating margin compared to similar companies."", 'Having a high operating margin may not sound like a big deal. However, it can mean the difference between supporting sizable dividend raises and buybacks or maybe only negligible buybacks. P&G earned $14.8 billion in trailing-12-month (TTM) net income, spent $9.09 billion on dividends, and paid $3.9 billion on buybacks. It had repurchased $7.4 billion in stock in fiscal 2023 and plans to buy back $5 billion to $6 billion in fiscal 2024. So, some of its stock buybacks were front-loaded at the beginning of the last fiscal year, which is why the TTM buybacks look lower.', 'P&G is funding a massive dividend program and needs the high margins to support a sizable buyback program. This quality is what separates P&G from the competition.', ""Coke hasn't reduced its outstanding share count at nearly the rates of ITW and P&G. But it does have a higher yield, now at 3.3% thanks to its recent dividend raise."", ""Coke has raised its dividend at a faster rate than P&G. And despite being a smaller company, it is now paying nearly as much in dividends, with $8 billion in TTM dividends paid compared to $9.1 for P&G. Coke also has incredibly impressive margins for a beverage maker. For comparison, PepsiCo's margin is just 14.1% -- just half of Coke's margin."", 'Coke is one of the most reliable pure-play dividend stocks out there. While Coke has been and will probably continue to underperform in a market fueled by growth stocks, it does offer less downside risk than many companies. Of course, any stock could go to $0. But Coke has a recession-resilient business that tends to do well no matter the economic cycle.', ""In this vein, investing in Coke isn't necessarily about beating the market but preserving capital and generating passive income. It's a good pick if you are nearing retirement or are in retirement but may be unsuitable for investors early into their journeys or that have a high risk tolerance."", 'A common theme among ITW, P&G, and Coke is that they are high-margin, high-quality businesses that directly reward shareholders. But the market knows it. ITW and P&G both have price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios over 26.6, while Coke has a 24 P/E. Paying up for a stock sounds counterintuitive, but these companies have track records of growing into their valuations over time.', ""If you're looking for bargain-bin dividend choices, ITW, P&G, and Coke are not for you.\xa0But if you're OK with paying a premium, these three stocks are certainly worth a closer look."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Illinois Tool Works right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Illinois Tool Works, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Illinois Tool Works wasn’t one of them.

Investors can achieve excellent long-term returns in this way, even by owning mostly large index funds that mirror the performance of the S&P 500.', ""You can bolster these returns with individual stocks that outperform the wider market, of course. And by choosing successful businesses with strong finances, you'll maximize your chances to generate wealth over the decades. Let's look at a few of these standout stocks that can make growth an easier process for your retirement portfolio."", ""Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) has most of the ingredients you could want in a long-term stock holding. The company dominates dozens of product categories with goods consumers use daily, giving shareholders stability through a wide range of selling environments. Its market leadership position confers big financial benefits, too, in the form of faster growth and higher profitability. Compare its 24% operating profit margin with Kimberly-Clark's 15% rate, for example."", ""It hasn't been all good news for P&G's business lately, as sales volumes dipped into negative territory last year. But its pricing power offset that decline, allowing overall organic sales to continue rising. Management is projecting another year of modest growth ahead in fiscal 2024."", ""Investors can take advantage of Wall Street's lack of enthusiasm about that growth to pick up P&G's shares at a discount today since the stock sat out most of the rally in the past year."", ""If you have more of an appetite for risk, consider adding Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) stock to your retirement portfolio. The tech giant has already produced many millionaires on its way to its current $3 trillion market capitalization. But don't let that eye-popping valuation scare you away from Microsoft's stock."", 'After all, growth is still going strong at 16% in the most recent quarter. Microsoft is seeing big gains in its core cloud services segment but has also returned to growth in the personal computing segment. Its recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard helped its gaming segment soar through late December.', ""Investors who prioritize cash flow will love this business, which generated $49 billion of operating cash in the past six months compared to $34 billion a year earlier. These wins will allow for robust cash returns through dividends and stock buybacks in the years to come, amplifying investors' total returns from here."", ""Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) looks like a growth stock that's just getting started on a long expansion journey. The e-commerce infrastructure specialist is building on its roughly 10% market share in the U.S., with sales jumping 26% in 2023. Cash flow and profit margins took big steps higher last year, too, with help from the company's sale of its expensive logistics segment."", 'There\'s every reason to expect more of the same in 2024. ""We look to build on the momentum that we achieved in 2023 and continue to deliver both top-line growth and profitability,"" CFO Jeff Hoffmeister said in mid-February.', ""As you might expect, the stock's valuation has jumped in response to this good news. You'll have to pay 14 times sales to own Shopify today compared to 10 times sales a year ago."", ""Still, that premium won't matter much in a decade or more if the company can keep generating higher transaction volumes while improving its financial strength. Watching the stock for a pullback might be the best strategy if you're worried about its high valuation. But having a long holding period in mind reduces the risk of overpaying for a successful growth stock like this."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Procter & Gamble right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Procter & Gamble, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Procter & Gamble wasn’t one of them.

It has deftly navigated difficult operating environments before. And so far, it has done an excellent job in the face of high inflation this time around.', 'But fiscal 2024 second-quarter results hint that the consumer staples icon could be facing a tougher future.', ""In fiscal 2023, P&G's organic sales were rock-solid even in the face of fast-rising costs, thanks to a spike in inflation. To put some numbers on that, in the first quarter of that year, organic sales rose 7%; in the second quarter, 5%; the third quarter, 7%, and the year ended with 8% growth in the fourth quarter. That was followed by 7% growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Pricing has been a big driver of growth, as P&G passes on rising costs to consumers."", 'That said, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, volume fell 1%, meaning that price increases were the only reason for the increase in organic growth. With fiscal second-quarter earnings now out, the trend has subtly shifted. Organic sales were up just 4% with volume down 1%.', ""Again, price was the main driver of organic sales growth, but it was the lowest growth in a year and a half. That's not a great sign and suggests that consumers could be starting to push back against rising prices."", 'If you own P&G or are looking at it, here are three things you need to watch in the quarters ahead.', ""The normal approach to rising inflation is for consumer staples companies like P&G to raise prices. Customers usually pull back, which shows up as lower volume. And then, as consumers get accustomed to the new prices, volume starts to increase again. Organic volume hasn't been that strong for around six months at this point. That's not a great sign for P&G."", ""As you examine the next few quarters of earnings results, you'll want to make sure that volume doesn't start to decline at a faster clip. Of note, volume fell 4% in the company's healthcare business in the fiscal second quarter. Management provided logical reasons for that drop, but it could also be the canary in the coal mine."", 'So far, price increases have allowed P&G to maintain an upward trajectory in organic sales growth. But if volume trends are weak, it might be forced to shift gears.', 'The big fear for investors should be a market-share battle with peers that leads to price cuts. This could result in a downward spiral for the entire consumer staples industry, which would take even strong brand owners like P&G along with it.', 'Organic sales growth slowed dramatically between the fiscal first and second quarters of 2024. If it keeps falling, P&G could be in for some rough sledding.', ""One of the things that separates P&G from the pack is its focus on creating new and improved products. Basically, it isn't simply charging higher prices for the same thing. It is trying to earn the higher prices it is charging by offering product improvements and entirely new products."", ""This is what has long driven strong market-share performance. But things haven't been going so well with its market share of late."", ""In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the company was able to increase market share in 38 of the 50 category/country combinations it tracks. That fell to 31 in the fiscal first quarter of 2024 and dropped again to 28 in the second quarter. If P&G's ability to distinguish its products from that pack continues to slip, it will get harder to continue growing organic sales."", 'Procter & Gamble is a well-run company, and even well-run companies go through hard times. So a slowdown in performance is hardly the worst thing that could happen.', ""But this doesn't change the fact that the operating environment appears to be getting more difficult. That, in turn, is likely to affect the company's performance and the stock price."", ""If you own this Dividend King, you should be looking past the headlines to watch the finer details, including volume, organic sales, and the company's ability to differentiate its products from the competition."", ""If you don't own it, you'll want to monitor the same things, with the notion that a performance shortfall could potentially open up a long-term buying opportunity."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Procter & Gamble right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Procter & Gamble, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Procter & Gamble wasn’t one of them.

Over the past year, the energy major has seen its stock price decline more than 10% compared with the S&P 500's increase of 21%.The supermajor – with 60% liquids-weighted production – is highly exposed to the perils of oil price fluctuations. The drop in downstream segment earnings as a fallout of lower margins is a concern too while reserve replacement ratio remains weak, indicating challenges in replenishing produced energy.Moreover, it has been experiencing an increase in costs as a percentage of revenue.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Most Reliable Dividend Stocks To Buy.\xa0', 'During times of economic turmoil, investors often shift their attention toward dividend stocks, which provide regular income streams. The reliability of these stocks depends on factors such as their historical growth performance, cash flow stability, payout ratios, and overall financial health reflected in their balance sheets. Among these, dividend growth emerges as the most important factor when considering investing in dividend stocks. Moreover, historical returns have shown the outperformance of dividend growth strategies over an average dividend stock. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, outperformed the broader market with lower volatility over the long run. The report also mentioned that the index demonstrates its capacity to offer downside protection through its upside and downside capture ratios. The index surpassed the performance of the S&P 500 in down months 69.34% of the time and in up months 43.61% of the time.', 'Dividend stocks that offer both a substantial yield and a track record of consistent dividend growth strike a balance between distributing dividends to shareholders and reinvesting capital into future growth endeavors. Nuveen reported FactSet data which showed that dividends per share rose by 5% in the S&P 500, and it is anticipated that there will be similar growth in 2024 based on consensus estimates. In addition to this, over 325 companies within the index either raised their dividends per share or introduced a dividend over the past year.', 'As mentioned earlier, the payout ratio holds a significant importance when assessing the dependability of dividend stocks. Companies with high payout ratios may face challenges in future growth, which could jeopardize both stock price appreciation and dividend growth. Fortunately, the S&P 500’s dividend payout ratio remains below its long-term average. Consensus estimates also indicate an 11% growth in earnings per share for 2024, which should support attractive returns for shareholders. Moreover, companies are maintaining substantial cash reserves on their balance sheets, with cash totaling roughly $2 trillion as of September 2023, nearing the highest levels in two decades.', ""Though dividend stocks didn’t perform as well as the broader market in 2024, analysts have given a positive stance about dividend equities this year. Goldman Sachs has raised its forecast for dividend payouts in the S&P 500. The firm stated that there has been a surge in investors' attraction towards dividend-paying stocks following Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s recent announcement of its inaugural quarterly dividend. The firm’s analysts noted this heightened interest and consequently revised their forecast for the S&P 500's dividend-per-share payout, increasing it from 4% to 6%. Another reason contributing to the optimism regarding dividends among Goldman's team is the trend of major US corporations consistently exceeding Wall Street's earnings expectations during the last quarter of 2023. Considering investors’ inclination toward dividend stocks, companies are steadily increasing their payouts. Goldman reported that since the beginning of 2024, 56 companies within the S&P 500 index have increased their dividends, with a median increase of 6%. Among these, financial firms and industrial companies, totaling 10 and nine respectively, have played a significant role in driving the overall increase."", 'Some of the best dividend stocks that have raised their dividends for decades and have strong balance sheets include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).

(NASDAQ: REGN) announced the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has extended the approval of Praluent® (alirocumab) as an adjunct to diet and other low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering therapies to include pediatric patients aged 8 and older with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH).', '“Many children with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) are able to substantially improve their LDL-C (bad cholesterol) with currently available therapies. But for those children whose LDL-C remains dangerously high, this approval is an important milestone as it gives these children and their families an additional option to help reduce and manage their LDL-C levels much earlier in their lives,” said\xa0Mary P. McGowan, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of the Family Heart Foundation.', 'Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited condition caused by mutations in one of several genes that control how the body processes cholesterol, which can lead to very high levels of LDL-C (bad cholesterol). FH can come in two forms: HeFH, which develops when one mutated gene is inherited from one parent; and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), which develops when a mutated gene is inherited from both parents. Praluent is approved to treat both children and adults with HeFH and adults with HoFH.', 'The approval is based on a Phase 3, randomized multicenter trial evaluating pediatric patients aged 8 to 17 with HeFH, who had LDL-C levels of 130mg/dL or greater and were already being treated with lipid-lowering medications. Patients were randomized to receive Praluent (N=101) or placebo (N=52) every two or four weeks in two consecutive cohorts. Patients who received Praluent every four weeks had 31% lower LDL-C than placebo at 24 weeks (97.5% Confidence Interval: -45.0% to -17.9%; p<0.0001). Improvements in additional key lipid parameters were also observed. Results from the trial were recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics.', 'No new adverse reactions were identified in this trial, and the safety profile was consistent with the safety profile observed in adults with HeFH. Across Praluent trials in patients with primary hyperlipidemia (N=2,476), the most common adverse reactions (≥5%) more frequently observed with Praluent than placebo have been injection site reactions (7%), and influenza (6%) and diarrhea (5%).', '“The approval of Praluent for the treatment of high cholesterol was a historic landmark achievement, as it was the first approved therapy targeting the genetically-validated PCSK9 target for heart disease,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Board co-Chair, President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron, and a principal inventor of Praluent. “Praluent has made a meaningful impact in the treatment of adults with familial hypercholesterolemia, and we are proud that our innovation will now be able to help appropriate children with the heterozygous form of this disease manage their dangerously high levels of LDL-C.”', 'About the Praluent HeFH Pediatric TrialThe randomized multicenter Phase 3 trial consisted of a 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluating the efficacy and safety of Praluent in pediatric patients aged 8 to 17 years with HeFH (N=79). The primary endpoint was the percent change in LDL-C from baseline to week 24 in the Praluent and placebo treated patients. At baseline, patients were on a low-fat diet and being treated with background lipid-lowering therapy. In the trial, patients were randomized 2:1 to receive Praluent or placebo every 2 or 4 weeks. The Praluent dose was based on body weight.', ""About PraluentPraluent inhibits the binding of PCSK9 to the LDL receptor and thereby increases the number of available LDL receptors on the surface of liver cells to clear LDL, which lowers LDL-C levels in the blood.

Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$4.49b', 'US$4.69b', 'US$5.47b', 'US$6.31b', 'US$7.01b', 'US$7.53b', 'US$7.97b', 'US$8.35b', 'US$8.69b', 'US$9.00b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x6', 'Analyst x6', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ 7.42%', 'Est @ 5.88%', 'Est @ 4.80%', 'Est @ 4.05%', 'Est @ 3.52%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% ', 'US$4.2k', 'US$4.2k', 'US$4.6k', 'US$5.0k', 'US$5.2k', 'US$5.3k', 'US$5.2k', 'US$5.2k', 'US$5.1k', 'US$4.9k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$49b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth.

You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.845. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

After earning approval for a high-dose formulation of the medicine last year, Regeneron is better equipped to handle the competition from Roche's Vabysmo, first approved in early 2022."", ""Things are looking up for Regeneron's two most important products, but there is more to cheer about with this company. The biotech is close to launching brand-new products. It is currently awaiting approval for cancer treatment linvoseltamab from the FDA. Regeneron's deep pipeline and ability to replenish its lineup represent more reasons its financial results will improve over time while its shares continue to beat the market."", ""That's what makes Regeneron an excellent biotech stock to buy this month."", ""Exelixis is a mid-cap biotech stock that is notable for one key reason. The company specializes in developing cancer medicines -- that's one of the largest, fastest-growing areas in the industry. Exelixis has found success, most notably thanks to its current crown jewel, Cabometyx, the leading cancer therapy of its type in treating some forms of renal cell carcinoma (RCC, the most common form of kidney cancer) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, the most common liver cancer)."", 'Considering how competitive the oncology market is, Exelixis carving out a successful and lucrative niche for itself is impressive. The biotech is looking to replicate the success it has had with Cabometyx. Its goal is to target areas with unmet needs, where there is a dire need for new therapy approaches.', ""That's what it is doing with its most advanced candidate, zanzalintinib, which is undergoing phase 3 studies in metastatic colorectal cancer and advanced non-clear cell RCC. Zanzalintinib still has a way to go before earning approval. In both cases, five-year survival rates are low, which highlights the need for novel treatment options."", ""In the meantime, Exelixis continues to deliver solid financial results thanks to Cabometyx. Last year, the company's total revenue of $1.8 billion increased by 13.6% year over year. Exelixis' earnings per share came in at $0.65, about 16% higher than the year-ago period."", ""Exelixis recently announced positive results from a late-stage study for Cabometyx -- in combination with Roche's cancer medicine Tecentriq -- in treating metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. This diagnosis often leaves patients with at most two years to live. An approval here could meaningfully move the needle for Exelixis."", ""The company's Cabometyx will continue to grind out new indications, while its multiple pipeline programs -- both in the early and late stages -- will make progress in the next few years. Exelixis' innovative qualities in the oncology space and successful track record make it a top biotech company to invest in now."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals wasn’t one of them.

Brown, M.D., FACS, Director of Research at Retina Consultants of Texas and a trial investigator. “Less than a year after its approval, EYLEA HD has already made an impact in the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. EYLEA HD has provided disease control for my tough-to-treat cases of diabetic eye disease and allowed both my diabetic and wet age-related macular degeneration patients to enjoy less frequent dosing with a similar safety profile to EYLEA.”', 'PULSAR and PHOTON are two double-masked, active-controlled pivotal trials evaluating EYLEA HD compared to EYLEA. As published in The Lancet, both PULSAR in wAMD (N=1,009) and PHOTON in DME (N=658) met their primary endpoints, with EYLEA HD demonstrating non-inferior and clinically equivalent vision gains at 48 weeks with both 12- and 16-week dosing regimens after only 3 initial monthly doses, compared to an EYLEA 8-week dosing regimen after initial monthly doses (3 in PULSAR and 5 in PHOTON). Furthermore, 79% and 77% of wAMD patients and 91% and 89% of DME patients, who were respectively randomized to 12- and 16-week dosing, maintained these extended dosing intervals through 48 weeks.', 'The most common adverse reactions (≥3%) reported in patients treated with EYLEA HD were cataract, conjunctival hemorrhage, intraocular pressure increased, ocular discomfort/eye pain/eye irritation, vision blurred, vitreous floaters, vitreous detachment, corneal epithelium defect, and retinal hemorrhage.', 'In August 2023, EYLEA HD was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with wAMD, DME and diabetic retinopathy (DR) based on the one-year data. Two-year data were presented in 2023 for PULSAR at the EURETINA Congress and for PHOTON at the American Society of Retina Specialists annual meeting.', 'EYLEA HD is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Bayer AG. In the U.S., Regeneron maintains exclusive rights to EYLEA and EYLEA HD. Bayer has licensed the exclusive marketing rights outside of the U.S., where the companies share equally the profits from sales of EYLEA and EYLEA HD (known as Eylea 8 mg outside the U.S.). Eylea 8 mg is approved in the European Union, Japan and other countries. Submissions to other regulatory authorities in additional countries have been made.', 'About the EYLEA HD Clinical Trial Program PULSAR in wAMD and PHOTON in DME are double-masked, active-controlled pivotal trials that are being conducted in multiple centers globally. In both trials, patients were randomized into 3 treatment groups to receive either: EYLEA HD every 12 weeks, EYLEA HD every 16 weeks, or EYLEA every 8 weeks. The lead sponsors of the trials were Bayer for PULSAR and Regeneron for PHOTON.', 'Patients treated with EYLEA HD in both trials had 3 initial monthly doses, and patients treated with EYLEA received 3 initial doses in PULSAR and 5 in PHOTON. In the first year, patients in the EYLEA HD groups could have their dosing intervals shortened down to an every 8-week interval if protocol-defined criteria for disease progression were observed. Intervals could not be extended until the second year of the study. Patients in all EYLEA groups maintained a fixed 8-week dosing regimen throughout their participation in the trials.', 'About wAMD and Diabetic Eye DiseasewAMD is a retinal disease that may affect people as they age. It occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow and leak fluid under the macula, the part of the eye responsible for sharp central vision and seeing fine detail. This fluid can damage and scar the macula, which can cause vision loss. An estimated 1.4 million Americans have wAMD.', 'DR is an eye disease characterized by microvascular damage to the blood vessels in the retina often caused by poor blood sugar control in people with diabetes. The disease generally starts as nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and often has no warning signs or symptoms. NPDR may progress to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), a stage of the disease in which abnormal blood vessels grow onto the surface of the retina and into the vitreous cavity, potentially causing severe vision loss.', 'DME can occur at any stage of DR as the blood vessels in the retina become increasingly fragile and leak fluid, potentially causing visual impairment. In the U.S., approximately 1.5 million adults are diagnosed with DME, while approximately 6 million people have DR without DME.', 'About Ophthalmology at RegeneronAt Regeneron, we relentlessly pursue groundbreaking innovations in eye care science to help maintain the eye health of the millions of Americans impacted by vision-threatening conditions. Over a decade ago, our breakthrough scientific research resulted in the development of EYLEA, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor designed to block the growth of new blood vessels and decrease the ability of fluid to pass through blood vessels in the eye. EYLEA has since brought fundamental change to the retinal disease treatment landscape and is supported by a robust body of research that includes eight pivotal Phase 3 trials, 11 years of real-world experience, and more than 70 million EYLEA injections globally.', 'Regeneron continues to advance our anti-angiogenesis expertise with new solutions with the aim of offering optimal flexibility for a broad group of patients and eye care professionals.

Thriving economies depend on stable environments and inclusive societies, and that\'s why Cisco\'s environmental sustainability strategy, The Plan for Possible, includes investing in resilient ecosystems as one of its three priorities. It is in our shared interest to help humans and nature navigate a changing climate by investing in regenerative technologies, workforces, and nature itself. The Cisco Foundation\'s Climate Grants and Investments team is working toward that vision by providing nonprofit grants and impact investing to support innovative climate solutions.', 'As I reflected in a piece last year about women making strides in sustainability, I couldn\'t be prouder to see so many women represented in the environmental sustainability space. Women couldn\'t be better positioned to help connect us to a more regenerative future.

It is one thing that all of us share. It is not only a mirror of ourselves, but a focusing lens on what we can become.\'', ""I am inspired by many women in the nature solutions space. Margo Robbins is a Karuk Tribal member teaching hundreds of people the art of beneficial fire; Katharine Hayhoe leads science at The Nature Conservancy; Sandra Steingraber who picked up Rachel Carson's lifesaving work; dozens of women cofounders and CEOs who, like me, are pioneering the nature tech space."", 'Perhaps women are leading this space because we naturally have a nurturing, reciprocal relationship with nature rather than a destructive one. Women are known for creating community and we know that the answer to the nature and climate crisis resides in community, collaboration, and cooperation. Women know that nature is community and community is nature.""', 'Ugwem I.

Or with our close partners the Cheptikale Ogiek of Mt Elgon, Kenya, women have played a leading role in a mapping initiative to restore ancestral lands to their communities, helping to protect and steward their local ecosystem."", 'The future of humanity depends on us doing everything we can to support resilient ecosystems in the world at large, and therefore depends on women\'s inclusion in these efforts.""', 'Nancy Schellhorn, Co-Founder and CEO, RapidAIM - Australia', '""As women leaders, we bring visibility to the value of whole-of-community approaches to innovation.', 'Meeting the challenge of building resilient ecosystems takes all of us.

But until significantly more women are in decision-making positions - we've tied one hand behind our back as Spaceship Earth falters."", ""Stabilizing our climate requires solutions to be scaled on accelerated timelines. It requires a comfort with ambiguity along with fierceness and determination (beware of mama bears). No single country, company or organization can solve the climate crisis by themselves. Leaders that value traits of collaboration as much or more than beating the competition will feel more comfortable in this existential endeavor. As U.S. President Harry Truman remarked, ‘It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit.'"", 'In my work alongside women in investment, business, civil society, and philanthropy, I see these traits deployed daily. Women lifting the work of others, creating pre-competitive solutions-spaces for the common goal.

In 2023, it saw remarkable growth, achieving its strongest performance since 2020 with an increase of over 43%. As of March 7, it has gained 10.21%, surpassing the broader market's gain of 8.72% this year so far. Notably, according to Jonathan Krinsky, a leading market analyst at BTIG, the NASDAQ-100, which is heavily concentrated in tech, has endured 303 consecutive trading sessions without experiencing a decline of 2.5% or more as of March 5, marking it as the third-longest period without such a significant pullback since 1990. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of the best dividend stocks listed on the index."", ""The impressive performance of NASDAQ can be largely attributed to the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, which has driven up the prices of major technology stocks and boosted the overall market throughout 2023 and into the current year. Additionally, the easing of inflation and the Federal Reserve's indication of potential rate cuts later in 2024 have further supported NASDAQ's rebound from the challenges it faced in 2022. Despite the prevalence of technology companies in the NASDAQ index, many companies offer dividends to shareholders. A notable recent addition to the list of dividend-paying companies in the index is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), which made headlines in February of this year by declaring its inaugural dividend. This move marks a significant milestone for the technology sector, which has long been dominated by a select few companies for more than a decade."", ""Meta's decision to offer a dividend serves as evidence that investors are increasingly interested in dividend-paying stocks for their capacity to provide consistent and reliable income. This trend was evident in 2023 when companies in the US distributed record dividends to their shareholders. According to a report by Janus Henderson, the S&P 500 paid out an all-time high of $70.30 per share last year, a notable increase from $66.92 in 2022. This resulted in a total payment to shareholders reaching a record $588.2 billion, surpassing the previous year's figure of $564.6 billion. The report also mentioned that there were 707 instances of dividend increases reported in the fourth quarter of 2023. These increases amounted to a total of $17.5 billion for the quarter, showing an uptick from the $16.3 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022."", ""Furthermore, dividend-paying stocks have historically delivered robust returns. Since 1960, dividends have contributed to approximately one-third of the market's total return. Dividend stocks offer a degree of stability during periods of increased market volatility. According to a report by Perkins Coie, a Washington-based law firm, dividend-paying stocks exhibit 30%-33% lower volatility compared to non-dividend-paying stocks. This stability has been particularly notable during turbulent decades like the 1930s and 2000s, where dividend-paying stocks served as a buffer against significant declines in market prices. In addition to this, dividend-paying companies that consistently increase their dividends can provide better protection against inflation than bonds in an inflationary environment."", 'In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks listed on NASDAQ.', 'Photo by nick chong on Unsplash', 'Our Methodology:', 'For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 933 hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2023 and selected companies that are trading on the NASDAQ exchange and also pay dividends to shareholders.
