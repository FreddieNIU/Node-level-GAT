SWHGX bears a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.', 'History of Fund/Manager', ""Schwab Funds is based in San Francisco, CA, and is the manager of SWHGX. Since Schwab MarketTrack Growth Investor made its debut in November of 1995, SWHGX has garnered more than $853.73 million in assets. The fund's current manager is a team of investment professionals."", 'Performance', 'Of course, investors look for strong performance in funds. This fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of 9.84%, and is in the middle third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 5.63%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.', ""It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower."", ""When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Over the past three years, SWHGX's standard deviation comes in at 14.47%, compared to the category average of 14.76%. The fund's standard deviation over the past 5 years is 15.81% compared to the category average of 15.4%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade."", 'Risk Factors', ""Investors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 0.83, so it is likely going to be less volatile than the market at large. Another factor to consider is alpha, as it reflects a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark-in this case, the S&P 500. SWHGX's 5-year performance has produced a negative alpha of -3.2, which means managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns."", 'Expenses', 'Costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, SWHGX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.39% compared to the category average of 0.79%. Looking at the fund from a cost perspective, SWHGX is actually cheaper than its peers.', 'This fund requires a minimum initial investment of $0, while there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.', 'Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.', 'Bottom Line', 'Overall, Schwab MarketTrack Growth Investor ( SWHGX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, this fund looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.', 'For additional information on this product, or to compare it to other mutual funds in the Mutual Fund Equity Report, make sure to go to www.zacks.com/funds/mutual-funds for additional information.

The firm sees a stronger multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle driven by the need for the latest hardware to enable generative artificial intelligence features to be introduced in 2024 and 2025. ', ""Argus upgraded Pinterest (PINS) to Buy from Hold with a $45 price target. More than half of the company's users have intention to purchase prior to visiting the Pinterest platform, and the firm sees more of these users, higher engagement, increased ad prices and higher ad loads to drive growth."", 'Piper Sandler upgraded Tempur Sealy (TPX) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $61, up from $41. Tempur has become a dominant operator within the mattress industry, with a multi-year growth outlook that is becoming highly attractive to long-term investors, the firm tells investors in a research note.', 'Morgan Stanley upgraded Hertz (HTZ) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $15, down from $16. While the company\'s ""aggressive EV strategy"" has exacerbated significant challenges in both fleet cost and operating expense per unit, Hertz has begun to take ""decisive action to address self-inflicted challenges from its large EV fleet,"" the analyst tells investors. Given about 90% upside to its revised price target, the firm sees ""an improved risk reward,"" the analyst added.', 'Wolfe Research upgraded Analog Devices (ADI) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $225 price target.

The firm still likes the Schwab story over a multi-year view, but believes catalysts ""will simply take time to play out, with most of them 2025 events.""', ""Citi downgraded Spirit Airlines (SAVE) to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $4, down from $13. Although JetBlue (JBLU) and Spirit can still appeal Tuesday's court ruling, which blocked the carriers' proposed merger, it is unclear why JetBlue wouldn't cut its losses here and recognize that it avoided a risky bid on a highly levered carrier with steep losses, the firm says."", 'BofA downgraded Playtika (PLTK) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $8, down from $11. The firm cites a ""tepid"" growth outlook and lack of catalysts for the downgrade. ', 'DA Davidson downgraded Varonis (VRNS) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $45, up from $37. The firm sees ARR growth potentially accelerating from 15-16% this year to 20% plus in FY24 given Copilot driven deals and increased SaaS conversions with existing customers, but believes shares are fully pricing this in with shares up 89% since last May. The firm continues to believe the SaaS transition will play out quicker than expected and ', 'Top 5 Initiations: ', ""Bernstein initiated coverage of Palo Alto Networks (PAWN) with an Outperform rating and $402 price target.

The firm says CrowdStrike and SentinelOne are the two leading best-of-breed players in endpoint security targeting cloud technical horizons. ', 'Bernstein initiated coverage of Cloudflare (NET) with a Market Perform rating and $85 price target. The company appears ""reasonably durable relative to competitors"" in its core CDN and internet security market, but it is not clear if it will have as much success in new product extensions, the firm says.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 80 cents per share on revenues of $5.8 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the oilfield service firm’s performance in the December quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at HAL’s previous-quarter performance first.', 'In the last reported quarter, this Houston, TX-based provider of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells beat the consensus mark on stronger-than-expected profit from its Completion and Production division. Halliburton had reported adjusted net income per share of 79 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents. However, revenues of $5.8 billion came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate by some $35 million on tepid sales from Middle East/Asia.HAL beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, which resulted in an average earnings surprise of 5.1%. This is depicted in the graph below:', 'Halliburton Company price-eps-surprise | Halliburton Company Quote', '\xa0', 'The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter bottom line has remained unchanged in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates an 11.1% improvement year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 3.7% increase from the year-ago period.', 'After bouncing strongly from the depths of the pandemic, the oil and natural gas rig count in the United States has been gradually declining over the past year or so. Consequently, drilling activity — an important factor for services companies — has hit a speed bump. In the United States, a region on which Halliburton is highly dependent, the rig count at the end of the fourth quarter was 622 compared with 779 a year ago. This steady decline in rig count is a concern for contracting activity.On a further bearish note, the increase in HAL’s costs might have dented the company’s to-be-reported bottom line. Going by our model, the company’s fourth-quarter cost of sales will likely total $4.7 billion, up 3% from the year-ago period. The upward cost trajectory could be attributed to the prevailing inflationary environment. \xa0But giving some respite to the company, our expectation for the fourth-quarter operating income of the Completion & Production segment is pegged at $701.7 million, indicating a 6.5% improvement from the year-ago quarter on the back of higher international and offshore activity.', 'The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Halliburton is likely to beat estimates in the fourth quarter.

Most companies don't like to cut dividends, so they generally only increase them when the business can support the hike over the long term. This seems like basic logic, but when you look at dividends with this lens, it changes the information you collect from a board's dividend decisions."", ""Here's a look at what dividend decisions have been saying about Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA), Nucor (NYSE: NUE), Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE: SWK)."", ""Walgreens is one of the largest drugstore operators in the United States. The industry has been in a state of flux lately as it looks for new ways to grow. Walgreens tried its hand at benefits management, but that didn't work out. Then it shifted, along with its rivals, to operating healthcare clinics."", ""The future is still a bit uncertain, noting that there was a recent CEO change during what is a pivotal time for the company. However, dividend investors should have noted the bad omens in mid-2023 when Walgreens didn't increase its dividend at the normal interval."", ""While the dividend wasn't cut at that point, it was not increased, and that was a material change in direction for a company that had a long history of regular increases behind it. Add in the massive business shifts taking place and a new CEO and it shouldn't be any surprise that the dividend was at risk. The cut that was announced in early 2024 was at least partly signaled by the dividend decisions that were made in 2023."", ""Shifting to Nucor and Steel Dynamics, two prominent U.S. steel makers, there are two different trends to consider. Nucor's dividend, for example, has tended to grow slowly for years on end. But then it jumps materially, usually after the company opens a material plant or facility. Essentially, the dividend is signaling a step change in the business, for the better."", ""Smaller peer Steel Dynamics, meanwhile, had been increasing its dividend at a rapid clip year in and year out. That has been a clear indication that this company remains in a growth phase, which isn't exactly shocking given that it is much smaller than industry giant Nucor. At some point, Steel Dynamics' growth will slow, as is normal for a growth company. However, the dividend paths here are clearly indicating the different stages of these two steel competitors."", 'Companies generally have to live through good periods and bad ones, as Walgreens shows. However, a dividend can help you hang on through the rough patches, too, and that has nothing to do with the income you collect. For example, Chevron has increased its dividend annually for over 30 years, and right through multiple energy industry downturns. In 2020, when oil prices plunged due to the economic shutdowns used to slow the spread of the coronavirus, it hiked its dividend. It was a clear sign to investors that Chevron expected to sail through yet another industry downturn without a problem.', ""Stanley Black & Decker's story is a bit more troubling. The company's business did well during the pandemic period, but then it hit a wall as inflation took hold and supply chains got snarled. It has been selling assets to trim debt, rationalizing its business, and cutting costs. Earnings have plunged, but the dividend has continued to rise. The last two dividend increases were nothing but a token penny per share per quarter, but they were made exactly on the normal schedule."", ""The takeaway this Dividend King likely wants investors to leave with is that it is struggling today, but still believes its long-term future remains bright. That's a vastly different story than the one Walgreens was telling shareholders."", ""There's no reason at all to believe that any of the dividend growers noted here would be expected to cut their dividends in the near term. But there's also the chance, even if it is remote, that they do cut them because financial situations change all the time."", ""However, for dividend investors who pay close enough attention, dividend changes (or the lack thereof) can provide valuable clues about how a board of directors is thinking. Walgreens, Nucor, Steel Dynamics, Chevron, and Stanley Black & Decker are all examples of this. At the end of the day, you shouldn't just sit back and collect dividend checks, you should view them as another tool for keeping tabs on your investments."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Chevron right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Chevron wasn't one of them.

', 'Wing — the drone delivery arm of Google parent Alphabet so far responsible for more than 350,000 deliveries across three continents — is ready to think bigger.', 'On Wednesday, the company unveiled a new larger drone, which it said will be added to its fleet to “simplify and streamline” bigger orders. Wing will work with partners and regulatory stakeholders to introduce the unnamed model, which boasts double the payload of its predecessor, to service areas worldwide in the next 12 months.', 'The news follows Wing’s recent Dallas-Fort Worth expansion with Walmart, which the retailer claims to be the largest drone delivery expansion of any U.S. company. Wing began flying in DFW in 2022, partnering with Walmart in August to add service out of two regional Supercenters. Combined, the stores serve 60,000 homes.', 'The company also picked up new permissions from the FAA in December, allowing it to fly drones beyond the visual line of sight (BVLOS) of the operator, without human observers on the ground. Only a handful of drone delivery providers have that approval, which can improve range and reduce costs by cutting down on human capital.', '', 'According to internal company data, 70% of Wing’s U.S. orders are delivered by a single aircraft. That means the remaining 30%, however, require two or more drones. The company’s revamped design is intended to address that issue.', '“Think of it like how airlines operate different aircraft for different routes: This new aircraft will streamline our deliveries of larger orders,” said Adam Woodworth, CEO of Wing. “For example, you could order last-minute ingredients for dinner — pasta, marinara sauce, parmesan cheese, canned olives and garlic.”', 'Wing’s larger design was borne out of its Aircraft Library approach, wherein engineers develop a variety of aircraft configurations that build on the core components of its flight-proven aircraft. This allows the firm to quickly adapt its design to meet needs identified in the market, such as a bigger drone.', 'The latest design shares much of its hardware and architecture with the drones comprising Wing’s fleet. These can carry up to 2.5 pounds on 12 square miles (10 nautical miles) flights, cruising at 65 mph (56 knots). The new drone maintains that range and speed but doubles the payload to 5 pounds, using the same standardized cardboard delivery box. It also keeps a hybrid aircraft configuration, which combines vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) and precision hovering capability with fixed wings for cruise flight.', 'The updated model is also designed to work with the infrastructure and automation supporting the company’s current fleet, which comprise the Wing Delivery Network. Announced last year, the system aims to streamline deliveries by intelligently calculating routes, allocating drones based on demand, and flying fluidly between Wing hubs.', 'It also introduces new technologies to simplify operations on the customer side, such as the Autoloader. In lieu of loading the aircraft themselves, store associates can simply leave packages to be picked up. Essentially, it’s curbside delivery for drones.', 'Crucially, Wing’s new drone won’t replace other aircraft within its fleet. Part of the Wing Delivery Network philosophy is using multiple aircraft for different mission profiles.', '“It’s always been our vision to implement a multimodal drone delivery model, in the same way that ground delivery uses different vehicle sizes for different orders,” Woodworth said. “We’re committed to making that vision a reality so more shoppers can experience the convenience of drone delivery. With the new aircraft carrying more food, medicine and household essentials, customers in urban and suburban areas will be able to bundle their orders better — and receive them in one quick trip.”', 'The introduction of a larger aircraft could add to Wing’s momentum. Outside of Zipline, which focuses primarily on medical deliveries (and is also partnered with Walmart), it boasts more deliveries than any other firm. By cutting back on the number of inefficient two-drone deliveries, that figure could rise even faster.', 'And while the new model has the same range as Wing’s other aircraft, the company’s entire fleet may soon fly farther. Before receiving Federal Aviation Administration approval to remove visual observers, the firm was limited to 6 square miles (5 nautical mile) trips, which needed to be monitored continuously by human eyes. Now, computers can do the tracking, which should enable longer routes.', 'The post Google’s Wing introduces new delivery drone with double the payload appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

The raise kicks in on Feb. 1.', 'The company told CNN that it hasn’t made any changes to store managers’ pay structures in more than a decade, before a pandemic and all that followed subsequently, including a period of high inflation.', 'Previously, the pay range for store managers was between $65,000 and $170,000, it said. It will now change to be between $90,000 and $170,000, based on the store format that the manager runs.', 'The company said in a press release that it is also changing the managers’ bonus program to emphasize store profits, which will play a bigger role in calculating their bonuses, in addition to sales.', '“If you hit all targets, your bonus could now be up to 200% of your base salary,” Walmart said in the release. The move comes as retailers strive to attract and retain more workers, curb turnover rates and confront a growing wave of labor organizing efforts at big box stores.', '“I’m proud Walmart is making this investment following last year’s increase in starting pay for stores. As a result of those investments in front-line hourly associates and upcoming annual increases, our U.S. average hourly wage will soon exceed $18,” Cedric Clark, Walmart U.S. executive vice president of store operation said in the post.', 'At the same time, Walmart also cut the starting paying for some new hires in a sign of a cooling labor market.', 'In September, Walmart reduced the starting pay by about $1 for new hires who prepare online orders for curbside pickup or delivery to customers’ homes, and those who restock store shelves beginning in mid-July. The pay change did not apply to any existing employees.', 'Walmart’s rival Target raised its starting wage for workers in some positions to up to $24 in 2022. The Minneapolis-based retailer said at the time that the increase applied to hourly workers at its discount stores, supply chain facilities and headquarters.', 'Target in 2020 set its minimum wage at $15. That will remain in place, but Target said some workers would qualify for higher starting pay based on the nature of their job and the prevailing competitive wages in their local market.', 'Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart employs about 1.6 million workers in the U.S., where it operates close to 5,000 stores nationwide. The retailer noted that as many as 75% of its managers began their Walmart careers as hourly workers.', '“So did I,” Clark said. “My Walmart career started as a sporting goods hourly associate in Washington state. I was able to grow my career because people invested in me.”', 'Walmart and other value-priced retailers have benefited from budget-strapped household shopping more frequently at their stores in an inflationary environment, as well as higher-income shoppers trading down to discount stores.', 'CNN’s Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to this story', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates."", 'The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This global professional services firm providing strategy, risk and people solutions is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.8%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $5.52 billion, up 9.9% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.6% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marsh & McLennan?', ""For Marsh & McLennan, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.77%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination indicates that Marsh & McLennan will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Marsh & McLennan would post earnings of $1.38 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.57, delivering a surprise of +13.77%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", 'Marsh & McLennan appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Microchip Technology, it has a TSR of 131% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!"", ""Microchip Technology provided a TSR of 19% over the year (including dividends). That's fairly close to the broader market return.

To fill this gap, Microchip Technology (Nasdaq: MCHP) has launched the MCP998x family of 10 automotive-qualified remote temperature sensors. The MCP998x family is one of the largest portfolios of automotive-grade multi-channel temperature sensors in the industry and is designed for 1°C accuracy at a wide operational temperature range. The device family includes five sensors with shutdown temperature setpoints that are designed not to be overwritten by software or maliciously disabled.', 'With up to five channels of monitoring and several alert and shutdown options for security, this product family can support systems that supervise more than one thermal element. The remote sensors also integrate resistance error correction and beta compensation, eliminating the need for additional configuration for improved accuracy. Monitoring temperatures at multiple locations with a single, integrated temperature sensor reduces board complexity and size and simplifies design for a lowered bill of material (BOM).', '“This new family of remote temperature sensors is expanding customer choice in a product category that, historically, has offered limited options,” said Fanie Duvenhage, vice president of Microchip’s mixed-signal and linear unit. “With 10 devices to choose from, each offering better accuracy in very high temperature applications and five with shutdown safety features, the MCP998x family gives customers a broad range of automotive multi-channel temperature sensors to choose from.”', 'More accurate where it counts, designed for 2.5°C accuracy up to 125°C, the MCP998x device family can be used at the high end of the traditional temperature range where many competitors are challenged. This high temperature tolerance makes them well-suited for automotive applications where operating temperatures for electronics is a major factor. The MCP998x sensors are designed to support vehicle functions including HID lamps, advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS), automotive servers, video processing, infotainment systems, engine control, telematics and body electronics such as seat control, lighting systems, mirror control and power windows. Visit the website to learn more about Microchip’s full portfolio of temperature sensors.', 'Development ToolsTo enable easier design and development, the MCP998x family is supported by the new EV23P16A evaluation board.', 'Pricing and AvailabilityThe MCP998x family of multi-channel temperature sensors is available starting at $0.63 each in 10,000-unit quantities.

There may be no way back, say analysts.', '“The Opec+ cartel is fracturing,” says Kelty. “They have been caught out by the rise in production from the US and other countries which means they are losing their historic control over prices.”', 'If sustained, it could herald a seismic shift in a global oil market that has long been dominated by producers in the Middle East and Russia.', 'It could also, say analysts, spell big trouble not just for Putin, who relies on energy revenues to fund 45pc of Russia’s federal and defence budgets, but also for countries like Saudi Arabia. ', 'The Gulf state also relies on oil revenues to keep its population happy.', 'Opec, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, was founded in 1960 by Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Venezuela to strip control of global oil production from the UK and the British companies that then dominated.', 'It now has 12 members and formed a wider network called Opec+ in 2016 that involved another 10 oil-producing states, including Russia.', 'The group’s key weapon is their control over the supply of oil. Almost 80pc of the world’s proven supplies are in Opec countries.', 'Turning off the taps and restricting supply has always driven prices up and forced Western leaders to come begging. The ability to control price has showered huge wealth on Opec members, particularly in the Middle East.', 'The power that goes with controlling fuel supplies helped to embolden Putin in Ukraine. He assumed Europe would have to give way once Russia invaded because he controlled their gas and a large amount of their oil.', 'What has happened instead is that the free market has begun to take over.', 'Flows of oil into Europe from Russia have reduced but they have been quickly replaced by oil from the US, Norway and newer sources like Guyana and Brazil.', '“The loss of Russian product imports to European and US markets saw the re-routing of global trade flows, under the pressure of the EU embargo and G7 sanctions,” \xa0the IEA says in its report.', 'As a result, Opec+’s share of the market is shrinking. The control it has exercised for decades is slipping away in the process. That change is happening even though global demand for oil is expected to reach a record high this year at more than 102m barrels a day. “Record-breaking output” from the United States, Brazil, Guyana and Canada will more than meet demand, the IEA says.', '“These four non-Opec+ producers, all from the Americas, are expected to add a combined 1.3 mb/d [million barrels per day], with the United States contributing more than half the gains to once again lead the world’s supply expansion.”', 'Last month, weekly US oil production hit 13.2m barrels per day, according to the US Energy Information Administration. That’s above the Donald Trump-era record of 13.1m set in early 2020 just before the pandemic sent prices and production crashing.', 'The recent surge in US output has been the key factor in keeping a lid on the prices of petrol, diesel, jet fuel and all the other products derived from oil and gas. Those products range from road surfacings (bitumen) to carpets and clothes (polyester) and all kinds of plastic.', 'In fact, US output – led by shale drillers in Texas and New Mexico’s Permian Basin – is so strong that America is exporting the same amount of crude oil, refined products and natural gas liquids as Saudi Arabia or Russia produces.', 'With their power diminishing, Opec+ has been riven with infighting. A November meeting was delayed at the last minute amid reports that African members, who heavily rely on oil revenues day-to-day, were reluctant to agree to Saudi plans to cut their output.', 'Shortly after, Angola, which had been an Opec member since 2007, quit.', '“We realised Angola does not gain anything by keeping in the organisation,” the country’s resources minister Diamantino de Azevedo said at the time.', 'Callum Macpherson, head of commodities at Investec, says the expansion to Opec+ was an attempt to regain control of global markets as it was slipping by broadening the group’s influence. However, members’ competing interests have made it harder to agree on tactics.', 'At recent\xa0meetings, for\xa0example, the Saudis wanted a cut in production but other members were unwilling to lose oil revenues.', 'Mr MacPherson says: “Russia, Iran and Venezuela are subject to sanctions… Other producers face challenges due to local instability like Iraq, Libya and Nigeria. So most members are unable or unwilling to join the Saudis in efforts to support the market.”', 'Meanwhile, the US is tightening the screws on Russia. Last month President Biden issued an executive order authorising the use of sanctions against foreign financial institutions that help Russia’s military industrial complex.', 'A key aim is to block Russia’s remaining export markets in India and China. This month deputy secretary of the US Treasury Wally Adeyemo will travel to Italy, Germany, Japan and other G7 partners to build support for “holding Russia accountable for its war against Ukraine”.', 'Greg Newman, chief executive of Onyx Capital Group, a leading London trader in oil derivatives, said Opec and Russia had overplayed their hand and would struggle to regain their former control of the markets.', '“Non-Opec supply is growing at such a pace that it is not clear there will ever again be a good time for Opec to increase production.”', 'It means the only tool its members have is to cut production even further. They are already close to the limit – further cuts would hit coffers too hard.', '“To me, it looks like non-Opec supply will eventually overwhelm the market,” says Newman. “If this was to happen, Opec and Russia would finally have to cede control to a free market.”', 'Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Reported EPS is $1.13, expectations were $1.05. Morgan Stanley isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', ""Operator: Good morning. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplements, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release and strategic updates.

This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to chief executive officer Ted Pick.', ""Ted Pick: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. It is a privilege to be with you. Today, I will deliver the annual deck that was a hallmark of James Gorman's 14-year tenure, both to affirm Morgan Stanley's strategy and to provide a level of transparency on our progress that you have come to respect. Let's turn to the slides. Turning first to Slide 3, over the last 15 years, we have transformed the firm's business mix, scale, profitability and returns. If you compare various historical periods, you can see our business evolution. Each period faced its own challenges. In 2009 to '14, Morgan Stanley was a classic self-help story. Transformation began with the acquisition and integration of Smith Barney. The investment bank was reset, and the firm survived the near triple credit downgrade and the euro crisis."", ""In 2015 to '19, we weathered the years of financial repression, resizing our fixed income business and pressing ahead to the top slot in institutional equities. During this period, we also acquired Solium, which was a step toward leadership in the corporate stock plan space. Then in 2020 to '22, the COVID years, we achieved incremental scale in both wealth and investment management with the acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance, giving us a leading self-directed platform and pushing forward in investment solutions. During this period, each of the two major business lines -- wealth and investment management and institutional securities generated operating leverage and high returns. Transformed Morgan Stanley today has tripled client assets in its durable businesses with significant opportunities for further growth."", ""Notwithstanding 2023's geopolitical, macroeconomic and industry challenges, the firm's business model generated consistent results. In 2023, firm revenues were $54 billion with $12 billion of PBT, double the averages of 2009 to '14. Our return on tangible common equity was a solid 13%, inclusive of notable items that reduced returns by over 100 basis points. Last year's return profile was tripled the post crisis years. Combined earnings from wealth and investment management generated 60% of the firm's top line and PBT, and our category of one asset gathering strategy sets the stage for continued durable growth. The institutional securities business also grew over the transformation years with an eye to investing in its leading franchises. The objective has been to create an integrated investment bank of investment banking, equities and fixed income to serve leading institutions around the world."", 'Taken together, the Morgan Stanley business portfolio of today has well higher and more stable profitability. The actions we have taken over the last 15 years, organic and inorganic, were all within our core strategic footprint. At its center is acting as a trusted advisor to clients, helping them raise, allocate and manage capital. It is what we do. We are a global leader and we are really good at it. This will not change. Turning to Slide 4, since 2010, revenues and wealth and investment management have more than doubled, and today we are number one in the world among our peers. During the same period, our client assets have more than tripled to $6.6 trillion. We see continued opportunities to drive growth and are steadfast in our goal of reaching $10 trillion in total client assets.', 'In wealth management, we have established ourselves as a leading asset gatherer by expanding our business model across three channels -- advisor led, self-directed and workplace. The business generated $1 trillion of net new assets over the past three years, and we are relentlessly focused on sustainable growth. We expect NNA growth to continue to vary quarter by quarter, given seasonality and even year to year given market tone and the cadence of migrating workplace assets and attracting assets held away. We are nevertheless confident in our ability to continue to grow and deepen our 18 million relationships with the breadth of our wealth management offering. Over time, our ability to track, deepen and retain client relationships with our differentiated platform allows us to drive revenue growth and operating leverage, enabling 30% margins.', ""Given some of the recent macro headwinds in our continued investments for growth, it's reasonable to expect reported margins to consolidate in the mid-20s range over the near term. The underlying business has achieved 30% margins before, and we intend to deliver that return profile again in the long term against a higher base of revenue. Our wealth platform is complemented by investment management, where we've added a number of new capabilities to our strong public market alpha engines. This business is well aligned to key areas where we see secular growth, including customization such as parametric, private markets and value add credit. At a holistic level, the wealth and investment management business has achieved the kind of scale which enables us to invest in what matters most to clients and to take further market share through cycles."", ""Turning to Slide 5. Morgan Stanley's Institutional Securities Group, our Integrated Investment bank is a preeminent global franchise. Our capability set, extensive client footprint and premier brand put us in a position to be the trusted advisor to every important corporation, public or private, asset manager and asset owner. Our teams across geographies, businesses and client segments position us at the center of global capital allocation and formation. Over the last decade, we have advised on nearly $9 trillion in M&A transactions, raised nearly $13 trillion of capital for clients and as indication of our market's presence. In a single trading session last month, our equities business transacted roughly $250 billion of notional value. Our leadership position outside the U.S., acting as a true global investment bank, is critical for the Morgan Stanley franchise."", ""After more than five years managing our integrated investment bank, I'd add that it is clear from client visits around the world that the barriers to entry to becoming a global investment bank are real. Today, there are fewer competitors, and we are one of those very few who can provide the full breadth of capabilities. We expect the next economic and financial cycle to be led by corporate finance activity which will drive investment banking growth, and as such are particularly focused on expanding our 15% world share in that advice driven business. Turning to Slide 6. When you combine our wealth and investment management platform with our leading institutional franchise, you see the power of what we will call the integrated firm. Our capacity to source new client opportunities efficiently facilitates the flow of capital and deliver Morgan Stanley's firmwide Solutions has never been stronger."", 'Looking at the right side of the slide, more specifically, our premier corporate franchise spans every business segment, with clients at the center of everything we do. We cover their broad range of needs, from advising the C suite on strategy, to helping them raise capital and hedge risks, on through to advising the broader employee base through our workplace offering. Second, we have a unique capability to serve individuals who range from self-directed, up through to the ultra-high net worth set and small institutions who sit between the traditional segments. We can deliver best-in-class institutional capabilities paired with sophisticated wealth management solutions in an integrated service model. Third, we continue to invest in our ability to deliver investment and client solutions as we are at the center of financial innovation and growth.', ""Our global integrated investment bank is core to our ability to source and structure customized opportunities for corporations and financial sponsors. Our structuring capabilities are augmented by scaled distribution channels, extending from the largest institutions through the individual retail client set. With a central focus on our clients, we see significant opportunities in delivering the integrated firm. Turning to Slide 7. Ultimately, the firm's success relies on our human capital and maintaining a differentiated partnership culture. With James as Executive Chairman and together with Andy Saperstein and Dan Simkowitz as our Co-Presidents, our highest priority is delivering the integrated firm to our clients. Our shared Morgan Stanley experience, having all lived through the 15-year transformation, gives us a lens into where we come from and where we are going."", 'The intentional mobility of our leadership, engineered by James over these many years, is particularly important. Andy, in his expanded role as head of both wealth and investment management, is well situated to leverage his deep knowledge of retail distribution and products to drive client opportunities across the business. Dan, having successfully revitalized investment management for nearly a decade, is returning to lead institutional securities, where he spent 25 years, will play a critical role in connecting the firm around sourcing opportunities, structuring financing and distributing capital for our clients. Both these gentlemen have burnished the brand and successfully integrated acquisitions. To have James, Dan, Andy as partners to open 2024 speaks to the enduring strength of our culture.', ""Our broader leadership team has worked together since the financial crisis through the strategic transformation and today are unified in advancing toward our goals. The operating and management committees of the firm each have an average tenure of more than 20 years. Long tenure is one element that maintains the strength of a learning culture of serving clients in a first-class way. In addition to backing the Morgan Stanley experience set of our longstanding leaders, we're enhanced by the injection of some key lateral hires and joiners via our acquisitions. Our businesses are supported by a world class technology and infrastructure organization, and by 2,320 talented Managing Directors, 155 of whom we promoted to the partnership last week. Our 80,000 people are what makes Morgan Stanley's culture and drives us to be excellent on behalf of our clients, to be prudent fiduciaries of capital, and to maintain a keen awareness of the road we have traveled to achieve the firm we have today."", 'Turning to Slide 8, in addition to one -- the performance of the business, two -- driving an integrated firm and three -- maintaining our culture, we are four highly focused on the state of our financial capital. Given our deliberate growth and durable earnings over the last several years, our capital position is strong, going to the finalization of Basel III Endgame. Our regulatory requirements, as ventured within our stress capital buffer, have steadily come down since 2020, reflecting the improved resilience of our businesses. With respect to Basel III Endgame, we continue to believe after fulsome industry comment and further evaluation of economic and competitive impacts, that the final rule will result in a well more constructive outcome than originally proposed, particularly as it pertains to matters that are driving our estimated RWA inflation.', ""Looking ahead, we remain committed to the dividend as it is at the core of our business model's durability. While we will toggle among opportunities to support our clients, grow our businesses, and repurchase our stock, the core strengths and strategic decisions of the last 15 years are reflected in our quarterly dividend, which we have grown from $0.05 to $0.85 per share. The continued sustainability of that dividend is paramount. With the firm coming together, we will drive toward our performance goals. Slide 9 reiterates our confidence in them. Our strategy and long-term value proposition remain intact. The four firmwide goals are in place, hitting $10 trillion in client assets, achieving a 30% wealth management pretax margin, a 70% firmwide efficiency ratio, and achieving 20% returns on tangible equity."", 'Our management team is steeled to execute against our priorities to reach these goals. We enter 2024 with confidence, and our base case for the coming year is constructive. There are two major downside risks. The first is geopolitical, that global conflicts intensify and conflagrate. The second is the state of the U.S. economy over the course of 2024. The base case is benign, namely that of a soft landing. But if the economy weakens dramatically in the quarters to come and the Fed has to move rapidly to avoid a hard landing, that would likely result in lower asset prices and activity levels. On the other hand, if inflation in fact has not been beaten back and continues to challenge consumers and supply chain, that could result in a stickier fed and the resulting higher for longer will have to be absorbed in the way of a higher-than-expected cost of capital and the dangers of a bifurcated economy.', 'These risks, the geopolitical and that of the U.S. economy, present some uncertainties as we start 2024. Nevertheless, as we have discussed this morning, the Morgan Stanley of today is meant to perform through the cycle, and based on the evidence we see, our building M&A and IPO pipelines, improving boardroom confidence, and an increasingly positive tone from our retail and institutional clients, we remain constructive on the year ahead. We will execute on our clear and consistent strategy. We have a global business, a world class wealth and investment manager alongside a leading investment bank. The growth opportunities are extraordinary, especially given how our businesses and regions intersect and support the business strategy. We will continue to lead with asset consolidation across wealth and investor management, and remain committed to growing high quality share in institutional securities to consistently deliver our integrated firm to clients around the world.', ""In so doing, we will continue to execute towards our key objectives and to deliver for shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Sharon, who will discuss our fourth quarter and annual results, and then together we'll take your questions. Thank you."", 'A - Sharon Yeshaya: Thank you and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $54.1 billion in 2023 and ended the year with fourth quarter revenues of $12.9 billion. For the full year, ROTCE was 12.8% and EPS was $5.18, and for the fourth quarter ROTCE was 8.4% and EPS was $0.85. The full year efficiency ratio was 77.2%. A number of factors impacted our annual and quarterly results. The full year results include nearly $900 million of notable items. Over half of these items were reflected in the fourth quarter. A $286 million FDIC special assessment charge and a legal settlement of $249 million were both realized in the fourth quarter. In addition, the full year results include $353 million of severance expenses, primarily related to a May employee action.', ""The combination of these three items negatively impacted full year EPS by $0.44, ROTCE by 105 basis points and the efficiency ratio by 164 basis points. Total integration related expenses for the year were $293 million, nearly 70% of which was related to E*TRADE. With the E*TRADE integration now complete, we remain focused on continuing to manage our expense base, supporting our long-term efficiency goals while still investing in growth. Now to the businesses. Institutional securities' full year revenues were $23.1 billion and quarterly revenues were $4.9 billion. Full year results were impacted by the weak investment banking environment that began with the onset of the hiking cycle and geopolitical events in early 2022, and persisted through most of the past year."", ""Fourth quarter revenues reflected stronger investment banking results and prudent risk management across fixed income and equities. Investment banking revenues were $4.6 billion for the full year. Lower completed M&A transactions followed a dearth of announcements in the back half of 2022 and early 2023, which weighed on results. However, optimism began to rise midyear followed by a notable increase in Morgan Stanley's announced volumes starting in the third quarter and continuing into the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenues were $1.3 billion. Results were supported mostly by fixed income underwriting as the investment grade market remained open for regular way issuance and was supported by event driven activity. Advisory revenues have begun to recover versus recent quarters, and were roughly flat year over year."", 'Equity underwriting revenues were also flat as activity remained muted. As we enter 2024, we are positioned to capitalize on the opportunity set, while downside risks are linked to the consumer with the rate path and geopolitics as two key determinants, we expect the US will lead the recovery globally. Corporate confidence will ultimately drive the cycle forward and we are encouraged by signs the CEO and boardroom optimism is growing, evidenced by the build of our advisory and IPO pipeline. Our integrated investment bank is well positioned to capitalize on the recovering backdrop, particularly where the institution works across the businesses with CEOs, CFOs and Treasurers on corporate solutions. Strength and sentiment should support broad M&A and new capital market issuance, and eventually feed through to the broader market activity.', ""Equity full year revenues were $10 billion, reflecting lower revenues across regions. Tempered client engagement was reflective of broad market uncertainty. Revenues were $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Prime brokerage revenues in the fourth quarter were solid. Results reflected narrower spreads and the geographic mix of client balances. Cash results declined versus last year's fourth quarter, reflecting lower volumes, particularly in Asia, ex-Japan. Derivative results were up versus last year's fourth quarter as the business continued to grow the client base. Fixed income revenues were $7.7 billion for the full year, declining from 2022 strong results. The full year decline was driven by lower client activity in foreign exchange and commodities, which were impacted by greater uncertainty around the rate outlook and less volatile energy markets."", ""Quarterly revenues were $1.4 billion. Macro performance was down versus the prior fourth quarter. Results reflected fewer monetization opportunities, particularly in Asia compared to heightened engagement in the region last year. Micro was down year over year, driven by lower revenues in credit corporates which was negatively impacted by movements in credit spreads on the back of geopolitical events. Results in commodities were up versus last year's fourth quarter, primarily reflecting improved performance in the power and gas business. Turning to wealth management. For the full year, wealth management's revenues were $26.3 billion and the pretax profit was $6.5 billion, which resulted in a PBT margin of 24.9%. Reported results reflect the complex macro backdrop as well as several idiosyncratic events."", 'The unprecedented rise in the absolute level of interest rates were particularly consequential as the subsequent shifts in client behavior impacted the revenue mix and margin. In addition, there were several expense items that impacted the margin including integration related expenses, the FDIC special assessment, severance charges and the impact of DCP, which saw meaningful swings compared to last year. Taken together, these four items impacted the full year margin by over 250 basis points. Total client assets ended the year at a new high, reaching $5.1 trillion of assets. Full year fee-base flows were $109 billion. These flows and associated fees offset the market levels and changes in interest mix of client portfolios, supporting the year-over-year increase in asset management revenues.', ""Fourth quarter revenues were $6.6 billion, and the reported PBT margin was 21.5%. The aforementioned notable expenses negatively impacted the fourth quarter margin by over 400 basis points. Asset management revenues in the quarter were $3.6 billion, up approximately $200 million from the prior year's fourth quarter. Quarterly fee-based flows were strong at $42 billion, underscoring the value clients are seeing in our advice-based model. Client allocations to higher yielding cash alternatives remained elevated, and clients continue to deploy monthly inflows into equity markets from sweep balances. The eventual return of the new issuance calendar and improved retail sentiment should provide a tailwind as clients look to redeploy into broader asset crosses."", 'Net new assets of $282 billion for the year represented 7% annual growth rate of beginning period assets. Fourth quarter net new assets were $47 billion. For the full year, net new asset growth was driven by the advisor led channel across existing clients, new clients and net recruiting. Transactional revenues in the fourth quarter were $1.1 billion. Excluding the impact of DCP, transactional revenues increased slightly year-over-year as clients invested in structured products and fixed income products. Bank lending balances of $147 billion remain roughly flat, consistent with the environment. Total deposits increased 2% quarter over quarter to $346 billion, driven by continued demand for our savings offering from our wealth management channel and a modest increase in sweep balances.', 'Net interest income was $1.9 billion in the quarter. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by the mix of average deposits and the blended deposit cost in the quarter. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, the deposit mix will continue to be the primary driver of net interest income. The modest sequential build and sweeps was promising and suggests we are nearing a level of frictional sweeps and client accounts. Assuming that the forward curve holds and that our assumptions around client behavior materialize, we would expect NII in the first quarter to be roughly in line with the fourth quarter. Our asset led gathering strategy remains unchanged, and we expect it to deliver margin expansion over time. The path is clear and includes the following objectives -- First, increase relationships through our channels.', 'Second -- migrate assets to advice. Third -- deepen existing client relationships with enhanced capabilities including new products and solutions, and finally, realize scale benefits of our investments over time. These efforts are well underway. In the year, we grew client relationships by over 600,000 across the franchise. This was led by success in the workplace channel, as we continue to win corporate plans and add participants in stock plan. In the prior three years, we saw an average of $50 billion of workplace assets migrate to the investor led -- the advisor led channel on an annual basis. This year, client migration was up 25% year-over-year despite economic headwinds, and on the product side, our financial advisors are offering clients investment opportunities such as private credit, private equity, and all their other alternatives.', 'Bringing wealth and investment management closer together will create greater opportunities for ongoing product creation. As we move forward and transition from integration to optimization for client experience, we expect to see greater scale benefits from our investments over time. Investment management reported full year results of $5.4 billion and fourth quarter revenues of $1.5 billion. AUM increased year-over-year to $1.5 trillion, supported by higher asset values. Long-term net inflows of approximately $7 billion -- excuse me, long term net outflows of approximately $7 billion were driven by headwinds in our [MSIM] active equity growth strategies. Within alternatives and solutions, we continue to see demand for parametric customized portfolios across both equity and fixed income strategies as more retail clients seek customized solutions.', ""Liquidity overlay services had outflows of $6.6 billion. Weaker institutional liquidity flows were partially offset by demand for parametric's overlay product and the combined parametric brand, inclusive of overlay and its retail offering had net inflows of over $5 billion again this quarter, underscoring the strength of our differentiated customized offering. Fourth quarter asset management and related fees of $1.4 billion increased slightly versus last year. Quarterly performance based income and other revenues were $61 million. Gains in U.S. private equity and infrastructure offset losses in real estate, reflecting the benefits of diversification in the franchise. Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets were $1.2 trillion.

Deeply committed to the brand identity, she’s still the app’s CEO, and likely wouldn't have launched it without inspiration from her first boss: Salesforce’s Marc Benioff."", '“My first job after college was working for Salesforce,” Bradford told Fortune in an interview—first as a sales engineer and later as an account executive. Bradford arrived at Salesforce, per her LinkedIn page, in May 2007. That was “the era of the cloud, where everything was going to the cloud,” she said. “And Salesforce was the pioneer.”', 'Because she onboarded during the company’s first decade—it was then still called Salesforce.com—Bradford “got front row seats to the whole software as a service industry.” She also got exposure to Benioff, who she said was “an amazing CEO.”', '“I learned a lot just watching how he operates his business,” she said. “And from there decided that I wanted to stay in technology and keep growing as an entrepreneur.”', 'Like Benioff, who built Salesforce from the ground up and has led the company ever since, Bradford began work on her app all on her own. “I built and designed The League for myself as a user,” she explained. “I did do some focus groups, but for the most part, the focus group was me, and I built the features that I wanted.”', 'She also relies on the coding skills she honed as a computer science major at Carnegie Mellon—and put into action at Salesforce. “Every time I come up with a new idea, or someone gives me a great idea, I can actually ship it and build it into the app and have people use it within a month or two—sometimes even weeks at this point,” she said. “I love the ability to build, to iterate, and to be responsive to what’s going on in the environment.”', ""And she's far from the only executive Benioff has influenced."", '“Marc has been a towering exemplar of what it means to be an innovative and forward-thinking leader,” Ken Frazier, former CEO of Merck, said when Chief Executive Magazine honored Benioff as its 2022 CEO of the Year. Fortune has named him one of the World’s 25 Greatest Leaders, and Harvard Business Review included him on its list of the 10 Best-Performing CEOs.', 'Benioff’s much-lauded leadership style focuses on belonging, equality, and inclusion. He often refers to the “Salesforce Ohana,” an ethos that emphasizes Salesforce’s we’re-a-family mentality—unusual for a Silicon Valley giant, much less for a company leading the world in customer relationship management (CRM). He also, since Salesforce’s 1999 founding, has committed 1% of its equity to philanthropic causes, especially in diversity and access in the tech and AI fields.', 'But sometimes the “aloha” approach can run counter to Benioff’s actions. Last year, the software firm announced a 10% workforce cut, news Benioff broke to employees in an email dotted with “Ohana” references and reminders that coworkers are family. In an all-hands call a day later, Benioff reportedly dodged questions about the layoffs, frustrating remaining workers.', ""“Given how little of this call has addressed the layoffs, the questions asked in this channel, and the ‘family’ who were laid off, should we consider retiring the phrase ‘Ohana?'” one employee wrote in an internal Slack channel at the time, per an Insider report."", ""Still, though, it's clear that Benioff has left a positive impact on some of his former workers like Bradford. Once she scaled The League enough to hit the million-dollar mark for her own personal wealth, she didn’t shell out on anything flashy. “I helped my parents put a down payment in for a retirement community that they were excited about,” she said."", 'Perhaps she was guided by a Hawaiian word for family—one that means no one gets left behind.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

Throughout history, the combination of innovation, competitive forces, legal decisions, and acquisitions has consistently fueled change atop Wall Street's leaderboard."", 'In 1980, eight of the top 10 largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. were in the oil and gas, automotive, or chemical industries. As of 2024, none of these 10 companies remained in the top 10 by market cap. In fact, only one of the top 10 public companies by market cap (Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)) as recently as 2000 is still a top-10 company just 24 years later.', ""Although it's tough to envision a world where Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) or Microsoft aren't at the top, history suggests this is precisely what'll happen at some point in the future -- perhaps even sooner than you think."", 'While nothing is written in stone, a strong argument can be made that e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) can become the largest publicly traded company by 2027.', ""For Amazon to stand taller than its peers, one of three things would need to happen. The handful of trillion-dollar companies within sight of Amazon's market cap would need to 1) underperform, 2) stagnate, or 3) increase in value at a slower pace than Amazon's stock."", ""Apple's reign as the largest public company may well be over. Although it's generating abundant operating cash flow and is still the leading smartphone company in the U.S. by a long shot, its physical product growth engine has stalled."", ""The good news for Apple is that CEO Tim Cook is overseeing a successful ramp-up of the company's subscription services segment. Additionally, more than $600 billion in aggregate share repurchases since the start of 2013 have provided a tangible lift to Apple's earnings per share. Nevertheless, sales of the company's physical products (iPhone, iPad, Mac, and wearables) fell across the board in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30, 2023). Without double-digit sales growth, Apple's forward earnings multiple of 26 becomes far less palatable for investors."", 'Though Microsoft and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) appear virtually unstoppable at the moment, thanks largely to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, these two highfliers are fallible.', 'For the past three decades, every next-big-thing investment trend has navigated its way through an initial bubble period. This is to say that investor expectations for the uptake of a new technology, innovation, or trend have consistently outpaced the actual uptake or acceptance of that trend. AI is unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule.', ""Despite becoming the infrastructure backbone of high-compute data centers, Nvidia is staring down a couple of big headwinds. It'll be contending with its first true taste of AI-driven graphics processing unit (GPU) competition in AI-accelerated data centers in 2024, and is likely to see its pricing power for A100 and H100 chips diminish as AI-focused GPU scarcity wanes."", ""On the other hand, Microsoft has the luxury of falling back on the phenomenal operating cash flow of its legacy segments. While it likely faces less downside risk than Nvidia if the AI bubble bursts in 2024, or shortly thereafter, Microsoft's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30 is toward the high end of its range over the trailing decade. In other words, the risk may outpace the reward potential for Microsoft stock over the next couple of years."", 'As for Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), I expect the parent company of internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube to continue to thrive. Alphabet stock remains historically cheap, relative to its future cash flow, and Google has a practical monopoly on global internet search -- a nearly 92% share in December 2023.', ""The only flaw (if you want to call it that) with Alphabet is that more than three-quarters of its revenue derives from advertising. This leaves Alphabet exposed to economic downturns, which leads me to believe that Amazon can simply outpace any gains in Alphabet's stock over the next four years."", 'This leads us back to Amazon, which is the only other publicly traded company with a trillion-dollar market cap.', ""Most people are familiar with Amazon because of the company's world-leading e-commerce segment. A 2022 report from Insider Intelligence (formerly eMarketer) estimated that Amazon would account for just shy of 40% of U.S. online retail sales. For context, the 14 closest competitors to Amazon's online marketplace were expected to trail its share by over 8 percentage points on a combined basis."", ""But while e-commerce represents the proverbial face of Amazon, it's by no means the company's growth engine. Whereas online retail sales draw plenty of traffic to the company's website and account for a significant percentage of total revenue, the margins associated with online sales are razor thin. This means a recession could adversely impact Amazon's top line, but it'll have only a minimal impact on its income and operating cash flow."", ""Amazon's growth is dependent on the company aggressively reinvesting its operating cash flow into high-growth initiatives. It's why the traditional P/E ratio isn't a particularly useful metric with Amazon."", ""At the moment, no segment is of greater importance to Amazon's future than Amazon Web Services (AWS). According to tech analysis company Canalys, AWS was the leading provider of cloud infrastructure services, with a 31% share of the global market, as of the end of September."", ""The first factor that makes AWS critical to Amazon's success is the growth runway for cloud computing. While estimates vary, a report from Fortune Business Insights projects a compound annual growth rate of 20% between 2022 and 2030, with annual cloud computing sales surpassing $2.4 trillion by the end of the decade. As the leader in cloud infrastructure service spending, AWS finds itself on the leading edge of this fast-paced trend."", ""But what's arguably even more important is the considerably juicier operating margin Amazon generates from AWS. During the September-ended quarter, AWS brought in just a shade above $23 billion in sales, which works out to $92 billion on an annual run-rate basis."", ""Whereas Amazon generated a negative 2.7% operating margin on its non-AWS segments ($306 billion in net sales) through the first nine months of 2023, it's earned a scorching 26.2% operating margin via AWS through nine months. If AWS can continue growing by a double-digit percentage, which seems likely given that enterprise cloud spending is still in its relatively early stages, it'll have an outsize impact on Amazon's cash-flow generation in the years to come."", ""Throughout the 2010s, Amazon stock closed out each year valued at a multiple of 23 to 37 times its cash flow. But thanks to AWS and its rapidly rising $92 billion annual sales run rate, Amazon's cash flow is expected to nearly quadruple between 2022 and 2027 to north of $17 per share."", ""Based on this, Amazon's current share price of $153 represents a multiple of approximately 9x consensus cash flow by 2027. More than doubling Amazon's market cap to $3.2 trillion would comfortably lift its cash-flow multiple to 18x consensus estimates in 2027, yet would still be historically inexpensive compared to what investors willingly paid to own shares of Amazon for the entirety of the previous decade."", ""If Amazon simply sustains its historic valuation, relative to cash flow, over the coming four years, it'll have a reasonable pathway to become the largest publicly traded company by market cap."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

Investors are instead getting a bit nervous that the Fed and other influential central banks won’t race to dramatically cut rates while inflation lingers solidly above target levels.', 'On the other hand, the selling heading into the heart of fourth quarter earnings season makes sense to help cool things off following the blistering run off the October lows. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were always likely to test their longer-term 50-day and 200-day moving averages in the early months of 2024.', 'The Q4 earnings outlook has improved since the big banks kicked things off late last week.', 'Investors who can handle the near-term uncertainty that earnings season brings might want to consider buying these three large-cap stocks ahead of their upcoming earnings releases and holding them for the long haul since timing the market precisely is extremely difficult.', 'Microsoft', 'Microsoft reports its Q2 FY24 earnings results on January 30. Cloud computing reshaped MSFT and turned it back into a consistent sales and EPS growth juggernaut. Now AI appears to be the next expansion-focused frontier, with Microsoft introducing artificial intelligence features across various parts of its business such as Office.', 'On top of AI, MSFT closed its roughly $70 billion deal to buy Activision Blizzard in October as a massive bet on gaming and the future of VR and the metaverse. Microsoft is also sitting on $144 billion in cash and equivalents that will help it continue to pursue expansion through strategic acquisitions.', 'Microsoft is projected to grow its revenue by roughly 14% in both FY24 and FY25 to jump from $212 billion last year to $275 billion next year. The firm is projected to grow its adjusted earnings by 14% during both periods as well. MSFT has consistently beaten our bottom line estimates, and its EPS outlook has remained intact over the last several months to help it land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment.', 'MSFT stock has more than doubled Tech over the past 20 years. MSFT shares have surged 65% during the last 12 months vs. the Zacks Tech sector’s 46%. Despite sitting near new all-time highs, Microsoft trades below its average Zacks price target.', 'The stock might be a little overheated right now, and it could pull back to its 21-day or 50-day moving averages in the near-term. But Microsoft is trading solidly above its 21-month moving average, as it has for most of the last decade.', 'Valuation-wise, MSFT trades at a 10% discount to its 10-year highs at 32.5X forward 12-month earnings. Microsoft appears far cheaper when factoring in its longer-term earnings growth outlook since its PEG ratio of 2.1 offers 5% value vs. its 10-year median and a 32% discount to its highs—MSFT is also trading nearly in line with the Zacks Tech sector.', 'MSFT boosted its FY24 dividend by 10% and it is committed to repurchasing more shares. All in, investors who are bullish on big tech and the possibilities of AI might want to add Microsoft ahead of earnings and hold it forever.', 'Procter & Gamble', 'Procter & Gamble, one of the powerhouses of the consumer packaged goods world, is set to report its second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings results on January 23. Procter & Gamble is one of the largest makers of household and personal essentials, with brands ranging from Febreze and Swiffer to Head & Shoulders and Pampers and tons more. PG breaks down its business into five categories: Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric & Home Care, and Baby, Feminine & Family Care.', 'Procter & Gamble’s standing as a consumer staples standout helps it succeed during most economic environments, good or bad. The company is projected to post roughly 4% sales expansion both this year and next to help boost its adjusted earnings by 9% and 8%, respectively, based on current Zacks estimates. PG has regularly topped EPS estimates in the last five years and its upward revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now.', 'PG stock has climbed 65% in the last five years vs. the Zacks Consumer Staples sector’s 9%. Procter & Gamble has lagged the market during the past three years, up 11% vs. the S&P 500’s 26% run.', 'PG shares are trading roughly 8% below their highs and 12% under their average Zacks price target. Procter & Gamble is trading above its very long-term 21-month moving average and around neutral RSI levels on a 20-year timeframe.', 'The stock might be able to break out of its prolonged holding pattern in 2024 as investors look for gains outside of big tech. Procter & Gamble is trading at a 16% discount to its decade-long highs and near its median at 22.4X forward earnings.', 'PG’s dividend yields 2.5% to outpace its industry’s 2.4% average. P&G is also one of fewer than 70 S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, which are firms that have both paid and raised dividends for at least 25 years running.', 'United Rentals', 'United Rentals, an equipment rental star, said it will release its Q4 FY23 results on January 24. URI’s growing portfolio of large equipment includes scissor lifts, towable light towers, generators, excavators, and nearly everything else under the sun its clients might need. Customers across construction, utilities, energy, home builders, and beyond count on United Rentals for various offerings across different timeframes.', 'United Rentals has lifted prices alongside inflation and it is benefiting from its Ahern Rentals acquisition in late 2022. The firm’s revenue was booming before the pandemic, with sales up between 15% to 21% for three straight years until they slipped in 2020. URI quickly left its Covid setbacks behind and posted 14% sales growth in FY21 and 20% in 2022.', 'United Rentals carried over its momentum in 2023, topping our Q2 and Q3 earnings estimates. The company reaffirmed its 2023 guidance last quarter, and URI’s management team remains confident in its longer-term outlook. The firm expects it will benefit from the ongoing investment super cycle in the U.S. across infrastructure, industrial manufacturing, and energy and power.', 'The company’s earnings outlook has slipped slightly compared to where it was this time last year. But its 2025 estimates have improved recently. Plus, URI’s sales are projected to jump by 22% in 2023 and another 4% in 2024 against a difficult-to-compete-against period. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to surge by 26% and 6%, respectively.', 'URI has surged 590% in the past 10 years to crush the S&P 500’s 170% and the Zacks Construction sector’s 155%. United Rentals is up 42% in the last 12 months, including some large swings.', 'URI’s recent slip below its 21-day moving average might mean it will be forced to test its 50-day soon. Thankfully, it is already at neutral RSI levels vs. overbought in December. Some investors might want to wait for it to slide to the longer-dated trendlines such as the 21-month depicted in the nearby chart.', 'Yet, the stock appears to be worth simply buying and holding through any near-term downturns since it trades at a 21% discount to its sector despite its huge long-term outperformance and 25% below its highs at 12.9X 12-month forward earnings.

Nvidia to a record closing high. That's up 1.88%. Visa, whether you classify it as fin or tech or fintech, nevertheless, that's at a record high, up half a percent. And just really a broad swath of industries represented from Costco to MasterCard. We also see T-Mobile, so telecom. Looking at staples, financials, chip stocks, a pretty broad swath here. Even O'Reilly Auto Parts up about 2.36%."", ""And let's take a look at the sector action. I was talking in the last hour about the dominance of tech, not only last year but this year, and guess what? Today it is up about 2%, and it's followed by industrials and communication services. Now, industrials a little bit newer to the mix. We saw it really come into its own in November, December of last year."", ""But the bottom line is all three of these sectors are outperforming, and what's lagging is telling because those are the defensive sectors. So that's actually bullish. Take a look at utilities down 1%. Real estate, that's down 2/3 of a percent. Staples, even energy slightly defensive. Health care arguably defensive. All of those in the red today."", ""And let's just cycle through some heat maps to see where we stand at the end of the day. So here's the NASDAQ 100. Apple you're going to notice here. Apple is not on top anymore. It used to sit there for years and years. It is now second to Microsoft. So Apple up 3%. Nice to see those gains but still second to Microsoft in terms of market cap."", ""Alphabet and Nvidia and Amazon each up more than 1%. Meta up more than 2%. But Tesla-- Tesla has not been able to catch a break this year, down 1.7%. That's down about 15%, 16% for the year."", ""And let's take a look at energy. This is one of the sectors that was lagging. You can see kind of a mixed board here. The American majors in the red while some of the European majors in the green. Just for example, Exxon down 2/10 of a percent. Shell up half a percent."", ""But when we take a look at China, that's been one of the real sore spots over the last month. Just talking with the prior guest about potential investments in China. Not looking the best today. We've got Pinduoduo down just slightly but Alibaba down another 1%. And if we take a look at the year-to-date losses, that's when we really see some dark red, guys.

Zuckerberg also said the company had begun training its next generation Llama 3 large language model."", '""It\'s become clear that the next generation of services requires building full general intelligence,"" Zuckerberg said. ""Building the best AI assistants—AIs for creators, AIs for businesses and more—that needs advances in every area of AI from reasoning to planning to coding to memory and other cognitive abilities.""', ""The announcements are a clear signal that Zuckerberg wants to position Meta at the forefront of developing consumer-facing AI products. This is important to Meta's investors, but perhaps more importantly, to talented engineers and machine learning researchers, many of whom are increasingly choosing to work for OpenAI or other well-funded AI startups."", 'To make more rapid progress towards this goal, Meta is combining Fundamental AI Research (FAIR), its advanced AI research division, which was founded over a decade ago, with the GenAI group it established just last year to help it build generative AI products, such as the celebrity persona chatbots it launched in September.', ""The move echoes Alphabet's decision last year to merge its two advanced AI research labs, Google Brain and DeepMind. Although neither Google lab was directly responsible for producing products, the rationale behind the merger was to enable Google to both create more capable AI models and to move those models into commercial production far faster than the tech giant had managed to in the past. The company was trying to catch up to Microsoft and OpenAI, which had beaten Google to market with a highly-capable AI chatbot in the form of ChatGPT and had also made the world's most powerful large language model, GPT-4, available to customers."", ""Many technologists, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates, predict that the next big platform shift in computing will be to personal AI assistants, which will become people's main interface to the digital world. These sophisticated AI chatbots will act as agents, performing tasks ranging from planning vacations to booking restaurant reservations, as well as composing letters and producing other types of content on demand. Zuckerberg clearly does not want to see Meta get left behind in this platform shift."", 'It is also clear that much of Zuckerberg\'s announcement was aimed at the AI researchers and machine learning engineers that Meta wants to recruit and retain. The war for this specialized and high-priced talent is fierce, with Google reportedly doling out seven-figure stock grants to some top AI engineers and researchers to keep them from being hired away by OpenAI. And Zuckerberg told The Verge in an interview published today that his shift to talking about ""general purpose intelligence"" is designed to woo this rarefied talent. ""I think that’s important to convey because a lot of the best researchers want to work on the more ambitious problems,"" he told the publication.', ""Meta has done important AI research over the years, in areas that range from unsupervised learning, where an AI system can learn patterns without labelled data, to AI software that can beat top humans at the complex strategy game Diplomacy. It has made big breakthroughs in machine translation and computer vision algorithms. Meanwhile, Meta's GenAI team developed Llama 2, a large language model that is among the most powerful open source AI models available. Although not quite as capable as OpenAI's GPT-4 or Google's Gemini models, Llama 2 has become popular with developers looking to build sophisticated chatbots in a less expensive and more customizable way than building on top of OpenAI's or Google's models allows."", ""But the race for artificial general intelligence—or AGI, a single AI system that can perform most cognitive tasks that a person can—was historically never the company's main concern. Deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun, who founded FAIR and remains Meta's chief AI scientist, thinks AGI may be possible, eventually, but that researchers are a long way from achieving it. As for Meta's product teams, they were mostly interested in AI that was special purpose, not general purpose. It was designed to help the company with specific problems—how to automatically tag your friends in photos, how to recommend posts in your feed, and critically, how to weed out fake accounts and posts promoting extremism, terrorism, hate speech, self-harm, and misinformation."", 'At times, some Meta executives were downright dismissive of companies such as OpenAI and DeepMind that had the pursuit of AGI as their goal. Jerome Pesenti, who served as Meta\'s vice president of AI until the summer of 2022, famously dismissed AGI as ""technobabble"" that distracted people from more concrete goals, and problems, in machine learning. With today\'s announcement, Zuckerberg is now saying to machine learning researchers: We don\'t think it\'s technobabble anymore, please come and work for us.', 'That is also clearly why Zuckerberg mentioned the specific number of graphics processing units, or GPUs, the company is purchasing. These specialized chips, which are needed to create the most advanced AI models, are in short supply and serve as a big draw for top researchers and engineers. Meta will have 350,000 of Nvidia\'s most advanced H100 GPUs online in its datacenters and 600,000 ""H100 equivalents"" in computing power available when other GPUs are counted, Zuckerberg said. Meta may use some of Nvidia\'s older model GPUs for some applications and also uses is own custom-built AI chips.', 'The Verge cited chip industry analysts as estimating that Meta took delivery of 150,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs last year, a figure that tied with Microsoft\'s H100 deliveries and which is three times greater than any other Nvidia customer\'s. Google mostly uses custom built ""tensor processing units"" or TPUs for its AI models. But both Google and Microsoft need to share their H100 chips with the company\'s cloud computing customers. Meta, on the other hand, does not sell cloud computing infrastructure to other companies.', ""In his Reel, Zuckerberg also tried to tie the company's AI efforts to the metaverse, the virtual reality future that Zuckerberg had spent billions trying to reposition the company around but which has been eclipsed by the generative AI craze set off by ChatGPT's release in 2022. The Meta CEO said he believes augmented reality glasses will become a key part of how people interact with future AI assistants, since the glasses will enable the AI to see and hear the same things as the user and offer instant advice or additional helpful information and context. He said that the $300 camera-equipped smart glasses Meta launched in partnership with Ray Ban last year have been selling well and would get new AI features in the future."", 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Most companies don't like to cut dividends, so they generally only increase them when the business can support the hike over the long term. This seems like basic logic, but when you look at dividends with this lens, it changes the information you collect from a board's dividend decisions."", ""Here's a look at what dividend decisions have been saying about Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA), Nucor (NYSE: NUE), Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE: SWK)."", ""Walgreens is one of the largest drugstore operators in the United States. The industry has been in a state of flux lately as it looks for new ways to grow. Walgreens tried its hand at benefits management, but that didn't work out. Then it shifted, along with its rivals, to operating healthcare clinics."", ""The future is still a bit uncertain, noting that there was a recent CEO change during what is a pivotal time for the company. However, dividend investors should have noted the bad omens in mid-2023 when Walgreens didn't increase its dividend at the normal interval."", ""While the dividend wasn't cut at that point, it was not increased, and that was a material change in direction for a company that had a long history of regular increases behind it. Add in the massive business shifts taking place and a new CEO and it shouldn't be any surprise that the dividend was at risk. The cut that was announced in early 2024 was at least partly signaled by the dividend decisions that were made in 2023."", ""Shifting to Nucor and Steel Dynamics, two prominent U.S. steel makers, there are two different trends to consider. Nucor's dividend, for example, has tended to grow slowly for years on end. But then it jumps materially, usually after the company opens a material plant or facility. Essentially, the dividend is signaling a step change in the business, for the better."", ""Smaller peer Steel Dynamics, meanwhile, had been increasing its dividend at a rapid clip year in and year out. That has been a clear indication that this company remains in a growth phase, which isn't exactly shocking given that it is much smaller than industry giant Nucor. At some point, Steel Dynamics' growth will slow, as is normal for a growth company. However, the dividend paths here are clearly indicating the different stages of these two steel competitors."", 'Companies generally have to live through good periods and bad ones, as Walgreens shows. However, a dividend can help you hang on through the rough patches, too, and that has nothing to do with the income you collect. For example, Chevron has increased its dividend annually for over 30 years, and right through multiple energy industry downturns. In 2020, when oil prices plunged due to the economic shutdowns used to slow the spread of the coronavirus, it hiked its dividend. It was a clear sign to investors that Chevron expected to sail through yet another industry downturn without a problem.', ""Stanley Black & Decker's story is a bit more troubling. The company's business did well during the pandemic period, but then it hit a wall as inflation took hold and supply chains got snarled. It has been selling assets to trim debt, rationalizing its business, and cutting costs. Earnings have plunged, but the dividend has continued to rise. The last two dividend increases were nothing but a token penny per share per quarter, but they were made exactly on the normal schedule."", ""The takeaway this Dividend King likely wants investors to leave with is that it is struggling today, but still believes its long-term future remains bright. That's a vastly different story than the one Walgreens was telling shareholders."", ""There's no reason at all to believe that any of the dividend growers noted here would be expected to cut their dividends in the near term. But there's also the chance, even if it is remote, that they do cut them because financial situations change all the time."", ""However, for dividend investors who pay close enough attention, dividend changes (or the lack thereof) can provide valuable clues about how a board of directors is thinking. Walgreens, Nucor, Steel Dynamics, Chevron, and Stanley Black & Decker are all examples of this. At the end of the day, you shouldn't just sit back and collect dividend checks, you should view them as another tool for keeping tabs on your investments."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Chevron right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Chevron wasn't one of them.

These matters within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, involve risks and uncertainties that may affect PPG’s operations, as discussed in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Accordingly, many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained herein. Such factors include statements related to the effects on our business of COVID-19, global economic conditions, geopolitical issues, the amount of future share repurchases, increasing price and product competition by our competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, energy, labor and logistics, the ability to achieve selling price increases, the ability to recover margins, customer inventory levels, PPG inventory levels, the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, the timing of realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring and other initiatives, the ability to identify additional cost savings opportunities, the timing and expected benefits of potential future and completed acquisitions, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, economic and political conditions in international markets, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, fluctuations in tax rates, the impact of future legislation, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions, the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation, including asbestos litigation, and governmental investigations. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, while the list of factors presented here and in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, lower sales or earnings, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on PPG’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.', 'All information in this release speaks only as of January 18, 2024, and any distribution of this release after that date is not intended and will not be construed as updating or confirming such information.

In addition, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share and the adjusted effective tax rate may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies. PPG is not able to provide a reconciliation of first quarter and full-year 2024 expected adjusted earnings per diluted share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable

Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady."", 'Michael Gerard O’Grady', ""Thank you, Jennifer. Let me join in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Similar to the last few years, 2023 presented a challenging operating environment. We experienced a combination of geopolitical instability, highly visible bank failures and elevated inflation and interest rates. I would like to thank our teams across the company for their tireless efforts to serve our clients under these difficult circumstances.Turning to our numbers. Our fourth quarter results capped off a solid year of progress towards driving improved long-term financial performance. On a year-over-year basis, reported fourth quarter revenue was $1.6 billion. Expenses were $1.4 billion and earnings per share were $0.52. Our performance in the quarter included the impact of $261 million in notable items. Adjusting for the notable items in both periods, fourth quarter revenue on a year-over-year basis was flat with trust fees up 5% and expenses up 3%. We focused much of our efforts in 2023 on expense control, making various structural and governance changes to enable sustained long-term productivity improvements. Actions included disciplined head count management, vendor consolidation, rationalization of our real estate footprint and process automation. Although we brought our year-over-year expense growth down in each quarter this year, our expense growth in 2023 was still too high relative to our trust fee and revenue growth levels in recent years. As such, lowering the trajectory of our expense growth further remains a top priority this year as well. Turning to the businesses. Our organic growth continued to be below historical levels, although we saw improvement throughout the year. Within Wealth Management, for the fourth quarter and the year, solid growth in client advisory fees was largely offset by product level asset outflows. We continue to see ongoing strength in the higher wealth tiers above $50 million in client assets, where our expertise, track record and industry leadership are significant differentiators. Our ability to harness the data and analytics from serving the wealthiest people in the world for more than 130 years, coupled with our holistic advice driven culture sets us apart in the marketplace and will continue to be an important driver of our success. Drawing from our experience working with some of the most sophisticated families around the globe, next month, the Northern Trust Institute will publish its first book, Secrets of Enterprising Families. The book will provide a window into what works for ultra-high net worth families who have succeeded generation after generation and what doesn't, to help other families gain important insights and unlock value. The book will be launched with a series of client and prospect events around the country, giving us a new channel to establish relationships and develop business. Finally, as a testament to our exceptional client service and expertise, in 2023, we were named Best Private Bank for Family Offices in the U.S. and Best Private Bank for Succession Planning in the U.S. by the Financial Times Group. Asset servicing generated solid new business growth in both the fourth quarter and full year but this was largely offset by continuing asset outflows at the client level and generally lower transaction volumes and capital markets activities. We performed particularly well with asset owners in the Americas in the fourth quarter. Notable wins included the state of Nebraska Investment Council pension plan and Costco's retirement plan. We were also reappointed as asset servicing provider for the Healthcare of Ontario pension plan. Throughout the year, we also generated healthy momentum with asset managers in the U.K. and EMEA regions, where our solutions for alternatives and private credit were particularly well received. We recently finalized terms with one of the world's largest private market firms, which will add significant scale to our alternatives division. This appointment is a testament to our ability to successfully compete for some of the largest and most complex mandates. Our Asset Servicing business received numerous awards in 2023 for its innovation and industry leadership, including best outsourcing provider by Waters, European Transfer Agent of the Year and Administrator of the Year by Funds Europe, Best Global Custodian for asset owners by AsianInvestor. In Asset Management, following several quarters of client outflows, we generated positive overall inflows in the fourth quarter, including healthy growth in index equity and our fourth consecutive quarter of positive liquidity inflows. We've seen particularly good momentum in our high-yield complex, with 93% of our taxable active funds outperforming their 1-year benchmarks. Our alternatives funds have also continued to generate solid growth and remain an important driver of our fee revenue. As a result, our product launches during the year focused largely on alternatives capabilities. In closing, we enter 2024 with positive momentum, well positioned to navigate the ongoing macroeconomic and market uncertainty. Our focus is squarely on accelerating profitable organic growth, maintaining our expense discipline and driving greater resiliency and efficiency in our operating model. With that, I'll turn it over to Jason to review our financial performance. Jason?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Thank you, Mike. Let me join Jennifer and Mike in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Let's dive into the financial results of the quarter, starting on Page 4. This morning, we reported GAAP fourth quarter net income of $113 million. Earnings per share of $0.52 and our return on average common equity was 4%. As noted on the slide, our reported results included $176 million loss on the sale of securities related to a repositioning of the portfolio that we completed in November. They also included an $85 million FDIC special assessment. Our assets under custody and administration and assets under management were up sharply on both a sequential and year-over-year basis.Strong equity and fixed income markets, coupled with favorable currency movements, drove most of the improvement in both periods, offset slightly by asset outflows in both periods. Given the intra-period market movements and lag effects of our fee arrangements, markets had an unfavorable impact on sequential trust fee growth and a favorable impact on year-over-year trust fee growth. On a year-over-year basis, currency movements had an approximate 90-basis point favorable impact on revenue growth, largely within our Asset Servicing segment and 110-basis point unfavorable impact on expenses. On a sequential basis, currency impacts were immaterial. Excluding notable items in all periods, revenue was flat on both a sequential quarter and year-over-year basis. Expenses were well controlled, up 1.9% sequentially and up 2.6% over the prior year. Trust, investment and other servicing fees totaled $1.1 billion, 2% sequential decrease and a 5% increase compared to last year. All other noninterest income on an FTE basis was down 6% sequentially and down 5% over the prior year. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $501 million, up 7% sequentially and down 9% from a year ago. Our provision for credit losses was $11 million in the fourth quarter. Overall, our credit quality remains very strong. Net charge-offs during the quarter were $2 million. Nonperforming loan levels decreased to $64 million from $69 million in the prior period and nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans remained stable. Turning to our Asset Servicing results on Page 5. Assets under custody and administration for asset servicing clients were $14 trillion at quarter end. Asset servicing fees totaled $612 million. Custody and fund administration fees were $420 million. Assets under management for asset servicing clients were $1 trillion. And asset management fees within Asset Servicing were $131 million. Moving to our Wealth Management business on Page 6. Assets under management for our wealth management clients were $423 billion. Assets and trust investment and other servicing fees for wealth management clients were $478 million. Moving to Page 7 and our balance sheet and net interest income trends. Our average balance sheet decreased 3% on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to lower borrowing activity. It declined 8% compared to the prior year due to lower client deposits. Average deposits were $102 billion, essentially flat with the prior quarter and meaningfully better than our expectations. We experienced a stronger-than-anticipated increase in deposits late in the quarter, ending the year at $116 billion. At quarter end, operational deposits comprised approximately 2/3 of institutional deposits and institutional deposits comprised 75% to 80% of the total mix. Despite significant leverage capacity, we reduced our average borrowings by $4 billion relative to the third quarter or nearly 4%, reducing both our FHLB advances and Fed funds purchased. Shifting to the asset side of the balance sheet. $3.2 billion securities repositioning we completed in November, involve the sale of both high-quality liquid assets and non high-quality liquid assets available for sale securities with a weighted average maturity of 2 to 3 years. Earlier this week, we completed another $2.1 billion repositioning, which enhances our flexibility given the dynamic rate environment. We record an associated loss in the first quarter of approximately $200 million. The proceeds of both sales were invested in short floating rate securities, further reducing the duration of the portfolio, which is now 1.8 years. Average loan balances were $42 billion, flat both sequentially and relative to the prior year. Our end-of-period loan balances were up $4 billion or 9% over the third quarter, reflecting an increase in overdrafts related to higher levels of year-end trading and settlement activity. Our loans have since returned to $42 billion. The heightened activity at the end of the quarter did not have a material impact on net interest income in either the fourth quarter or first quarter. As a reminder, approximately 75% of the loan portfolio is floating. The total balance sheet duration continues to be less than 1 year. Our average liquidity levels remained strong. Cash held at the Federal Reserve and other central banks was down, reflecting the decrease in borrowings. But high-quality liquid assets comprise more than 50% of our deposits and more than 40% of total earning assets on average. Our net interest income in 2024 will continue to be driven largely by client deposit behavior, which has been less predictable given the unique aspects of this rate cycle. We expect the November and January securities repositioning to provide an incremental $30 million in net interest income per quarter in 2024, relative to fourth quarter levels. We currently expect first quarter net interest income to be in the range of $480 million to $500 million. This assumes deposits remain stable but deposit pricing continues to be under some pressure with further NIM compression possible as long as quantitative tightening persists and the deposit environment stays highly competitive. Turning to Page 8. As reported, noninterest expenses were $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 9% sequentially and up 5% as compared to the prior year. Excluding notable items in both periods, as listed on the slide, expenses in the fourth quarter were up just under 2% sequentially and under 3% year-over-year. I'll touch on just a few highlights. Excluding all notable items, compensation expense was up 2% year-over-year. This reflected the impact from 2023 base pay adjustments partially offset by reductions in incentive compensation and head count actions taken year-to-date. Full time equivalent head count was down 200 or 1% sequentially and down 500 or 2% over the prior year. Excluding notable items in all periods, non-compensation expense was up 3% year-over-year. Equipment and software expense was up 10% year-over-year, largely due to increased amortization expense. Recall that as much as 2/3 of this line item is comprised of depreciation and amortization expense. And finally, we realized 200 basis points of trust fee operating leverage in the quarter. Turning to the full year results on Page 9. Trust fees were down 2% in 2023, largely due to asset outflows and weaker transaction volume, partially offset by the elimination of rate-driven fee waivers and new business generation. Excluding the impact of the 2 securities repositionings, other noninterest income was down 9%, reflecting weakness in foreign exchange trading and other capital markets activities. Net interest income was up over $100 million or 6%, which largely offset the decline in the other noninterest income categories. This translated to flat total revenue growth. Reported expenses were up 6% for the full year to $5.3 billion. Excluding notable items in both periods, as listed on the slide, expenses were $5.1 billion in 2023, up 4.8%, which compares favorably to 2022. As we've noticed previously, we expect to bring the expense growth rate down further in 2024. We have clear line of sight to 2 key areas of increase, base pay adjustments within compensation expense and depreciation and amortization increases within equipment and software. On a blended rate, we expect to provide base pay adjustments of approximately $65 million in 2024, which will hit our compensation line beginning in the second quarter. This compares to base pay adjustments of $80 million in 2023. Within equipment and software expense, we expect a $65 million or 10% increase in 2024. Combined, these 2 line items will drive approximately 3% increase in operating expenses above 2023 levels alone. That said, we expect to continue to generate meaningful efficiency gains from our productivity office and have identified further opportunities for improvement. As we look out to the first quarter, we expect the following: First quarter compensation expense will include our annual equity incentive payments, including those for retirement-eligible employees, along with modest employee head count growth associated with growth in the underlying businesses. This should translate to a sequential increase of $50 million to $55 million. Employee benefits expense is expected to increase by approximately $10 million due to seasonally higher payroll taxes. Turning to Page 10. Our capital levels and regulatory ratios remained strong in the quarter. We continue to operate at levels well above our required regulatory minimums. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under the standardized approach was flat with the prior quarter at 11.4% as capital accretion offset a modest increase in risk-weighted asset levels. This reflects a 440-basis point buffer above our regulatory requirements. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.1%, up 20 basis points from the prior quarter. At quarter end, our unrealized pretax loss on available-for-sale securities was $924 million. We returned over $300 million to common shareholders in the quarter through cash dividends of $156 million and common stock repurchases of $146 million. For the full year, we returned approximately $980 million to common stockholders, including common stock repurchases of approximately $350 million. And with that, Ruth, please open the line for questions."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Glenn Schorr with Evercore."", 'Glenn Paul Schorr', ""I appreciate all the numbers you helped us with and maybe try to peek a little bit more under the covers. So deposits stable. I heard your thoughts on 1Q NII on the further deposit pricing pressure. So the question is, as we go throughout the year, do you have any window into that stability and deposits sticking around? And then with the combination of 75% floating rate loan book and still pressure on deposits, is it reasonable to assume that NII might go down in second quarter forward before stabilizing later in the year and rising. I know that's a little bit further look into the future but ..."", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Yes. But it's -- I think it's a very reasonable way to frame looking out farther end of the year. And you're right, for us to say full year numbers at this point, it's just too early. But it is good to think about how the assets and liabilities are going to react with looming rate cuts. And I think it's helpful to think back on how the impact to NIM occurred with rates rising initially was very different than what happened eventually when betas were much higher. And I think on the way down, we might have a similar situation where the first cuts may be different than the later ones. And 2 things jump out in my mind. One is, we have never tried to be a price setter in deposits. Our goal has always been keep the deposits in the house and we were very aggressive at following what we saw market pricing was. And the second thing is that as we get these initial cuts, we could see the market reacting in a way to keep deposit cost, deposit yields for clients higher to hold on to deposits. And so I think initially might be tougher than what happens eventually. Now all that said, the volumes matter a lot. And it's obviously been extremely hard for us to predict where volumes were going to go. And we saw October better than we anticipated. November was better than October. December was better than November. And so volumes are going to be critical in what happens in the first half of the year and it's just super hard to predict."", 'Glenn Paul Schorr', 'I definitely appreciate that. This one might be a little bit easier to follow up, on fee operating leverage. I mean, just by means of pricing alone or the markets alone, the markets had a strong end to the fourth quarter. So your fee run rate should probably be a lot better going into the first quarter. And with your comments on even more sharper discipline on expenses, do you expect to make some meaningful progress early on in the year in this fee-to-expense ratio?', 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Yes, you're right to call out that there is a lift, the launch point is higher coming into the year. And I don't know if I'd say meaningful but it's definitely higher. And the lag effects will help us as we walk into the year. And so that's the math of it. But then more strategically, we do feel positive about the pipeline in both asset servicing and in wealth management. And underneath both businesses, our Asset Management business is incredibly important. And as Mike mentioned in his commentary, there's some early signs of flows back in and we always think, just as we do in deposits, just keep the money in the house, keep the client assets in the house. But if our Asset Management business does better, then that helps as well. And so I think the strategic component is also -- we're feeling early signs of some positive movement from an organic perspective."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research."", 'Steven Joseph Chubak', ""So I was hoping to maybe just unpack like the deposit discussion a bit further. And specifically, just get a sense as to how you're thinking through the impact of ongoing Fed QT. It does feel like a lot of the liquidity in the system has come out of RRP, that's provided a bit of stability or at least has helped drive better deposit resiliency over the last 6 months. But with the RRP expected to be exhausted over the next, call it, 3 to 4 months, just wanted to get a sense, once that happens, how you expect deposit flows to ultimately trend?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Yes, I'll start and Mike may have thoughts too because we talk about this a lot and it's more predictive than it is quantitatively spitting out results, frankly. But you're right that -- my sense is that the RRP program had a really significant impact on deposits. And it was effectively competing with banks for deposits. And now that it's come down, I do think that, that's been a help.Now from here is different. And I think -- we have to think about the fact that rate movements are going to also have an impact on how clients think about deposits. And with the deposit costs having gone up so much in the second half of the year and again, that had a big impact on deposit costs and client behavior, we could see that having an impact this year as rates come down. And so I think it's not just the RRP program but how clients think about instead of 5% rates, how they think about 3% rates and comparing that to maybe more of a risk on trade. And so I think we've got to think both about the program and the rate environment."", 'Michael Gerard O’Grady', ""I would agree with what Jason said there. And just as there was a transition on the way up with QE there's going to be a transition on the way down. Unchartered territory for everyone on QT and how they go about that and when they might stop more aggressively seeing their portfolio come down. So I think the timing of that will matter. And then also, we saw with client behavior that as rates went up, more of the liquidity moved into treasuries. And that had an impact on us. And as we come down, I think, over time, a lot of the funds that have moved into treasuries, will start to move into other alternatives. And as Jason said, our objective is to work with the clients and really try to meet any of those needs and keep the dollars in the house."", 'Steven Joseph Chubak', ""That's great. And just for my follow-up, the duration on the asset side of the balance sheet admittedly has been a little bit more volatile, especially given some of the repositioning actions you talked about, the asset betas with rate hikes were quite elevated for you guys and some of your trust peers as well. Just wanted to get a sense as to what percentage of the asset side of the balance sheet, if we took a snapshot today, is sensitive to movement in short rates as we do prepare for eventual rate cuts?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""We can do it in 3 buckets. And if you just take cash, obviously, 100% of that; the second, loans in roughly 3 quarters are rate sensitive. And you think about the securities portfolio and I'll give you 2 numbers to play with. One is, the duration is meaningful, it now about 1.8%. But also just the weighted average maturity of the portfolio, I think, is also helpful, which is a little under 4 years. And we quote this balance -- the duration of the balance sheet, that's just us doing a weighted average across those effectively, just to give a sense of the impact of the large size of the cash component and the large floating component of the loan book."", 'Steven Joseph Chubak', 'And Jason, can you just clarify what percentage of the securities book today is floating?', 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Yes, it's about 1/3 of the book is floating."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs."", 'Alexander Blostein', ""Just building on Steven's questions for a second. I guess given the fact that rates are expected to come down and you guys have actually been, I guess, shifting the balance sheet to be maybe a little bit more floating for the right reason and obviously been a good trade for NII for last quarter, this quarter. Any expectations to actually start locking in higher yields going forward and maybe extending duration a little bit. I know this is pretty quick, you guys have just kind of gone the other way but the balance sheet effectively became a little more floating as rates are about to come down. So just curious how you're thinking about that."", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Yes, it's on our mind a lot and as we're talking about it and we have brought the duration down. And one of the benefit to that is that it does make it just a lot more flexible because the markets have been really dynamic. And so there will come a time when -- I anticipate where we would say it's time to step out a little bit, our bias over the last year has obviously been to go shorter and that's played out. I think rates -- in the way rates have played out, we had a view and not materially but it worked in our favor. But from here, I think we do have to think about -- it's not locking in as much as just taking the downside risk off the table of a dramatic reduction in rates. And so there's some component there that we'd say we can naturally hedge against."", 'Alexander Blostein', ""Got you. Makes sense. I wanted to follow up for my second one just around the expense outlook. '23 was super noisy. There's a bunch of one-timers, obviously. So I just want to clarify a couple of things. So I guess the ultimate message is that 2024 expense growth is expected to be lower than 2023. I think the core expense growth in '23 was about 5%. So I just want to confirm that. And then the core base you're speaking to, is it still kind of $5.1 billion to maybe $5.2 billion in sort of core expense base of which we should think about '24?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""So confirm the '23 number we think of is 5%, just a little bit less than that, right at about 4.8%. And we are working from a base in '23 of 5.1%. And probably worthwhile to invest a minute and just explain because you're right, there have been a few things. So if you lock the reported [$5.284 billion] and then you take out in the year severance-related charges, with 2 occupancy charges that totaled about [$13 million], there was a client capability write-off, we mentioned in second quarter, $26 million; FDIC special assessment, $85 million. And then there was a small equipment credit of $4 million in the third quarter that was mentioned as well. And the severance-related charge in Q2 was $39 million, just to make sure I give you the numbers on everything. And so let's work -- that tells us we'd work from a base of 5.1%."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS."", 'Brennan Hawken', ""We'd love to follow up on that last question actually. So thanks for clarifying the base. That's helpful. #1, just to confirm, you did mention that I think it would be inclusive of adjusting for the write-off of the client capability. Just want to confirm that. And just to clarify the message on the investing, super clear that you're looking to drive expense growth lower than you saw in 2023 but you also laid out an uplift of 3% from base paying software. So does that represent like a floor to growth? Or do you have sufficient levers to offset at least some of that?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""It's not a floor but it does give you a sense of what's already in the '24 base from which we're working. And -- so we've got to use productivity to get aggressively at that. Some of our productivity work is already reflected in that but we've got to do more this year. And we wanted to be super transparent in the things that we already know that are in the '24 increase so that you guys can predict what that level is."", 'Brennan Hawken', 'Okay. And is the write-off of the capability that was in other operating expense part of the adjustments too, sorry, if I missed that.', 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', 'Yes.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Mike Brown with KBW.', 'Michael C. Brown', 'The sequential increase in the noninterest-bearing deposits, that was a positive to see this quarter. Could you just touch on maybe some of the key drivers there? Was this supported by some of the new business activity that you referenced in the prepared remarks. And then I appreciate the comments on the deposits and the potential for the stability here near term. But I guess, focusing on the NIBs, can they stabilize at this level, either in terms of like an absolute dollar basis or as a percentage of the total deposits?', 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""My observation in looking at it is that it's less percentage driven and more what is that base. And the reason I mention it that way is, a lot of that NIB, it comes from one of the channels in our institutional business and it actually performed better than the rest of the institutional business and looking at it over the last few weeks. And so it just tells me that, that client -- that subclient channel behaves on its own. And it looks like that has flattened out somewhat, not necessarily calling it a plateau at this point but it certainly behaved a little bit better than the rest of the institutional book. And another component is the wealth book, which -- that deposit base increased in the quarter. It was not dramatically but it was nice to see that up on average. And obviously, we saw, overall the whole deposit book very flat. But nice to see that the wealth book doing well because even though the noninterest-bearing is obviously highly attractive economically, the wealth deposits are very attractive as well, not at zero but they're very attractive. And that component did well in the quarter."", 'Michael C. Brown', ""Jason, I guess on the servicing side of the business, I was hoping you could maybe just touch on the competitive landscape and the alternative asset side of the business. How do you think about maybe that opportunity for Northern Trust? And how are your -- if you can just talk about your capabilities today and maybe where you're investing to take some share in that space?"", 'Michael Gerard O’Grady', ""Yes, Mike. So I'll address that. We believe that the alternative space or broadly speaking, just private markets is a major opportunity for us on the asset servicing side. And that largely follows with what's happening in the marketplace from an investor perspective. And so we expect that market to grow. And we think we have the value proposition that is compelling within that. You heard in my comments earlier that we recently won a very large mandate with one of the large private markets firms. And it was after an exhaustive process that we went through to win that business, very capabilities oriented, very global as to the capabilities necessary and the footprint necessary to do it. So again, it's an area of focus for us and one where we think we're going to be able to continue to grow as the market grows and as we're able to take share."", 'Michael C. Brown', 'Thanks, Mike. I appreciate the commentary there.', 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley."", 'Ryan Michael Kenny', ""I have a question on capital. So your CET1 ratio, 11.4%. It's well above the regulatory minimum, well above last year's level. And then we got the comment letter from Basel Endgame a couple of days ago and there's clearly a lot of industry pushback there. Your earnings generation from NII looks a little bit higher than consensus expected. So putting that all together, how should we think about how Northern's approaching buybacks this year, in this quarter. Is there any room to maybe lean in a little bit there?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Sure. So you're right in the tee up of the numbers. There's obviously room. We did a fair amount of buybacks in the quarter, a little bit more than we do on average. And we're always looking at that relative to other opportunities we have to invest capital. And so in the near term, we're thinking about, does it make more sense to invest in RWA effectively to say we could grow the loan book more. We could do more in FX. We could do more in sec lending. Or do we want to reposition the -- take a different repositioning in the securities portfolio? The repositionings we did this year were all helpful to capital because in going shorter we -- and out of non-HQLA into HQLA on that, we -- those are all helpful to capital. But you also know how closely we look at peers and we take pride in the capital levels we have. We think it's part of our financial model and our business model and talking to clients and being able to evidence to them how strong the capital base is. And so there's definitely room. But we also got to have in mind that Basel Endgame, which you referenced briefly, it's still unclear. We did do a comment letter, which you referenced but it's unclear what the impacts are going to be. We think we're in good position relative to peers but I want to keep an eye on that. But we'll also think about additional stock repurchases as we always do, given alternatives we have."", 'Ryan Michael Kenny', 'Okay. Great. And can you also update us on your expectations regarding ability and timing to dispose of the Class B Visa shares? And would that potentially have any impact on capital and buybacks outlook?', 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Yes. So just for people who don't follow it as closely, we own just over 4 million Visa B shares and at the current exchange rate, so that translates to about $1.7 billion. And there's a proposal that it's going to be voted on next week, I think, that would enable the B shareholders to monetize half of the holdings. So what are we planning to do? One, at this point, there's nothing to do. The proposal is still outstanding and we've got to wait and see what the shareholder vote looks like. Even assuming it passes, there are timing restrictions to it. But that said, this is not a strategic asset for Northern Trust. And so you should read into that. It's not something that we're saying we're going to hold on to beyond what the restrictions would enable us to do. And we're discussing all the options. There's likely going to be a combination of a few tools that we'll take but early to give details on that at this point."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank."", 'Brian Bertram Bedell', 'If I could just clarify, Jason, a couple of things you gave guidance on earlier, just to make sure I heard it right. The incremental NII from the 2 portfolio security sales is [$30 million] annualized and that comparison period is 1Q versus 4Q. Is that correct?', 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Yes. So you broke up a tiny bit but I think I'm following where you are but don't hesitate to tell me if I miss it. So the November repositioning helped in the quarter by, call it, $6 million. But that should be helpful going forward to the tune of -- in the neighborhood of $15 million a quarter. The January repositioning, which we mentioned for the first time a little while ago, that should help in the quarter about -- round number is about $15 million a quarter."", 'Brian Bertram Bedell', ""$15 million per quarter. Okay. And then on the expense side, maybe just, again, trying to get some more clarity on the total expense growth. I think you said comp expense being up [$50 million to $55 million] 1Q versus 4Q because of the retirement of eligible options and then employee benefits up $10 million versus 4Q. So correct me if I'm wrong on that. And then just translating that into expense growth through the year. Obviously, there's lots of different levers. But is the idea to try to improve on the 3% expense contribution from that -- from a total growth perspective? Or should we be thinking of expense growth stay better than 5% -- lower than 5% but potentially higher than 3%. And can you improve that trust expense to capacity ratio in '24 from '23?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Yes. So, couple of things. One, confirm your numbers are right on first quarter and the step up. Remember, both of those are fully seasonal, Brian, so the step-up in first quarter is just because that's the booking of our retirement eligible equity grants. And so that in and of itself represents the vast majority of that step-up. And then similarly, we've got a higher payroll tax in first quarter just as we hit the caps on that level. But both of those numbers come back down for second, third, fourth quarter. That said, second quarter got to build in the base pay adjustments that we referenced, which is that $65 million, that will be second, third, fourth quarter. So all that said, the goal is to do better than the roughly 5% we did this year. The 3% was not seen as the -- again, back to it's not seen as a floor. But also, that's a big difference to go from 5% down to 3%. And so we're using the productivity to do everything we can to get materially better than the 5%. But the fact that we're walking in with 3% already in the base is just going to make it difficult. And so I think it's -- and the last thing I'll mention is, for us, we're anticipating organic growth. That's our -- we target -- we have organic growth targets for each of the 3 businesses. And we want to continue to be a growth company. That is important. And that drives some expenses in addition to expectation of what we're doing from a revenue perspective. And so it's hard to fine-tune much with -- to say is it between 3% and 5%, if -- we're not doing as well from an organic perspective, we're going to be working really hard to say what else do we do to make sure we're doing the right thing and we get a positive fee operating leverage."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global."", 'James Francis Mitchell', ""Maybe just to follow-up on that last comment, just maybe a little more detail. It seems like organic growth in '23, it was a tough environment, a little mixed. So it seems like you're more optimistic across the board. So if you can kind of just give us a little more thoughts, detail on the organic growth prospects this year?"", 'Michael Gerard O’Grady', ""Sure, Jim. It's Mike. I'll start off here. So you're absolutely right. We've gone through I would say a time period where the organic growth has definitely been strained and lower than our historical levels. And there's a number of factors behind that, that we've talked about over the preceding earnings calls that relate to client activity, that relate to some of the outflows that we had in the asset management business, which obviously impact then wealth management and asset servicing. And the reason why we're so positive going forward here on organic growth, some of those trends, as we've talked about, have turned around. And so we see good inflows into asset management. So that aspect of it is a lift going forward to our organic growth but then also the strategies that we have in place to drive profitable organic growth.Where we've been focused as a company is in a couple of areas, there are few areas. One is really looking at the portfolio of our growth. So historically, asset servicing has been the majority of the organic growth. And looking forward, we're looking to shift that more towards the more scalable parts of our business. So wealth management and asset management. That doesn't mean that the asset servicing business will not be growing. It's just -- we're very focused within that business to the areas that scale the most. So if you think about the nature of all the things we do for clients on that front, some of those activities are more scalable, more profitable than others. And so we'll lean towards those areas. I mentioned the success we've had with asset owners in the Americas. A lot of that is the custody and related services on that front. That's some of the more scalable services that we have. And it's, again, not to say that we won't be doing the business with the asset managers, some fund services but some of those areas are more resource intensive. And so we're going to be really disciplined about the types of business that we take in, that require hiring more people, investing more in particular technologies around that. And then the last thing I would say just around the organic growth and why we're optimistic on it is, the businesses are working, I would say, much more closely together in how we go to market. So as we would call it here, 1 Northern Trust is our approach to the marketplace. So it's not separate businesses but rather to the extent that we're going to approach a client or a prospect to work with them, it's going to include multiple offerings from across the businesses, particularly asset management with asset servicing, on the front end, as part of a bundle that we're offering to the clients. And then certainly with Wealth Management as well. You heard in some of our earlier comments here, the advisory fee component of wealth management has been growing nicely through the year. We think that it can grow at a higher rate. But importantly, the more that we can do on the product side with those clients as well. So as we talk about the transitioning with quantitative tightening, for example and the move out of short-term treasuries to the extent that we can help those clients move into fixed income funds, for example. That's a real opportunity for us. So a number of things that we're doing to proactively try to drive that organic growth."", 'James Francis Mitchell', ""That's really great color, Mike. And maybe just a quick follow-up on deposit pricing. Jason, you talked about still some pressure on overall deposit costs. Is that lags still on pricing? Or is that an assumption of a negative mix shift out of NIBs. What's kind of driving further pricing pressure on deposits?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Yes. It's lags. And we actually, in the fourth quarter, made some agreements on pricing that will come into play in the first quarter more than they did in the fourth quarter. And it didn't drive deposit volumes higher in fourth quarter but it is something that as we try to do more fine-tuned predictions of what first quarter would look like. It's something that we factored in. We think that costs will be higher. And that's part of the reason why even though we ended it at [$501 million] and I indicated that December was better than November and October, we think we're still going to be flat to down a little bit in the first quarter, largely because of that pricing element. And in general, we do -- our view is that as the Fed does reduce rates, we're going to have client conversations about it. And again, we're not a price setter but highly committed to making sure our clients leave their deposits here."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research."", 'Robert Henry Wildhack', ""One more question on expenses. I'm curious how you would approach a hypothetical year where revenue growth comes in a lot better than expected and what that might mean for expense growth. I guess the core question is, what takes precedent, your expense-to-fee ratio or the absolute level of expense growth this year?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""I'll start and Mike may want to add to it. Historically, we'd say, well, we want to grow and -- but we have talked about ensuring that we were committed to more of an absolute number in terms of the expenses. And we've also committed to more scalable growth. And so we're already having conversations internally about ensuring that we're highly disciplined on bringing on business that is scalable. And so I think that is a change relative to how we've thought about it before, where there was more of a desire to bring on business at always at attractive margin. But our commitment to scalable growth is going to be -- is higher at this point. And that means that the expenses shouldn't be as volatile with anticipation or even line of sight on new business coming on that brings with it a high degree of expense."", 'Michael Gerard O’Grady', ""Yes. So I agree with what Jason said there. Just to add to your point, we're outside of our range on expense-to-trust fee ratio. So we're trying to drive that into the range. And so as Jason is indicating, we're leaning towards trying to get into that range sooner rather than later."", 'Robert Henry Wildhack', ""Okay. And then on NII, I would just love to get your thoughts on the sensitivity there as it relates to different scenarios from the Fed. What's the impact of, say, 1 or 2 Fed cuts this year, as opposed to, say, 6 Fed cuts?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""Yes, those are the scenarios we're looking at but I'd come back to this theme. It's just going to depend on how well we're able to hang on to spread. And we -- and there's just been highly variable. And I think our ability to predict just over the last couple of quarters has been really hard. But I feel really good about the volumes that stayed in place. And so I think our approach has worked but it's going to make it less predictable. It's the opposite of what we just talked about on the expense side, ironically, where we're saying we want to be more predictable on the expenses to try and get that expense-to-trustee ratio where we want it to be. On the deposit side, there's more flexibility and more willingness to follow where the market goes to make sure we're holding on the client assets."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo."", 'Robert Carr Rutschow', ""This is Rob Rutschow, for Mike. Just wanted to follow up on the custody commentary a little bit more. As we calculated, your fees assets under custody were down about 5% year-over-year. You mentioned client outflows. So how much of that is kind of risk off versus actual pricing pressure. What is -- what was the new business this year? And what's the outlook for pricing pressure versus new business as we look into '24?"", 'Michael Gerard O’Grady', ""Yes, I'll start and then, Jason, you can fill it out. But first of all, I just think you need to take into account that we are compensated sometimes on the asset level, sometimes on the transaction levels. And transaction volumes were lower during the year. So that drove some of the weakness in the custody fees there. From a pricing perspective, I would say nothing in particular as far as the competitive environment that is driving custody pricing to much lower levels, if you will, I would say it's relatively stable on the pricing front there."", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""And as I look at just the underlying details of how we did, I think you're leaning more towards the asset servicing business. The net new business for the year was positive. And year-over- -- I'm just thinking year-over-year for the quarter and asset servicing hit its mark on net new business. The issue with the company is some of the other things happening as we get into transactions and then what we referenced earlier, in our clients going through their asset levels declining but much less of a repricing story relative to prior years. And the business is winning. If we just look at their win rate in the market, it is strong. So a lot of this year, the impact came from these other dynamics of lower transaction volumes and same number of clients but less assets."", 'Robert Carr Rutschow', ""Okay. And if I could follow up on wealth. I guess, can you talk about the competitive dynamic there and especially in Global Family Office, you saw a little bit of deceleration in the growth rate. Any changes or any areas that you're looking to grow, inside the U.S. or out?"", 'Jason Jerrome Tyler', ""You're right to call it. GFO had a lower -- much lower growth rate than it has over the last couple of years. It's been -- the last couple of years have been excellent for that business. And this year was weaker but we always talk about the fact that is the spikiest business that we have, very small number of client activity can lead to meaningful change. And it's also one of the businesses where with what happens underneath from an investment management perspective can have a meaningful impact on how the business is doing. But we've actually invested heavily in that business. They've got a lot of accomplishments in technology and some of the things that they have done with their Wealth Passport, their overall technology platform, we feel is industry-leading -- it is industry leading. Just the way that they've -- they're now interacting with clients from that platform perspective, what clients are able to do with multiple accounts and reporting and client asset movement -- all coming -- and a lot of -- and it's all cloud-enabled, is what we've done recently. And so it's highly, at the -- market leading from our view in terms of what we're doing. And we're continuing to invest in that business from a technology perspective. So there's more coming, which makes us feel very optimistic about what that business is going to do over the next couple of years."", 'Operator', ""This does conclude the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I would like to turn the call back over to Jennifer Childe for any closing comments."", 'Jennifer Childe', 'Thanks, Ruth and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon.', 'Operator', ""This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.""]"

Now, Chevron is poised to enjoy access to high-upside assets offshore in Guyana and in the Permian Basin. Chevron's strong balance sheet, new growth opportunities, and growing dividend (yielding 4%) make it an all-in-one package for any long-term investor."", ""Chevron's arch-rival, ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), is similar in many ways -- the two companies are to U.S. energy what Ford and General Motors are to American automotive. The does-it-all oil and gas major ExxonMobil has earned its industry stripes by paying and raising its dividend for 41 consecutive years. While its debt-to-equity ratio is 0.2, a bit higher than Chevron's, ExxonMobil boasts a massive $33 billion of cash on its balance sheet, leaving only $8 billion in net debt."", 'Size is a competitive advantage in the energy business, and ExxonMobil has also used it to swallow up peers and smaller competitors. The company has a pending $59.5 billion all-stock acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, which will more than double its footprint in the Permian Basin. ExxonMobil also has assets in the Guyana region, where it has made several notable discoveries. In all, ExxonMobil is poised for strong long-term production.', ""ExxonMobil is an oil and gas company first, but it's also remained open to new markets. It's investing in carbon capture technology and lithium mining, which is projected to begin yielding results in 2027. ExxonMobil's low net debt and huge size give it financial flexibility that is somewhat unique in this capital-intensive industry. Consider ExxonMobil (as well as Chevron) stocks to dollar-cost average into and hold for the long haul."", ""Renewable energy has made a lot of progress over the past decade, now accounting\xa0for roughly 20% of all electricity used in the U.S. NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) is America's largest renewable energy producer. It also doubles as an electric utility in the Southeastern U.S. The tailwind of growing renewables has been good for NextEra's business -- shares have outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 10 years."", ""It's also a solid dividend stock, and its current 3% yield comes with consistent growth. NextEra has raised the payout for 29 consecutive years and counting. The stock became a bit turbulent in 2023 due to rising interest rates making borrowing more expensive. The company has leaned on borrowing to help fund growth, but it still has an investment-grade credit rating."", ""Additionally, long-term trends favor NextEra Energy. America as a whole is striving to reduce carbon emissions. Studies have estimated a $4 trillion investment opportunity now through 2050 that will demand 7,000 gigawatts (GW). Today, NextEra's production and storage capacity is only 70 GW, and there is 21 GW more in its backlog. Investors can buy the stock with confidence that the utility business is highly regulated and stable (people always need electricity), and the renewable business will continue to present long-term upside."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Chevron right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Chevron wasn't one of them.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates."", 'The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This parent company of Florida Power & Light Co. Is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.49 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -3.9%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $6.15 billion, down 0.2% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NextEra?', ""For NextEra, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +4.79%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination indicates that NextEra will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that NextEra would post earnings of $0.86 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.94, delivering a surprise of +9.30%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", 'NextEra appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

Let's talk to one of those companies. That is BNY Mellon President and CEO Robin Vince. Robin, good to see you here. Your company's 240 years old. Did we get that stat right?"", ""ROBIN VINCE: Yeah, you did. It's great to be with you, by the way. Thanks for having me here in Davos."", ""Yeah, this is our 240th year. We were founded by Alexander Hamilton. We're actually the oldest bank in the United States. But to your point earlier on, we are in a transformation."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: How do you-- how are you implementing AI in a company that is 240 years old?', ""ROBIN VINCE: Well, you only get to be 240 years old by continually reinventing yourself over the years. We've been part of a lot of innovation and transformations over the course of our history. And last year in 2023-- we just announced our results last week on Friday-- we really started to invest quite deeply in AI. We created an AI hub, and it's creating benefits for our clients. We have a service now that we deliver to clients that helps them to be able to see in the Treasury market what's likely to happen next in the post-trade process."", 'We also use AI to be able to help our research folks get a start on the day, a draft writing of the research. And then they come in a little later, and they can obviously polish it up, improve it, but it creates efficiency for them.', ""JULIE HYMAN: What are you hearing from your clients about these kind-- I mean, it sounds like you're using it a lot internally as well, but we've been sort of trying to figure out what the push and pull is when it comes to these type of AI services."", 'ROBIN VINCE: Well, AI is all the rage at Davos this year, as you probably know. The main promenade sort of converted from crypto to AI, it feels, for the week.', ""But our clients are excited. They're curious. They are a little cautious. They're not quite sure how it's going to happen, and that's where we bring our platforms at BNY Mellon to them to help them to navigate all of this because that's really what we are. We're a platforms company that helps our clients to navigate what's going on in the world. And so in the case of AI, they do look to us to help create solutions that ultimately is going to make their lives easier in the investment process."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: You mentioned crypto. Are you ready to make a big bet on crypto in light of what we have seen with the spot Bitcoin ETFs?', ""ROBIN VINCE: Our focus has always been, Brian, on the digital-asset ecosystem more broadly, tokenization. How can assets that maybe haven't been part of the financial system be brought into the financial system and be easier to transact, to move, to manage, to store, which is really the heart of our business? And so that's our primary focus in the tokenization/digital-asset space."", ""JULIE HYMAN: So we've talked about AI. We've talked about digital assets. Let's talk about the core business of banking and what affects it, namely interest rates, right? You've talked about that your net interest income is going to come back a little bit as we start to see changes in rates. What are you expecting on rates this year?"", ""ROBIN VINCE: Well, we have a great vantage point as a company, and we're very privileged with our business, with our clients. We touch about 20% of all investable assets in the world, and about 40% of our revenues come from outside of the US, so we have that global reach. So the answer on rates depends market by market, but to the US--"", ""JULIE HYMAN: Let's talk US."", ""ROBIN VINCE: Sure. So in the US, I think the Fed's done a pretty good job in navigating everything that they've had to deal with. You know, we had COVID. We had a surge in inflation. We've had the longest, quickest campaign in rate rises in 40 years. We've talked a lot about that. And so far, people are still talking about the possibilities of soft landings."", ""Now, that's going to be super hard to pull off. It hasn't happened in recent times, certainly not with this backdrop. We're rooting for it, no question, but we're in the preparedness business. So we help our clients to be able to manage whether or not rates are going to go up or down."", ""Now, it's our house view that we will see rate cuts this year, maybe a little less than what the market's expecting right now and maybe a little later as well. But, you know, we'll have to see."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: We're hearing from a lot of international investors a more level of concern as we near the presidential election. When you talk to those international clients, are they wanting to or do you think they'll pull back on how much they're investing in the United States in the lead up to the election?"", ""ROBIN VINCE: Well, I was in an event yesterday, actually, and it was interesting. There were several European leaders there, including some heads of state, and there was this conversation around the fact that people around the world have to prepare for the different eventualities of what can happen in politics. You know, we have half the world's population going into elections this year, so it's not just about the US. We've got other important elections in other places."", ""But I think it's right, and this is again back to us. We're in the preparedness business. Our clients need to be in the preparedness business. They expect us to help them sort of navigating whether something happens one way or another way. You've got to be prepared. You can't roll the dice on these types of things."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: How are they preparing?', 'JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.', ""ROBIN VINCE: Well, you can be prepared by looking carefully at your business, by investing in whether rates might go up a little bit or whether they go down a little bit. Is the stock market going to have a good year, or is it not going to have such a good year? How do you get your business-- resilience matters. We saw-- we learned those lessons in 2023. We saw that if you're not prepared from an asset liability management basis, you can get yourself into trouble. That's what happened in the spring. If you're not operationally resilient, you're not there and ready for cyber. We help to try to wrap our platforms around our clients so they can be resilient to more types of things."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Lastly, quickly before we let you go, do you expect a more risk-off environment in markets in that month or two before the election?', ""ROBIN VINCE: Look, the way that markets play out, markets don't like uncertainty, and so we'll have to see how the election in the US is playing out at a given moment in time, and markets are going to react to that. But markets have a pretty good ability to look through events and look through into the future, but uncertainty isn't helpful. And so again, you've got to be ready for that."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Unhelpful indeed. BNY Mellon President and CEO Robin Vince, good to get some time with you here at Davos. Really appreciate it.', 'ROBIN VINCE: Great to be with you Brian, Julie. Thank you so much.', 'BRIAN SOZZI: Thank you so much. Appreciate it.']"

The bank provides financial services for institutions, corporations, and individual investors and delivers investment management and investment services in 35 countries and more than 100 markets. BNY Mellon is the largest global custody bank in the world, with about $44.3 trillion in under custody and administration (as of Dec. 31, 2022), and can act as a single point of contact for clients looking to create, trade, hold, manage, service, distribute, or restructure investments. BNY Mellon's asset-management division manages about $1.8 trillion in assets."", 'Bank of New York Mellon Corp has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1985, with dividends currently distributed on a quarterly basis. The company has increased its dividend each year since 2010, earning it the title of a dividend achiever, reserved for companies with at least 14 consecutive years of dividend increases. Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share to track historical trends.', ""As of today, Bank of New York Mellon Corp currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.89% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 3.07%, suggesting an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months. Over the past three years, the company's annual dividend growth rate was 6.40%, which increased to 9.70% per year over a five-year horizon. Over the past decade, the annual dividends per share growth rate stands at an impressive 11.10%. Based on the dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of Bank of New York Mellon Corp stock as of today is approximately 4.59%."", ""To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. As of 2023-12-31, Bank of New York Mellon Corp's dividend payout ratio is 0.40, indicating a balanced approach to dividend distribution and earnings retention. Bank of New York Mellon Corp's profitability rank is 6 out of 10 as of 2023-12-31, suggesting fair profitability. The company's consistent positive net income over the past decade further solidifies its financial stability."", ""Bank of New York Mellon Corp's growth rank of 6 out of 10 suggests a fair growth outlook. However, the company's revenue and earnings growth rates indicate some challenges. Bank of New York Mellon Corp's revenue has grown at an average rate of 4.90% per year, underperforming approximately 52.54% of global competitors. The 3-year EPS growth rate has decreased by about -7.70% per year on average, underperforming approximately 67.49% of global competitors. Additionally, the 5-year EBITDA growth rate of -1.00% underperforms approximately 68.08% of global competitors, highlighting areas for potential improvement."", ""In conclusion, while Bank of New York Mellon Corp has a strong history of dividend payments and has demonstrated growth in its dividend per share over the years, investors should consider the company's moderate payout ratio, fair profitability, and mixed growth metrics when evaluating the sustainability of future dividends. With a balanced approach to dividends and earnings retention, the company appears to be maintaining a prudent financial strategy. However, the underperformance in revenue and earnings growth compared to peers suggests that investors should keep an eye on the company's strategic initiatives to improve these metrics.

Today, though, was an opportunity to bring those conversations to life and remind us what we're all fighting for."", 'In 2020, Mastercard founded the Priceless Planet Coalition with Conservation International and World Resources Institute, uniting the efforts of businesses and consumers to fight climate change, with a goal of restoring 100 million trees across six continents.', ""We work with scientific experts to design and identify projects and ensure the integrity of our restoration practices.

In addition to capturing carbon, these mangroves protect coastlines from storm surges and provide habitat for a wide variety of marine species, which in turn keep local fisheries healthy and the regional economy thriving', ""COP28 offered a perfect moment for our customers and partners to understand what makes the Priceless Planet Coalition extraordinary and distinct from other planting and restoration programs. On this day, they experienced a critical ecosystem firsthand, and contributed to its future by planting mangrove saplings. Our aim was to inspire them to launch their own campaigns to support the coalition's goal of restoring 100 million trees."", ""We set off that morning with Sanjayan, Johan Rockström of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Conservation International's chief scientist, and other world-renowned conservation experts and climate scientists.

Sanjayan called these mangrove forests the ""the hardest-working habitats on earth.""', ""We boarded our kayaks and paddled out under the beating sun, which sharpened every detail of our surroundings - the faintest ripples on the placid water, the black-tipped wings of flamingos in flight and slender stalks of mangrove saplings spearing the water's surface as they stretched toward the sky. We learned more from our experts during our time on the water, but as Sanjayan suggested, we also let the beauty and peace of the landscape speak for itself. You can hear it; you just have to be willing to listen."", ""As the tide began to recede, we drew up to shore, eager for the main event. Toting foot-tall saplings, we walked along the beach to the planting site, brushing the dirt from the mangroves' root balls and setting them carefully into the muddy soil. Our hands and knees were coated in silvery gray silt, our necks turned pink in the heat, our shoulders tight and sore - but our spirits high."", 'While everyone at COP28 understood the precariousness of the moment, this trip to Mangrove Beach underscored the possibility of our mission.

To date, countries worldwide have been reluctant to carry out deep-sea mining activities due to the risks involved, that are thought to be greater than onshore mining. But Norway views the move as key to accessing minerals critical to achieving a global green transition. So, could this encourage other countries to do the same?', 'This month, Norway’s parliament voted to open its waters for commercial-scale deep-sea mining. Those who support the bill believe the extraction of metals and minerals from the ocean’s seabed will be necessary to support the growing demand for these materials under a global green transition. Norway hopes the move will support a shift away from fossil fuels in favour of renewable alternatives. Advocates also suggest that the practice could be less harmful to the environment than land-based mining.', 'Potato-sized nodules of critical minerals, including cobalt, nickel, copper, and manganese can be found at the bottom of the sea floor. These minerals have previously only been accessed from large-scale mining projects on land, which are also destructive to the environment. Many countries are investing in the expansion of land mining activities in response to the growing global demand for these minerals. As countries worldwide shift away from a reliance on fossil fuels and invest in renewable energy projects, clean technologies and electric vehicles, the demand for critical minerals is expected to rise sharply in the coming decades. Gerard Barron, CEO of Vancouver-based The Metals Co.,\xa0explained, ""What are the alternatives if we don\'t go to the ocean for these metals? The only alternative is more land mining and more pushing into sensitive ecosystems, including rainforests.”', 'At present, several forecasts say that there are not enough mining activities at present to meet this demand. This is driving leaders worldwide to investigate alternative ways to meet this growing demand. By 2040, the world will require twice the amount of cobalt, nickel, copper, and manganese as it uses today to meet global energy transition targets, according to the International Energy Agency.', 'Norway’s plan allows companies to apply for mining licenses for critical minerals in the country’s waters, near the Svalbard archipelago, which covers an area of around 280,000 square kilometres. The country would not start drilling immediately, rather it will accept proposals from firms applying for licenses to be assessed for approval.', 'However, critics suggest that deep-sea mining is\xa0extremely destructive\xa0and much of the potential impact on the environment is still unknown. Scientists do not yet know what impact the removal of the large mineral nodules from the seabed could have on the ecosystems under the sea. However, there are strong arguments both for and against deep-sea mining, particularly as it is expected to take a long time until the potential impact of the practice is fully understood. Jessica Battle, the leader of the World Wildlife Fund’s No Deep Seabed Mining Initiative, explained, “Scientists are projecting it will take decades before we know enough about the deep sea to make those informed decisions, to not jeopardize and destroy something before we actually really know what it will do for us.”', 'Both the U.K. and the European Commission have enforced temporary bans on the practice until there is a greater understanding of the impact of deep-sea mining on the environment. Several companies, such as BMW and Google, have also called for bans. A letter from EU lawmakers urging Norway to reconsider the move stated, “The sheer importance of the ocean to our planet and people, and the risk of large-scale and permanent loss of biodiversity, ecosystems, and ecosystem functions, necessitates a pause of all efforts to begin mining of the deep sea.” The Norway Environment Agency and its many citizens have also condemned the plan due to environmental concerns.', 'Meanwhile, the International Seabed Authority (ISA) is working to establish regulations for deep-sea mining, as companies and governments worldwide look for alternative ways to access critical minerals. There are several different approaches to deep-sea mining, which are being assessed for their potential impact on the environment by the Authority. The ISA missed a July 2023 deadline for setting standards for the sector, making it easier for Norway and other powers to move forward on deep-sea mining plans.', 'Norway is not the only country looking to commence deep-sea mining operations for critical minerals, with Japan and the Cook Islands making similar advances on deep-sea mining plans in recent years. It is not surprising that countries are looking to deep-sea mining to meet the growing demand for critical minerals. A U.S. Geological Survey suggests that The Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CZZ) - an environmental management area of the Pacific Ocean, administered by the ISA, which covers around 1.3 percent of the ocean floor – contains more nickel, cobalt, and manganese than all on-land deposits. This has led many to question whether deep-sea mining may be less environmentally damaging than land mining, as producers would only need to mine a small area to see big results. However, scientists and climate activists are wary of entering into new, invasive energy activities without fully understanding the potential impact on the environment, making Norway’s move extremely controversial.', 'By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.com', 'More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:', 'Beijing Navigates Shifting Sands in Middle East Politics', 'Protecting Coasts and Powering Homes: The Tidal Range Revolution', 'Space-Based Solar Farms Could Power the Planet from Orbit', 'Read this article on OilPrice.com']"

On top of that, the share price is up 49% in about a quarter."", ""So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress."", ' Check out our latest analysis for PulteGroup ', 'While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.', ""Over half a decade, PulteGroup managed to grow its earnings per share at 34% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 31% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS."", 'The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).', 'We know that PulteGroup has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? If you are thinking of buying or selling PulteGroup stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.', ""When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, PulteGroup's TSR for the last 5 years was 313%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return."", ""We're pleased to report that PulteGroup shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 109% over one year. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 33% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand PulteGroup better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance.

The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.66% for the week ending Jan 11, 2024, according to data from Freddie Mac.Since late October 2023, mortgage rates have decreased by more than 110 basis points, according to Freddie Mac. This positive trend has shifted the future sales expectation component in the HMI into positive territory for the first time since August.Notably, all three major HMI indices posted gains in January. The HMI index assessing current sales conditions rose by seven points to 48, the component measuring sales expectations in the next six months increased 12 points to 57, and the component evaluating the traffic of prospective buyers grew by five points to 29.Analyzing the three-month moving averages for regional HMI scores, the Northeast saw a four-point increase to 55, the South experienced a two-point increase to 41, the West recorded a one-point gain to 32, and the Midwest remained steady at 34.Importantly, despite the decline in mortgage rates to below 7% in the past month, many builders are still opting to reduce home prices to stimulate sales. In January, 31% of builders reported price reductions, a decrease from 36% in the previous two months and the lowest rate since last August. The average price reduction in January remained at 6%, unchanged from the previous month. Concurrently, 62% of builders offered various sales incentives in January, a figure that has remained stable between 60% and 62% since October.The forecast for 2024 anticipates growth in single-family starts, providing much-needed inventory to the market. As home building expands in 2024, the market is likely to confront growing supply-side challenges, leading to higher prices and/or shortages of lumber, lots, and labor.', 'Adding some homebuilding stocks to your portfolio seems to be a judicious move at this point, given solid demand.

While good news for shareholders, the company has traded much higher in the past year. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Goodyear Tire & Rubber’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Goodyear Tire & Rubber ', 'According to our valuation model, Goodyear Tire & Rubber seems to be fairly priced at around 3.9% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Goodyear Tire & Rubber today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $14.49, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Goodyear Tire & Rubber’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.', 'Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a relatively muted revenue growth of 3.7% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for Goodyear Tire & Rubber, at least in the short term.', 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in GT’s future outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on GT, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. While conducting our analysis, we found that Goodyear Tire & Rubber has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it."", 'If you are no longer interested in Goodyear Tire & Rubber, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Instead, it will focus on maximizing utilization of existing Boeing 757 narrowbody and 767 medium freighters in its Canada overnight express network and on international charter routes.', 'The airline had previously telegraphed that two of the large freighters would be operated for DHL Express, but co-CEO James Porteous on Thursday said Cargojet changed its mind when it couldn’t get firm commitments for the other two units and realized economies of scale weren’t possible with such a small fleet.', 'Cargojet originally envisioned having eight 777s, but last year it decided not to move forward with an investment in four 777-300s — eventually selling them and canceling production slots at an Israeli retrofit company. Porteous said the -300s were speculative investments that didn’t pan out with express operators or other cargo airlines once demand began contracting in 2022 from record highs fueled by the pandemic’s disruption of supply chains.', 'Spreading the fixed cost of hiring crews, pilot training, flight simulator time, spare parts and maintenance infrastructure across several revenue aircraft is much more efficient with a larger fleet, according to aviation experts, and Cargojet realized that even four aircraft were too few to justify the upfront expenditures. It had budgeted $1.2 billion to launch the 777 program.', '“When we looked at the cost of capital as a public company — everything from ramping up the number of pilots [and maintenance staff] we would need to hire to cover the first two aircraft and routes for DHL, plus all the spare parts and tooling, and we’d have to buy or build a hangar at our hub in Hamilton [Ontario] because the aircraft doesn’t fit in our existing hangars — we just finally came to the conclusion this doesn’t make economic sense. It’s not a great use of capital,” Porteous said in a phone interview from an investor conference in Whistler, British Columbia.', 'Cargojet netted $75 million to $82 million from buying and selling the 777-200s, according to Monday’s announcement.', 'Porteous declined to identify who bought the 777-200s and a flight simulator, but Jetran confirmed it is the buyer.', '“Jetran basically decided to step into Cargojet’s commitments to take those four airplanes because we see tremendous value in the [777 passenger-to-freighter] program and that asset class,” CEO Jordan Jaffe said in an interview. He declined to say how much Jetran paid for the aircraft or who the end user will be.', 'Mammoth Freighters, which is working to validate its design and get it certified by the Federal Aviation Administration for use in commercial aircraft, has 35 confirmed orders. Jetran has more than 20 of them, including nine 777-200s that will be resold to DHL Express.', 'Mammoth has a large maintenance hangar in Fort Worth, Texas, where conversion kits are being installed using Mammoth’s design, as well as a licensed contractor in the United Kingdom. It will also offer conversions for the 777-300.', 'Assembly work involves gutting the plane’s interior, adding a rigid barrier to protect the cockpit, installing a large door for pallets and reinforcing the floor to support heavy loads. The process typically takes four to five months for a large airliner, but prototype aircraft used for validation flights and certification take longer to complete.', 'The downturn in the air cargo market since the spring of 2022 has chilled orders for factory-built and converted freighters, raising concerns of a potential glut in narrowbody freighters as prior orders continue to be fulfilled. Analysts say there still is a need for more widebody capacity with Boeing last year ending production of the 747 jumbo jet, Western sanctions against Russia for invading Ukraine effectively removing many extra-large freighters from the market, airlines retiring MD-10 and MD-11 freighters, and other aircraft starting to reach the end of their useful life.', 'Jaffe said Cargojet’s decision doesn’t reflect on its sales forecast or confidence in Mammoth Freighters.', '“They’re extremely well capitalized. They have an A-team of industry experts and some of the best facilities we’ve ever seen,” he said.', 'Jetran, based in Horseshoe Bay, Texas, last year acquired five 747-400 freighters, which are more than 20 years old, from Taiwan-based China Airlines in a sale-leaseback as a gateway platform for new 777 converted freighters or next-generation 777s to be built by Boeing, said Jaffe.', 'The jumbo freighters, he explained, allow Jetran to pursue new customers that can eventually move into the 777 and provide a bridge for existing customers that need aircraft until the Mammoth conversions are available. Airlines can take a short-term lease of three or four years and then transition to the 777 converted freighters.', '“I don’t mind using the 747 as essentially a stopgap airplane,” Jaffe said.', 'The 777s are heavy-lift aircraft that can carry more than 100 tons. The wide fuselage makes them well suited for dense freight and light e-commerce shipments. Mammoth’s 777-300 converted freighter is designed with 14% more volume than a 747-400 and is ideal for lightweight freight that takes up space because it has more interior volume but a similar weight payload to the 777-200. That translates into 10 more main-deck pallet positions than the -200LR. The 777-300 is ideal for medium-length routes of about eight hours. The 777-200 is aimed more at long, intracontinental routes. Both variants are twin-engine aircraft and much cheaper to operate than four-engine 747s.', 'Cargojet is focusing on its existing fleet of 41 freighters — 17 Boeing 757 narrowbody aircraft and 24 Boeing 767 medium widebodies.', '“The commonality of the flight deck with one pilot for both aircraft types, commonality of parts, makes a lot more sense for us to continue,” especially in the domestic Canada market, Porteus told FreightWaves. “We feel we can continue to grow the ACMI [dedicated contract transport] business with DHL with the 17 or 18 aircraft that we have operating with them today.”', 'Porteus acknowledged that Cargojet likely won’t be able to sell four Boeing 757s recently identified as surplus because the industry has an oversupply of standard-size cargo jets. He said Cargojet may be able to lease two aircraft and will return the others to service when parcel and freight demand pick up again.', 'Click here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper articles by Eric Kulisch.', 'Contact reporter: ekulisch@freightwaves.com\xa0', 'Cargojet reverses course on 777 freighter ambitions', 'DHL Express to buy 9 Boeing 777 jets converted for cargo', 'The post Jetran buys Cargojet rights for 777 freighter conversions appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

Unfortunately, geopolitical tensions are escalating in several hotspots worldwide, as illustrated by the ongoing clashes in the Red Sea.', 'Furthermore, the aerospace and defense sector is attractive because these are excellent businesses that enjoy significant strategic moats. They have longstanding relationships with their customers (governments), and this industry features significant regulatory barriers to entry. Furthermore, building these types of products requires substantial technological expertise and investment in R&D. Because of these factors, it is difficult for newcomers to disrupt these companies.', 'With this in mind, which is the best defense ETF? Read on to find out.', 'According to BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the “iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. equities in the aerospace and defense sector.”', 'The fund invests in U.S. companies that manufacture commercial and military aircraft and other defense equipment.', 'ITA has been around since 2006, and it is the largest aerospace and defense ETF with $5.9 billion in assets under management.', 'ITA has provided investors with solid returns over the years. As of December 31, 2023, the fund has generated an annualized three-year return of 11.2%, an annualized five-year return of 9.2%, and an annualized 10-year return of 10.3%.', 'The fund owns 36 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 76.15% of assets.\xa0Below is an overview of ITA’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.', 'As you can see, it’s very concentrated in its top holdings, like Raytheon (NYSE:RTX) and Boeing (NYSE:BA), which have massive weightings of 17.6% and 16.6%, respectively.', 'Overall, this has been a good ETF over the years, but this outsized position in Boeing may be cause for concern at this point, as the aircraft manufacturer has become embroiled in a number of mishaps early in 2024. These include the highly-publicized incident in which the door plug came off of a Boeing 737 midflight, causing an emergency landing, and a collision involving two Boeing airplanes at Chicago’s O’Hare airport.', 'Boeing clearly faces significant questions going forward, and the issues led several sell-side analysts to downgrade the stock. ITA gives investors a lot of exposure to the troubled stock, which is cause for concern.', 'Turning to Wall Street, ITA earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 27 Buys, nine Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average ITA stock price target of $134.24 implies 10.75% upside potential.', 'Lastly, ITA features an expense ratio of 0.40%, meaning that an investor in the fund will pay $40 on a $10,000 investment annually.\xa0ITA has been a strong performer over the years, but its large position in Boeing could be a headwind in the short-to-intermediate term.', 'This brings us to the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF. State Street’s XAR launched in 2011 and has $1.9 billion in assets under management.', 'According to fund sponsor State Street, XAR “seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, generally correspond to the total return performance of the S&P Aerospace & Defense Select Industry Index.” This is a “modified equal-weighted index which provides the potential for unconcentrated industry exposure across large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks.”', 'This modified equal-weighted approach is appealing because it means that, unlike ITA, XAR doesn’t have massive exposure to Boeing. While Boeing makes up 16.6% of ITA, XAR has a more manageable 3.5% weighting towards Boeing. In fact, it isn’t even one of XAR’s top 10 positions.', 'In total, XAR owns 35 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 41.6% of the fund, so it is far less concentrated than ITA. Below is an overview of XAR’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.', 'As you can see, XAR is more diversified than ITA, as its top holdings like Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON), L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX), and Raytheon (NYSE:RTX) each have weightings of just 4.2%.', 'As of December 31, 2023, XAR generated a fairly underwhelming three-year annualized return of 6.3% but much more impressive five- and 10-year annualized returns of 12.2% and 11.7%, respectively.\xa0This three-year return was worse than ITA’s, but its five- and 10-year returns were slightly better.', 'Like ITA, XAR earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys, 10 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average XAR stock price target of $148.13 implies 14.75% upside potential.', 'Finally, XAR’s expense ratio of 0.35% is the cheapest of the group. I’m constructive on XAR, given its strong long-term five- and 10-year performance, its lower exposure to Boeing, and the fact that it has the most cost-effective expense ratio of these three major defense ETFs.', 'Invesco’s PPA launched in 2005 and has $2.6 billion in AUM.\xa0According to Invesco (NYSE:IVZ), PPA invests at least 90% of its assets in the SPADE Defense Index, an index that is comprised of the stocks of companies that are “involved in the development, manufacturing, operations and support of US defense, homeland security and aerospace operations.”', 'PPA has outperformed both ITA and XAR in recent years. As of December 31, the fund has an annualized three-year return of 12.1%, an annualized five-year return of 14.8%, and an annualized 10-year return of 13.3%.', 'PPA holds 52 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 52.2% of assets.\xa0Below is an overview of PPA’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.', 'As you can see, like XAR, PPA has a more manageable position in Boeing (accounting for 5.05% of the fund).\xa0On the downside, PPA is the most expensive of these three funds, with an expense ratio of 0.58%.', 'PPA earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 40 Buys, 12 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average PPA stock price target of $99.14 implies 9.7% upside potential.', 'In conclusion, I’m optimistic about all three of these ETFs as the aerospace and defense sector looks well-positioned for the short term based on escalating tensions worldwide and for the long term based on the strong moats these businesses enjoy.', 'All three are good ETFs, and they all invest in similar businesses. One key difference is that ITA is much more exposed to Boeing than the other two ETFs discussed here. Given the considerable issues that Boeing is dealing with right now, this could be a detriment to ITA, going forward. Based on that, I am ranking XAR and PPA ahead of ITA at this point in time.', 'PPA and XAR have a lot in common, and both feature lower exposure to Boeing. PPA has generated slightly better returns, but I view XAR as the best choice at the moment because its expense ratio is significantly lower than PPA’s, making it the winner here.', 'Disclosure']"

Akasa Air’s order of 737 Max 10 and 737 Max 8-200 jets will be delivered over eight years and does not include any Max 9 aircraft.', 'Boeing has shed 15% of its market capitalization since the Jan. 5 failure—roughly $22 billion—starting the year with both a literal bang and a whimper. Akasa Air’s order of jets still represents a sorely needed boost for Boeing, though. Akasa Air will be banking on Boeing’s sustainable innovation to make a positive impression in India’s growing aviation market.', '“The lower carbon emissions of the 737 Max family allow us to remain focused on sustainable operations, while also providing our environmentally conscious passengers with a more comfortable way to fly,” Akasa Air CEO and founder Vinay Dube said in a press release.', 'The ordered 737 Max jets will reduce fuel use and carbon emissions by 20% and produce 50% less noise compared to older generations of planes, according to Boeing.', 'The addition of 150 Boeing planes will more than double Akasa Air’s fleet to 226 aircraft. Launched in 2022, Akasa Air makes up 4% of India’s market, according to India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation.', 'Aircraft sustainability efforts have flourished in the past few years. While Boeing’s efforts have attracted Akasa Air, it may not be enough to distinguish themselves from rival Airbus, which forms a global ""duopoly,"" as noted by Bank of America Research.', 'International Air Transport Association member airlines passed the Fly Net Zero resolution in October 2021, committing to reach net zero carbon status by 2050.

Like Boeing, Airbus is expanding the use of SAF. Airbus updated its older commercial model family of the A320ceo to the A320neo in 2010, claiming that the A320neo models are able to use a 50% SAF blend. The company hopes to use 100% SAF for the models by 2030, as does Boeing. Airbus spokesperson Kristi Tucker said they hope to have a hydrogen-powered plane in service by 2035.', ""James Darcy, aviation consultant, former head of communications of Airbus for the Americas and member of the National Aeronautic Association’s Sustainability Advisory Committee, told Fortune that one challenge airline companies face when ordering more sustainable aircrafts is the time it takes for the planes to be delivered, saying that both Boeing and Airbus have 10-year backlogs. “Airlines are having to make decisions today based on what's available that will influence their fleet composition 10 years from now,” he said. As supply chain delays have hampered aircraft production, manufacturing has been unable to keep up with advancing sustainable technologies."", 'A Boeing spokesperson did not disclose when the 737 Max aircraft would be delivered to Akasa Air.', 'While manufacturers are making long-term investments in hydrogen-propulsion systems and electric airplanes, airlines have to settle for purchasing aircrafts that use SAF to reduce carbon emissions gradually.', 'Akasa Air may have drawn to Boeing’s sustainability mission, but Darcy said the Boeing 737 Max is just as sustainable as Airbus’ A320neo.', ""“You're not going to have a big competitive differentiator one way or another in the current generation on the sustainability front,” Darcy said. “Those decisions are more likely going to come down to things like cost to operate, cost to own and overall reliability. It's an interesting choice given the current headlines on the Max aircraft.”"", 'Akasa Air did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Before making this announcement, TE Connectivity was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business."", 'The next year is set to see EPS grow by 48.8%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 28% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.', 'The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was $0.84, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.36. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 11% a year over that time.

Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. In the last five years, TE Connectivity's earnings per share has shrunk at approximately 3.7% per annum.

Earnings are predicted to grow over the next year, but we would remain cautious until a track record of earnings growth is established."", ""In summary, it's great to see that the company can raise the dividend and keep it in a sustainable range. The earnings coverage is acceptable for now, but with earnings on the decline we would definitely keep an eye on the payout ratio. Taking all of this into consideration, the dividend looks viable moving forward, but investors should be mindful that the company has pushed the boundaries of sustainability in the past and may do so again."", 'Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Given that earnings are not growing, the dividend does not look nearly so attractive.

This is a shipping company that is focused on the transportation of oil and gas. I am sure that you have seen the escalation of tensions and violence in the Red Sea and that geopolitical news is going to cause shipping rates to move a lot higher. Even ships that are not in the Red Sea will see prices increase as the potential for attacks outside of the region has grown. Let’s explore more about this company in this Bull of The Day article.', 'Navigator Holdings Ltd. owns and operates a fleet of handy-size liquefied gas carriers.

The price book is at 0.95x which means that we are buying this stock for less than the value of the assets on the books. Value players love a stock that is below 1x on price to book and with good growth and earnings growth this makes this a great play here. Margins increased from 10.8% in June to 13.4% in September.', 'Marathon Oil is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as earnings estimates have tracked lower due to softer demand for oil.

When I experienced the inconvenience of living without things that I normally take for granted, I realized that our lives heavily depend on energy and other infrastructure.""', 'As a result, Takahito focuses on how he can help address similar problems.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This spices and seasonings company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +9.6%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $1.8 billion, up 5.9% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.32% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.

However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill."", 'Bill Demchak: Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. During a challenging and volatile operating environment for the banking industry, PNC performed well during 2023 and delivered a solid finish in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2023, adjusting for the fourth quarter impact of the FDIC special assessment and expenses related to a staff reduction initiative that we completed in the fourth quarter, we earned $14.10 per diluted share compared to $13.85 per diluted share in 2022. Throughout the year and amidst all the disruption, we continue to grow our customer base and deepen relationships across our coast-to-coast franchise. Importantly, we generated record revenue and controlled core expenses, which allowed us to deliver a modest amount of positive adjusted operating leverage.', ""For the fourth quarter, we reported $883 million in net income or $1.85 diluted per share and $3.16 per share on an adjusted basis. Rob is going to take you through the financials in a moment, but I'd like to highlight a few points. First, as we announced in early October, we closed on the acquisition of the capital commitment loans from Signature, which is immediately accretive to earnings. Secondly, as we expected, we saw meaningful growth from non-interest income during the fourth quarter, driven primarily by a rebound in capital markets and advisory fees. Third, we completed the actions to reduce our workforce and we are positioned to realize $325 million of expense savings in 2024. This is in addition to our CIP savings target for 2024 that Rob will discuss in a few minutes."", 'Expense discipline remains a top priority for us and accordingly we are targeting stable expenses for 2024 even as we continue to invest in key growth initiatives. Fourth, our credit quality remained strong during the quarter, reflecting our thoughtful approach us to growing our balance sheet. While we continue to expect credit charge offs to increase over time, particularly in the CRE office segment, we’re adequately reserved. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we increased our capital position, saw solid improvement in our AOCI intangible book value and repurchased a modest amount of shares. In summary, we run our company with a focus on delivering through the cycle performance and feel very good about our strategy, our capabilities and the strength of our balance sheet as we enter 2024.', ""And we believe we are well positioned to drive growth and deliver shareholder value in the coming year and beyond. As always, I want to thank our employees for everything they do to meet the needs of our customers and make our success possible. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob."", 'Rob Reilly: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis and compared to the third quarter. Loans were up 2% and averaged $325 billion, which includes the acquired Signature capital commitment loans. Investment securities declined $2 billion or 2%. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve increased $4 billion to $42 billion and deposits increased $1.4 billion and averaged $424 billion. Borrowed funds increased $5 billion to $73 billion, driven by higher FHLB borrowings and parent company senior debt issuances. At year end, P&C was fully compliant with the proposed holding company long term debt requirements. And we expect to reach compliance with the bank level metrics through our normal course of funding well in advance of the phase in period.', 'AOCI improved $2.6 billion to negative $7.7 billion at quarter end, primarily reflecting the impact of favorable interest rate movements during the quarter. Accordingly, tangible book value increased to $85.08 per common share, up 9% linked quarter and 18% compared to the same period a year ago. We remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.9% as of December 31st, which increased 10 basis points linked quarter. Our estimated fully phased in expanded risk based CET1 ratio based on the new proposed capital rules would be approximately 8.2% at year end, which is well above our current requirement of 7%. We continue to be well positioned with capital flexibility. During the quarter, we resumed modest share repurchase activity of approximately $100 million or roughly 0.5 million.', 'And when combined with $600 million of common dividends, we returned a total of $700 million of capital to shareholders. Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Compared to the third quarter, average loan balances increased 2%, driven by higher commercial loan balances and modest growth in consumer. Commercial loans were $223 billion, an increase of $5 billion, driven by the acquisition of the Signature capital commitment portfolio. Excluding the $8 billion full quarter average impact from the Signature loan portfolio, commercial loans declined $3 billion or 1%, driven by lower utilization and soft loan demand. Consumer loans grew approximately $130 million driven by higher residential mortgage balances, partially offset by lower home equity and credit card balances.', 'And loan yields increased 19 basis points to 5.94% in the fourth quarter. Slide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Average deposits grew $1.4 billion to $424 billion during the quarter as seasonal growth in commercial deposits was partially offset by a decline in consumer deposits. In regard to mix, consolidated non-interest bearing deposits were 25% in the fourth quarter, down slightly from 26% in the third quarter and consistent with our expectations. We continue to expect the non-interest bearing portion of our deposits to stabilize near current levels. Our current rate paid on interest bearing deposits increased to 2.48% during the fourth quarter, up from 2.26% in the prior quarter. As of December 31st, our cumulative deposit beta was 44% and in line with our expectation for the quarter.', 'As we stated previously, we expect betas to drift modestly higher, while interest rates remain at current level. And our current forecast calls for the first rate cut to occur in mid-2024, at which point, we believe the rate paid on deposits will begin to decline. Slide 6 details our investment security and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $137 billion decreased 2% as curtailed purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio pay downs and maturities. The securities portfolio yield increased two basis points to 2.59%, reflecting the runoff of lower yielding securities. As of December 31st, the duration of the investment securities portfolio was 4.1 years. Our received fixed swaps pointing to the commercial loan book totaled $33 billion on December 31st.', 'The weighted-average received fixed rate of our swap portfolio increased three basis points to 2.1% and the duration of the portfolio was 2.3 years. AOCI improved by $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower interest rates. Importantly, as lower rate securities and swaps roll-off, we expect a continued meaningful improvement to tangible book value from AOCI accretion. Turning to the income statement on Slide 7. Fourth quarter net income was $883 million or $1.85 per share, which included pre-tax non-core expenses of $665 million or $525 million after tax related to the FDIC special assessment and the workforce reduction charges incurred in the fourth quarter. Excluding non-core expenses, adjusted EPS was $3.16. Total revenue of $5.4 billion increased $128 million or 2% compared to the third quarter of 2023.', 'Net interest income declined modestly by $15 million. And our net interest margin was 2.66%, a decline of five basis points. Non-interest income increased to $143 million, or 8%. Non-interest expense of $4.1 billion increased $829 million or 26% and included $665 million of non-core expenses. Core non-interest expense was $3.4 billion and increased $164 million or 5%. Provision was $232 million in the fourth quarter and our effective tax rate was 16.3%. Full year 2023 revenue grew 2% compared to 2022. Core non-interest expense was well controlled and grew 1%. Importantly, our disciplined expense management and CIP savings allowed us to deliver modest positive operating leverage and PPNR growth of 2% on an adjusted basis. Turning to Slide 8, we highlight our revenue trends.', 'Fourth quarter revenue was up $128 million, or 2% compared with the third quarter, driven by strong fee income as net interest income of $3.4 billion was down modestly. Fee income was $1.8 billion and increased $99 million or 6% linked quarter. Looking at the detail, capital markets and advisory fees rebounded as expected and increased $141 million, or 84%, driven by higher M&A advisory fees. Asset Management and Brokerage revenue grew $12 million or 3%, reflecting favorable market conditions. And residential and commercial mortgage revenue declined $52 million or 26%, primarily due to a decrease in the valuation of net mortgage servicing rights. Other non-interest income of $138 million increased $44 million or 47% and included favorable valuation adjustments and gains on sales.', 'The fourth quarter also included a $100 million negative Visa fair value adjustment compared to a $51 million negative adjustment in the third quarter. As a reminder, at December 31st, PNC owned 3.5 million Visa Class B shares with an unrecognized gain of approximately $1.5 billion. Turning to Slide 9, our fourth quarter non-interest expense of $4.1 billion was up $829 million and included $665 million of non-core charges. Core non-interest expense of $3.4 billion increased to $164 million, or 5% linked quarter, reflecting higher business activity, seasonality and asset [impairments]. During the quarter, we incurred $42 million of impairment charges, which were largely related to building write-offs. Notably, in 2023, we reduced our non-branch footprint by 2 million square feet, or approximately 17%.', ""For the full year, core non-interest expense of $13.3 billion increased $177 million or 1%. Expense growth was well controlled due in part to the $50 million midyear increase in our CIP goal to $450 million, which we exceeded. As a result, we generated 41 basis points of adjusted positive operating leverage for the full year. Looking forward to 2024, our annual CIP target is $425 million. This program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments. And as of year-end, we completed actions related to the workforce reduction that will drive $325 million of cost savings in 2024. Taken together, we're implementing $750 million of expense management actions, all of which are reflected in our 2024 guidance that I will cover in a few minutes."", 'Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10. While overall credit quality remained strong across our portfolio, we did see a slight uptick in NPLs and delinquencies. Non-performing loans increased $57 million or 3% linked quarter and included a $12 million increase in CRE. Total delinquencies of $1.4 billion increased $97 million, or 8% linked quarter. The increase included seasonally higher consumer delinquencies, the majority of which have already been resolved. Net loan charge offs were $200 and in the fourth quarter and came in at the low end of our expectations. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans ratio was 24 basis points. And our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.5 billion or 1.7% of total loans on December 31st, stable with September 30th.', ""The CRE office portfolio is where we continue to see the most stress and fourth quarter's net loan charge offs were $56 million. We continue to expect future losses on this portfolio. However, we believe we've adequately reserved for those potential losses. As of December 31st, our reserves on the office portfolio were 8.7% of total office loans and inside of that 12.9% on the multi tenant portfolio. Importantly, our overall CRE office portfolio declined 6% or approximately $550 million linked quarter, reflecting a higher level of payoff. Criticized office loans were flat and nonperforming loans increased 2% linked quarter. Naturally, we'll continue to monitor and review our assumptions to ensure they reflect current market conditions.

245,11988a7c-d27f-38ca-aaa5-7bb1964ff532,ISRG,2024-01-19,Too Much Optimism Is Baked Into Intuitive Surgical,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-much-optimism-baked-intuitive-130024398.html,1705669224,STORY,['ISRG'],"['Intuitive Surgical Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) is an absolute monster of a health care stock. The company has returned over 600% over the past 10 years, easily dwarfing the 160% returns of the S&P 500 Index. Over the same period, the Health Care Select Sector ETF (XLV) returned 148%. Most of the growth in Intuitive Surgical was seen as hospitals, large medical institutions and integrated delivery networks such as Kaiser Permanente jumped onto the trend of using its robotic surgery systems at their health care facilities.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ISRG.', 'With the scope for innovation in the health care space and the accompanying optimism in seeing medical institutions gradually adopt robotic surgeries, market participants have attached higher premiums to Intuitive Surgical over time. While I believe the company is well-positioned for the long term, the stock is richly valued at the moment after having benefited from an overly exuberant market.', 'Headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, Intuitive Surgical is a dominant force in the field of robotic surgeries. Most patients at hospitals are, to date, generally operated on via open surgical procedures or laparoscopic surgical procedures, where surgeons are present in person to physically operate on the patient. However, the use of robots and robotic systems to manage surgical procedures has increased in the last 25 years, as per the American College of Surgeons. Intuitive Surgical is a dominant force in the field of robotic surgery and is the maker of the Da Vinci robotic surgery system, with over 7,500 systems already deployed around the world.', 'The company generates revenue by installing its robotic systems products either via full sales models, where revenue is recognized upfront, or sales-type lease arrangements, where revenue is recognized over time via operating leases and usage-based revenue models. The Da Vinci robotic systems are the mainstay of its robotic surgery products, which form the core revenue generators for Intuitive Surgical. The company also sells the Ion endoluminal systems as part of its robotic system product line, but they generate less revenue as compared to the Da Vinci products.', 'According to its most recent 10-Q, product revenue makes up approximately 83% of sales, primarily from a mix of system sales and recurring sales from the Da Vinci product platform. Intuitive Surgical also estimates it earns between $600 $3,500 of revenue per robotic surgical procedure from the sale and usage of system instruments and surgical procedure accessories, depending on the type and complexity of the procedure.', 'At this point, I can conclude the more procedures there are, the more revenue Intuitive Surgical earns from each system placed in hospitals. Moreover, the company would also increase the chance of growing revenue if existing robotic system products placed in hospitals are utilized more often, leading to more opportunities for incremental orders placed for newer robotic systems or for more system instruments.', 'I noted earlier that procedure volume is an important metric that shows the health of the overall robotic procedures. More procedures lead to more hospitals placing and utilizing more robotic systems, as can be seen below, per the third-quarter investor slides.', ""I can observe how strong procedure growth of 18% year-over-year on the left has led to relatively higher robotic systems placed in hospitals operated by IDNs. But the growth in hospitals seen in the number of robotic systems placed in hospitals is much higher at 45%. Such strength in the macroenvironment portends solid interest in purchasing and deploying Intuitive Surgical's robotic systems."", ""The company also understands the costs of its systems are high. Therefore, it enters into operating lease agreements with medical institutions and spread the recurring revenue realized from the sales of those systems over time. In addition to financial obligations, these leases generally also contain commercially competitive clauses that are structured to favor Intuitive Surgical over its competitors. I think these moves create a secular moat that works very well for the company, in addition to the growing surgical volume trend that we observed earlier. This can be seen in the chart below, taken from Intuitive Surgical's investor presentation, which shows how these industry trends and sales agreements have worked well to grow the company's recurring revenue to 79% of its overall revenue as of 2022."", 'I shall note, however, that hospitals and medical institutions will always evaluate the budget requirements for purchasing robotic systems given the high cost of system acquisition, deployment and skill upgrades for surgeons who will operate using these robotic surgery systems. As per its latest 10-K, each of the Da Vinci systems costs between $0.5 million and $2 million. Hence, the purchase and deployment of these systems will hugely depend on the general trend in capital expenses in medical institutions and the overall strength of the macroeconomy. These trends can sometimes be a double-edged sword for Intuitive Surgical, in my opinion.', 'Intuitive Surgical has an impressive balance sheet, to say the least. With a solid cash position of $7.5 billion, which has grown approximately 12% year over year, the company carries no long-term debt. This has resulted in improving the quality of shareholder equity.', 'While the company missed revenue expectations in the third quarter by 1.7%, it exceeded its earnings expectations by a solid 22.7%. Meanwhile, its overall revenue grew 12% to $1.74 billion, of which 66.9% was recognized as gross profits. This was the second consecutive quarter the company was able to arrest the decline in its profit and operating income margins. I will note that Intuitive Surgical does have superior operating income margins as compared to competitors such as Stryker (NYSE:SYK) and Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), mainly due to its dominant market share and innovation pipeline.', ""But as I look forward, I see severe optimism baked into the stock's valuation. One of the primary reasons the company's stock has seen appreciation in its market cap is due to the fact that the company soft-launched its fourth-quarter earnings last week, which shows full-year revenue of $7.12 billion coming in ahead of consensus expectations of $7.08 billion. The release also mentioned that full-year Da Vinci procedures came in much stronger at 22%, which I can assume is the key reason for excitement."", ""Still, I do not see sufficient reasons for investors to be optimistic about continued growth in global procedures heading into 2024. One of the reasons Intuitive Surgical's management themselves mentioned is they still see macroeconomic conditions remaining uncertain in 2024. During the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference 2024 held last week, Chief Financial Officer Jamie Samath noted:"", ""So our procedure guidance is 13% to 16% for 2024. I guess, one thing before I get into the low end and the high end of the range, I really want to emphasize that in '23, we had 22% procedure growth for the year. You saw just elevated level of patients in the healthcare system or essentially backlog throughout 2023. So as you're thinking about 2024, it's really hard to predict what's going to happen with the backlog. So I'm not sure, I don't know what's really going to happen with that if that actually even carries overs into 2024. But at the low end of the range, we're assuming that bariatrics growth, I'd say, continues to decline modestly."", 'Management is currently projecting procedures to grow modestly by 13% to 16% in fiscal 2024 as per their provincial fourth-quarter earnings release.', ""For the purpose of valuing Intuitive Surgical, I have assumed the company grows its revenue in line with its procedure growth, although in reality it will be lower. Moreover, since the company has the characteristics of a late-stage growth company, I have assumed revenue will continue to grow at an average rate of 15%. I have also assumed the company's adjusted Ebitda margin will only improve to 30% from its current margin of 27.5%."", ""Given that this is a growth company with a strong balance sheet, growing margins and dominant market share, I would be willing to pay a forward price-earnings ratio of 30. Applying a discount rate of 8%, I estimate the value of Intuitive Surgical's shares at $255."", ""I had earlier touched upon how macro forces in the economy had helped higher purchase agreements for Intuitive Surgical's robotic systems. However, in cases of downturns in the economy, medical institutions will curtail spending and reallocate budget resources toward critical investments rather than capital expenses toward system upgrades such as those by Intuitive Surgical. In such cases, the company would see fewer sales agreements and, subsequently, fewer systems being placed in medical institutions."", 'As can be seen in the chart above, fewer Intuitive Surgical systems were placed in years where there were downturns and recessions, such as in 2020 and 2022. This also impacted revenue growth, which would then impact premium multiples.', ""Also, so far, Intuitive Surgical has held a dominant market share in the robotic surgery space. However, its competition has moved to launch cheaper systems to make it easier for medical institutions to purchase and place robotic systems. Medtronic, for instance, launched the Hugo Robotic Surgery systems to address the historic cost and utilization barriers of Intuitive Surgical's products. Similarly, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) acquired Verb Surgical in 2019 to compete with Intuitive Surgical. These competitors may pose significant threats moving forward."", ""While I am optimistic about the secular growth prospects of the company, I believe Intuitive Surgical's market value today far exceeds the estimates that my valuation models suggest, indicating superior premiums. But with health care costs rising and pharmaceutical budgets under pressure, I cannot justify the premium attached to this company's stock and find it overvalued."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted fee income ratio. Adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP) and adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP) are used to determine adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP). Net interest income (GAAP) on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the adjusted fee income and adjusted efficiency ratios. Net loan charge-offs (GAAP) are presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted net loan-charge offs (non-GAAP). Adjusted net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans (non-GAAP) are calculated as adjusted net loan charge-offs (non-GAAP) divided by average loans (GAAP) and annualized. Regions believes that the exclusion of these adjustments provides a meaningful basis for period-to-period comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions’ business. It is possible that the activities related to the adjustments may recur; however, management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management.', 'Tangible common stockholders’ equity ratios have become a focus of some investors and management believes they may assist investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions’ capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders’ equity measure. Because tangible common stockholders’ equity is not formally defined by GAAP or prescribed in any amount by federal banking regulations it is currently considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently than Regions’ disclosed calculations. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions’ capital adequacy using tangible common stockholders’ equity, management believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess Regions’ capital adequacy on this same basis.', 'Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders.', 'Management and the Board of Directors utilize non-GAAP measures as follows:', ""Preparation of Regions' operating budgets"", 'Monthly financial performance reporting', 'Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results (management only)', 'Presentation to investors of company performance', 'Metrics for incentive compensation', 'Regions’ Investor Relations contact is Dana Nolan at (205) 264-7040; Regions’ Media contact is Jeremy King at (205) 264-4551.', 'View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240119201719/en/', 'Contacts', 'Media Contact: Jeremy King(205) 264-4551', 'Investor Relations Contact: Dana Nolan(205) 264-7040']"

This gain exceeds both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index by a wide margin. Thanks to this remarkable past performance, investors might have their eyes on the company as a potential portfolio addition right now.', ""If one takes the time to understand Visa, it's extremely easy to find compelling reasons to like this enterprise. But is now a good time to buy this massive card-payments business? Here's why I think that's a smart idea. "", 'In the past couple of years, macroeconomic headwinds, particularly higher interest rates and inflationary pressures, have negatively impacted most businesses out there. And while many companies have reported significantly slowing growth, Visa continues humming along. ', 'In fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), the business reported revenue of $32.7 billion, which was up 11% year over year. This was propelled by payment volume that jumped 5% to a whopping $14.3 trillion. As has been the case in recent times, management reported strength in cross-border activity.', 'Visa also continues to register strong bottom-line gains. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) surged 18% last fiscal year. And in the last 10 years, this metric has climbed at a compound annual rate of 15.9%. This is part of the reason the stock has done so well for investors. ', 'Looking ahead, executives believe the current fiscal year will be a return to normal following geopolitical and pandemic-related disruptions. ""For the full year, we expect low double-digit adjusted net revenue growth,"" said CFO Chris Suh on the fourth-quarter 2023 earnings call.', ""What's attractive from an investment perspective is that it really doesn't matter what happens with the economic backdrop. In both good and bad times, Visa should continue to post solid financial results. And this can reduce risk in one's portfolio."", ""Setting aside some of the shorter term headwinds like the pandemic and rising interest rates, investors will find no shortage of reasons to like this business. As the world's dominant payment network, Visa has easily become a mission-critical service provider for both consumers and businesses. Just think what would happen if the network suddenly stopped working. This demonstrates how important the company really is."", 'And with 4.3 billion cards in circulation worldwide, coupled with over 130 million merchant locations that accept them as a form of payment, the business is protected from the threat of disruption thanks to its powerful network effects. The two-sided ecosystem only becomes more valuable the larger it gets.', 'Warren Buffett once said, ""The best business is a royalty on the growth of others, requiring little capital itself."" Because Visa doesn\'t approve borrowers and extend credit itself, it fits Buffett\'s description. Banks are the ones that partner with Visa to issue cards, thus taking on the default risk of its customers.', ""Investors will be happy to know that Visa is highly inflation-resilient. The company collects a tiny percentage fee every time one of its cards is swiped. So, anytime consumers pay more for things in their daily lives, the revenue potential for Visa rises. There aren't many businesses that are well positioned like this one. "", ""As of this writing, Visa shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 31.9. This is not only cheaper than the stock's historical 10-year average valuation, but it also represents a discount to Mastercard. This seems like a reasonable entry point to me. "", 'What are investors getting when paying this valuation? According to consensus analyst estimates, Visa is projected to increase revenue and EPS at annualized rates of 10.5% and 13.4%, respectively, between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2026. And based on all the positive characteristics of the business that I discussed above, there could be many more years of the same type of double-digit growth. ', 'Therefore, it looks like a good idea to add this stock to your portfolio and hold it for the long term. ', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Visa wasn't one of them.

However, investors shouldn't necessarily mimic Warren Buffett's investing moves."", ""For one thing, Berkshire Hathaway is a holding company and has specific corporate goals that aren't the same as an individual investor's. For that reason and others, it sells stocks when necessary. You might buy a Buffett stock today and find out that Buffett and his team closed out their position when Berkshire Hathaway reports its earnings."", ""But some of these top stocks have been in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio for years or even decades and could add tremendous value to just about any individual investor's holdings. Consider Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), and Visa (NYSE: V) stock. If you have $1,000 to buy stocks after paying off debt and saving for an emergency fund, each of these could add something different and important to a well-rounded portfolio."", 'Buffett only bought Amazon stock in 2019, after the company had become an e-commerce, logistics, and cloud computing powerhouse.\xa0He famously said, ""I was too dumb to realize what was going to happen,"" but that didn\'t stop him from buying it later.', 'This is a great lesson for investors -- to look ahead and not behind. Amazon stock has gained around 70% since Berkshire Hathaway started its position.', 'There are plenty of reasons Amazon could continue to be an amazing stock to hold for decades. After downward pressure last year, sales growth is back in the double digits, up 13% year over year in the 2023 third quarter.', 'The company also made important changes to its distribution system to get more items to shoppers quicker and more cheaply. Between investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and its new and improved delivery network, it should keep up faster, cost-efficient shipping. E-commerce is accelerating again, and Amazon is well-positioned to pad its lead.', 'It also has the top position in cloud computing, with 32% of the market, according to Statista. Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched several new generative AI services last year that now make it the player to beat. The segment usually pulls more than its weight in company income, and as clients start to increase their budgets again, AWS sales should grow faster.', ""Amazon has plenty of other businesses that are just getting started, too. Advertising continues to be its fastest-growing segment, and the company is competitive in streaming. It's doubling down on developing a massive healthcare business, and there are other businesses in the works."", ""The company's stock has gained almost 60% over the past year, and you can expect more in 2024."", ""Coca-Cola is the longest-held stock in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, and Buffett has said that he would never sell it. It's the largest beverage company in the world, has an incredible brand, and pricing power with its loyal fans."", ""It's been reporting continued strength despite a host of challenges over the past few years, with increasing profits and steady margins. Management sees a large market opportunity, with industry growth from $650 billion in 2017 to $1.3 trillion. It expects all of its categories to increase at compound annual growth rates in the mid-single digits and sees plenty of market share for the taking."", ""Coca-Cola is considered a safe stock and often moves in reverse to the market -- at least that's what's been happening over the past few years. It gained 7% in 2022 when the market dropped 19% and dropped 7% in 2023, while the market moved up 24%. It hasn't been a market-beating stock over the past few decades but is reliable for growth and provides protection during challenging times."", ""Specifically, Buffett and other investors love Coca-Cola stock for its dividend. The company is a Dividend King and is getting ready to raise its dividend for the 62nd consecutive year. It's raised and paid the dividend through thick and thin, making it incredibly reliable under any circumstances. The dividend yield is 3.1% at the current price, about double the S&P 500 average, and it's a top dividend stock to add to a diversified portfolio."", ""To round this out, let's look at an amazing forever stock to add to any portfolio. Visa is the largest payment-processing network in the world and runs a growing, relevant, and highly profitable business. In other words, it's a fantastic company with many growth avenues and opportunities and a no-brainer stock to own."", ""In general, Visa's performance mirrors the economy. As the top company of its kind, with $15 trillion of processed-payment volume over the trailing 12 months, it stands to gain from growth in spending. It takes a small fee every time a shopper swipes a card, which also leads to higher income without increased costs."", 'The company is doing just fine now, despite the inflationary environment. Sales increased 11% in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), and earnings per share rose 18% over last year.', 'Visa has been at the forefront of developing new technology in digital payments and is seeing strong results from its alternative payments and other bets. It continues to create and expand partnerships with global financial institutions and merchants and is well-positioned to spring even higher when inflation moderates and interest rates are cut.', 'Visa stock has beaten the market for years, and that should continue for the foreseeable future.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Visa?', ""For Visa, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.71%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination indicates that Visa will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Visa would post earnings of $2.23 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.33, delivering a surprise of +4.48%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

To date, countries worldwide have been reluctant to carry out deep-sea mining activities due to the risks involved, that are thought to be greater than onshore mining. But Norway views the move as key to accessing minerals critical to achieving a global green transition. So, could this encourage other countries to do the same?', 'This month, Norway’s parliament voted to open its waters for commercial-scale deep-sea mining. Those who support the bill believe the extraction of metals and minerals from the ocean’s seabed will be necessary to support the growing demand for these materials under a global green transition. Norway hopes the move will support a shift away from fossil fuels in favour of renewable alternatives. Advocates also suggest that the practice could be less harmful to the environment than land-based mining.', 'Potato-sized nodules of critical minerals, including cobalt, nickel, copper, and manganese can be found at the bottom of the sea floor. These minerals have previously only been accessed from large-scale mining projects on land, which are also destructive to the environment. Many countries are investing in the expansion of land mining activities in response to the growing global demand for these minerals. As countries worldwide shift away from a reliance on fossil fuels and invest in renewable energy projects, clean technologies and electric vehicles, the demand for critical minerals is expected to rise sharply in the coming decades. Gerard Barron, CEO of Vancouver-based The Metals Co.,\xa0explained, ""What are the alternatives if we don\'t go to the ocean for these metals? The only alternative is more land mining and more pushing into sensitive ecosystems, including rainforests.”', 'At present, several forecasts say that there are not enough mining activities at present to meet this demand. This is driving leaders worldwide to investigate alternative ways to meet this growing demand. By 2040, the world will require twice the amount of cobalt, nickel, copper, and manganese as it uses today to meet global energy transition targets, according to the International Energy Agency.', 'Norway’s plan allows companies to apply for mining licenses for critical minerals in the country’s waters, near the Svalbard archipelago, which covers an area of around 280,000 square kilometres. The country would not start drilling immediately, rather it will accept proposals from firms applying for licenses to be assessed for approval.', 'However, critics suggest that deep-sea mining is\xa0extremely destructive\xa0and much of the potential impact on the environment is still unknown. Scientists do not yet know what impact the removal of the large mineral nodules from the seabed could have on the ecosystems under the sea. However, there are strong arguments both for and against deep-sea mining, particularly as it is expected to take a long time until the potential impact of the practice is fully understood. Jessica Battle, the leader of the World Wildlife Fund’s No Deep Seabed Mining Initiative, explained, “Scientists are projecting it will take decades before we know enough about the deep sea to make those informed decisions, to not jeopardize and destroy something before we actually really know what it will do for us.”', 'Both the U.K. and the European Commission have enforced temporary bans on the practice until there is a greater understanding of the impact of deep-sea mining on the environment. Several companies, such as BMW and Google, have also called for bans. A letter from EU lawmakers urging Norway to reconsider the move stated, “The sheer importance of the ocean to our planet and people, and the risk of large-scale and permanent loss of biodiversity, ecosystems, and ecosystem functions, necessitates a pause of all efforts to begin mining of the deep sea.” The Norway Environment Agency and its many citizens have also condemned the plan due to environmental concerns.', 'Meanwhile, the International Seabed Authority (ISA) is working to establish regulations for deep-sea mining, as companies and governments worldwide look for alternative ways to access critical minerals. There are several different approaches to deep-sea mining, which are being assessed for their potential impact on the environment by the Authority. The ISA missed a July 2023 deadline for setting standards for the sector, making it easier for Norway and other powers to move forward on deep-sea mining plans.', 'Norway is not the only country looking to commence deep-sea mining operations for critical minerals, with Japan and the Cook Islands making similar advances on deep-sea mining plans in recent years. It is not surprising that countries are looking to deep-sea mining to meet the growing demand for critical minerals. A U.S. Geological Survey suggests that The Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CZZ) - an environmental management area of the Pacific Ocean, administered by the ISA, which covers around 1.3 percent of the ocean floor – contains more nickel, cobalt, and manganese than all on-land deposits. This has led many to question whether deep-sea mining may be less environmentally damaging than land mining, as producers would only need to mine a small area to see big results. However, scientists and climate activists are wary of entering into new, invasive energy activities without fully understanding the potential impact on the environment, making Norway’s move extremely controversial.', 'By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.com', 'More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:', 'Beijing Navigates Shifting Sands in Middle East Politics', 'Protecting Coasts and Powering Homes: The Tidal Range Revolution', 'Space-Based Solar Farms Could Power the Planet from Orbit', 'Read this article on OilPrice.com']"

VZ is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results before the opening bell on Jan 23. In the quarter, the Business segment is likely to have recorded year-over-year lower revenues owing to a challenging macroeconomic environment.', 'The Business segment includes the wireless and wireline operations of Wholesale, Public Sector and Other, Small and Medium Business, and Global Enterprise.During the fourth quarter, Verizon completed the deployment of the Express Entry facility at the Bank of America Stadium. It incorporates 5G Edge Accelerated Access technology, which has facial authentication features that precisely authenticate visitor identity and accelerate the ticketing process. Its cloud-based infrastructure reduces the expenses related to on-premise servers.The automated check-in facility offers nearly real-time, touchless entry into the venue, reducing congestion and delays at the entrance. Along with improving overall safety and security, these advanced features will ensure better resource management in the stadium.\xa0\xa0 \xa0The company collaborated with Axon Enterprise Inc., a leader in public safety technology, to showcase 5G network slicing capabilities in public safety applications. 5G with network slicing capability utilizes a virtualized network to tailor its performance to diverse use cases, optimizing network performance, driving cost efficiency and improving revenue potential.Verizon also joined forces with Zebra Technologies to launch specialized Zebra mobile devices and software solutions tailored for Verizon Private 5G users. Tablets and computers developed by Zebra are specifically designed for frontline workers across industries like transportation, retail and manufacturing. The devices are equipped with Zebra Mobility DNA software, which facilitates inventory tracking, project management and seamless communication in various work environments.In the quarter, Verizon deployed its 5G Ultra-Wideband network technology to enhance user experience at the L.A. motor racing event. In addition, it leveraged the network slicing capability to optimize network performance in a high data usage environment. This feature, integrated into Verizon’s standalone 5G core, creates multiple slices of a virtualized network. This facilitated the efficient allocation of network resources and enhanced performance by customizing services according to specific application requirements. These are likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.However, adverse foreign currency translations and high operating costs are likely to have led to soft margins in the fourth quarter. In addition, the company’s wireline division is struggling with persistent losses in access lines owing to competitive pressure from the voice-over-Internet protocol service providers and aggressive triple-play (voice, data and video) offerings by cable companies. Consequently, Verizon will record $5.8 billion as a goodwill impairment charge in the Business segment in the fourth quarter. \xa0Our estimate for revenues from the Business segment is pegged at $7,876 million, indicating a decline from $7,900 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for operating income from the segment stands at $617 million, suggesting an improvement from $585 million.', 'For the December quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $34,819 million.

VZ is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results before the opening bell on Jan 23. In the quarter, the Consumer segment is likely to have recorded year-over-year lower revenues despite a healthy momentum in the wireless business, owing to a challenging macroeconomic environment.', 'The Consumer segment includes the retail wireline and wireless businesses.Verizon continued to capitalize on the full availability of 160 MHz of 5G C-band spectrum, which nearly tripled its 5G bandwidth connectivity. This helped the company to expand and enhance its 5G Ultra Wideband network, offering greater capacity to accommodate more customers with robust services and higher data speeds. The ongoing expansion is part of Verizon’s massive multi-year network transformation plan, bringing 5G service to more than 230 million people and 5G Home Internet service to more than 40 million households.Further, the upgraded infrastructure facilities have added more capabilities while paving the way for personalized customer experiences and offering a platform for enterprises and developers to drive innovation. The additional spectrum also enabled Verizon to offer 5G Home broadband and Business Internet services to more customers. These are likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.During the quarter, Verizon also continued with its aggressive fiber densification strategy that helped deploy nearly 57,000 fiber miles since 2020, connecting more than 51% of its cell sites with its own fiber. In addition to improved broadband experience for consumers and enterprises, it serves as the backbone of the wireless network.The company is offering various mix-and-match pricing in wireless and home broadband plans that have historically led to increased adoption of 5G devices and premium unlimited plans. In addition to various bundle plans for varied streaming services, Verizon offers customers greater control and flexibility over their preferred content selections, allowing them to pay only for what they want. With more than 30 partners onboard, it empowers customers to customize their viewing experiences across different categories such as sports, entertainment, education and more.The introduction of new services within myPlan combined with premium network connectivity is fostering brand loyalty among its existing customer base and building the foundation for future commercial expansion. Although this is likely to have translated into healthy customer additions, revenues from the Consumer segment are likely to have taken a toll with higher promotional expenses.Our estimate for revenues from the Consumer segment is pegged at $26,134 million, down from $26,770 recorded in fourth-quarter 2022. Our estimate for operating income from the segment stands at $7,354 million, suggesting a rise from $7,028 million.Adverse foreign currency translations and high operating costs are likely to have led to soft margins in the fourth quarter. Verizon is also expected to have recorded high capital expenditures for the launch and continued build-out of its 5G Ultra-Wideband network, deployment of significant fiber assets across the country and upgrade to Intelligent Edge Network architecture.The company’s wireline division is also struggling with persistent losses in access lines as a result of competitive pressure from voice-over-Internet protocol service providers and aggressive triple-play (voice, data, video) offerings by the cable companies. Due to challenging macroeconomic conditions and high inflationary pressures, several customers are likely to have faltered on their monthly bill payments, further affecting VZ’s quarterly performance.', 'For the December quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $34,819 million.

Most companies don't like to cut dividends, so they generally only increase them when the business can support the hike over the long term. This seems like basic logic, but when you look at dividends with this lens, it changes the information you collect from a board's dividend decisions."", ""Here's a look at what dividend decisions have been saying about Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA), Nucor (NYSE: NUE), Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE: SWK)."", ""Walgreens is one of the largest drugstore operators in the United States. The industry has been in a state of flux lately as it looks for new ways to grow. Walgreens tried its hand at benefits management, but that didn't work out. Then it shifted, along with its rivals, to operating healthcare clinics."", ""The future is still a bit uncertain, noting that there was a recent CEO change during what is a pivotal time for the company. However, dividend investors should have noted the bad omens in mid-2023 when Walgreens didn't increase its dividend at the normal interval."", ""While the dividend wasn't cut at that point, it was not increased, and that was a material change in direction for a company that had a long history of regular increases behind it. Add in the massive business shifts taking place and a new CEO and it shouldn't be any surprise that the dividend was at risk. The cut that was announced in early 2024 was at least partly signaled by the dividend decisions that were made in 2023."", ""Shifting to Nucor and Steel Dynamics, two prominent U.S. steel makers, there are two different trends to consider. Nucor's dividend, for example, has tended to grow slowly for years on end. But then it jumps materially, usually after the company opens a material plant or facility. Essentially, the dividend is signaling a step change in the business, for the better."", ""Smaller peer Steel Dynamics, meanwhile, had been increasing its dividend at a rapid clip year in and year out. That has been a clear indication that this company remains in a growth phase, which isn't exactly shocking given that it is much smaller than industry giant Nucor. At some point, Steel Dynamics' growth will slow, as is normal for a growth company. However, the dividend paths here are clearly indicating the different stages of these two steel competitors."", 'Companies generally have to live through good periods and bad ones, as Walgreens shows. However, a dividend can help you hang on through the rough patches, too, and that has nothing to do with the income you collect. For example, Chevron has increased its dividend annually for over 30 years, and right through multiple energy industry downturns. In 2020, when oil prices plunged due to the economic shutdowns used to slow the spread of the coronavirus, it hiked its dividend. It was a clear sign to investors that Chevron expected to sail through yet another industry downturn without a problem.', ""Stanley Black & Decker's story is a bit more troubling. The company's business did well during the pandemic period, but then it hit a wall as inflation took hold and supply chains got snarled. It has been selling assets to trim debt, rationalizing its business, and cutting costs. Earnings have plunged, but the dividend has continued to rise. The last two dividend increases were nothing but a token penny per share per quarter, but they were made exactly on the normal schedule."", ""The takeaway this Dividend King likely wants investors to leave with is that it is struggling today, but still believes its long-term future remains bright. That's a vastly different story than the one Walgreens was telling shareholders."", ""There's no reason at all to believe that any of the dividend growers noted here would be expected to cut their dividends in the near term. But there's also the chance, even if it is remote, that they do cut them because financial situations change all the time."", ""However, for dividend investors who pay close enough attention, dividend changes (or the lack thereof) can provide valuable clues about how a board of directors is thinking. Walgreens, Nucor, Steel Dynamics, Chevron, and Stanley Black & Decker are all examples of this. At the end of the day, you shouldn't just sit back and collect dividend checks, you should view them as another tool for keeping tabs on your investments."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Chevron right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Chevron wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The chip giant's revenue for the first nine months of the year and its fiscal Q4 guidance indicate that it is set to report $59 billion in revenue for the year. That would be more than double the $27 billion revenue Nvidia reported in the previous fiscal year. This eye-popping growth can be attributed to the AI chip boom and the company's impressive share of this market."", ""Given that Nvidia is expected to control a whopping 85% of the market for AI chips this year, according to investment banking firm Raymond James, it is set to make the most of this market's outstanding growth this year and in the long run. The firm projects Nvidia will generate $65 billion in revenue from sales of AI chips in fiscal 2025. That wouldn't be surprising, as Nvidia is leaving no stone unturned to ensure that it remains the dominant player in the AI chip market."", 'From aggressively ramping up the supply of AI chips to introducing new and more powerful chips this year to making China-specific chips to tap the AI opportunity in that market, there are multiple reasons Nvidia is likely to sustain its solid position in AI chips. More importantly, the company is now looking to boost its reach in other niches of the AI market as well, such as AI personal computers (PCs).', ""Nvidia recently released new consumer-class graphics cards aimed at helping users generate AI videos and images faster, as well as running AI inference applications on the latest large language models. Analysts are anticipating Nvidia's revenue to rise an impressive 54% to $91 billion in the new fiscal year, which will begin next month."", 'NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts', ""This impressive revenue jump explains why the company's forward price-to-sales ratio of 23 is lower than its current sales multiple of 30. Multiplying the forward price-to-sales multiple with Nvidia's estimated revenue for fiscal 2025 points toward a market cap of almost $2.1 trillion. That would be a 55% jump from current levels, indicating that Nvidia's AI-fueled surge is here to stay."", ""While Nvidia should generate a massive amount of revenue from selling AI chips this year, AMD forecasts AI-related revenue of just $2 billion in 2024. That's not surprising given that Nvidia controls the major chunk of this market thanks to its early move into AI chips, which gave it terrific pricing power."", ""On the basis of AI-driven revenue alone, Nvidia looks like the better bet. But at the same time, investors shouldn't forget that AMD has set its sights on the lucrative AI chip opportunity with its MI300X AI accelerator, which it claims can outperform Nvidia's flagship H100 data center GPU."", ""Specifically, AMD claims that its AI accelerators are 1.6 times faster than Nvidia's chips. The chipmaker also says that the MI300X could train bigger AI models than its Nvidia counterpart. However, it remains to be seen if that claim could give AMD's AI business a bigger-than-expected boost."", ""The good part is that AMD's latest AI chips will be deployed by multiple server OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and cloud service providers, including the likes of Microsoft, Oracle, Dell, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, among others. Another factor in AMD's favor this year is that it could benefit from an increase in advanced chip packaging capacity from the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which could allow the company to boost production of AI chips and help fill the supply shortage in the end market."", ""All this indicates why AMD is anticipating its AI revenue to multiply nicely compared to last year's level of $400 million, but it cannot be denied that the company still has a lot of catching up to do."", ""We have already seen that Nvidia's dominance of the AI chip market is likely to translate into 50%-plus revenue growth in fiscal 2025 (which will coincide with the majority of calendar 2024). AMD's revenue, on the other hand, is expected to grow at a much slower pace of 17% in 2024 to $26.4 billion. This slower growth explains why AMD is relatively cheaper than Nvidia with a price-to-sales ratio of 11."", ""Moreover, AMD's forward sales multiple of 9 points toward a market cap of $238 billion after a year, based on its estimated 2024 revenue. That doesn't point toward a big jump from current levels, which probably explains why the 39 analysts covering AMD have a median price target of $145 -- 1% below the current stock price."", 'Of course, AMD stock could be rewarded with a higher multiple if it can grow at a faster pace, assuming its AI business accelerates strongly.

What does that mean?"", 'Basically, in Q4 fiscal 2024, Applied is expecting revenue of $125 million ($500 million in ""annualized revenue"" divided by four). Adjusted EBITDA should now be about $62.5 million (the $250 million annualized figure divided by four). With Applied\'s first-half fiscal 2024 revenue and adjusted EBITDA at a respective $78.5 million and $20.2 million after the latest update, suffice to say the original full-year guidance (again, see chart above) was an overestimate.', 'I\'ve been skeptical of this company since it first landed on investors\' radars as a ""top AI start-up,"" and the downward revision in guidance certainly doesn\'t help.', 'But besides my issues with the way the business itself is structured, some investors may still be looking at the high rate of ""adjusted EBITDA"" as a reason for optimism. I think it best to look past this metric. On all other metrics -- GAAP net income and loss, unadjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, etc. -- Applied is still losing money.', 'First-half fiscal 2024 GAAP net loss was $22 million.', 'First-half fiscal 2024 EBITDA loss was $22.4 million.', 'First-half fiscal 2024 free cash flow was negative $36.8 million.', 'Suffice to say this is still a high-risk start-up, with only a potential high reward.', ""Adding fuzziness to the long-term thesis is the fact that Applied is also borrowing money from one of its key shareholders, B.

Our high-quality investment portfolio generated after-tax net investment income of $2.4 billion for the year, driven by strong and reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio.', '""Our operating results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 8% during the year to $122.90, after returning nearly $2 billion of excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and making important investments in our business.', '""Through excellent marketplace execution across all three segments, we grew net written premiums in the quarter by $1.2 billion, or 13%, to $10 billion. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 14% to more than $5 billion. Renewal premium change in the segment was very strong at 11.8%, while retention remained historically high at 87% and new business increased significantly. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 7% to $989 million, achieved 90% retention of our high-quality management liability business and grew net written premiums by 9% in our industry-leading surety business. Given the attractive returns, we are very pleased with the strong production results in both of our commercial business segments. In Personal Insurance, 13% top-line growth was driven by higher pricing. Renewal premium change was 21.2% in our Homeowners and Other business and was 16.7% in our Auto business.', '""Looking ahead, the fundamentals across our business are in excellent shape. In Business Insurance, we are growing while achieving very strong margins. Our Bond & Specialty business continues to produce excellent returns, and we added to our expert cyber capabilities with the strategic acquisition of Corvus. Our Personal Insurance business is showing significantly improved profitability, and the outlook is for continued improvement. Record cash flows have enabled us to make important strategic investments in our business, return excess capital to shareholders and grow our investment portfolio to nearly $93 billion. Combined with higher fixed income yields, this sets us up for higher levels of net investment income moving forward. With another year of very strong results in the books, continued strategic investment in pursuit of our focused innovation agenda and the best talent in the industry, we could not feel more confident about how we are positioned for 2024 and beyond.""', 'Consolidated Results', '\xa0', '\xa0', 'Three Months Ended December 31,', '\xa0', 'Twelve Months Ended December 31,', '\xa0', '($ in millions and

In the opinion of the Company’s management, it is important to measure the profitability of each segment excluding the results of investing activities, which are managed separately from the insurance business. This measure is used to assess each segment’s business performance and as a tool in making business decisions. Underwriting gain, excluding the impact of catastrophes and net favorable (unfavorable) prior year loss reserve development, is the underwriting gain adjusted to exclude claims and claim adjustment expenses, reinstatement premiums and assessments related to catastrophes and loss reserve development related to time periods prior to the current year. In the opinion of the Company’s management, this measure is meaningful to users of the financial statements to understand the Company’s periodic earnings and the variability of earnings caused by the unpredictable nature (i.e., the timing and amount) of catastrophes and loss reserve development.

Catastrophes can be caused by various natural events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and other naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares. Catastrophes can also be man-made, such as terrorist attacks and other intentionally destructive acts including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological events, cyber events, explosions and destruction of infrastructure. Each catastrophe has unique characteristics and catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount. Their effects are included in net and core income and claims and claim adjustment expense reserves upon occurrence. A catastrophe may result in the payment of reinsurance reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools.', 'The Company’s threshold for disclosing catastrophes is primarily determined at the reportable segment level. If a threshold for one segment or a combination thereof is exceeded and the other segments have losses from the same event, losses from the event are identified as catastrophe losses in the segment results and for the consolidated results of the Company. Additionally, an aggregate threshold is applied for international business across all reportable segments. The threshold for 2023 ranges from $20 million to $30 million of losses before reinsurance and taxes.', 'Net favorable (unfavorable) prior year loss reserve development is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims, which may be related to one or more prior years. In the opinion of the Company’s management, a discussion of loss reserve development is meaningful to users of the financial statements as it allows them to assess the impact between prior and current

Inbound transportation usually happens over a very large volume scale and tends to get absorbed on a per unit basis. When this starts to break down is if, for example, a Walmart has to charter its own container because it couldn’t get enough capacity; or when certain trade lanes see exploding rates per container.”', 'As of Tuesday, 549 carrier vessels accounting for roughly 7.5 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of capacity are actively diverting, will divert, or have already diverted the Suez Canal, according to Flexport.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC)."", 'Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' See our latest analysis for Exelon ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Exelon is:', '8.4% = US$2.1b ÷ US$25b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.08 in profit."", ""Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Exelon has a similar ROE to the average in the Electric Utilities industry classification (8.3%)."", ""So while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Exelon visit our risks dashboard for free."", ""Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same."", ""Exelon clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.70. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it."", 'Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.', ""Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company."", 'Of course Exelon may not be the best stock to buy.

On Slide 3, I want to acknowledge that the keys to our success to what continues to drive performance remains our purpose, mission and operating principles. Our focus on making a difference in people's lives and creating a positive impact in the communities we serve is core to how we operate. It is evident in how we show up for our communities in the moments of need like in Vermont and Lewiston, Maine, where we continue to help those impacted by tragedies.It is why we are committed to supporting small businesses that are the backbone of local economies. And it dictates how our charitable foundation, which celebrated its 30th anniversary last year, continues to uplift our partners. It is all done alongside our daily work of helping our customers achieve their financial goals. Turning to Slide 4. We're excited to see how deeply we've embedded sustainability across the bank and into our products and services. I look forward to sharing more information on the impact of our businesses when we release our 2023 sustainability report in the spring. Now let's turn to Slide 6. As we reflect on 2023, there are several successes to highlight. We continue to realize the benefits from the People's United franchise and are pleased with the growth in New England with M&T finishing as top SBA lender in Connecticut. C&I loans grew by over $5 billion or 11% in 2023, aided by the growth in several specialty businesses brought over by People's United. This C&I growth outpaced the reduction in CRE as we continue to optimize the way we serve these customers in the most capital-efficient manner possible. At the end 2023, CRE loans represented approximately 25% of total loans. Our capital remains strong with a CET1 ratio near 11%. We continue to leverage our strong capital and liquidity levels to grow new customer accounts and relationships. We also reduced asset sensitivity in 2023 while protecting shareholder capital and value. However, our work is not done. We continue to recognize the value created by the merger with People's United, while also bringing more capital efficient, great neutral balance sheet that will produce stable and predictable revenue and earnings over the long term. Now let's review the highlights for the full year. Results for the full year 2023 were strong. We generated positive operating leverage, solid loan growth, improved expense control through the year and growth in EPS and strong returns. Our pretax pre-provision revenue or PPNR, was $4.2 billion, up 22% from 2022, and we generated 3.9% positive operating leverage. Net charge-offs were 33 basis points, in line with our expectations and long-term average. GAAP net income was $2.7 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $15.79, up 37% from the prior year. As a reminder, '22 results included merger charges, gain on sale of our insurance business and a sizable contribution to our charitable foundation. While 2023 included a gain on the sale of the CIT business and the FDIC special assessment. If you exclude these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $15.72 during 2023, up 11% compared to 2022. Our adjusted returns were also very strong with return on assets of 1.33% and return on common equity of 11%. Turning to Slide 7, which shows the results of the fourth quarter were also strong. PPNR declined modestly from the linked quarter to just over $1 billion. C&I and consumer loan growth was strong. Expense control was evident as adjusted expenses declined 2% from the linked quarter and were down each consecutive quarter in 2023. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $2.74 for the fourth quarter. If we exclude the FDIC special assessment, adjusted diluted earnings per common share were $3.62. On an adjusted basis, M&T's fourth quarter results produced an ROA and ROCE of 1.19% and 9.8%, respectively. Next, we will look a little deeper into the underlying trends that generated our fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter, down 3% from linked quarter. This decline was driven by higher interest rates on customer deposit funding and changing deposit mix, partially offset by higher interest rates and earning assets. Net interest margin was 3.61%, down 18 basis points from the linked quarter. The primary drivers of the decrease to the margin were an unfavorable deposit mix shift contributing a negative 7 basis points, the impact of higher rates on customer deposit funding, net of the benefit from higher rates on earning assets contributing a negative 5 basis points and a negative 6 basis points for carrying additional liquidity on the balance sheet. Turning to Slide 9 to look at the average balance sheet trends. Average investment securities were $27.5 billion, decreasing modestly during the fourth quarter. Average interest-bearing deposits at the Fed increased $3.5 billion to $30.2 billion. Due to our decision to have more liquidity on the balance sheet. This was mainly funded with strong deposit growth. Average loans increased slightly to $132.8 billion and average deposits grew $2 billion to $164.7 billion. Turning to Slide 10 to talk about average loans. Average loans and leases increased slightly. Growth in C&I and consumer loans outpaced declines in CRE and residential mortgage loans. Growth in C&I loans were driven largely by dealer, fund banking and corporate and institutional businesses. Loan yields increased 14 basis points to 6.33% with higher yields across all loan categories. Of note, the consumer loan yield increased 26 basis points as we continue to benefit from higher yields on new originations compared to yields on runoff balances.Turning to Slide 11. Our liquidity remains strong. At the end of the fourth quarter, investment securities and cash, including cash out at the Fed totaled $56.7 billion, representing 27% of total assets. The duration of the investment securities portfolio at the end of 2023 was about 3.7 years and the unrealized pretax loss and available-for-sale portfolio was only $251 million. Turning to Slide 12. We continue to focus on growing customer deposits, and we're pleased with our growth in average deposits. Average deposits totaled grew $2 billion, approximately 3/4 of that quarterly growth was from customer deposits. Average demand deposits declined $3.8 billion, reflecting a continued shift toward higher-yielding products such as sweeps, money market savings and time profits. The mix of average noninterest-bearing deposits was 30% of total deposits compared to 33% sequentially. Excluding broker deposits, the noninterest-bearing deposit mix in the fourth quarter was 33%. Encouragingly, we saw the pace of deposit cost increases slow through the quarter. Continue on Slide 13. Noninterest income was $578 million, up 3% sequentially. The increase was largely driven by a strong quarter for commercial mortgage banking revenues, growth and trust income and a small unrealized gain on certain equity securities. Other income also benefited from higher loan syndication fees. The decrease in rates towards the end of the quarter drove the increase in commercial mortgage banking revenues. Turning to Slide 14. We continue to focus on controlling expenses. Noninterest expenses were $1.45 billion. Excluding the $197 million FDIC special assessment, noninterest expense were $1.25 billion, down 2% from linked quarter, and the adjusted efficiency ratio was 53.6%, largely unchanged from the third quarter. The decrease was driven by reductions in other expenses as a result of losses associated with certain retail banking activities in the linked quarter and lower merchant discount and credit card fees. The decrease in other expenses was partially offset by higher professional and other services. Salary and benefits decreased modestly from the third quarter as a result of lower average head count and seasonally lower benefit costs, partially offset by higher severance expenses. Next, let's turn to Slide 15 for credit. Full year net charge-offs totaled 33 basis points, in line with our long-term historical average and expectations were set out earlier in 2023. Net charge-offs for the quarter totaled $148 million or 44 basis points. up 15 basis points over the linked quarter. This quarter's increase was largely driven by 3 office-related charge-offs located in New York City, Boston and Washington, D.C. and 2 C&I charge-offs related to an online retailer and to an RV dealer. Nonaccrual loans have trended down each consecutive quarter since the first quarter of 2023. That trend continued in the fourth quarter with nonaccrual loans declining $176 million from linked quarter to $2.2 billion. The nonaccrual ratio declined 15 basis points from the third quarter to 1.62%. The decline was primarily driven by the transfer of certain loans to accrual, commercial payoffs and charge-offs on loans previously deemed nonaccrual. Since the end of 2022, we have increased the allowance over $200 million, and the allowance to loan ratio was 13 basis points, ending 2023 at 1.59%. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a provision of $225 million compared to net charge-offs of $148 million. This resulted in an allowance build of $77 million this quarter and increased the allowance to loan ratio by 4 basis points. The current quarter build was primarily reflective of the commercial real estate values and higher interest rates contributing to modest deterioration in the performance of loans to commercial borrowers as well as loan growth in the C&I and consumer portfolios. Turning to Slide 16. When we file our Form 10-K in a few weeks, we estimate that the level of criticized loans will be $12.6 billion compared to $11.1 billion at the end of September. We completed thorough reviews, covering more than 60% of all CRE loans, including maturities in the next 12 months, construction loans, watch loans and all criticized loans. The increase in criticized CRE loans was tied to these reviews and to 2024 maturities were the prospect of continued higher rates could negatively impact performance of the portfolios or create shortfalls in debt service coverage or require interest reserves for construction loans. The growth in criticized C&I loans was not tied to any specific review but rather completion of an annual review cycle and our ongoing quarterly update upon receipt of interim financials. Generally, our reviews do not incorporate any benefit of the forward curve at potentially lower interest rates. The 10 largest downgrades accounted for half of the total C&I downgrades and represented a range of industries. Common themes include pressures from higher interest rates and labor costs. During the fourth quarter, criticized non-owner-occupied C&I loans increased $663 million, accounting for 44% of the total increase in criticized loans. Criticized permanent CRE loans increased $441 million, representing 29% of the increase and criticized construction loans increased $375 million. Turn to Slide 17 and 18 for more details on the criticized loan portfolio. About 18% of the increase in criticized loans was driven by health care, 13% by multifamily and 9% are retail CRE loans. Loan to values remain strong for these loan types ranging from low 50% range for retail, mid-50% range for multifamily and high 50% range for health care. To date, modifications at maturity have had sponsors generally support their loans through replenishment of reserves, loan paydowns and enhanced recourse. That is why our credit size has not led to growth in nonaccruals. Our conservative underwriting and strong client selection has been supportive of these assets. Reflective of the financial strength of the portfolio diversification of our CRE borrowers, 96% of criticized accrual loan balances and 53% of nonaccruals loans are paying as agreed. Turning to Slide 19 for capital. M&T's CET1 ratio at the end of 2023 was an estimated 10.98% compared to 10.95% at the end of the third quarter. The increase was due in part to continued pause in repurchase in shares, combined with continued strong capital generation. At the end of December, the negative AOCI impact on CET1 ratio for available-for-sale securities and pension-related components would be approximately 20 basis points. Now turning to Slide 20 for outlook. First, let's talk about the economic outlook. We see so-called soft-landing scenario as having the highest probability but the possibility remains for mild recession brought down by lagged impact of rate hikes from last year. We are encouraged to be continued strong performance by the consumer as continued [drag] gains as well as wage growth above inflation helped drive consumer spending. Consumer spending has slowed enough to alleviate inflation pressure for many goods and services. We expect that to continue in 2024. Inflation figures remain above the Fed target of 2%, chiefly because of rents and home prices. While the prices of many consumer goods have fallen and inflation for consumer services has slowed. We expect weakness seen in rent listings to play through to the official inflation data in 2022, helping to bring the headline inflation figures down. Our outlook incorporates the forward curve that has multiple 25 basis point Fed cuts in 2024.With that backdrop, let's review our net interest income outlook. We expect taxable net interest income to be in the $6.7 billion to $6.8 billion range and net interest margin in the 350. This outlook reflects the impact of higher deposit funding costs and the impact of different interest rate scenarios. As we have discussed, we continue to carry a high level of liquidity. Our current level of HQLA is about $46 billion, which is 2/3 in the cash and 1/3 in investment securities. In 2024, we started to shift some cash into securities. This, combined with other potential hedging actions can help protect the downside risk for NII from lower rates but may reduce NII in 2024. We expect full year average loan and lease balances to be in the $135 billion to $136 billion range. We expect growth in C&I and consumer but anticipate declines in CRE and residential mortgages. Average deposits are expected to be in the $163 billion to $165 billion range. We are focused on growing customer deposits at a reasonable cost. The level of broker deposits is expected to decline through the year. Turning to fees. We expect noninterest income to be in the $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion range. We expect solid fee income across many business lines. Lower rates will help drive stronger residential and commercial mortgage banking revenue. Trust income is expected to grow from current levels from higher valuations and increasing clients. Turning to expenses. We anticipate noninterest expenses, including intangible amortization to be in the $5.25 billion to $5.3 billion range. This outlook includes our typical first quarter seasonal salary and benefit increase, which is estimated to be $110 million. We also included the outlook to be approximately $53 million for intangible amortization. Our business lines are focused on holding their expenses flat while allowing us to continue to invest in the franchise and our key priorities. These priorities include growing the New England and Long Island markets, optimizing resources in both expense savings and revenue generation, transferring our systems and processes, making them more resilient and scalable, and continuing to build out our risk management. Turning to credit. We expect net charge-offs for the full year to be near 40 basis points due to the ongoing credit cost normalization in the loan portfolio and resolution of some stress credits. We expect that the taxable equivalent rate to be 24.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Finally, as it relates to capital, our capital, coupled with limited investment security marks has been a clear differentiator for M&T. The strength of our balance sheet is extraordinary. We take our responsibility to manage our shareholders' capital very seriously and will return more when it is appropriate to do that. Our businesses are performing very well, and we are growing new relationships each and every day. While every economic uncertainty is improving, our share repurchase remains on hold. Our decision to resume share repurchases will consider the results of the 2024 internals and supervisory stress test, including the stress test capital buffer. Additional clarity on Basel III end game regulations and continued stabilization and economic conditions as it relates to the probability of a mild recession. That said, we continue to use our capital for organic growth and growing new customer relationships. Buybacks have always been part of our core capital distribution strategy and well again in the future. In the meantime, our strong balance sheet will continue to differentiate us with our clients, communities, regulators, investors and rating agencies. On Slide 21, there is a summary of 3 enhancements we made to our financial reporting. First, we reclassified the substantial majority of owner-occupied loans and related interest income from CRE to C&I loans. This better aligns with the classification with the underlying management and repayment source of the loans. Second, in the upcoming 10-K we are changing our operating segments to reflect how management organizes its businesses to make operating decisions, allocate capital resources and assess performance.Third, as certain categories have started to attribute more or less to our expense base, we opted to include printing, postage and supplies and other costs and operations, and break out professional and other services as a distinct line item in the income statement. To conclude, on Slide 22, our results underscore an optimistic investment thesis. While the economic uncertainty remains high, that is when M&T has historically outperformed peers. M&T has always been a purpose-driven organization with a successful business model that benefits all stakeholders, including shareholders. We have a long track record of credit outperformance through all economic cycles while growing in the markets we serve. We remain focused on shareholder returns and consistent dividend growth. Finally, we are disciplined, inquirer and prudent steward of shareholder capital. Our integration of People's United is complete, and we are confident in the ability to realize our potential post-merger. Now let's open up the call to questions before which Michael will briefly review the instructions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.', 'Gerard Sean Cassidy', 'Hi Daryl, how are you?', 'Daryl N. Bible', ""I'm good Gerard, how are you?"", 'Gerard Sean Cassidy', ""Good. Can you give us a flavor for when you guys look at the capital structure of M&T as you're putting out, it's quite strong, and we get beyond Basel III end game and you see what your new stress capital buffer will potentially be. What do you see a comfortable level of CET1 on a longer-term basis once those 2 unknowns are known and you can factor that into your thinking?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""I would say it depends, obviously, on the environment that you're in and whether we're doing a transaction or not doing a transaction. But you typically would want to operate with a buffer of maybe 50 to 100 basis points over what's required from the regulations and what we have there would probably be a way to probably peg it."", 'Gerard Sean Cassidy', ""Okay. Very good. And then based on the experience of M&T, obviously, over a long period of time, you've guys put out in your investor deck that your credit losses generally are below peers. With the increases in your criticized loans that you've shown today, the C&I and CRE. Do you still feel comfortable that you guys can maintain that kind of long-term track record of being better than the peers on the credit losses?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes. Yes. I think it's a long history here at M&T. I mean if you look at it, we have been a disciplined selection on client selection, sponsorship and underwriting, and our loss history is really low and kind of shows that. The future remains uncertain. But if you look at it, it's not a predictor of the past, and we're going to lean in on our client selection and underwriting approach has really not changed. LTVs are strong, and we have a really good approach to our underwriting. Our largest sponsors that we have right now are supporting their credits, they're putting money into credit refinancing. And many of the charge-offs that we realized in '23 came from, what I would say, not long-term clients. They're more financial or institutional type money. But over the long term, we think that our client selection will win the day."", 'Gerard Sean Cassidy', 'Just quickly to follow up on that. Is it safe to assume that the criticized loans more a reflection of market conditions rather than a change in underwriting stand as 2 or 3 years ago that have led to these types of increases?', 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes. If you look at where the increases came from multifamily, it's really more interest rate driven, is really what's driving that. It might have a little bit higher operating cost. But for the most part, their NOI business models are performing very well. So eventually, over time, I think that will cure ourselves and do relatively well. If you look at construction, construction overall is actually outperforming what's going on out there. There is stress in some of the takeouts right now. But as rates come down, I think agency takeouts will actually help in that sector. On the healthcare side, right now, it's really more of a reimbursement problem. While costs are going up, it takes a while for them to get better reimbursement costs. So I think that will help over time. There's a lot of demand in that sector. And I think as costs level off, plus there's an active takeout market through agencies like HUD from that perspective. Office, if you look at office, the one advantage we have in office is that we have a really good distribution of maturities. Over 2/3 of our maturities start in '26 and beyond. So I think that's a positive. And the other property types we have like retail and hotel are generally stable to improving."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley.', 'Manan Gosalia', ""Can you talk about the puts and takes on the NII guide? I know you're asset sensitive with the buildup in liquidity and the skew to commercial. So if we get more or fewer rate cuts and what's in the forward curve, what happens with NII? And then I think you mentioned your -- you started the year, putting some more -- or deploy some more of your cash into securities. Can you talk about what duration you're taking on there and what that would mean for the asset sensitivity?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes. So the guide that we gave at $6.7 billion to $6.8 billion. I would say with our 3 -- 25 basis point cut would be at the higher end of that range, so a closer to $6.8 billion, I think, from that perspective. If rates go maybe 5 cuts or 6 cuts maybe or [forwards] maybe a lower end of that range. We've decided that over the next couple of quarters, we're going to try to move as close as you can to a neutral position. We started to put some money into securities, and we will continue to do some hedges and interest rate swaps. We're going to average in over time, we're going to do it all at once and just kind of dollar average in to get it more neutral so that we can produce stable and predictable earnings over time and not have impact on interest rates. So I think we feel pretty good about what we're seeing there. And from a deposit beta perspective, I would tell you that deposit betas maybe or close to peaking from that perspective. Maybe our net interest margin is close to bottoming out maybe in the next quarter or two. So I feel actually pretty good that we'll be able to start to grow NII maybe towards the second half of the year and definitely into 2025."", 'Manan Gosalia', ""Got it. And maybe just a couple of short questions on credit. I mean I think you mentioned that the reviews on commercial real estate do not bake in the forward curve. So does that mean that if the forward curve plays through that criticized assets should come down? Or as you scrubbed through the remaining 40% of the book that, that could put some upward pressure there. And then I'm sorry if I missed it, but did you give what your updated office reserves were? Because I know you built some reserves during this quarter."", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes. Yes, let me take your first question first. So, we really don't take into account the forward curve when we go through the review that we're doing. A lot of the properties, like I said earlier, like multifamily is more rate driven than anything else. Their business models are intact. So you have good NOI. I would say, as rates fall, if rates go maybe 100 basis points or more, that could be and probably will be a positive impact for our credit costs. Now it may not flow in as rates actually materialize and have to come through when we're doing our next review but with that pressure, I think, would alleviate and probably have an impact on the levels that you're seeing from that perspective. From an office perspective, that -- part of that sector is a little bit different because it also has some structural challenges. So if you look at that, that's going to probably play out more over time. It's going to be when leases and vacancy rates kind of mature off, we're just blessed to have a longer time from a maturity perspective, which is great planning from the credit team. The top risk that we have there are embedded in the ratings and reserves that we have. Valuations that we have, I think, takes into account the risk. I think we're around 4.4% right now. So I think we feel good at that. And if you look at the real challenge will be when leases mature and you have resizing risk, what's going to happen at that point. But we have a lot of time for that to play out. I would tell you, if you just look at the signature transaction, there's a lot of money out on the sidelines that will definitely come in and play and be there. Right now, there's a difference between bid-ask spreads but there is money that will come into the market at some point."", 'Manan Gosalia', 'Great. Did you say the office reserve was 4.4%?', 'Daryl N. Bible', 'Yes.', 'Manan Gosalia', 'Okay. So did the reserve build come somewhere else in the portfolio because I know you built reserves this quarter?', 'Daryl N. Bible', ""We did. And I would say reserve builds were mainly driven by the increase in criticized. If you look at our page that we have in the slide deck, the actual -- office criticized numbers actually fell. Our increases in criticized were in health care and multifamily and in hotel. And those are really ones driving the increase. That was probably 2/3 of the increase. The other 1/3 was due to the loan growth that we had, which was C&I and consumer loans. So you can kind of see that the build wasn't that large for the increases that we had. We just really don't feel we have a lot of loss component because of the loan-to-value ratios that we have and the collateral that we have on those transactions."", 'Operator', 'And we have our next question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.', 'John G. Pancari', 'Just on the -- just back to the reserve. I know you cited that it did account for current real estate valuations and changes there. What -- and I know you gave us the LTVs, you cited a few of them. Are they refreshed LTVs? And if not, what type of valuation declines are you seeing in your -- as you work through the office portfolio specifically?', 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes. So when we have done these reviews, I would say we have about 60% of the CRE portfolio. That's been a very thorough review. Obviously, we're picking the larger one to ones that are in larger cities that might have more risk from a valuation decline. We're being probably on average about a 20% decrease in valuations. Our valuations are probably current within the last year or so. So we feel really good with that. We continue to have reviews every quarter and continue to be very thorough on how we're looking at that. But I think the reserves we have today, I feel pretty good about."", 'John G. Pancari', 'Okay. And one more just on that, if I could, the criticized scrub that you did. Is that -- was that just that? Was that more of a scrub of the portfolio. It sounds like the way you described it, it was. And if so, could -- do you expect less of an increase in criticized assets and related reserve build from this level?', 'Daryl N. Bible', ""John, I would love to tell you that this is the peak of our criticized. We have to finish up what we did. The majority of our construction loans, we have a little bit more construction loans to do this next quarter. And we're always subject to getting more information in as we get new financials and new vacancy information and all that. But I feel pretty good that we did a very thorough review of what we have out there. We really looked at all the spots that we thought. We'd have the most risk and really took that into account. But I can't here tell you today that we're at the top but at some point, hopefully, we will be able to say that."", 'Operator', 'And we have our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.', 'Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala', ""So I guess just on this criticized, nonaccruals on credit in general, given the work you've done, I'm sorry if I missed this, like should we expect -- so far, the growth in criticized has not reflected in or been sort of translated into nonaccruals. Should we expect that to change as you see some of your customers feel more pressure given just the lagged impact of the rate cycle? Or could we still see nonaccruals trend lower? And then what drives criticized lower from where we are today? Is it just time and maturity of these loans? Or could we see a pretty decent decline over the coming quarters?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""I think the increase that we have today was basically a review of looking at everything that we have out there. And I would tell you that interest rates probably was the biggest one. Labor cost was probably the next biggest increase. There was a little bit of increase in C&I as well. And then C&I, there was nothing idiosyncratic there. There was a mixture of, if you look at it, the largest 13 credits, 7 different industries. So it's pretty diverse from that perspective. So we feel pretty good overall with where we stand. Only 6% of our criticized has gone into nonaccrual, that's kind of what our historical numbers have been. And when I talked -- when Gerard asked the question, we really feel good about our client selection. We're seeing our sponsors and clients really stand up and really support these credits. And we think that what we haven't classified is the right direction. That doesn't mean a few may not flip into nonaccrual. But I think for the most part, we don't really see a large period of losses. If we did, we would have had to put more in the reserves, and that's what we're seeing and we're projecting."", 'Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala', 'Got it. And I guess maybe one question on capital. One another regional bank earlier this week talked about the need for scale for regional banks coming out of what happened last March. You all have been acquisitive from time to time very -- in a very deliberate way. Just talk to us in terms of, one, appetite to do bank deals as they come through over the next 12 to 18 months? And secondly, like, do you see the landscape becoming rich with deal opportunities as we move forward?', 'Daryl N. Bible', ""M&T has always done acquisitions and have grown over the years. Our business model is really to stick to the regions that we're in and to really meet the needs of those communities. And we like to grow share in those markets. So whether you need scale or not, I've been on both sides of that right now. And I would tell you that it's not something you have to have, it's something if it makes sense. I mean when you acquire somebody, you got to make sure it's a good cultural fit, first and foremost, that is critical. You have to really make sure that if you get synergies that those come through, both on the expense and revenue side.So we closed on People's. We're starting to get -- got all the cost synergies. We're in the midst of investing now more into New England and Long Island. So we're going to continue to grow that. It usually takes, I would say, 3 to 5 years to really get the total performance from these acquisitions. So we still have a lot of work to do from that. I'm sure down the road, M&T is a favorite acquirer, somebody might want to sell to us at some point. But right now, we got a lot of work in front of us. And we're focused on really making that. It's 1 of our top 4 priorities right now, and we're going to do that and deliver that."", 'Operator', 'And we have our next question from Frank Schiraldi with Piper Sandler.', 'Frank Joseph Schiraldi', ""Daryl, you mentioned the considerations for getting back to the buyback. Is it reasonable to think that maybe the last trigger or the last consideration is the stress test is the CCAR? And so just wondering, is the second half of '24, do you think the more likely scenario for restarting repurchases?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Frank, I would love to be buying shares back, especially at the level that we're trading at right now. I think it's a really good value. Right now, we just want to make sure that we go through the stress tests, we find out where our limits are. We got to make sure there's a lot of uncertainty out there, and we just don't want to go into a recession and if we do that, probably would hold back for those purposes. But we're in the midst of really making a really strong bank. We're really changing it to be less relying on balance sheet, commercial real estate and really more driven through off-balance sheet products and services, and we're growing our other businesses, both on the balance sheet and in fees, and we're really excited about that. I promise you we will do share repurchases. I can't tell you when that's going to happen but it is core to our strategy, and we will definitely do that when we think it's appropriate."", 'Frank Joseph Schiraldi', 'Okay. And then just a quick one, if I could, on the deposits, noninterest-bearing balances. Just your thoughts on -- you talked I think about deposit costs beginning to -- or beta is beginning to stabilize. Any thoughts on levels of noninterest-bearing from here? Are you starting to see stabilization in balances around this 30% of total deposit number? And then as part of that, can you just talk about how trust balances played into the linked quarter change in noninterest-bearing, if at all?', 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes. Now, these are good questions. So we did see through the quarter -- in the fourth quarter that our DDA balances were starting to stabilize. That's one of the biggest components of what's impacting net interest income is that migration from DDA into sweeps. Hopefully, that will kind of play out in the next quarter or 2 as that kind of stabilizes. I think when you look at the retail side of the chain, we still grow our CD book, that will probably continue though rates really start to fall. You didn't really see growth in CDs till we got over 3%. So we'll probably have to go down a little bit before that growth following slows down a bit. But it's important that we price that correctly. In our disclosures, we combine our retail CDs with our broker CDs and I did say in the prepared remarks that we probably plan to shrink our broker CDs over time. So that category will probably fall throughout the year but it's probably driven more by nonclients. From a trust perspective, it had a modest impact on it. I would say it wasn't that big of an impact from that. It was really just drop in more in the commercial space for the most part."", 'Operator', 'And we have our next question from Erika Najarian with UBS.', 'Erika Najarian', ""Daryl, just a few follow-up questions, please. On the (inaudible) of questioning, I'm wondering, what is your current assumption for downside beta for the first 100 basis points of cuts? And is there anything about this cycle where we can't look at historical precedents in terms of volume reaction or cumulative beta reaction to the Fed easing?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes. So if you look at our betas on a cumulative basis going up. We're now in the low 50% range but that includes the broker piece of that. So if you take that away, we're probably in the mid-40s. And on the downside, I'd probably say early on, we'll start probably in the 40s on the way down as well. And as it goes down, though, you won't be able to sustain that because while we increased a lot of our rates higher in the commercial area and our wealth area and some of our institutional areas. So those will come down as they went up.The retail side really did not come down, it didn't go up as much, so it won't come down as much. So if you were down 100 or 200 basis points, you're actually going to have a declining beta impact is probably what you're going to see play out depending on how much the Fed actually lowers rates. But I think early on, you're going to see something similar to that on the way down in the 40s would be my best guess."", 'Erika Najarian', ""Got it. And a follow-up question on credit. How should we think about the progression of your ACL ratio from here? I know you mentioned in the prepared remarks, you'd already built up your reserve pretty significantly. As we think about normalization and whatever maturity walls you have in the CRE, should we expect that your ACL ratios to continue to build from here? I mean this is sort of our first go at CECL with charge-offs actually going up."", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""All right. I know, it is. We feel really good where our reserve is right now. I can't promise you it's not going to go up. But we've been done a very thorough review of all of our, what we think are, higher risk type credits in the CRE space in the commercial space as well. So no promises that it can't go up anymore, but we feel really good where we are today and where we're reserved."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.', 'Bill Carcache', ""Daryl, can you take us inside some of the discussions that you're having with your commercial clients? And how confident are you that the ingredients are in place for a reacceleration in loan growth, if indeed, the soft-landing scenario plays out?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""I -- if you look at what our clients have been saying, for the most part, they've been more on the sidelines and really been leery of investing in their businesses. I think it's actually -- I get kind of excited. If the Fed just lowers rates just a little bit, I think the markets will get excited and you're going to have some things take off, and there'll be a lot more investment, which will help the lending side. I actually will get more excited on the fee side as well. We saw a fair amount of activity just in December with the move that we had in the yield curve in treasuries, where there was a lot of pent-up demand and we were able to do some placements in our commercial mortgage area, and you saw that flow through with some fee income. So I get kind of excited that if the Fed just -- lowers rates just a little bit, I think we're going to have more momentum come through than what you're actually seeing maybe in the guide that we have."", 'Bill Carcache', ""That's really helpful. And then following up on Erika's question on the reserve rate trajectory within CRE. Some has indicated that in this environment, they'd be more likely to maintain reserve rates in office CRE as charge-offs occur. Is it reasonable to expect that there would be a lag between when we see peak losses in CRE and when you actually start to release reserves?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""We go through the analysis. I mean it's a model, right? And it's based on our variables. So if you look at the variables we had this past quarter, the variables for like GDP and unemployment were basically unchanged. And they actually got a little bit better on (inaudible) and on HPI. So that actually helped in the reserve calculation. So we're using the macro variables coupled with what -- how we think that the credits are rated from a credit perspective and it all comes together. From a timing perspective, I think it's hard to say exactly when reserves will get adjusted. Right now, we feel good with what we have given what our risk is that we know right now on the credit side. But over time, probably, there will be some reserves but it releases by you just don't know when that's going to happen. So it's more model-driven."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Brian Foran with Autonomous.', 'Brian D. Foran', ""So one question going back to this beta on the way down that I sometimes get from investors and I never have a very good answer. And you guys historically been pretty good about thinking about normalized margins and drivers. So hopefully, you can do better than me. We all talk about deposit costs as the problem. But if I think about deposit margins over time, and I know there's different ways to measure them but relative to Fed funds, the spread between deposits and Fed funds is basically at an all-time high for you in the industry. It's a little less extreme relative to 2- and 5-year treasuries but it's still elevated or even just more simplistically, like your deposit costs today are still a little bit lower than they were. I know said in the last time the Fed was here. So I know a lot has changed over time but just have you thought about that? Does it make sense that deposit margins or liability margins more broadly or kind of higher than they have been historically and where on your worry list is the idea that because they're pretty high to start with, maybe as the Fed cuts, betas aren't 40% or 50% there, 20% or 30%?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes. I would say -- I think it was Erika's question for when I was saying as rates fall, the beta will start to come down just because the consumer side did not go up as much. So I think we'll start off at a higher pace. But as that comes down, that will be less from that. If you look at it, I actually like the level of interest rates where we are today. I mean we're in the low 5s is where the Fed is. If we stay, let's say, in the 4% range or maybe even as low as 3%. As long as we price our assets and deposits appropriately, to getting back to basic business and we get good spreads on that. There is no reason we can have very healthy net interest margins for a very long period of time. It's all about pricing your assets and deposits frankly making sure you're putting prepayment language in on your fixed loans and making sure you're pricing deposits appropriately. But it's a great environment for banking and margins. I feel really good from that. Would we trend higher than where we are today, probably over time but it really comes down to discipline. You really work on the asset mix change at that time in times like that, when rates tend to be in that time period, economy seems to be growing pretty well. So you probably have good loan growth out there and pretty decent deposit growth. So I actually get excited once rates come down a little bit, and we can really operate the bank. Historically, I think we'll have good -- really good returns."", 'Brian D. Foran', ""And maybe as a follow-up, your predecessor has the theme of kicking off this whole deposit and margin [worry] cycle at the Barclays conference a couple of years ago. I think at that time, the original message was the NIM was 4% or 4.1% and through the cycle, you thought 3.6% to 3.9% was a normalized range. Is that still the thinking like we'll be at 3.5% or so in '24, but normalized at some point in the future is 3.6% to 3.9%."", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""I think that's pretty much spot on, Brian, is that I would say. Darren did a great job in this role and he also called exactly what our charge-offs were going to be in the beginning of the year, and they came in pretty much spot on. So he did a great job in this role. But when I look at it and see what's happening, if I call it right, maybe we bottom in the next quarter or 2 and then it just margin then we can start growing from there. So I'm pretty much in that camp as well."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.', 'Steven A. Alexopoulos', ""Daryl, maybe to start -- to actually start where you just ended. So that normalized NIM range, 3.6% to 3.9%. If we think about your commentary right, you want to move the balance sheet to a more neutral position. Is there any reason in whatever a normal curve looks like, we haven't seen it in a while, that you couldn't move to the upper end of that range. I think most would be disappointed if you were 3.6%, like why wouldn't you move to the very upper end of that range?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Steve, I don't know."", 'Steven A. Alexopoulos', ""I'm not going to hear about it. I am just talking about 2025, 2026. Because is there a reason that you're not going to be 3.75% margin bank?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""I feel really good at the way we are positioned. What makes us so strong is we are really good at how we price our assets. But what really makes it is that we are great at growing operating accounts. And that funding source is really starting to come back on and growing nicely. So we always have and probably will have a top quartile net interest margin. So I feel really good about that. We may operate a little bit lower just because we're going to carry a little bit more liquidity. Right now, we're carrying about $4 billion more liquidity just because we increased our internal stress liquidity scenarios based upon some of the learnings that we had from earlier in the year from that perspective. So that cost us 6 basis points this quarter. It doesn't really impact NII a whole lot but it impacts your margin just because you were (inaudible) on assets and liabilities that don't make anything. But I feel really good in this rate environment, managing a balance sheet and doing the right thing for our customers and for our communities is really what banking is all about, and I think we'll be able to execute and perform really well in that environment."", 'Steven A. Alexopoulos', ""Got it. Okay. And just as a follow-up. So I know you've had 10 questions already on commercial real estate. But if we look at this deep dive you did covering 60% of all commercial real estate loans, one, what are you learning? I don't know if you're talking to building owners as you work through that process. But as these come due, you have $1 billion or so in criticized. What's the expected work out? Will they put more equity in? What are you expecting? And then when you called out the 4.4% office reserve, is that a general reserve on the office portfolio? Are those specific credits coming due where you're anticipating losses?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes. I mean the 4.4% is really a general amount. There could be a little bit of specific embedded in that. But it's -- the bulk of it is more of a general reserve from what we're seeing from that perspective. We are seeing our clients, our sponsors really step up and really support these credits. We think that with charge-offs that we had this past year were really more financial and institutional oriented. But our sponsors because they're long-term real estate owners of the property.I mean, they basically own properties where they want to own them in a certain block and city of where they have it. So it's really long-term oriented. They tend to have really low tax basis in these properties, and they're going to support these credits over time. So that's really what we're seeing there. When we go through and look at whether we should grade it as criticized or not, you're seeing some pressure on the debt service coverage ratio. Once it falls under [1.1], it goes into the [11] , which is criticized camp. But the vast majority of what we have in criticized is between 1 and 1.1. Yes, we had 1s under 1 in that level, but the vast majority we have there. So over time, I think those will cure and won't result in loss for the most part. We did raise losses up a little bit for '24. Some of that was really normalization on the consumer portfolio. And then some of it is maybe working out a few more credits off. But for the most part, what we have in criticized is not materializing into losses."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.', 'Kenneth Michael Usdin', ""Daryl, first question on the securities book. Trunk a little bit but also the yield was flattish, let's call it. I'm just wondering how you could tell us through how you're thinking about both the size of the securities book going forward? And also, what are you picking up on maturities as they're going back in if we're starting to see this kind of flattish type of yield situation?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes. So we had a couple of things going on there. So if you look at what we have right now, we're probably going to take anywhere from $3 billion to $5 billion this year and move from cash into the securities book over time. We're going to really focus on non-convex type securities. We don't have extension. So if we buy something at a duration of 3 years, it stays in a 3 years perspective. Yields that we're seeing right now are probably in the mid floors, plus or minus. So I think that's going on pretty well. The other good benefit that we have is we have about $9 billion of U.S. treasuries. Those U.S. treasuries average a yield close to 2%. So those are going to reprice and we're going to put those back out and probably 2-, 3-, 4-year type duration or maturity treasuries and we're going to reprice up over 200 basis points there. So I think that's a real positive. So we're seeing a nice uplift in the securities portfolio.The other thing to note, and I'll just switch over to the loan book, Ken, if you don't mind, is that on the consumer book, our auto didn't really grow but the volume we put on in our auto lending was like 250 basis points higher than what it was rolling off at. If you look at the RV portfolio, and that did grow some this past quarter, that was also up a couple of hundred basis points with a higher yield. So we're -- from a reactivity perspective, our fixed portfolios are starting to really show and perform and to have much higher yields."", 'Kenneth Michael Usdin', ""Yes, that's great. Actually, it was going to be my follow-up on the loan side. Do you have a broader way of helping us think through either the proportion of that book that's fixed and reprices over the next year or two?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""It's -- I would say, it's mainly in the consumer book is the book that's probably going to reprice higher. From C&I and CRE perspective, most of that is more floating because we're more like 60% floating, 40% fixed. So if you look at it like that, mortgage portfolio, for the volume we put on in mortgage will be I think probably at attractive yields. There's not a lot of activity. We're going to originate and sell all conforming. So we generate fee income and not put it on the balance sheet but we will support our clients and wealth. We will support our customers that we have for moderate- and low-income housing. So there will be some volumes that go on in those portfolios. So that will reprice higher. That would just be a little bit slower because the volumes won't be as high."", 'Kenneth Michael Usdin', ""And sorry, one more final one. Just you mentioned earlier the ongoing thought process of getting more of the production off balance sheet and kind of switching NII into fees. I'm just wondering where you are in that process and build out and infrastructure? And within that, do you have an idea of where you think that the right commercial real estate on balance sheet concentration of the loan book should be versus the current 25%?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes. So I would say our plans right now are to bring our CRE portfolio down probably another $3 billion. If you look in the last couple of years, we've been shrinking CRE, about $3 billion a year. That gives us time to basically work with our clients and meet their needs with more off-balance sheet alternatives. So we're doing it on a measured pace so we can do it and still meet the needs of our good long-term clients from that perspective. As far as what percentage we're going to head for, I know it's going to be lower than 25%. I can't tell you. You got a couple of things going on, CRE shrinking and the other portfolio increasing. So my guess is, you'll probably see it drop a little bit faster than you might expect. If we're successful or growing C&I and some of our consumer book."", 'Operator', 'And we have our next question from Chris Spahr with Wells Fargo Securities.', 'Christopher James Spahr', ""Daryl, this is about expenses and the efficiency ratio. I mean, this is going back a while ago that you, at one point, M&T had a 50% to 55% efficiency target. I know you haven't been updated in some time. I'm just wondering what do you think -- given that the efficiency will creep higher in '24 based on the guide, what do you think the efficiency will settle in? What's your normalized NIM?"", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes. So when you look at efficiency ratio, it's all about growing revenues faster than expenses. That's really what I kind of look at from that perspective. We really have a challenging time in '24 growing revenue so much just because we got net interest margin coming down some. My hope is that it levels off '24 and starts to grow later in '24. So we can start in '25 and start to have positive operating leverage from that perspective. I'd tell you I'm very pleased with working with the leadership team that we have here at M&T. We all agreed to come in and all business lines came in with flat expenses and basically finding cost cuts to cover their merit increases, and they kind of did that in their own businesses. So I think that was really well done from that perspective. We're guiding up a couple of percent just because we're making some investments and some really key projects like digital, like data. We have 2 transformations going on right now, one in finance, the other in commercial. We're investing in our treasury management businesses. So we've got a lot of investments. But given our leadership team, I feel good that we'll be able to contain what growth we need there and that we won't have -- the goal would be to have revenue real faster than expenses is really what we try to shoot for, and that will kind of drive good positive operating leverage."", 'Christopher James Spahr', ""So as a follow-up, so do you think you can manage like a few percent growth in expenses in '25 and '26 kind of just based on kind of your budgeting experience. Notwithstanding like kind of activity or volume-driven expenses."", 'Daryl N. Bible', ""Yes. I mean when I look at the levers that we have on the expense side, there's a lot of opportunities. If you look at it, our procurement and sourcing ores are continuing to improve and get better in that area. I think we still have opportunities in our corporate real estate area to get more square feet down over time. We're really working with workforce management and really how to do our operations the most efficiently possible. I think our call centers have a lot of opportunity from an automation perspective. One of our themes that we have in 2024 is simplification, really trying to simplify what we are doing today. So on the transformations that are going on, how we do this, we'll have less processes and much more simple way, getting things done in a much more efficient way of getting them done from that perspective. For me, it always comes down to how we prioritize. We're going to prioritize in the priorities that we have in this company, and I talked about those projects. If we can focus on those and really not have any other -- of the other investments kind of play out, we can control expenses really well and to continue to generate positive operating leverage as we get revenues to start to grow again."", 'Christopher James Spahr', 'Sorry. And one last ticky-tack question. Bayview, what is the -- do you have any estimate on what that would be for this year?', 'Daryl N.

(NYSE: PRU). The global financial services company has signed on as the men’s and women’s basketball program’s presenting sponsor and will also provide access to financial education and funded investment accounts for domestic Rutgers student-athletes in a variety of sports.', '""Thanks to the power of compound interest, investing money in your 20s can provide millions by retirement age, particularly for young athletes who may be on track to play as professionals,"" said Richard Parkinson, chief brand officer, Prudential Financial. ""By planning now, these young athletes can face their financial future with the same confidence they bring to the court or the field, no matter what happens in college and beyond.""', 'As part of the deal, Prudential financial advisors Lisa Lovell and John Benton will be on hand for consultations with Rutgers student-athletes throughout the season. Prudential Financial advisors also will facilitate financial education seminars for student-athletes and their families. The family session will be remotely accessible for those who are unable to travel to campus. Lastly, Prudential will provide investment accounts for select U.S. men and women student-athletes (international student-athletes are not eligible due to visa restrictions).', '""We are thrilled to enter into this transformative partnership with Prudential,"" said Rutgers Athletic Director Pat Hobbs. ""This is a one-of-a-kind opportunity to not only impact the lives of our student-athletes, but their families and hopefully generations to come. I look forward to collaborating with Prudential to help our Scarlet Knights build strengths in the principles of financial literacy.""', 'Access to financial education is more important than ever, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, with children growing up in an increasingly complex world where they will likely be required to take charge of their own financial future at a younger age than their parents or grandparents. Student-athletes, in particular, face some of the highest risk of money problems, says the Council for Economic Education. Yet in 2022, only 23 states required a personal finance course for high school graduation, and very few colleges required it for student-athletes.', '""College athletes can be valued at more than $1 million, but they (and their families) frequently live below the poverty line,"" said Delvin Joyce, Prudential Certified Financial Planner and Certified Financial Advisor and a former professional athlete. ""That’s why it’s more important than ever for them to invest their income early. By setting aside a small portion of their earnings each year, they can ensure better financial security when their sports careers come to an end.""', 'Becoming a collegiate athlete (and having the opportunity to turn pro) is what Prudential refers to as a ‘Now What?’ moment. When you seize ‘Now What?’ moments — the moments you realize your life has changed for the better — you can take your financial future to the next level. ‘Now What?’ moments are the ideal time to start investing, particularly for those college athletes who want to play professionally.', '""Only 2% of collegiate athletes make it to the pros,"" said Lovell. ""Those who do make it are typically well compensated but are not taught how to manage their wealth. Black athletes are particularly susceptible to financial troubles — a startling 15.7% of NFL players (the majority of whom are Black) have filed for bankruptcy within 12 years of retiring.""', 'Prudential is committed to curbing this trend. The company has a long-standing commitment to create opportunities for those who have been historically excluded from the financial system — including student and professional athletes — and helping them create a blueprint for building personal and generational wealth.', 'This is the third in a series of athletic sponsorship deals for Prudential that highlight the importance of planning for retirement at an early age. Last year, Prudential featured New Jersey Devils players Jack and Luke Hughes (22 and 19, respectively) in a social media brand campaign highlighting the importance of financial planning early in a professional sports career. Prudential also partnered with 19-year-old Ethan Quinn as he made his professional tennis debut. Quinn utilized Prudential Stages for Retirement and Prudential’s team of advisors to invest a portion of his earnings and let his money work for him as he builds his tennis career.', '""It’s more important than ever for young people to invest their income early — particularly those who are considering a pro sports career,"" said Benton. ""Traditional defined benefit plans, which provide retirees income for life, are disappearing fast — 70% of people had one in 1975 versus only 12% of people today — and Social Security benefits are projected to face a 20% cut across the board by 2033.""', '""If you don’t see it, you won’t spend it — and you can still have a great lifestyle with just a fraction of what you earn in a season,"" Joyce added.', 'Ethan Quinn is a customer and paid promoter of Prudential.

Investors are instead getting a bit nervous that the Fed and other influential central banks won’t race to dramatically cut rates while inflation lingers solidly above target levels.', 'On the other hand, the selling heading into the heart of fourth quarter earnings season makes sense to help cool things off following the blistering run off the October lows. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were always likely to test their longer-term 50-day and 200-day moving averages in the early months of 2024.', 'The Q4 earnings outlook has improved since the big banks kicked things off late last week.', 'Investors who can handle the near-term uncertainty that earnings season brings might want to consider buying these three large-cap stocks ahead of their upcoming earnings releases and holding them for the long haul since timing the market precisely is extremely difficult.', 'Microsoft', 'Microsoft reports its Q2 FY24 earnings results on January 30. Cloud computing reshaped MSFT and turned it back into a consistent sales and EPS growth juggernaut. Now AI appears to be the next expansion-focused frontier, with Microsoft introducing artificial intelligence features across various parts of its business such as Office.', 'On top of AI, MSFT closed its roughly $70 billion deal to buy Activision Blizzard in October as a massive bet on gaming and the future of VR and the metaverse. Microsoft is also sitting on $144 billion in cash and equivalents that will help it continue to pursue expansion through strategic acquisitions.', 'Microsoft is projected to grow its revenue by roughly 14% in both FY24 and FY25 to jump from $212 billion last year to $275 billion next year. The firm is projected to grow its adjusted earnings by 14% during both periods as well. MSFT has consistently beaten our bottom line estimates, and its EPS outlook has remained intact over the last several months to help it land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment.', 'MSFT stock has more than doubled Tech over the past 20 years. MSFT shares have surged 65% during the last 12 months vs. the Zacks Tech sector’s 46%. Despite sitting near new all-time highs, Microsoft trades below its average Zacks price target.', 'The stock might be a little overheated right now, and it could pull back to its 21-day or 50-day moving averages in the near-term. But Microsoft is trading solidly above its 21-month moving average, as it has for most of the last decade.', 'Valuation-wise, MSFT trades at a 10% discount to its 10-year highs at 32.5X forward 12-month earnings. Microsoft appears far cheaper when factoring in its longer-term earnings growth outlook since its PEG ratio of 2.1 offers 5% value vs. its 10-year median and a 32% discount to its highs—MSFT is also trading nearly in line with the Zacks Tech sector.', 'MSFT boosted its FY24 dividend by 10% and it is committed to repurchasing more shares. All in, investors who are bullish on big tech and the possibilities of AI might want to add Microsoft ahead of earnings and hold it forever.', 'Procter & Gamble', 'Procter & Gamble, one of the powerhouses of the consumer packaged goods world, is set to report its second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings results on January 23. Procter & Gamble is one of the largest makers of household and personal essentials, with brands ranging from Febreze and Swiffer to Head & Shoulders and Pampers and tons more. PG breaks down its business into five categories: Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric & Home Care, and Baby, Feminine & Family Care.', 'Procter & Gamble’s standing as a consumer staples standout helps it succeed during most economic environments, good or bad. The company is projected to post roughly 4% sales expansion both this year and next to help boost its adjusted earnings by 9% and 8%, respectively, based on current Zacks estimates. PG has regularly topped EPS estimates in the last five years and its upward revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now.', 'PG stock has climbed 65% in the last five years vs. the Zacks Consumer Staples sector’s 9%. Procter & Gamble has lagged the market during the past three years, up 11% vs. the S&P 500’s 26% run.', 'PG shares are trading roughly 8% below their highs and 12% under their average Zacks price target. Procter & Gamble is trading above its very long-term 21-month moving average and around neutral RSI levels on a 20-year timeframe.', 'The stock might be able to break out of its prolonged holding pattern in 2024 as investors look for gains outside of big tech. Procter & Gamble is trading at a 16% discount to its decade-long highs and near its median at 22.4X forward earnings.', 'PG’s dividend yields 2.5% to outpace its industry’s 2.4% average. P&G is also one of fewer than 70 S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, which are firms that have both paid and raised dividends for at least 25 years running.', 'United Rentals', 'United Rentals, an equipment rental star, said it will release its Q4 FY23 results on January 24. URI’s growing portfolio of large equipment includes scissor lifts, towable light towers, generators, excavators, and nearly everything else under the sun its clients might need. Customers across construction, utilities, energy, home builders, and beyond count on United Rentals for various offerings across different timeframes.', 'United Rentals has lifted prices alongside inflation and it is benefiting from its Ahern Rentals acquisition in late 2022. The firm’s revenue was booming before the pandemic, with sales up between 15% to 21% for three straight years until they slipped in 2020. URI quickly left its Covid setbacks behind and posted 14% sales growth in FY21 and 20% in 2022.', 'United Rentals carried over its momentum in 2023, topping our Q2 and Q3 earnings estimates. The company reaffirmed its 2023 guidance last quarter, and URI’s management team remains confident in its longer-term outlook. The firm expects it will benefit from the ongoing investment super cycle in the U.S. across infrastructure, industrial manufacturing, and energy and power.', 'The company’s earnings outlook has slipped slightly compared to where it was this time last year. But its 2025 estimates have improved recently. Plus, URI’s sales are projected to jump by 22% in 2023 and another 4% in 2024 against a difficult-to-compete-against period. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to surge by 26% and 6%, respectively.', 'URI has surged 590% in the past 10 years to crush the S&P 500’s 170% and the Zacks Construction sector’s 155%. United Rentals is up 42% in the last 12 months, including some large swings.', 'URI’s recent slip below its 21-day moving average might mean it will be forced to test its 50-day soon. Thankfully, it is already at neutral RSI levels vs. overbought in December. Some investors might want to wait for it to slide to the longer-dated trendlines such as the 21-month depicted in the nearby chart.', 'Yet, the stock appears to be worth simply buying and holding through any near-term downturns since it trades at a 21% discount to its sector despite its huge long-term outperformance and 25% below its highs at 12.9X 12-month forward earnings.

Gravy Analytics pointed to a consumer preference for fast casual restaurants, which offer better ambiance and more varied menus, among the reasons for the traffic shift. Fast food chains also increased prices at a faster pace than full-service chains during this past year, and some, including McDonald’s, started to see a slip in low-income traffic in early 2023.', 'BTIG pointed to several national advertising campaigns — including Pizza Hut’s $7 Deal Lovers menu, Burger King’s $2.99 wraps and Popeyes’ $5.99 wings offering — as evidence of a push to promote more discounted offerings. In January, Taco Bell updated its Cravings Value menu with six new items.', 'The QSR segment isn’t the only restaurant increasing menu promotions. Nearly half of restaurant operators plan to provide more special offers this year, and 20% are adding more affordable menu options, per a Popmenu survey of 461 restaurant operators.', 'The success of these campaigns aren’t guaranteed, however, and chains have yet to see industrywide changes in low-income diner traffic. They also come at a price.', '“The heavily-advertised promotions should help larger chains regain share from independents, albeit at a steep cost that should keep restaurant margins muted as they continue to recover from their 2022 lows,” BTIG said in a report emailed to Restaurant Dive.', 'Value offerings can help bring back some low-income customers that have been pulling back on restaurant spend, but not all chains are seeing similar results. Burger King saw traffic growth from diners with household incomes of less than $100,000 following offers of Royal Crispy Wraps and the Whopper Junior Duo, Restaurant Brands International Executive Chairman Patrick Doyle said during a November earnings call. Doyle added that these value offerings aren’t “recession proof, but they are recession resistant.”', 'The impact of traffic growth was seen among franchisees, as well. Carrols Restaurant Group, Burger King’s largest franchisee, reported negative traffic for six quarters beginning in Q1 2022, turning its traffic positive during the second half of 2023. Restaurant Brands International bought Carrols for $1 billion earlier this week.', 'McDonald’s saw its cohort of customers with annual incomes of $45,000 and under visit the restaurant less during Q3 2023. CEO Chris Kempsczinski said during an October earnings call that the chain will continue to monitor this group of customers, adding that value goes beyond just price.', ""“We are focused on maintaining our value leadership,” Kempsczinksi said. “[Value] incorporates delivering a better customer experience, which we're doing through faster service times, improved hospitality. … And we're seeing great execution, which means consumers are getting hotter, faster, better-tasting food.”"", 'In 2022, Church’s Chicken added a two-piece chicken and biscuit bundle for $2.99. This menu addition was originally a limited-time offer, but was extended into 2023 because it drove a significant number of transactions. The value-focused menu item contributed to one of the best traffic years Church’s has ever had in 2023, CEO Joe Guith said.', '“You just can’t beat that price point out there for the most part,” he said.', 'Church’s guests have average household incomes of about $40,000 and the chain has found success with value offerings. When the chain offered menu innovations at higher price points in the past, guests were deterred by the cost, Guith said.', 'While many chains have said value offerings can help get customers in the door, analysts suggest that low price points may not be enough to boost slumping margins. In a January report, TD Cowen said the value frenzy of 2018 didn’t result in significant improvements to QSR industry performance.', '2018 was the year McDonald’s launched its $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu that later sparked value offerings at Burger King, Jack in the Box and Wendy’s. Burger King offered various value items, like 2 for $6 sandwiches and a 2 Cheeseburger Meal for $3.49, while Wendy’s began offering things like a $1 Double Stack that same year. Jack in the Box offered bundled offerings with prices from $1 to $5, per TD Cowen.', ""“McDonald's value efforts failed to deliver intended results, with McDonald's U.S. traffic declining 2.2% in 2018,” TD Cowen said. “Anecdotally … franchisees were displeased with the intensified low-margin value strategy. This does not acquiesce with the industry's post-COVID-19 focus on improving franchisee cash flows to accelerate development and remodels.”"", 'TD Cowen said it’s more likely that chains, like McDonald’s, Taco Bell and Burger King, will lean into smartphone apps, digital offers and loyalty programs as a way to provide value versus national campaigns.', '“We note the vast majority of quick service restaurants aspire to increase traffic on smartphone apps via digital offers and loyalty incentives,” TD Cowen said. “This is key to enhancing data collection to help improve customer lifetime value via increased ticket and frequency.”', 'Personalized offers are becoming more effective means of marketing and 64% of restaurant owners said they are sending personalized offers to customers — up from 55% in 2023, according to TouchBistro’s “The State of Restaurants in 2024” report.', 'Many operators will continue to use loyalty programs as a way to create repeat customers. Sixty-seven percent of restaurants said they offer a rewards program, which are particularly popular among multi-unit restaurants, per TouchBistro’s report. Seventy-seven percent of operators with five to 20 locations said they offer a loyalty program.', 'Negative traffic may not be totally solved by more value promotions, however. Restaurant analyst Lynne Collier of Water Tower Research said the negative traffic trend, while impacted by low-income consumers pulling back, has more to do with increased restaurant supply.', '“Coming out of COVID, we lost a lot of restaurants, so you had this reduction in supply,” Collier said. “Now it’s the opposite. The growth rate accelerated and soon you’re going to have too many restaurants again. … I think that’s going to be a headwind for the industry for the foreseeable future because it’s all about supply. If there’s just too many restaurants, traffic will remain negative.”', 'That won’t necessarily stop chains like Church’s, which is known for its value, from adding more affordable options. The company also plans to roll out a rewards program early this year that will help the chain deliver even more value, Guith said.', '“Going forward, what does [value] look like? It’s being really judicious on moving price on the core,” Guith said. “We’ve done a whole set of work around pricing and menu architecture and we’re going to be engineering all of that over the course of next year.”', 'This story was originally published on Restaurant Dive.

Last year was no exception, as the warehouse owner delivered strong earnings and dividend growth."", 'The industrial REIT expects 2024 to be another strong year. Because of that, it remains a top option for investors seeking an elite dividend stock with high total return potential.', ""Prologis has a knack for delivering above-average growth. It had grown its core funds from operations (FFO) per share at a 12% compound annual rate over the five-year period ending in 2022. That was faster than the S&P 500's average (11%) and the REIT sector's average (7%). The company also delivered above-average dividend growth during that period (12% compound annual growth, compared to 6% for the S&P 500 and other REITs). "", 'Last year was no different. It was its fourth straight year of delivering double-digit earnings growth (its core FFO per share rose nearly 11%). Meanwhile, the REIT increased its dividend by another 10%. Since its initial public offering (IPO), the company has grown its dividend at a 15% compound annual rate, the 13th fastest pace in the S&P 100 (the top 100 publicly traded stocks in the country). ', ""The company's above-average earnings and dividend growth rates have helped power strong total returns.

"", 'Prologis expects 2024 to be another strong year. The company anticipates growing its core FFO per share by more than 9% at the midpoint of its guidance range. It expects its existing portfolio to drive most of that growth, estimating it will deliver 8% to 9% same-store net operating income growth in the year ahead.', 'The company will benefit from modest contractual rental rate increases on existing long-term leases, along with much higher rates as legacy leases expire and it signs new leases at much higher current market rates. It also expects to benefit from stabilizing $3.6 billion to $4 billion of development projects. ', ""There's additional upside potential from acquisitions. The company has penciled in completing $500 million to $1 billion of acquisitions, largely offset by $800 million to $1.2 billion of asset sales. However, it has a long history of making accretive acquisitions. It bought a $3.1 billion warehouse portfolio from Blackstone last year and acquired rival REIT Duke Realty in a $23 billion deal in 2022. "", ""Meanwhile, Prologis has lots of visibility into its earnings growth beyond this year due to its long-term leases. Most lease rates remain well below current market rents, which should continue rising at a healthy clip. That drives the company's view that its core FFO will grow at a 9% to 11% annual rate through at least 2026, with the potential of an additional contribution from mergers and acquisitions (which added 1.5% to its FFO per share each year in the 2021-2023 time frame)."", ' That strong FFO growth rate should support continued dividend growth. Given its conservative dividend payout ratio, Prologis could continue increasing its payment at a double-digit annual rate over the next few years.

Since becoming CEO in the mid-1960s, the Oracle of Omaha, as he's best known, has overseen a greater than 4,450,000% aggregate return in his company's Class A Shares (BRK.A), as of the closing bell on January 12."", ""Warren Buffett has a knack for picking long-term winners, and investors of all walks usually wait on the edge of their respective seats to see what he and his investment team have been buying and selling. The funny thing is, Buffett's most commonly purchased stock isn't the one you might initially think it is."", ""The good news for curious investors is that Berkshire Hathaway is required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission no later than 45 days following the end of each quarter. A 13F provides an under-the-hood look at what Wall Street's brightest minds purchased and sold in the previous quarter and is a required filing for persons and entities with at least $100 million in assets under management."", ""As of the closing bell on Jan. 12, Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio had $361 billion of invested assets spread across roughly 50 stocks. Some of these stocks have been added to with frequency in recent years."", 'Energy stock Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) is the perfect example of a now-core holding that\'s had the undivided attention of the Oracle of Omaha and his ""investing lieutenants,"" Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, over the past two years.', ""When 2022 began, Berkshire Hathaway held $10 billion in Occidental preferred stock yielding 8% annually. However, it held no common shares. As of this past week, Buffett's company owned a little over 243.7 million shares of Occidental Petroleum common stock, representing a greater than $14.1 billion stake."", ""The reason Buffett and his investing aides have purchased shares of Occidental with frequency over the past two years likely has to do with the expectation that the spot price for crude oil will remain elevated or head even higher. Multiple years of capital underinvestment by global energy majors during the pandemic, coupled with uncertainty tied to Russia's ongoing war with Ukraine, has led to a tight global supply of crude oil. Generally speaking, when the supply of a key commodity is constrained, it's not unusual for the spot price of that commodity to increase."", 'Occidental Petroleum is unique among integrated oil and gas operators in that it generates a disproportionate percentage of its revenue from its upstream (i.e., drilling) operations. If the price of crude oil rises, Occidental will enjoy an outsized benefit. Of course, the opposite of this scenario (a decline in the spot price of crude oil) is true, as well.', ""Warren Buffett has also not been shy about increasing his company's position in tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Since Berkshire's initial stake in Apple was opened during the first quarter of 2016, it's grown to almost 915.6 million shares and accounts for 47.1% ($170.2 billion) of invested assets."", 'Considering that Buffett referred to Apple as ""a better business than any we own"" during Berkshire\'s 2023 annual shareholder meeting, it shouldn\'t surprise anyone that he and his team have been building this position for years. Apple brings brand power and innovative consistency to the table that few other businesses can match.', 'For instance, Apple has been absolutely dominant in the U.S. smartphone market for well over a decade. Since introducing a 5G-capable iPhone in the fourth quarter of 2020, the company has consistently accounted for a little over half of U.S. smartphone market share.', 'Apple is also evolving into a platforms company. Placing added emphasis on subscription services is a way to boost long-term margins, minimize sales fluctuations during major iPhone upgrade cycles, and keep customers loyal to its ecosystem of products and services.', ""There's also nothing quite like Apple's capital-return program. Apple is returning $15 billion in dividends to its shareholders each year\xa0and has repurchased more than $600 billion of its common stock since kicking off its buyback program in 2013."", ""Berkshire Hathaway's 13F is an invaluable tool that helps investors get a read on what stocks, industries, and trends are piquing the interest of Warren Buffett and his lieutenants. However, it doesn't tell the full story -- at least with regard to Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy."", ""Though there are a couple of core holdings in Berkshire's portfolio that have been purchased with frequency in recent years, there's another stock you'll find listed toward the end of Berkshire's quarterly reports that's been purchased by Warren Buffett on an almost monthly basis, dating back to July 2018. The reason you're not going to find this stock listed on the company's 13F is because Buffett's favorite stock to buy is his own company, Berkshire Hathaway."", ""As of the midpoint of 2018, Berkshire Hathaway's share repurchase program required the company's stock to trade at or below 120% of book value (i.e., no more than 20% above book value) for buybacks to take place. For many years leading up to July 2018, Berkshire's stock never fell to this line-in-the-sand threshold -- which meant not a cent was spent on repurchases."", ""Everything changed on July 17, 2018. The company's board passed new measures that allowed Warren Buffett and his late right-hand man Charlie Munger more freedom to pull the trigger on buybacks when they saw fit. As long as Berkshire Hathaway had at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and Treasuries on its balance sheet, and Buffett and Munger agreed that their own company's stock was intrinsically cheap, repurchases could be conducted without any cap."", ""Since Berkshire Hathaway's board made this change -- Berkshire hasn't reported its fourth-quarter results yet, which is why I'm stating this figure through Sept. 30, 2023 -- Buffett and Munger OK'd share buybacks in all 21 quarters. In fact, there have only been a handful of months over the past five-plus years where share repurchases didn't take place. In aggregate, Buffett and the late, great Charlie Munger oversaw the repurchase of more than $72 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock since mid-2018."", ""Share buybacks are the direct way Warren Buffett and his team reward long-term shareholders. Since Berkshire doesn't pay a dividend, regularly buying back stock can steadily increase the ownership stakes of longtime shareholders."", ""Furthermore, companies with steady or growing net income, like Berkshire Hathaway (sans the recognition of unrealized investment gains and losses), should see their earnings per share climb as the number of outstanding shares decline.

You might buy a Buffett stock today and find out that Buffett and his team closed out their position when Berkshire Hathaway reports its earnings."", ""But some of these top stocks have been in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio for years or even decades and could add tremendous value to just about any individual investor's holdings. Consider Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), and Visa (NYSE: V) stock. If you have $1,000 to buy stocks after paying off debt and saving for an emergency fund, each of these could add something different and important to a well-rounded portfolio."", 'Buffett only bought Amazon stock in 2019, after the company had become an e-commerce, logistics, and cloud computing powerhouse.\xa0He famously said, ""I was too dumb to realize what was going to happen,"" but that didn\'t stop him from buying it later.', 'This is a great lesson for investors -- to look ahead and not behind.

The company entered the rapid rehydration beverage category in June with BodyArmor Flash I.V., the brand’s first major product offering in two years.', 'In both rapid hydration and now zero sugar, BodyArmor is entering a category where Gatorade and other players dominate.

The data showed Zero Sugar has more potassium and magnesium. It also has zinc and vitamins B and C that G Zero doesn’t. One area where Gatorade narrowly trumps Zero Sugar is with fewer calories; four calories compared to 10.', '”We’re going up against Goliath, and we’re really focused on becoming No. 1,” Niland said. “We’ll continue to innovate across [Powerade and BodyArmor], to drive growth for the category and for our brands.”', 'She said BodyArmor is working on “a ton of other opportunities,” including new categories and extensions of existing products that could hit the market in the coming year. “That pace [of innovation] will not slow down,” Niland noted.', 'This story was originally published on Food Dive.

(NYSE:MHK), might not be a large cap stock, but it received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. The recent rally in share prices has nudged the company in the right direction, though it still falls short of its yearly peak. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Mohawk Industries’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.', ' View our latest analysis for Mohawk Industries ', ""Great news for investors – Mohawk Industries is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $138.59, but it is currently trading at US$99.76 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Mohawk Industries’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity."", 'Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Mohawk Industries, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting top-line growth of 6.1% in the next few years, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.', 'Are you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since MHK is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MHK for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy MHK. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.', ""So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Weyerhaeuser?', ""For Weyerhaeuser, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -6.67%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Weyerhaeuser will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Weyerhaeuser would post earnings of $0.33 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.33, delivering no surprise.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""Weyerhaeuser doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

Rachelle, you know, I'm thinking back to those conversations that we had at the height of the pandemic, so many Americans putting off those elective, non-emergency procedures. Now we're still seeing that trickle through. And that's leading to really high costs, added costs for these medical insurance companies."", ""RACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true. And I mean, we've seen that health care-related stocks have really been beaten up year-to-date, apart from those that have been benefiting from GLP-1 and obesity drugs. They have been beaten up. Now, keep in mind, of course, health care does tend to be a more defensive sector because it's not usually tied to the whims of the economy, the shakes and the economy. But we really haven't seen investors pouring into those defensive stocks as well. So also playing into that as well. But unfortunately, we're continuing to see that these health care stocks are getting a bit beaten up here in the middle of earnings season."", ""Well, shifting gears, we also have our eyes on Netflix. A Citi analyst suggesting this morning that investors hit pause on the stock ahead of its earnings next week, citing three big reasons. One, 2024 revenue estimates may be too high. Two, 2025 content investments may exceed estimates. And three, of course, we can't rule out potential acquisitions."", ""So it's interesting to look at what they're expecting in terms of spending on content because we know that Netflix had in fact been pulling back on some of these very expensive programming, leaning more into earning some ad tiers, to its gaming as well. But for some reason, we're not seeing that reflected in that Citi note there, at least not to the degree that's not giving some sort of caution ahead of earnings here, Akiko."", ""AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. The content span always a big concern with these streaming platforms. But in many ways, the Netflix story has been a good one when you think about those additional levers they put in place, four additional channels for revenue. We're talking about the ad-based platform, you know, the subscription or the password sharing crackdown as well. And so you could argue that investors have kind of moved ahead on that."", ""Maybe this is about a valuation play. I'm looking at the numbers here that Netflix has publicly confirmed for the streaming platform's ad-based plan. 23 million global monthly active users. That's a huge gain from what they last reported back in November, 15 million. So that positivity or that positive story has in many ways already coming through for Netflix."", ""But other analysts still pretty bullish on that. When you look at BofA securities analyst, Jessica Ehrlich saying that she thinks there still can be more gains for subscribers, specifically in those lower price options as customers become more and more cost-conscious. There are other options they can tap into. So we'll have to watch very closely when Netflix reports those results next week.""]"

Investors are instead getting a bit nervous that the Fed and other influential central banks won’t race to dramatically cut rates while inflation lingers solidly above target levels.', 'On the other hand, the selling heading into the heart of fourth quarter earnings season makes sense to help cool things off following the blistering run off the October lows. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were always likely to test their longer-term 50-day and 200-day moving averages in the early months of 2024.', 'The Q4 earnings outlook has improved since the big banks kicked things off late last week.', 'Investors who can handle the near-term uncertainty that earnings season brings might want to consider buying these three large-cap stocks ahead of their upcoming earnings releases and holding them for the long haul since timing the market precisely is extremely difficult.', 'Microsoft', 'Microsoft reports its Q2 FY24 earnings results on January 30. Cloud computing reshaped MSFT and turned it back into a consistent sales and EPS growth juggernaut. Now AI appears to be the next expansion-focused frontier, with Microsoft introducing artificial intelligence features across various parts of its business such as Office.', 'On top of AI, MSFT closed its roughly $70 billion deal to buy Activision Blizzard in October as a massive bet on gaming and the future of VR and the metaverse. Microsoft is also sitting on $144 billion in cash and equivalents that will help it continue to pursue expansion through strategic acquisitions.', 'Microsoft is projected to grow its revenue by roughly 14% in both FY24 and FY25 to jump from $212 billion last year to $275 billion next year. The firm is projected to grow its adjusted earnings by 14% during both periods as well. MSFT has consistently beaten our bottom line estimates, and its EPS outlook has remained intact over the last several months to help it land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment.', 'MSFT stock has more than doubled Tech over the past 20 years. MSFT shares have surged 65% during the last 12 months vs. the Zacks Tech sector’s 46%. Despite sitting near new all-time highs, Microsoft trades below its average Zacks price target.', 'The stock might be a little overheated right now, and it could pull back to its 21-day or 50-day moving averages in the near-term. But Microsoft is trading solidly above its 21-month moving average, as it has for most of the last decade.', 'Valuation-wise, MSFT trades at a 10% discount to its 10-year highs at 32.5X forward 12-month earnings. Microsoft appears far cheaper when factoring in its longer-term earnings growth outlook since its PEG ratio of 2.1 offers 5% value vs. its 10-year median and a 32% discount to its highs—MSFT is also trading nearly in line with the Zacks Tech sector.', 'MSFT boosted its FY24 dividend by 10% and it is committed to repurchasing more shares. All in, investors who are bullish on big tech and the possibilities of AI might want to add Microsoft ahead of earnings and hold it forever.', 'Procter & Gamble', 'Procter & Gamble, one of the powerhouses of the consumer packaged goods world, is set to report its second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings results on January 23. Procter & Gamble is one of the largest makers of household and personal essentials, with brands ranging from Febreze and Swiffer to Head & Shoulders and Pampers and tons more. PG breaks down its business into five categories: Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric & Home Care, and Baby, Feminine & Family Care.', 'Procter & Gamble’s standing as a consumer staples standout helps it succeed during most economic environments, good or bad. The company is projected to post roughly 4% sales expansion both this year and next to help boost its adjusted earnings by 9% and 8%, respectively, based on current Zacks estimates. PG has regularly topped EPS estimates in the last five years and its upward revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now.', 'PG stock has climbed 65% in the last five years vs. the Zacks Consumer Staples sector’s 9%. Procter & Gamble has lagged the market during the past three years, up 11% vs. the S&P 500’s 26% run.', 'PG shares are trading roughly 8% below their highs and 12% under their average Zacks price target. Procter & Gamble is trading above its very long-term 21-month moving average and around neutral RSI levels on a 20-year timeframe.', 'The stock might be able to break out of its prolonged holding pattern in 2024 as investors look for gains outside of big tech. Procter & Gamble is trading at a 16% discount to its decade-long highs and near its median at 22.4X forward earnings.', 'PG’s dividend yields 2.5% to outpace its industry’s 2.4% average. P&G is also one of fewer than 70 S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, which are firms that have both paid and raised dividends for at least 25 years running.', 'United Rentals', 'United Rentals, an equipment rental star, said it will release its Q4 FY23 results on January 24. URI’s growing portfolio of large equipment includes scissor lifts, towable light towers, generators, excavators, and nearly everything else under the sun its clients might need. Customers across construction, utilities, energy, home builders, and beyond count on United Rentals for various offerings across different timeframes.', 'United Rentals has lifted prices alongside inflation and it is benefiting from its Ahern Rentals acquisition in late 2022. The firm’s revenue was booming before the pandemic, with sales up between 15% to 21% for three straight years until they slipped in 2020. URI quickly left its Covid setbacks behind and posted 14% sales growth in FY21 and 20% in 2022.', 'United Rentals carried over its momentum in 2023, topping our Q2 and Q3 earnings estimates. The company reaffirmed its 2023 guidance last quarter, and URI’s management team remains confident in its longer-term outlook. The firm expects it will benefit from the ongoing investment super cycle in the U.S. across infrastructure, industrial manufacturing, and energy and power.', 'The company’s earnings outlook has slipped slightly compared to where it was this time last year. But its 2025 estimates have improved recently. Plus, URI’s sales are projected to jump by 22% in 2023 and another 4% in 2024 against a difficult-to-compete-against period. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to surge by 26% and 6%, respectively.', 'URI has surged 590% in the past 10 years to crush the S&P 500’s 170% and the Zacks Construction sector’s 155%. United Rentals is up 42% in the last 12 months, including some large swings.', 'URI’s recent slip below its 21-day moving average might mean it will be forced to test its 50-day soon. Thankfully, it is already at neutral RSI levels vs. overbought in December. Some investors might want to wait for it to slide to the longer-dated trendlines such as the 21-month depicted in the nearby chart.', 'Yet, the stock appears to be worth simply buying and holding through any near-term downturns since it trades at a 21% discount to its sector despite its huge long-term outperformance and 25% below its highs at 12.9X 12-month forward earnings. And its dividend yields 1.1%.', ""Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', ""This world's largest airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.06 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -94.9%."", 'Revenues are expected to be $13.02 billion, down 1.3% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 50.03% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for American Airlines?', ""For American Airlines, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +43.10%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.', 'So, this combination indicates that American Airlines will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that American Airlines would post earnings of $0.26 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.38, delivering a surprise of +46.15%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This paint and coatings maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.8%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $5.21 billion, down 0.4% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sherwin-Williams?', ""For Sherwin-Williams, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.67%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sherwin-Williams will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Sherwin-Williams would post earnings of $2.77 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.20, delivering a surprise of +15.52%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower.

The payment will take the dividend yield to 3.7%, which is in line with the average for the industry."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Alliant Energy ', ""While it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. Based on the last payment, Alliant Energy's earnings were much higher than the dividend, but it wasn't converting those earnings into cash flow. No cash flows could definitely make returning cash to shareholders difficult, or at least mean the balance sheet will come under pressure."", 'The next year is set to see EPS grow by 25.5%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 58% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.', 'The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was $0.94, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.81. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 6.8% over that duration. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.', ""Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Earnings per share has been crawling upwards at 3.8% per year. Growth of 3.8% per annum is not particularly high, which might explain why the company is paying out a higher proportion of earnings. This could mean the dividend doesn't have the growth potential we look for going into the future."", ""In summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Alliant Energy's payments are rock solid. While Alliant Energy is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. We don't think Alliant Energy is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus."", 'Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which PepsiCo falls in, has gained 8.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'PepsiCo is expected to post earnings of $1.72 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3%.

Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.', ""Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

', 'The new extension, BodyArmor Zero Sugar, targets the fast-growing no-sugar category in sports drinks valued at $2 billion, according to Nielsen data provided by the brand. It will initially be available in four flavors: Fruit Punch, Lemon Lime, Orange and Cherry Lime.', ""“Zero Sugar is somewhere that BodyArmor needs to play,” Sabrina Niland, vice president of innovation with BodyArmor, said in an interview. “There’s a host of consumers that we are not able to reach right now because they're sugar avoiders.”"", ""After a rocky start following Coca-Cola's $5.6 billion purchase of the rest of BodyArmor it didn’t own in 2021, the beverage giant appears to have stabilized the business enough that it feels comfortable introducing the sports drink to a broader range of consumers through new product offerings."", 'Niland said new leadership installed by Coca-Cola after the acquisition identified zero sugar and rapid hydration as two untapped areas for BodyArmor. The company entered the rapid rehydration beverage category in June with BodyArmor Flash I.V., the brand’s first major product offering in two years.', 'In both rapid hydration and now zero sugar, BodyArmor is entering a category where Gatorade and other players dominate. This places the impetus on Coca-Cola to woo consumers to the BodyArmor brand through taste and aspects that set it apart.', 'BodyArmor Zero Sugar is leaning big into its health credentials, touting the new offering as the first better-for-you item in the $10.7 billion sports drink category. ', 'That’s “what sets us apart from the rest of the category,” Niland said. “It’s a huge, huge segment of sports drinks that have not had a better-for-you offering.”', 'BodyArmor, which was created in 2011, has grown into a $1 billion-plus premium sports drink brand through low sodium and high potassium levels, antioxidants, vitamins B and C and the absence of artificial colors and flavors.

', 'One ingredient missing from prior iterations of BodyArmor is coconut water; it was replaced with stevia to allow the product to be labeled zero sugar.', 'It’s no surprise that consumers are curtailing their sugar consumption as part of a pursuit to improve their health.', 'While BodyArmor has touted the better-for-you ingredients in its drink, having one without sugar was a notable void for the beverage. Niland, who previously worked at Danone and PepsiCo before joining BodyArmor in June 2022, admitted she was “surprised” by the absence of a zero sugar line.', 'BodyArmor has made notable inroads in sports drinks in just over a decade, but it remains a distant player in the category behind Gatorade. BodyArmor and Powerade, also owned by Coca-Cola, have a combined 23% market share, according to Nielsen AMC data provided by the beverage giant, while Gatorade, including G Zero, is at 64%.', 'Powerade had the first zero-sugar launch in 2007, Niland said, which gave Coca-Cola “the knowledge and the credentials” in the zero-sugar segment of sports drinks.', 'Similar to the decades-long battle between Coke and Pepsi in soft drinks, Coca-Cola is gunning for PepsiCo with the Zero Sugar launch.', 'BodyArmor provided information comparing the nutritional attributes and ingredients of its Zero Sugar compared to a G Zero. The data showed Zero Sugar has more potassium and magnesium. It also has zinc and vitamins B and C that G Zero doesn’t. One area where Gatorade narrowly trumps Zero Sugar is with fewer calories; four calories compared to 10.', '”We’re going up against Goliath, and we’re really focused on becoming No. 1,” Niland said. “We’ll continue to innovate across [Powerade and BodyArmor], to drive growth for the category and for our brands.”', 'She said BodyArmor is working on “a ton of other opportunities,” including new categories and extensions of existing products that could hit the market in the coming year. “That pace [of innovation] will not slow down,” Niland noted.', 'This story was originally published on Food Dive.

This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate.

So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Union Pacific would post earnings of $2.45 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.51, delivering a surprise of +2.45%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower.

In the said period, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained about 28% against the industry’s decline of 19%.Analysts seem quite optimistic about the company, which is one of the recognized names in the retail space.

This acquisition is expected to bring new design dynamics into the company’s portfolio and tap into different consumer segments.Additionally, the acquisition is seen as a significant opportunity for growth, both in terms of sales and margins. The company anticipates leveraging its capabilities to enhance the performance of Almost Famous over time. With an expected revenue contribution of $30-$35 million and an EPS impact of 1-2 cents for the current financial year, this acquisition aligns seamlessly with Steven Madden's forward-looking growth strategy.Despite a slight decline, the company's direct-to-consumer business remains significantly better than pre-COVID levels. The gross margin in the DTC segment improved 250 basis points to 63.7%, contributing to an expansion in the operating margin and higher EBIT from those reported in 2022. The improvement in the DTC gross margin was driven by lower freight expenses and a reduction in promotional activity."", ""Despite the positive strides, SHOO acknowledges the softening of the industry trends starting in September 23.

While equitable access to education and employment are fundamental to participating in society, life isn't and shouldn't be just about work."", ""For example, I'm a newly single blind woman engaged in online dating. As I'm browsing profiles, I want to participate in this amusing, exciting, and sometimes treacherous part of life as fully as anyone else-and that includes wanting to know if my prospective matches' profile pictures contain any metaphorical red flags. And you may think that because I'm blind, I don't care about the aesthetics. If so, you would be wrong. For instance, while I appreciate that a shaved head paired with a full luscious beard is the preference for many, it is not the aesthetic for me."", 'In recognition of International Day for Persons with Disabilities, which is celebrated annually on December 3, I want to offer food for thought as we lean into technological advances. You see, online dating, AI, accessibility and disability are all closely linked, and if done right will lead to innovative applications which may seem unimaginable.', 'Accessibility Meets AI', ""Back to online dating. Pictures supposedly convey 1000 words, which is why online dating is so inherently visual. One picture tells us about someone's spirit so deeply we will know if we want to spend 30- plus years with them. So, my dilemma: how do I participate in this social experiment?"", ""One way for me to do that is to use a mobile app that connects blind and low-vision individuals with sighted volunteers through a live video call. I can open the app and ask a sighted person to describe someone's profile picture."", ""While this approach is a great improvement over not having any information, it doesn't give me freedom to participate autonomously in the rich social tapestry we call life. Plus, do you really want to involve a third party to judge how shallow you are based on your swiping directionality? Neither do I!"", ""So that's where I got creative and leveraged the biggest technological shift in a generation-artificial intelligence (AI). Through a rather cumbersome, but judgment-free process, I take screenshots, run it through an AI-powered image description app, and voila. Man sitting in car with sunglasses, a baseball hat in the dark? Left please."", 'Disability: The Great Shared Human Experience', ""My online dating journey certainly is amusing. However, there are deeper implications. Think about how the world treats and includes-or doesn't-people with disabilities. Even if you are not disabled today, there will almost certainly come a day when you are. You might spend 6-12 weeks using crutches while the leg you broke skiing heals. Or maybe it's that you will experience the slow progression of a degenerative condition that unfolds over time."", 'Short-term or life-long, disability is going to be part of the fabric of your life at some point.', 'Building a World with Disabled Communities', 'How we harness the power of AI to design a more equitable world for people with disabilities becomes a question of who is building AI and how they are building it.', 'In most aspects of society, disabled people have been relegated to the sidelines, and seldom expected to be in or promoted to decision-making roles. The narratives we commonly hear about disability and the disabled experience are often informed by non-disabled people who hold deep bias and fear around this topic.', ""Let's try a little thought experiment. Picture a disabled woman in your mind right now."", 'I\'m going to guess that the first image to pop into your mind is probably not that of a vivacious, fashion-forward woman of color strutting with her white cane through the streets of Washington, DC, sporting her favorite burnt orange booties. And you certainly will not picture her online dating profile, because we do not associate disability as part of the human experience, but rather as ""other.""', ""Here's another experiment. What do you think happens when you ask an AI image-generator to create pictures of disabled people?"", 'As one commentator I recently heard speak said, the answer is, ""You get a bunch of sad-looking white guys in wheelchairs.""', 'That served as a bit of a laugh line in his presentation, but it was uncomfortable laughter, because we know why generative AI engines produce images like that. We get out of AI what we put into it. And right now, a lot of bias and assumptions are integrated into it.', ""The result is that the AI we're expecting to enrich all our lives, instead may be a promoter of harmful narratives and stereotypes of marginalized communities."", 'One of these erroneous narratives is that inclusion of disabled and neurodivergent communities inherently equates to slowing progress and innovation: further, that this inclusion may negatively impact the quality of the result to something ""less than.""', 'In our industry, speed has been regarded as one of the defining factors for success and profitability. Hence, the value of inclusion of marginalized communities is in direct contrast to what is seen as a competitive advantage. The data tells us that this is far from the truth. In fact, inclusion of disabled and other marginalized perspectives, rather than being a hindrance, results in outperforming the competition.', ""But stories and images are powerful. The narratives we breathe in from the moment we are children are hard to dismantle even when we see the numbers. Data isn't enough to move the needle. Instead, focusing on proactive learning, engagement with the disability community, promotion of disabled and neurodivergent individuals into decision-making positions, and appreciation for and of the time of disabled people, paired with storytelling is truly what can break the biases built into our neural networks."", 'Inclusion Powers Innovation', 'Disabled and neurodivergent people live in a world that is not designed for us. So, we create solutions. In fact, some of your most beloved technological advancements were developed by disabled people when we had to find a solution to further participate in day-to-day life.', 'Did you know that the keyboard on your desk, the electric toothbrush you are hopefully using, and all dictation features across your devices, along with being able to speak with your home assistants, were all results of innovation driven by the needs of the disability community?', 'Revolutionary technological advances are meant to break rather than build barriers, build connection rather than disconnection, and increase enjoyment, fun and productivity rather than take them away. And while the creativity and needs of the disabled community have launched innovations that make all our lives easier and richer-audio books, anyone?--many of the technical advances today are excluding and leaving behind disabled and neurodivergent users, because there is a lack of intentionality in building accessible advances which serve all.', ""I wonder if in our desire for speed we've forgotten that to speed up, to create and innovate, sometimes we must pause and wonder, who else can we serve? Technological advances that last and don't just become an amusing memory in two to three years are those which serve so many people that we cannot imagine our lives without them. Knowing that disability will impact us all at some point in life, thoughtfulness about designing a more accessible world logically follows as a step to creating those kinds of meaningful advances. This is why inclusive AI is so crucial."", ""So, let's flip the narrative. Building inclusive AI isn't about inhibiting speed. It is about accelerating innovation."", 'Powering an Inclusive Future for All', 'Through the tireless work of disabled advocates, the United Nations recognized how deeply disability is intertwined with humanity when it first proclaimed December 3, as International Day of Persons with Disabilities more than 30 years ago.', 'This year, the theme for IDPWD was ""United in action to rescue and achieve the sustainable development goals for, with and by persons with disabilities.""', ""Celebration is stopping to acknowledge and feel joy and pride in all that we have accomplished. Yes, you may celebrate having to yell at your Alexa today because it didn't understand what you asked and went off on a tangent. Know that the same home assistant helped someone turn on their oven because we did not build touch screens with motor disabilities in mind."", 'But celebration is also a commitment to growth, to saying, ""Where do we go next and how do we do it better?"" Designing with the disability community, prioritizing accessibility from the moment you think of an idea, actively including those of us who interact with the world differently, that\'s how we truly celebrate and honor difference.', 'Artificial intelligence is the biggest development in tech in a generation. It has the power to make our world a more inclusive place. Now is the time for everyone involved in AI to commit to building it for, with, and by persons with disabilities-then maybe someday it will power full inclusion.
