Here are 5 of the biggest recent earnings reports, all covered in real time on InvestingPro.Snap beats Q4 estimates but expects revenue to fallSnap (NYSE:SNAP) said Q4 EPS was $0.14, better than the consensus of $0.11, while revenue of $1.3 billion (flat year-over-year) was in line with expectations. DAUs increased 17% year-over-year to 375 million.But the company said 2022 was a challenging year, as it continued to experience the impact of macroeconomic headwinds, platform policy changes, and increased competition, and expects the operating environment to remain challenging, as it sees these headwinds persist throughout Q1.Given uncertainties related to the operating environment, the company didn’t provide expectations for revenue or adjusted EBITDA for Q1. The company shared its internal forecast which assumes revenue to decline 2%-10% year-over-year in Q1, noting that it had observed a year-over-year decline in revenue of approximately 7% quarter-to-date.Following the results and guidance, UBS downgraded Snap to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $10.00. Its price target was lowered at several brokerages, including at Goldman Sachs (to $8 from $10), Barclays (to $15 from $18), and Credit Suisse (to $13 from $16), as well as Truist Securities (to $8.00 from $10.00) and Evercore ISI (to $12.00 from $14.00).Shares were recently changing hands at $9.82 premarket.Vodafone CEO promises to 'do more' following weak Q3Vodafone's (LON:VOD) interim CEO Margherita Della Valle pledged to improve results after Q3 revenue growth slowed due to weak performance in key European markets.Service revenue organic growth dropped to 1.8% year-over-year to €9.52B, due to declines in customer levels in Germany and price competition in Italy and Spain. However, the UK saw an increase in service figures by 5.3% on an annualized basis to €1.8B due to resilient demand and price hikes. This led to a quarterly total organic group revenue growth decrease to 2.7% from 4.1% in the previous quarter.Story continuesVodafone ADRs (NASDAQ:VOD) were trading more than 3% lower premarket today.Advanced Micro Devices stock gains on Q4 beat &amp; in line guidanceAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) shares were up nearly 5% premarket today after the company reported its Q4 results, with EPS of $0.69 coming in better than the consensus of $0.67.Revenue grew 16% year-over-year to $5.6B, compared to the consensus of $5.52B, driven primarily by growth across its embedded and data center businesses and partially offset by lower revenue from chips for laptops, PCs, and gaming systems.For Q1/23, the company expects revenue in the range of $5B-5.6B, compared to the consensus of $5.48B.Following the results announcement, several Wall Street analysts raised their price targets on the stock, including KeyBanc with a new price target of $95.00 (from $80.00), JPMorgan with a new price target of $82.00 (from $70.00), and Morgan Stanley with a new price target of $87.00 (from $77.00).Goldman Sachs said it remains constructive on the stock given its expectation for significant market share expansion in server CPU and the potential for margin improvement in H2/23 and 2024 driven by higher volumes and better mix vs. H1/23, while noting that the competitive landscape in PC and the near-term correction in Data Center will potentially weigh on investor sentiment.Match Group shares plunge on Q4 miss &amp; disappointing outlookMatch Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) shares fell more than 9% premarket today after the company reported its Q4 results, with EPS of $0.30 coming in worse than the consensus of $0.46. Revenue fell 2% to $786M, compared to the consensus of $786.89M. Overall payers declined 1% year-over-year to 16.1M.For Q1/23, the company expects revenue to be in the range of $790M-$800M, worse than the consensus of $816M. For full-year, the company reaffirmed its focus on delivering 5%-10% year-over-year growth, in both Match Group's total revenue and Tinder Direct revenue.Western Digital shares drop on Q2 earnings &amp; guidance missWestern Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) shares plunged more than 4% premarket today after the company reported its Q2 results, with EPS of ($0.42) coming in worse than the consensus of ($0.14). Revenue was $3.11B, compared to the consensus of $2.99B.For Q3/23, the company expects EPS in the range of ($1.70)-($1.40), compared to the consensus of ($0.30).The company also announced that Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) had purchased $900M of its convertible preferred stock together with Elliott Investment Management at an initial conversion price of $47.75 per share. Both companies were granted board seats.Liz Moyer, Yasin Ebrahim, and Scott Kanowsky contributed to this report.***If you’re interested in upgrading your search for new investing ideas, check out InvestingPro.Related Articles5 big earnings reports: Snap stock battered on sales warningPayPal's rocky road ahead warrants more cost cuts, Wall Street saysFutures dip on jitters ahead of ADP report, Fed decision]"

This compares to earnings of $2.30 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -425%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of hard drives for businesses and personal computers would post earnings of $0.30 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.20, delivering a surprise of -33.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Western Digital , which belongs to the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry, posted revenues of $3.11 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.09%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.83 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Western Digital shares have added about 40.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.6%.What's Next for Western Digital?While Western Digital has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Western Digital: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.36 on $3.1 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.19 on $13.21 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer- Storage Devices is currently in the top 32% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Quantum Corp.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this steel company have returned +26.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.8% change. The Zacks Steel - Producers industry, to which Nucor belongs, has gained 20.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nucor is expected to post earnings of $3.60 per share, indicating a change of -53.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $12.98 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -54.9%. This estimate has changed +12.4% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.16 indicates a change of -14% from what Nucor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nucor is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NUE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Nucor, the consensus sales estimate of $7.71 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -26.5%. The $30.06 billion and $28.08 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -27.6% and -6.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNucor reported revenues of $8.72 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -15.8%. EPS of $4.89 for the same period compares with $7.97 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.29%. The EPS surprise was +16.99%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nucor is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nucor. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $0.89 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -2.05%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this insurance company would post earnings of $1.40 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.51, delivering a surprise of 7.86%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Unum , which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry, posted revenues of $3 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.04%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.99 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Unum shares have added about 0.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.6%.What's Next for Unum?While Unum has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Unum: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.53 on $3.05 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.30 on $12.3 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

McKenney, president and chief executive officer. ""Our solid fourth quarter results were driven by higher premiums across our core segments and continued favorable trends in our Group Disability line. We enter 2023 with strong sales momentum and record levels of capital.  This positions us well to execute on our strategy of growth while returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.""Story continuesRESULTS BY SEGMENTWe measure and analyze our segment performance on the basis of ""adjusted operating income"" or ""adjusted operating loss"", which differ from income before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of income due to the exclusion of investment gains or losses, amortization of cost of reinsurance, and certain other items.  Investment gains or losses primarily include realized investment gains or losses, expected investment credit losses, and gains or losses on derivatives.  These performance measures are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) guidance for segment reporting, but they should not be viewed as a substitute for income before income tax or net income.Unum US SegmentUnum US reported adjusted operating income of $228.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of 181.0 percent from $81.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Premium income for the segment increased 3.4 percent to $1,581.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to premium income of $1,529.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Net investment income for the segment decreased 8.3 percent to $166.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $182.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.Within the Unum US operating segment, the group disability line of business reported a 236.1 percent increase in adjusted operating income to $114.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $34.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Premium income for the group disability line of business increased 7.3 percent to $732.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $682.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by in-force block growth and favorable persistency.  Net investment income decreased 8.9 percent to $86.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $94.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by lower miscellaneous investment income and a lower level of invested assets.  The benefit ratio for the fourth quarter of 2022 was 64.1 percent, compared to 78.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to lower claims incidence in both the group short-term and long-term disability product lines as well as favorable recoveries in the group long-term disability product line.  Group long-term disability sales were $156.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of 45.5 percent from $107.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Group short-term disability sales were $101.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of 54.9 percent from $65.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Persistency in the group long-term disability product line was 90.7 percent for full year 2022, compared to 89.6 percent for full year 2021.  Persistency in the group short-term disability product line was 88.9 percent for full year 2022, compared to 87.4 percent for full year 2021.The group life and accidental death and dismemberment line of business reported adjusted operating income of $29.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to an adjusted operating loss of $71.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Premium income for this line of business increased 1.8 percent to $463.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $455.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by in-force block growth, partially offset by lower persistency.  Net investment income decreased 9.7 percent to $25.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $27.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, due primarily to lower miscellaneous investment income, partially offset by an increase in the yield on invested assets.  The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 78.2 percent, compared to 98.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, due to lower mortality in the group life product line, resulting primarily from lessening impacts of COVID-19 on our insured population.  Sales of group life and accidental death and dismemberment products decreased 8.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022 to $94.9 million, compared to $103.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Persistency in the group life product line was 88.9 percent for full year 2022, compared to 89.7 percent for full year 2021.  Persistency in the accidental death and dismemberment product line was 87.9 percent for full year 2022, compared to 89.1 percent for full year 2021.The supplemental and voluntary line of business reported a decrease of 28.7 percent in adjusted operating income to $84.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $119.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Results were impacted from the recapture of a critical illness reinsurance treaty in the voluntary benefits product line.  Premium income for the supplemental and voluntary line of business decreased to $385.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $391.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, due primarily to a change in estimate in the individual disability unearned premium reserve.  Net investment income decreased 6.9 percent to $55.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $59.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to lower miscellaneous investment income and a decrease in the yield on invested assets.  The benefit ratio for the individual disability product line was 53.2 percent for the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 40.2 percent for the fourth quarter of 2021, due to a change in estimate in the individual disability unearned premium reserve as well as higher average benefit size. The benefit ratio for the voluntary benefits product line was 44.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 42.9 percent for the fourth quarter of 2021, due to unfavorable experience in both the critical illness and accident product lines, partially offset by lower mortality in the life product line, resulting primarily from lessening impacts of COVID-19 on our insured population.  The benefit ratio for the dental and vision product line was 65.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 65.6 percent for the fourth quarter of 2021.  Relative to the fourth quarter of 2021, sales in the individual disability product line increased 16.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022 to $25.9 million.  Sales in the voluntary benefits product line decreased 5.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022 to $49.9 million.  Sales in the dental and vision product line totaled $41.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of 43.1 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.  Persistency in the individual disability product line was 89.5 percent for full year 2022, compared to 89.7 percent for full year 2021.  Persistency in the voluntary benefits product line was 75.8 percent for both full year 2022 and 2021.  Persistency in the dental and vision product line was 79.9 percent for full year 2022, compared to 86.0 percent for full year 2021.Unum InternationalThe Unum International segment reported adjusted operating income of $45.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of 66.1 percent from $27.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Premium income increased 0.5 percent to $178.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $177.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Net investment income increased 26.1 percent to $47.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $37.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Sales decreased 7.1 percent to $23.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $25.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.  For the fourth quarter of 2022, Unum International results were unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in the British pound sterling to U.S. dollar exchange rate relative to the fourth quarter of 2021.The Unum UK line of business reported adjusted operating income, in local currency, of £37.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of 101.6 percent from £18.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Premium income was £132.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of 15.4 percent from £114.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, due to favorable sales and in-force block growth.  Net investment income was £38.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of 44.0 percent from £26.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, due to higher investment income from inflation index-linked bonds.  The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 76.0 percent, compared to 81.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, due to favorable experience in the group long-term disability product line driven by favorable recoveries.  Sales increased 1.4 percent to £14.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to £14.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Persistency in the group long-term disability product line was 85.1 percent for full year 2022, compared to 89.3 percent for full year 2021.  Persistency in the group life product line was 87.9 percent for full year 2022, compared to 86.5 percent for full year 2021.  Persistency in the supplemental product line was 92.8 percent for full year 2022, compared to 90.9 percent for full year 2021.Colonial Life Segment Colonial Life reported a 16.3 percent increase in adjusted operating income to $93.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $80.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Premium income decreased 0.7 percent to $420.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $423.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily as a result of lower overall persistency, partially offset by higher prior period sales.  Net investment income decreased 8.8 percent to $37.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $40.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, due to lower miscellaneous investment income and a decline in the yield on invested assets, partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets.  The benefit ratio was 45.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to the benefit ratio of 52.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by favorable claim experience across all product lines.Sales increased 2.3 percent to $170.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $166.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Persistency in Colonial Life was 78.0 percent for full year 2022, compared to 79.3 percent for full year 2021.Closed Block SegmentThe Closed Block segment reported adjusted operating income of $40.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $76.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Excluded from the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2021 is the amortization of the cost of reinsurance related to the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction of $15.3 million and $19.7 million, respectively. Premium income for this segment declined 5.6 percent to $230.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $244.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, due to policy terminations, partially offset by rate increases.  Net investment income decreased 10.5 percent to $252.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $282.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, due to lower miscellaneous investment income, partially related to smaller increases in the net asset value on our private equity partnerships, and a decline in the yield on invested assets.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets.The interest adjusted loss ratio for the long-term care line of business increased to 86.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 82.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, driven primarily by higher incidence.  The interest adjusted loss ratio for the long-term care line of business for full year 2022 was 82.0 percent which is below our long-term expected range.Corporate SegmentThe Corporate segment reported an adjusted operating loss of $37.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to an adjusted operating loss of $45.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, due primarily to higher net investment income and lower interest and debt expenses, partially offset by higher operating expenses.OTHER INFORMATIONShares OutstandingThe Company's weighted average number of shares outstanding, assuming dilution, was 200.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 204.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2021.  Shares outstanding totaled 197.8 million at December 31, 2022.  During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company repurchased 1.5 million shares at a cost of $62.6 million.Capital ManagementAt December 31, 2022, the weighted average risk-based capital ratio for the Company's traditional U.S. insurance companies was approximately 420 percent, and cash and marketable securities in the holding companies equaled $1,571.0 million.Book ValueBook value per common share as of December 31, 2022 was $46.51, compared to $56.37 at December 31, 2021.  Book value per common share excluding AOCI as of December 31, 2022 was  $60.45, compared to $54.63 at December 31, 2021.Effective Tax RateEffective tax rate on adjusted operating earnings was 22.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022, and 19.4 percent for full year 2022.OutlookThe Company will hold its 2023 outlook meeting on Thursday, February 23, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time, in New York City.  Additional information, including information on how to access a webcast of the meeting which will be simulcast in a listen-only mode, can be found on the ""Investors"" section of the Company's website.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESWe analyze our performance using non-GAAP financial measures.  A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  The non-GAAP financial measure of ""after-tax adjusted operating income"" differs from net income as presented in our consolidated operating results and income statements prepared in accordance with GAAP due to the exclusion of investment gains or losses and the amortization of the cost of reinsurance as well as certain other items as specified in the reconciliations in the Financial Highlights section below.  Investment gains or losses primarily include realized investment gains or losses, expected investment credit losses, and gains or losses on derivatives.  The non-GAAP measure ""book value per common share excluding AOCI"" differs from the GAAP measure due to the exclusion of AOCI.  We believe these measures are better performance measures and better indicators of the profitability and underlying trends in our business.Investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments.  Our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of investment gains or losses.  Although we may experience investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels, a long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is long-term in nature, and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities.We have exited a substantial portion of our Closed Block individual disability product line through the two phases of the reinsurance transaction that were executed in December 2020 and March 2021. As a result, we exclude the amortization of the cost of reinsurance that was recognized upon the exit of the business related to the ceded reserves for the cohort of policies on claim status. We believe that the exclusion of the amortization of the cost of reinsurance provides a better view of our results from our ongoing businesses.We may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability.CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION Members of Unum Group senior management will host a conference call on Wednesday, February 1, 2023, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2022.  Topics may include forward-looking information, such as the Company's outlook on future results, trends in operations, and other material information.The dial-in number for the conference call is 1-844-200-6205 for callers in the U.S. (pass code 224848).  For callers in Canada, the dial-in number is 1-833- 950-0062 (pass code 224848).

QRVO is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Feb 1, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 4.31%. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.23%, on average. The company is likely to have recorded lower revenues year over year as it continues to navigate through adverse macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions.Factors at PlayIn the to-be-reported quarter, Qorvo inked a multi-year supply agreement with SK Siltron for silicon carbide (SiC) bare and epitaxial wafers to ease the domestic semiconductor supply chain situation. The SiC devices are better than conventional silicon in dealing with high power and heat conduction.Qorvo’s Gen 4 SiC FET solutions will increase the driving range of electric vehicles by up to 10%, enabling a more efficient transfer of electricity from the battery to the motor. This is likely to have improved the revenues for the quarter.During the third quarter, Qorvo, in collaboration with MediaTek, announced that it has secured multiple design wins that include 5G devices, Wi-Fi routers and automotive platforms. This deal will further strengthen its broad and robust portfolio and will likely boost  the commercial expansion in mobile, networking, automotive and other markets. Qorvo has already established itself as a highly regarded supplier for numerous MediaTek cellular and Wi-Fi reference designs.The company's broad range of RF Frontend products combined with MediaTek SoCs and chipsets will boost performance and effectiveness for Wi-Fi reference designs. With regard to smartphones, it also secured several design wins with leading OEMs that span a variety of its highly integrated, cutting-edge cellular solutions. The top-line performance of the business will probably be aided by  these developments.However, macroeconomic uncertainty and the current geopolitical climate are expected to have a detrimental effect on the company's top-line performance. War in Europe, growing geopolitical tension between the United States and China and semiconductor manufacturing challenges will hurt its earnings prospects. In addition to the unfavorable smartphone market environment, supply shocks and intense competition would probably hurt the company's third-quarter salesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of the company stands at $727 million, indicating a decline from $1,114 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at 64 cents per share. It had reported earnings of $2.98 per share in the year-earlier quarter.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Qorvo for the fiscal third quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

Both metrics declined year over year. Results were hurt by the ongoing challenging environment and sluggish demand from rising inflation. The headwinds are likely to recover in the second half of fiscal 2023. Consequently, management issued the 2023 view.Shares of the company have gained 11.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 13.5% growth. We also note that shares of WHR jumped more than 2% after the trading session on Jan 30. This might be owing to the earnings beat in the quarter under review.Notably, management concluded the strategic review of EMEA. As part of this, the company’s European major domestic appliance business will form a new entity with Arçelik. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2023. The company announced the successful buyout of InSinkErator, which has had no material impact on Q4 results. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Insight Into Q4The appliance maker delivered adjusted earnings of $3.89 per share, declining 37% from $6.14 in the year-ago quarter. However, the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.23 and our estimate of $3.23.Net sales of $4,923 million dropped 15.3% from the year-ago quarter. The top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,047 million and our estimate of $5,254.2 million. Excluding the unfavorable impacts of foreign exchange, net sales amounted to $5,059 million, down 13% year over year. The downside is mainly due to a one-off supply disruption in North America and drab demand, which somewhat offset favorable price/mix.The gross profit for fourth-quarter 2022 was $645 million, down 39.3% from $1,063 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Ongoing EBIT of $171 million declined 66% from $502 million in the year-ago quarter. The ongoing EBIT margin of 3.5% contracted 510 bps year over year.Story continuesRegional PerformancesNet sales for the North America segment decreased 13.6% year over year to $2,874 million. Excluding the currency impact, sales in the region dropped 13%. The segment’s EBIT plunged 67.1% year over year to $166 million, while the EBIT margin contracted 950 bps to 5.8% due to elevated cost inflation and one-off supply-chain disruption.Net sales for the EMEA segment were down 27.2% year over year to $1,028 million. Excluding currency impacts, sales in the region dipped 18.1%. The metric was hurt by drab demand in key countries. The segment’s EBIT was at a loss of $4 million compared with the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $20 million due to lower volume, cost inflation and unfavorable currency, which offset cost-based pricing actions.Net sales from Latin America remained flat year over year to $831 million, owing to a sequential demand rise in Mexico and Brazil, which offset cost-based pricing efforts. Excluding the currency impacts, sales in the region fell 3.1%. The segment’s EBIT of $49 million declined 12.5% from the year-ago period’s $56 million. The EBIT margin contracted 80 bps to 5.9%, mainly affected by inflation, somewhat offset by cost-saving efforts.Net sales in Asia fell 22.1% year over year to $219 million mainly due to muted consumer demand, which was partly offset by cost-based pricing. Excluding the currency impacts, sales for the region were down 15.9%. The segment’s EBIT of $6 million reflected a 65% plunge from the $17 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The segment’s EBIT margin of 2.7% contracted 320 bps from the prior-year quarter, driven by cost inflation and a top-line decline.Other Financial DetailsAs of Dec 31, 2022, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company had cash and cash equivalents of $1,958 million, long-term debt of $7,363 million and a stockholders’ equity of $2,336 million, excluding non-controlling interests of $170 million.As of Dec 31, 2022, Whirlpool provided cash of $1,390 million from operating activities. It reported a free cash flow of $820 million. WHR incurred a capital expenditure of $570 million in the same period. Notably, capital expenditure is likely to be $600 million for 2022.The company returned $1.3 billion in cash to shareholders with $900 million in share repurchases.Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseWhirlpool Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteOutlookFor 2023, Whirlpool envisions a net sales decline of 1-2% to $19.4 billion. On a GAAP and ongoing basis, Whirlpool expects earnings per share of $16-$18. Management anticipates a tax rate of 14-16% on a GAAP basis and adjusted basis. For 2023, Whirlpool expects cash used in operating activities of $1.4 billion and a free cash flow of $800 million.That said, management is on track with its cost takeout actions and expects $800 to $900 million related to gains from the aforementioned measures and eased raw material inflation.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are PVH Corp PVH, Oxford Industries OXM and Ralph Lauren RL.PVH Corp currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

22,edf57f04-30f0-3d5e-a545-4e7cde0415a5,PVH,2023-02-01,Here Is Why Bargain Hunters Would Love Fast-paced Mover PVH (PVH),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-bargain-hunters-love-fast-135001042.html,1675173001,STORY,['PVH'],"[Momentum investing is essentially an exception to the idea of ""buying low and selling high."" Investors following this style of investing are usually not interested in betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.PVH (PVH) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 23.6% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. PVH meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 65.3% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for PVH is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 2.01. This indicates that the stock moves 101% higher than the market in either direction.Story continuesGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that PVH has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped PVH earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, PVH is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. PVH is currently trading at 0.62 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 62 cents for each dollar of sales.So, PVH appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to PVH, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

Per the latest Earnings Preview, quarterly results have been dull year over year, reflecting the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and record level of inflationary pressure worldwide. Going by the sector’s scorecard, 8.9% of the companies in the Medical sector, constituting 28.4% of the sector’s market capitalization, reported earnings till Jan 25. Of these, 80% beat earnings estimates and 20% beat the same for revenues. Earnings increased 5% year over year on 7% higher revenues.Overall, fourth-quarter earnings of the Medical sector are expected to plunge 10.9% on a 2.9% revenue decrease. This compares with the third-quarter reported earnings decline of 3.3% on revenue growth of 5.1%.The projection reflects the ongoing global inflationary pressure leading to an extremely tough situation related to raw material and labor cost as well as freight charges, which have put the industry in a tight spot again. The majority of the players within this space have witnessed mounting raw material costs and other expense pressure through the Q4 months. Added to this, labor-supply constraints with rising labor costs and global supply-chain hazards are expected to have moderated the growth process.Medical Device Quarterly SynopsysIntegral to the broader Medical sector, medical device or the Zacks-defined Medical Products companies’ collective business growth is likely to have displayed improvement compared with the last year, with a significant reduction in COVID-led severity across the United States and other developed countries. Through the Q4 months, new waves of coronavirus spread rapidly across various developed and emerging nations. Yet, the companies’ successful addressing of a couple of years’ pent-up demand is likely to have led to higher year-over-year growth within the legacy base businesses of the industry players.Also, diagnostic testing companies might have shown a sequential rise in testing demand, thanks to rising new cases in select geographies, leading to business growth for many companies.Story continuesOverall, the legacy base business recovery and testing demand of the companies through the months of the fourth quarter are expected to have been impressive. Medical device companies like Boston Scientific BSX, Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO, Hologic HOLX and Align Technology ALGN are likely to have been positively influenced by these factors in Q4.However, as discussed earlier, replicating the market-wide trend, this sector’s Q4 results are likely to be significantly dampened by the ongoing macroeconomic threat in the United States and outside. Despite the reopening of the economy, the vicious cycle of deteriorating inflationary situation along with aggressive rate hikes has put the global investment scenario in a tighter spot again. Within medical device, going by the industry-wide trend so far, logistical challenges and increasing unit costs have been heavily weighing on the corporate profitability of the stocks across the board. On the other hand, the tightened monetary policy is starkly altering consumer preferences and once again, demand for the non-essential category line of medical device businesses is on the back foot.This might have, in a way, shrunk the companies’ revenues in Q4 compared to the prior quarter.Let's take a look at three MedTech players scheduled to announce results on Feb 1.Boston Scientific: Boston Scientific expects fourth-quarter 2022 operational revenue growth in the range of 8.5% to 10.5% year over year. This excludes an approximate 650-basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on rates during the Q3 earnings release. Meanwhile, BSX’s top line is likely to have improved year over year, with non-COVID elective medical procedures running in a full-fledged way in the United States and elsewhere across the globe. Given the improving scenario along with an innovative pipeline, expansion into faster growth markets, globalization efforts and enhanced digital capabilities, Boston Scientific is well-positioned to register decent fourth-quarter 2022 results.(Read more: Will Boston Scientific Beat Q4 Earnings Estimates?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $3.24 billion for the fourth quarter suggests a 3.6% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for BSX’s earnings of 47 cents per share indicates a 4.4% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Per our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates. This is exactly the case as you can see below.BSX has an Earnings ESP of +2.64% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.

The company is expected to have recorded growth, driven by a favorable business mix and new launches. The company advanced its Orbitrap portfolio, launching the Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid mass spectrometer. In electron microscopy, the company introduced the Thermo Scientific Arctis Cryo-Plasma Focused Ion Beam, an automated microscope that streamlines cryoelectron tomography. These are all expected to have contributed to the Q4 top line of Thermo Fisher.(Read more: What's in Store for Thermo Fisher in Q4 Earnings?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Thermo Fisher’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $10.36 billion, which implies a decline of 3.2% from the year-ago figure. The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $5.19, suggesting a fall of 20.6% from the prior-year reported figure.TMO has an Earnings ESP of -0.62% and a Zacks Rank #3.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

QuoteHologic: In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Hologic is expected to have witnessed strong growth in the Diagnostics business (excluding COVID) from the growing adoption of Panther instruments and an expanded Panther installed base. During the fourth-quarter earnings update, Hologic noted that the company has nearly 3,250 Panthers instruments placed globally. Its performance might have been driven by both legacy and new assays, namely the BBCVTV vaginitis panel, MGen, CTMG and its respiratory menu on the Panther Fusion. However, with COVID testing significantly down over the past few months, Hologic’s Molecular Diagnostics business is likely to have been impacted by lower COVID-related sales.(Read more: Hologic to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hologic’s fiscal first-quarter revenues is pegged at $980.9 million, which implies a decline of 33.3% from the year-ago figure. The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at 96 cents, suggesting a fall of 55.8% from the prior-year reported figure.HOLX has an Earnings ESP of +5.05% and a Zacks Rank #2.Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHologic, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHologic, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Hologic, Inc. QuoteAlign Technology: Align Technology is likely to have gained from increasing clear aligners shipments to Invisalign doctors worldwide. In the last reported quarter, the company witnessed increased shipments in Invisalign case volumes across almost all markets — led by Taiwan, Thailand, India and Korea — driven by increased submitters.  Analysts expect this trend to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, aiding sales growth. However, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the heightened volatility in foreign exchange rates might have posed hindrances to recovery, hampering business performance in Q4. Staffing shortages and the ongoing inflationary pressure are expected to have dragged the company’s profitability down in Q4.(Read more: Align Technology to Post Q4 Earnings: What's in Store?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of $1.52 per share implies a 46.3% plunge from the year-ago reported figure.

27,def3838a-cbab-351b-be4c-6b04ae4beb8a,CTAS,2023-02-01,Cincinnati Leader of Impact: Cintas’ Katie Gough-Edwards,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cincinnati-leader-impact-cintas-katie-193000833.html,1675193400,STORY,['CTAS'],"[CINCINNATI, OH / ACCESSWIRE / January 31, 2023 / Cintas Corporation's Katie Gough-Edwards, a longtime advocate for heart health and the American Heart Association (AHA), won a seven-week fundraising challenge to become the AHA's 2022 Leader of Impact for Greater Cincinnati.Gough-Edwards, Cintas First Aid &amp; Safety's Midwest Director of Sales, will be honored for her passion and drive to make a difference at the 2023 Greater Cincinnati Heart Ball, Feb. 4 at the Hyatt Regency Cincinnati. The celebration follows a national competition that started Sept. 29 on World Heart Day and inspired $1.8 million in fundraising for the AHA.&gt;&gt; Media-Use Asset (Dropbox) - Gough-Edwards Headshot (.jpg)Gough-Edwards is among six area changemakers who raised a combined $114,727 in a campaign that ranked fourth in the country and first in its market size. Gough-Edwards raised nearly $37,000, or over a third of that total, in support of the AHA's life-saving work.She was surprised to learn she'd won when the Cincinnati leaders gathered for a November conference call.""Because it was a blind competition, nobody knew what you were raising. It wasn't posted anywhere, which made it more competitive and fun and really brought it back to raising money for a good cause,"" Gough-Edwards said. ""It was awesome to see that all the efforts of Cintas and our partners were so successful that we took first place.""The AHA's challenge encouraged local leaders to promote heart health awareness and combat health inequities in their communities. This year, 209 local leaders across 150 cities created unique fundraising campaigns.Mark Carter, Cintas First Aid &amp; Safety President and COO, nominated Gough-Edwards. As a supporter of the AHA personally and professionally for 13 years, he regarded her as an ideal ambassador.""Katie is a game-changer for the First Aid &amp; Safety Division, as well as Cintas,"" Carter said. ""Her personal connections to heart disease and cardiovascular events, in addition to her influence and reach in our business, gave her the potential to be a tremendous force in this year's Leaders of Impact campaign. I thought she was a natural choice to represent Cintas this year, and I'm so proud she represented Cintas and the American Heart Association so successfully.""Story continuesGough-Edwards credited the longstanding relationship between Cintas and the AHA for fostering awareness about heart disease, strokes, cardiac events and cardiovascular health. Not only is Cintas the AHA's largest provider of CPR, first aid and Automated External Defibrillator (AED) training in the United States, but the company has trained and certified more than 900,000 people in lifesaving CPR and first aid since 2016.By participating in or donating to annual campaigns for the Heart Mini-Marathon &amp; Walk and Go Red for Women, thousands of Cintas partners have helped raise funds to support the AHA's education and awareness programs and fund important research to improve the outcomes of cardiac events.Gough-Edwards launched her Leader of Impact fundraising campaign on social media, where she shared that heart disease and cardiac events have affected her family members and loved ones - and even herself. Gough-Edwards had heart-related complications with the births of her three children.She was treated for preeclampsia, a high blood pressure disorder that can lead to life-threatening complications for mother and baby, with her first birth. Gough-Edwards thought she was in the clear after her second baby but was diagnosed with postpartum preeclampsia, a rare and serious condition that can occur up to six weeks after delivery.Even she didn't know much about postpartum preeclampsia at the time.""There's not a ton of education around it out in the community. We just don't talk about it enough,"" Gough-Edwards said.Although she did not have to be readmitted to the hospital following her third birth, she showed symptoms for postpartum preeclampsia and was properly treated by her physicians.Gough-Edwards continues to be a proponent of creating healthier communities through education that features AHA guidelines. The AHA trains 22 million people in CPR each year, has helped over 19 million patients with high blood pressure and has funded more than $5 billion in research.With help from her Cintas team, partners, friends, family and the community, Gough-Edwards is confident that the collective 2022 Greater Cincinnati Leaders of Impact campaign funds will help the AHA assist even more people while saving lives.""We're investing in the American Heart Association so that they can continue to provide world-class research and education to our communities - how to live healthier, how to take care of your heart and how to make sure you're getting the training you need,"" Gough-Edwards said.About Cintas CorporationCintas Corporation helps more than one million businesses of all types and sizes get Ready™ to open their doors with confidence every day by providing products and services that help keep their customers' facilities and employees clean, safe, and looking their best.

(PRNewsFoto/Edwards Lifesciences Corporation)Highlights and OutlookQ4 sales grew 1 percent to $1.35 billion; constant currency1 sales grew 7 percentQ4 TAVR sales were flat; constant currency sales grew 5 percentQ4 EPS of $0.65; adjusted1 EPS increased 25 percent to $0.642022 sales of $5.38 billion grew 3 percent; constant currency sales grew 8 percent2022 EPS of $2.44; adjusted1 EPS increased 12 percent to $2.48Meaningful progress on 8 pivotal trials across TAVR and TMTTRepurchased $1.7 billion of Edwards' stock in 2022Reiterated 2023 guidance of 9 to 12 percent constant currency sales growth""While the challenging environment negatively impacted sales, we grew 8 percent in 2022 and our company stayed focused on the long-term, making meaningful progress on strategic milestones with the potential of transforming patient care.  The healthcare environment is gradually improving, and we expect 9 to 12 percent sales growth in 2023,"" said Michael A. Mussallem, chairman and CEO.  ""Edwards has continued to aggressively invest during this transient COVID environment, which positions our company for strong growth and leadership in a new era of structural heart and critical care innovation.""2022 Full Year ResultsSales for the year ended December 31, 2022, were $5.38 billion, a year-over-year increase of 3 percent, or 8 percent on an underlying basis.  Although initial sales expectations for 2022 anticipated a better healthcare environment, the company delivered balanced contributions across each of its product groups and regions.  Diluted earnings per share for 2022 were $2.44, while adjusted earnings per share of $2.48 increased 12 percent from the year-ago period.Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)For the quarter, the company reported TAVR sales of $868 million, which were flat year-over-year, or up 5 percent on an underlying basis.  Globally, at constant currency, the company's average selling prices and market positions were stable.  In the U.S., Edwards' TAVR procedures grew in the mid-single digit range.Story continuesIn the fourth quarter, Edwards began the introduction of the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve in the U.S.  The RESILIA tissue's anti-calcification technology is designed to address one of the primary causes of reintervention following heart valve replacement, and provides the potential to extend the durability of the valve.Outside the U.S., in the fourth quarter, Edwards' TAVR procedures also grew in the mid-single digits, and the company continues to see excellent opportunities for growth given that international adoption of TAVR therapy remains quite low.Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies (TMTT)Edwards' groundbreaking portfolio of transcatheter mitral and tricuspid technologies demonstrated promising outcomes and clinical performance in the fourth quarter.  The company made meaningful progress toward transforming care for patients with mitral and tricuspid disease.Fourth quarter TMTT sales were $32 million, lifted by the continued adoption of the PASCAL platform in Europe.  During the quarter the company initiated the U.S. launch of PASCAL.  Edwards has now treated more than 10,000 patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid regurgitation with the PASCAL repair system.  Full year global sales of $116 million increased nearly 50 percent on a constant currency basis versus the prior year.Surgical Structural Heart and Critical CareSurgical Structural Heart sales for the quarter were $224 million, up 1 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, or 8 percent on an underlying basis.  The growth was lifted by increased adoption of the company's premium RESILIA technologies around the world, including the recent launch of the company's MITRIS surgical mitral valve.Critical Care sales were $225 million for the quarter, representing an increase of 6 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2021, or 13 percent on an underlying basis.  Sales growth was driven by contributions from all product lines and regions, led by the HemoSphere platform and Smart Recovery technologies.Additional Financial ResultsFor the quarter, the adjusted gross profit margin was 81.0 percent, compared to 76.8 percent in the same period last year.  This improvement was driven by the expected positive impact from the company's FX program, which includes hedge contract gains and natural hedges that offset the negative sales impact from the weakening of the Euro and Yen against the dollar.Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were $411 million, or 30.5 percent of sales, compared to $424 million in the prior year.  This decrease was driven by the weakening of the Euro and Yen against the dollar, partially offset by continued investments in the ongoing build out of the U.S. TMTT commercial team and the company's high-touch model for TAVR.Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter were in-line with year-ago levels at $232 million, or 17.2 percent of sales.Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $214 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $283 million, less capital spending of $69 million.  Full year free cash flow was $1.0 billion.Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. Total debt was approximately $600 million.  During the fourth quarter, the company repurchased $750 million of stock through an accelerated share repurchase program.  In total, the company repurchased $1.7 billion of stock in 2022.  Edwards currently has approximately $900 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.OutlookOverall, the company is reaffirming the sales guidance it provided at the December investor conference for all product groups.  Full year 2023 sales are expected to grow 9 to 12 percent to $5.6 to $6.0 billion.  Additionally, the company continues to expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.60.For the first quarter of 2023, the company projects total sales to be between $1.37 and $1.45 billion, and adjusted EPS of $0.58 to $0.64.""We expect meaningful growth and progress in 2023 with a gradual improvement in healthcare staffing and contributions from all major regions.  We are enthusiastic about the continued expansion of transcatheter-based therapies for the many structural heart patients still in need, which positions us well for long-term success,"" said Mussallem.  ""As the global population ages and cardiovascular disease remains the largest health burden, we believe the opportunity to serve our patients will nearly double between now and 2028, reflecting low double-digit annual growth.  We are confident that our patient-focused innovation strategy can transform care and bring value to patients and healthcare systems worldwide.""About Edwards LifesciencesEdwards Lifesciences is the global leader of patient-focused innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring.  We are driven by a passion for patients, dedicated to improving and enhancing lives through partnerships with clinicians and stakeholders across the global healthcare landscape.

accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""), the Company uses non-GAAP historical financial measures.  Management makes adjustments to the GAAP measures for items (both charges and gains) that (a) do not reflect the core operational activities of the Company, (b) are commonly adjusted within the Company's industry to enhance comparability of the Company's financial results with those of its peer group, or (c) are inconsistent in amount or frequency between periods (albeit such items are monitored and controlled with equal diligence relative to core operations).  The Company uses the term ""underlying"" when referring to non-GAAP sales and sales growth information, which excludes currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company uses the term ""adjusted"" to also exclude intellectual property litigation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities arising from acquisitions, and a significant program discontinuation.Management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally for strategic decision making, forecasting future results, and evaluating current performance.  These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations by investors that, when viewed with its GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company's business and facilitate comparability to historical periods.Non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP; therefore, the information is not necessarily comparable to other companies and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP historical financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided in the tables below.Fluctuations in currency exchange rates impact the comparative results and sales growth rates of the Company's underlying business. Management believes that excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations from its sales growth provides investors a more useful comparison to historical financial results. The impact of the fluctuations has been detailed in the ""Reconciliation of Sales by Product Group and Region.""Guidance for sales and sales growth rates is provided on an ""underlying basis,"" and projections for diluted earnings per share, net income and growth, gross profit margin, taxes, and free cash flow are also provided on a non-GAAP basis, as adjusted, for the items identified above due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting such items without unreasonable efforts.  The Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP guidance to comparable GAAP measures due to the unknown effect, timing, and potential significance of special charges or gains, and management's inability to forecast charges associated with future transactions and initiatives.Management considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure which provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by business operations, after deducting payments for capital expenditures, which can then be used for strategic opportunities or other business purposes including, among others, investing in the Company's business, making strategic acquisitions, strengthening the balance sheet, and repurchasing stock.The items described below are adjustments to the GAAP financial results in the reconciliations that follow:Intellectual Property Litigation Expenses, net - The Company incurred net intellectual property litigation expenses of $7.1 million and $6.4 million in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, $6.1 million and $2.4 million in the second quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, income of $2.4 million and expense of $4.7 million in the third quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, and expenses of $5.0 million and $7.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively.Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration Liabilities, net - The Company recorded gains of $2.9 million and $4.5 million in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, $20.9 million and $102.6 million in the second quarter of 2022 and 2021, gains of $12.5 million and expense of $1.1 million, respectively, in the third quarter of 2022 and 2021, and expense of $0.5 million and gains of $18.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to changes in the fair value of its contingent consideration liabilities arising from acquisitions.Amortization of Intangible Assets - The Company recorded amortization expense related to developed technology and patents in the amount of $1.7 million and $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, $1.2 million and $3.3 million in the second quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $1.5 million and $1.7 million in the third quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $1.3 million and $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively.Program Discontinuation - The Company recorded a $68.4 million charge in the third quarter of 2022 as a result of its decision to exit its HARPOON surgical mitral repair system program.  The charge primarily related to the impairment of intangible assets associated with the technology and other related exit costs. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company recorded a $6.1 million gain due to a reduction in the estimated exit costs.Provision for Income Taxes - The income tax impact of the expenses and gains discussed above is based upon the items' forecasted effect upon the Company's full year effective tax rate. Adjustments to forecasted items unrelated to the expenses and gains above, as well as impacts related to interim reporting, will have an effect on the income tax impact of these items in subsequent periods. EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATIONUnaudited Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Information(in millions, except per share and percentage data)Three Months Ended December 31, 2022Net

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 1.46% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 1.09%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 6.63%.Heading into today, shares of the world's largest retailer had gained 0.25% over the past month, lagging the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 10.03% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.75% in that time.Walmart will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be February 21, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Walmart to post earnings of $1.50 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 1.96%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $158.81 billion, up 3.88% from the year-ago period.WMT's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $6.08 per share and revenue of $605.64 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -5.88% and +5.74%, respectively.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Walmart. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Walmart currently has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Walmart has a Forward P/E ratio of 23.39 right now. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 11.9.Story continuesWe can also see that WMT currently has a PEG ratio of 4.25. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. WMT's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.23 as of yesterday's close.The Retail - Supermarkets industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 12, putting it in the top 5% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.Be sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, earnings missed the same. Over the trailing four quarters, BALL missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the quarters and missed once, the average surprise being a negative 2.4%.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for BALL’s fourth-quarter earnings per share is pegged at 54 cents, suggesting a decline of 44% from the prior-year quarter’s levels. The estimates have remained unchanged over the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales is pegged at $3.53 billion, indicating a year-over-year decline of 4%.Ball Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Ball Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseBall Corporation price-eps-surprise | Ball Corporation Quote Factors to NoteBall Corporation has lately witnessed weaker-than-expected demand as customer spending has been muted amid higher retail prices, particularly in the United States. This might get reflected in the company’s fourth-quarter performance. High input and labor costs due to supply constraints might have impacted the company’s performance in the quarter. Higher-than-expected start-up costs stemming from capacity-expansion measures are likely to have dented margin performance. BALL has been focused on improving its efficiency and reducing costs, which might have negated these impacts and boosted margins in the to-be-reported quarter.Due to weak demand, the company recently announced the closure of its aluminum beverage can manufacturing facilities in Phoenix, AZ, and St. Paul, MN. The Phoenix facility is expected to have ceased production in the fourth quarter of 2022, followed by the St Paul facility in the first quarter of 2023. The closure of the Phoenix facility will likely impact the results of the Beverage Packaging, North and Central America segment in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Beverage packaging, North and Central America segment is pegged at $1,439 million for the December-end quarter indicating a 5% year-over-year decline. The segmental operating income is estimated at $132 million compared with the prior-year quarter’s $162 million. The segment’s results might have been impacted by the weakness in demand as mentioned above and inflated raw material and manufacturing costs.The Beverage Packaging, EMEA segment’s fourth quarter 2022 results will likely bear the impact of higher inflation, energy costs and supply-chain disruptions across the region as well as the sale of the Russian aluminum beverage packaging business.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Beverage packaging, South America segment’s net sales is pegged at $600 million, suggesting a 2% dip from the year-ago period’s levels. The segment’s operating income is pegged at $92 million, suggesting a 4% decline from the prior-year quarter’s $103 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Beverage packaging, Europe segment’s sales is at $700 million for the to-be-reported quarter, indicating a 20% drop from the prior-year quarter’s $870 million. The segment’s operating income is projected at $55 million, suggesting a 47% plunge year over year. Elevated costs might have impacted the segment’s profits during the quarter under review.The Aerospace segment’s contracted backlog remained strong at $3 billion as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. Contracts won but not yet booked into backlog stood at $4.6 billion. Program execution remains at a high level across the business. The segment continues to win and provide mission-critical programs and technologies to the U.S. government, defense, intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance customers. This is likely to get reflected in the segment’s fourth-quarter top line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Aerospace segment's revenues is pegged at $517 million for the period in discussion, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 4%. The segment’s operating income is projected at $44.5 million, suggesting an 18% decline from last year quarter as the improvement in its revenues is likely to be offset by the supply-chain inefficiencies being faced by the segment.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Ball Corp this time around.

43,3fde12e9-b91e-304b-99f7-38ec33cee6ef,XYL,2023-02-01,Xylem (XYL) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xylem-xyl-reports-next-week-150003870.html,1675177203,STORY,"['ITW', 'XYL']","[Xylem (XYL) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 7, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis water and wastewater treatment company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +27%.Revenues are expected to be $1.41 billion, up 7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Xylem?For Xylem, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.63%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Xylem will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Xylem would post earnings of $0.66 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.79, delivering a surprise of +19.70%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Xylem appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerIllinois Tool Works (ITW), another stock in the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $2.61 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +33.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.89 billion, up 5.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Illinois Tool Works has been revised 0.4% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 1.92%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Illinois Tool Works will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, an active catastrophe environment and persistent inflationary pressures are likely to have thrown roadblocks for insurers. Some of the insurers, including MetLife, Inc. MET, Aflac Incorporated AFL, The Allstate Corporation ALL, American Financial Group, Inc. AFG and MGIC Investment Corporation MTG, are set to report their fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 1.The insurance space is housed within the broader Finance sector (one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification). Per the latest Earnings Preview, the total earnings of finance companies for fourth-quarter 2022 are anticipated to fall 9.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure, while revenues of these companies are expected to grow 2.8%.Factors Likely to Shape Insurers’ Performance in Q4The top lines of insurance companies are likely to have benefited on the back of growing premiums resulting from uninterrupted rate hikes, exposure growth and solid customer retention rates in the fourth quarter. A rising premium level bodes well, as they contribute a chunk to an insurer’s revenues. Diversified portfolios, which minimize concentration risks, possessed by insurers, are also expected to have provided an impetus to their fourth-quarter premiums.Per MarketScout, a Texas-based insurance distribution and underwriting company, the commercial insurance rates in the United States grew at a composite rate of 5.1% in the to-be-reported quarter. The same source cited a composite rate increase of 5.2% across the personal lines insurance business in the fourth quarter of 2022.However, significant catastrophe losses stemming from Winter Storm Elliott are expected to have acted as drags on the underwriting results of insurance companies in the to-be-reported quarter. Karen Clark &amp; Company expects the storm to produce an estimated loss of $5.4 billion for the U.S. insurance industry.Story continuesDespite coming with its share of worries, catastrophe losses usually ramp up the policy renewal rate and prompt insurers to implement rate hikes. In the fourth quarter, an improving interest rate scenario is likely to have boosted investment yields for those insurers that have exposure to rate-sensitive products. An aging U.S. population is expected to have sustained steady premium flows for life insurers from their insurance and protection products in the to-be-reported quarter.Easing of border restrictions and receding effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have imparted more confidence to people in traveling, which, in turn, is likely to have boosted auto premiums in the fourth quarter. However, inflationary pressures are anticipated to have elevated auto part expenses or labor costs, which is likely to have exerted pressure on the margins of auto insurers.Strength in the mortgage market, supported by increased policy renewal and lower unemployment rates, is likely to have favored mortgage insurance premiums in the to-be-reported quarter.The insurance industry frequently resorts to significant technology investments in blockchain, AI and advanced analytics, which are aimed to accelerate claim payments and automate processes. These investments are likely to have curbed costs and aided the margins of insurers in the fourth quarter.   Let’s find out how the following insurers are placed before their fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 1.The Zacks model suggests that a company needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.MetLife: In the fourth quarter, revenues of MetLife are likely to have benefited on the back of solid performances of its U.S., Latin America, and the Europe, the Middle East and Africa segments.

50,ea103f84-8832-3994-b9fd-d48bf7d964ec,IT,2023-02-01,Gartner (IT) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q4 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gartner-expected-beat-earnings-estimates-150003543.html,1675177203,STORY,['IT'],"[Gartner (IT) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 7. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis technology information and analysis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.57 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -14.1%.Revenues are expected to be $1.47 billion, up 12.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.92% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Gartner?For Gartner, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.52%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Gartner will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Gartner would post earnings of $1.85 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.41, delivering a surprise of +30.27%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Gartner appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Russia has said it will not accept an oil price cap.GREEK RELIEFGreek-owned ships run by Greek management firms handled at least 21 voyages of Russian crude in January to a range of destinations.The Greek shipping companies included TMS Tankers Management, Stealth Maritime, Kyklades Maritime, Dynacom, Delta Tankers, NGM Energy and New Shipping, according to Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking and shipping sources.Story continuesNGM said its tanker, the Ace, had discharged crude oil in Bulgaria.""Any oil shipments for outside the EU performed post Dec. 5 are permitted and authorised by the EU as they comply with the G7 price cap mechanism,"" a company official said via email.""In all circumstances we ensure compliance per EU regulations with the use of external independent third party legal counsel to vet all legal documents,"" the official added.The other companies did not respond to requests for comment on the specific voyages.The Karolos tanker, managed by Dynacom, loaded Russian crude at Russia's Baltic port of Ust-Luga in January and is due to discharge the oil in Sikka, India by Feb. 3, according to Eikon ship tracking.Similarly the Lovina, managed by TMS Tankers, loaded crude at Russia's Primorsk port in January and is also sailing to India.Late in December Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a decree banning the supply of crude and refined products from Feb. 1 for five months to nations abiding by the cap.On Monday Moscow released the legal framework backing this decree that includes a ban on deliveries to foreign entities involved in any price limits, and a ban on the inclusion of any price cap mechanism in contracts.(Reporting by Moscow reporters; Additional reporting by Jonathan Saul, Noah Browning and Julia Payne in London; Editing by Jan Harvey)]"

Three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. We have Lucid, Exxon, and Peloton. Starting it off with Lucid, it's the top-trending ticker on Yahoo Finance. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas making the case that Lucid stock is heading lower and that the fundamental outlook is quote, ""more likely deteriorating than improving"". One thing that has Jonas worried is Tesla's price cuts.He's saying that's because he thinks it could lead to a drop in Lucid reservations. And that's not all demand for its higher priced cars. That could suffer given the current economic environment and the rising rate environment right now. Fed's expected to raise rates again tomorrow.Now when it comes to Lucid's relationship with Saudi Arabia's public investment fund, Jonas noted that the relationship between the two could quote, ""extend beyond a controlling shareholder status"", and that guidance and support from Saudi Arabia will quote, ""potentially enhance Lucid's long-term infrastructure and supply chain development.""Now Ines, he does have an underweight rating on the stock, thinking it could fall substantially further than it is today. And of course, this is contrary to kind of the rally that we saw in Lucid following that report about the fact that Saudi Arabia could potentially buy out the remaining stake in Lucid. So I think there's big question marks out on the street just in terms of what this company is going to look like over the next couple of quarters.INES FERRE: Yeah, and how much they'll be able to produce going forward, but also that rally that you mentioned. I had reached out to an analyst that talked about the short interest on the stock that was over 20% short interest. So you were seeing a huge short squeeze with that headline.

64,9a60b3b0-7460-35f5-8b2f-38065fb21057,OMC,2023-02-01,Omnicom (OMC) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q4 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/omnicom-omc-expected-beat-earnings-150103496.html,1675177263,STORY,['OMC'],"[Omnicom (OMC) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 7, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis advertising company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.94 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -0.5%.Revenues are expected to be $3.69 billion, down 4.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Omnicom?For Omnicom, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.75%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Omnicom will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Omnicom would post earnings of $1.64 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.77, delivering a surprise of +7.93%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Omnicom appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE: FE), recently broke ground on a new operations service center in North Jackson, Mahoning County, to help streamline operations and maximize efficiencies along the local high-voltage power system.FirstEnergy Corp. Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)The nearly 20,000-square-foot facility, located within Ohio Edison's service area, will provide company personnel with direct access to heavy-duty transmission equipment and materials to help enhance electric service reliability and minimize the impact of service disruptions for customers in the area.""This facility will benefit customers by providing quicker access to resources for our transmission personnel in the event of a service-related issue,"" said Jim Gatto, manager of Ohio's transmission operations at FirstEnergy. ""Transmission personnel were previously scattered at various service centers across our entire northeast Ohio service area, causing a slower response to issues in the North Jackson area since crews were coming from work sites in Kinsman, Alliance and Massillon.""When finished, the building will serve as a central location for nearly a dozen transmission line workers based in the Mahoning Valley area. The new center, situated on 10 acres along Bailey Court East, will also include offices and storage space for other utility personnel.In addition to the service center, the project includes construction of a 15,000-square-foot storage facility next to the service center that will be used to house large transmission equipment, including transformers, power lines, insulators and more. Construction of both facilities are on track to be completed in the late spring.ATSI provides transmission services in Ohio and in the western portion of Pennsylvania and owns or maintains more than 8,100 miles of transmission lines, substations and other facilities.FirstEnergy is dedicated to integrity, safety, reliability and operational excellence. Its 10 electric distribution companies form one of the nation's largest investor-owned electric systems, serving customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and New York.

Both metrics declined year over year. Results were hurt by the ongoing challenging environment and sluggish demand from rising inflation. The headwinds are likely to recover in the second half of fiscal 2023. Consequently, management issued the 2023 view.Shares of the company have gained 11.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 13.5% growth. We also note that shares of WHR jumped more than 2% after the trading session on Jan 30. This might be owing to the earnings beat in the quarter under review.Notably, management concluded the strategic review of EMEA. As part of this, the company’s European major domestic appliance business will form a new entity with Arçelik. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2023. The company announced the successful buyout of InSinkErator, which has had no material impact on Q4 results. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Insight Into Q4The appliance maker delivered adjusted earnings of $3.89 per share, declining 37% from $6.14 in the year-ago quarter. However, the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.23 and our estimate of $3.23.Net sales of $4,923 million dropped 15.3% from the year-ago quarter. The top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,047 million and our estimate of $5,254.2 million. Excluding the unfavorable impacts of foreign exchange, net sales amounted to $5,059 million, down 13% year over year. The downside is mainly due to a one-off supply disruption in North America and drab demand, which somewhat offset favorable price/mix.The gross profit for fourth-quarter 2022 was $645 million, down 39.3% from $1,063 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Ongoing EBIT of $171 million declined 66% from $502 million in the year-ago quarter. The ongoing EBIT margin of 3.5% contracted 510 bps year over year.Story continuesRegional PerformancesNet sales for the North America segment decreased 13.6% year over year to $2,874 million. Excluding the currency impact, sales in the region dropped 13%. The segment’s EBIT plunged 67.1% year over year to $166 million, while the EBIT margin contracted 950 bps to 5.8% due to elevated cost inflation and one-off supply-chain disruption.Net sales for the EMEA segment were down 27.2% year over year to $1,028 million. Excluding currency impacts, sales in the region dipped 18.1%. The metric was hurt by drab demand in key countries. The segment’s EBIT was at a loss of $4 million compared with the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $20 million due to lower volume, cost inflation and unfavorable currency, which offset cost-based pricing actions.Net sales from Latin America remained flat year over year to $831 million, owing to a sequential demand rise in Mexico and Brazil, which offset cost-based pricing efforts. Excluding the currency impacts, sales in the region fell 3.1%. The segment’s EBIT of $49 million declined 12.5% from the year-ago period’s $56 million. The EBIT margin contracted 80 bps to 5.9%, mainly affected by inflation, somewhat offset by cost-saving efforts.Net sales in Asia fell 22.1% year over year to $219 million mainly due to muted consumer demand, which was partly offset by cost-based pricing. Excluding the currency impacts, sales for the region were down 15.9%. The segment’s EBIT of $6 million reflected a 65% plunge from the $17 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The segment’s EBIT margin of 2.7% contracted 320 bps from the prior-year quarter, driven by cost inflation and a top-line decline.Other Financial DetailsAs of Dec 31, 2022, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company had cash and cash equivalents of $1,958 million, long-term debt of $7,363 million and a stockholders’ equity of $2,336 million, excluding non-controlling interests of $170 million.As of Dec 31, 2022, Whirlpool provided cash of $1,390 million from operating activities. It reported a free cash flow of $820 million. WHR incurred a capital expenditure of $570 million in the same period. Notably, capital expenditure is likely to be $600 million for 2022.The company returned $1.3 billion in cash to shareholders with $900 million in share repurchases.Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseWhirlpool Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteOutlookFor 2023, Whirlpool envisions a net sales decline of 1-2% to $19.4 billion. On a GAAP and ongoing basis, Whirlpool expects earnings per share of $16-$18. Management anticipates a tax rate of 14-16% on a GAAP basis and adjusted basis. For 2023, Whirlpool expects cash used in operating activities of $1.4 billion and a free cash flow of $800 million.That said, management is on track with its cost takeout actions and expects $800 to $900 million related to gains from the aforementioned measures and eased raw material inflation.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are PVH Corp PVH, Oxford Industries OXM and Ralph Lauren RL.PVH Corp currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(VFC) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-v-f-vfc-150003546.html,1675177203,STORY,"['RL', 'VFC']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when V.F. (VFC) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 7, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of brands such as Vans, North Face and Timberland is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.99 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -26.7%.Revenues are expected to be $3.48 billion, down 4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for V.F.For V.F.The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +5.79%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that V.F. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that V.F. Would post earnings of $0.74 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.73, delivering a surprise of -1.35%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.V.F. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Textile - Apparel industry, Ralph Lauren (RL), is soon expected to post earnings of $2.91 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.75 billion, down 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Ralph Lauren has been revised 1.6% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -1.35%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ralph Lauren will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Moody’s was recognized for championing gender equality in its workplace and in the global business community.""Gender equality is a crucial component of our work culture and business strategy that enables us to create better value for our people, customers, and shareholders,"" said Francisco Martinez-Garcia, Chief Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion Officer at Moody’s. ""Our culture embraces courageous conversations on an array of topics, including diversity. We use those insights to expand our policies, benefits, and talent programs to build a workforce where women and other diverse groups can ascend into leadership positions and impact every aspect of our business.""Moody’s implements a wide range of programs to advance gender equality in its workplace and communities. Its employee initiatives aim to advance women into leadership positions and ease the transition for working mothers re-entering the workforce. Moody’s community efforts also provide women entrepreneurs with resources, tools, and guidance to help them grow their small businesses.Additionally, Moody’s publishes research and insights on gender, including the 2022 ""Breaking the Bias"" report, which outlined the importance of gender equality in transforming economies, finance, and business. The report identified $22 billion in 2021 bond issuance linked to projects tied to achieving gender equality and female empowerment. It also found that if policies like paid family leave, childcare subsidies, and universal pre-kindergarten could increase U.S. women’s workforce participation to match that of other developed nations, U.S. GDP would increase by $1 trillion over the following decade.The Bloomberg GEI is a weighted reference index that measures and tracks the performance of public companies across five pillars: leadership and talent, equal pay and gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and external brand. The index is designed to help investors direct capital to companies committed to supporting gender equality through proactive policies and transparency.Story continuesThe GEI recognition underscores Moody’s contribution to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5 on gender equality in the United Nations’ 2030 agenda.For more information on Moody’s sustainability efforts, please visit www.moodys.com/sustainability.ABOUT MOODY’S CORPORATIONMoody’s (NYSE: MCO) is a global integrated risk assessment firm that empowers organizations to make better decisions.

The bottom line, however, plunged 31% from the year-ago quarter figure.Shares of the company have gained 1.8% in pre-market trading. This is largely driven by encouraging quarterly performance and upbeat 2023 guidance.Lower operating expenses and Moody’s Analytics segment’s solid performance support Moody’s results. The company’s liquidity position was robust during the quarter. Yet, subdued issuance volume was a major headwind, which hurt Moody’s top line.After taking into consideration certain non-recurring items, net income attributable to Moody's was $246 million or $1.34 per share, down from $427 million or $2.28 per share in the prior-year quarter.In 2022, adjusted earnings per share of $8.57 declined 30% year over year but surpassed the consensus estimate of $8.39.

The top line, however, declined 16% year over year. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenues by 3%.In 2022, revenues decreased 12% year over year to $5.47 billion. The top line, nonetheless, beat the consensus estimate of $5.43 billion.Total expenses were $984 million, down 4%.Adjusted operating income of $477 million was down 12%. Adjusted operating margin was 37%, down from 38.3% a year ago.Mixed Segment Performance in the QuarterMoody’s Investors Service revenues plunged 34% year over year to $576 million. The fall was mainly due to muted capital market activities. Foreign currency translation affected the segment’s revenues by 2%.Moody’s Analytics revenues grew 7% to $714 million. This was mainly driven by the steady demand for Know Your Customer solutions and credit research. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted the segment’s revenues by 5%.Story continuesStrong Balance SheetAs of Dec 31, 2022, Moody’s had total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.86 billion, down from $1.9 billion as of Dec 31, 2021.The company had $7.4 billion in outstanding debt and $1.25 billion in additional borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility.Capital Deployment UpdateDuring the quarter, Moody's did not repurchase any shares.Moody’s announced a quarterly cash dividend of 77 cents per share, representing a 10% hike from the prior payout.

This compares to earnings of $2.33 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 12.68%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this credit ratings agency would post earnings of $2.01 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.85, delivering a surprise of -7.96%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Moody's , which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, posted revenues of $1.29 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.97%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.54 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Moody's shares have added about 12.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.6%.What's Next for Moody's?While Moody's has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Moody's: mixed.

PG&amp;E knows that's a challenge for many customers and is sharing why bills are higher and how the company is supporting its customers.Understanding Higher Natural Gas BillsThe increased cost of natural gas on the West Coast and colder-than-normal temperatures are causing higher energy bills. Gas price increases this winter have been driven by higher demand and tighter supplies in California, Oregon and Washington, as customers use more natural gas for heating during colder temperatures. Power plants are also using more natural gas to meet electricity demand. More cold and dry weather is expected this week with daytime highs forecast below normal and chilly overnight lows in PG&amp;E's service area.Like other utility companies, PG&amp;E does not control the market prices it pays for gas and electricity nor does PG&amp;E mark up the cost of the energy it purchases on behalf of its customers.As of January 25, PG&amp;E projects that residential combined-use gas and electricity bills will be about 32% higher from November to March, compared to the same months last winter. Bills for individual customers vary based on factors including how much energy they use. However, if gas prices fall and weather warms, bill impacts could be less severe.Why natural gas prices are upNatural gas prices change daily and have been much higher on the West Coast than the rest of the country since November. Between January 19 and 25, California's average daily prices were five times higher than the U.S. benchmark prices and those in New York and Chicago, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Colder temperatures in the West have caused customers to turn up the thermostat and use more energy. PG&amp;E customers have used more natural gas this winter than the past five-year historic average, with November usage 20% higher, December 10% higher, and January to date about 3% higher.Story continuesBill relief from California Climate CreditPG&amp;E is actively engaging with federal and state regulators, policymakers, and lawmakers on ways to provide bill relief.The California Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to vote February 2 on issuing the annual April Climate Credit earlier this year, a proposal that PG&amp;E supports. Part of the state's efforts to fight climate change, the credit is administered by PG&amp;E and other California utilities. Residential customers who receive both gas and electric services from PG&amp;E would receive a total bill credit of $91.17.Separately, more than 300,000 customers who experienced financial hardships during the pandemic will receive an automatic one-time bill credit before Feb. 3 under the California Arrearage Payment Program. Customers do not need to apply for the credit and amounts will vary.How PG&amp;E is working to reduce costsPG&amp;E uses three key strategies to help moderate the impact of dynamic natural gas pricing on its customers:Accessing the lowest-priced gas from three gas production basins.Withdrawing gas from underground gas storage when demand and prices increase.Using financial hedging products to lock in lower prices.PG&amp;E is also acting to stabilize customers' bills in the long term, with a goal of keeping increases at or below assumed inflation. PG&amp;E is working to reduce or offset investment costs in its energy system. The company generated more than $970 million by selling licensing agreements to wireless providers to attach equipment to transmission towers. It's also undergrounding powerlines to reduce recurring maintenance costs and pursuing federal funding to offset some costs of making the energy system safer and more climate resilient.Here are three tools that customers can use now to manage winter bills:Keep bills predictable. Level out monthly payments and offset high seasonal bills with Budget Billing, a free tool that averages your annual energy costs to help manage monthly bills.Flexible payment arrangements. Extend your bill due date or make a payment arrangement. Access your online account for details.Customers may also qualify for financial assistance programs including the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), a federally-funded assistance program overseen by the state that offers one-time residential utility bill payment.Here are three ways customers can lower energy use to save money:Dial down your thermostat. You can save about 2% of your heating bill for each degree that you lower the thermostat (if the turndown lasts a good part of the day or night). Turning down from 70 to 65 degrees, for example, saves about 10%.Lower your water heater temperature. By setting your water heater temperature to 120 degrees Fahrenheit you can reduce the amount of energy it takes to produce and maintain hot water.Keep areas around vents open. Furniture and carpet can block heating vents, which makes heating systems work harder and prevents rooms from heating quickly.About PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

Per the latest Earnings Preview, quarterly results have been dull year over year, reflecting the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and record level of inflationary pressure worldwide. Going by the sector’s scorecard, 8.9% of the companies in the Medical sector, constituting 28.4% of the sector’s market capitalization, reported earnings till Jan 25. Of these, 80% beat earnings estimates and 20% beat the same for revenues. Earnings increased 5% year over year on 7% higher revenues.Overall, fourth-quarter earnings of the Medical sector are expected to plunge 10.9% on a 2.9% revenue decrease. This compares with the third-quarter reported earnings decline of 3.3% on revenue growth of 5.1%.The projection reflects the ongoing global inflationary pressure leading to an extremely tough situation related to raw material and labor cost as well as freight charges, which have put the industry in a tight spot again. The majority of the players within this space have witnessed mounting raw material costs and other expense pressure through the Q4 months. Added to this, labor-supply constraints with rising labor costs and global supply-chain hazards are expected to have moderated the growth process.Medical Device Quarterly SynopsysIntegral to the broader Medical sector, medical device or the Zacks-defined Medical Products companies’ collective business growth is likely to have displayed improvement compared with the last year, with a significant reduction in COVID-led severity across the United States and other developed countries. Through the Q4 months, new waves of coronavirus spread rapidly across various developed and emerging nations. Yet, the companies’ successful addressing of a couple of years’ pent-up demand is likely to have led to higher year-over-year growth within the legacy base businesses of the industry players.Also, diagnostic testing companies might have shown a sequential rise in testing demand, thanks to rising new cases in select geographies, leading to business growth for many companies.Story continuesOverall, the legacy base business recovery and testing demand of the companies through the months of the fourth quarter are expected to have been impressive. Medical device companies like Boston Scientific BSX, Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO, Hologic HOLX and Align Technology ALGN are likely to have been positively influenced by these factors in Q4.However, as discussed earlier, replicating the market-wide trend, this sector’s Q4 results are likely to be significantly dampened by the ongoing macroeconomic threat in the United States and outside. Despite the reopening of the economy, the vicious cycle of deteriorating inflationary situation along with aggressive rate hikes has put the global investment scenario in a tighter spot again. Within medical device, going by the industry-wide trend so far, logistical challenges and increasing unit costs have been heavily weighing on the corporate profitability of the stocks across the board. On the other hand, the tightened monetary policy is starkly altering consumer preferences and once again, demand for the non-essential category line of medical device businesses is on the back foot.This might have, in a way, shrunk the companies’ revenues in Q4 compared to the prior quarter.Let's take a look at three MedTech players scheduled to announce results on Feb 1.Boston Scientific: Boston Scientific expects fourth-quarter 2022 operational revenue growth in the range of 8.5% to 10.5% year over year. This excludes an approximate 650-basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on rates during the Q3 earnings release. Meanwhile, BSX’s top line is likely to have improved year over year, with non-COVID elective medical procedures running in a full-fledged way in the United States and elsewhere across the globe. Given the improving scenario along with an innovative pipeline, expansion into faster growth markets, globalization efforts and enhanced digital capabilities, Boston Scientific is well-positioned to register decent fourth-quarter 2022 results.(Read more: Will Boston Scientific Beat Q4 Earnings Estimates?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $3.24 billion for the fourth quarter suggests a 3.6% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.

The company advanced its Orbitrap portfolio, launching the Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid mass spectrometer.

During the fourth-quarter earnings update, Hologic noted that the company has nearly 3,250 Panthers instruments placed globally. Its performance might have been driven by both legacy and new assays, namely the BBCVTV vaginitis panel, MGen, CTMG and its respiratory menu on the Panther Fusion. However, with COVID testing significantly down over the past few months, Hologic’s Molecular Diagnostics business is likely to have been impacted by lower COVID-related sales.(Read more: Hologic to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hologic’s fiscal first-quarter revenues is pegged at $980.9 million, which implies a decline of 33.3% from the year-ago figure.

You can try it here.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureBut there’s a catch: It’s not entirely reliable yet. In testing so far, 26% of AI-written texts were flagged as “likely AI-written,” while human-written text was incorrectly labeled as AI-written 9% of the time. The tool proved more effective on chunks of texts longer than 1,000 words, but even then the results were quite iffy.OpenAI defended the tool’s flaws as part of the process, saying they released it at this stage of development “to get feedback on whether imperfect tools like this one are useful.”What is ChatGPT?Made by OpenAI, which also made the text-to-image generator DALL-E, chatbot ChatGPT has become a talking point since it was launched as a prototype in November 2022. Microsoft, which has pumped in tens of millions into the company, could reportedly use it to advance its Bing search engine.Applications of the tool stand to benefit various professions and endevors. The dialogue-based artificial intelligence (AI) tool helps real estate agents create online listings, students churn out essays, and developers write code, among other things.OpenAI’s classifier can’t be used to prevent cheating in schoolsOne of the biggest concerns about ChatGPT is its application for cheating in school exams. Some institutions have started blocking ChatGPT on their devices and networks. OpenAI released its AI-identifying tool to partially address those issues.“We recognise that many school districts and higher education institutions do not currently account for generative AI in their policies on academic dishonesty. We also understand that many students have used these tools for assignments without disclosing their use of AI,” the company has acknowledged.Story continuesUnfortunately for these institutions, the AI text classifier is “far from foolproof” and can’t be used to detect plagiarism, OpenAI warned. Not only can it misclassify AI text as human writing and vice versa, students could also learn to dodge the system by modifying some words or clauses in the generated content.For now, educators have to encourage students to be more honest and transparent about their use of the chatbot.A non-exhaustive list of OpenAI’s text classifier’s limitations🗣 It really only works on English text. In other languages and code, it is even less accurate.💬 Predictable text such as a list of prime minister, which would largely be the same whether a human or bot wrote it, cannot be picked up by the classifier.⏳ The detection may be ephemeral given that AI-written text can be edited to evade the classifier.❌ For inputs that are very different from text in the AI’s training set, which ends in 2021 and likely can’t handle very complex asks, the classifier could confidently answer incorrectly.Tool of interest: GPTZeroA 22-year-old developer, Edward Tian, wrote an app to sniff out text generated by ChatGPT and launched it on Jan. 3. The Princeton University student, who is months away from graduating, based his detection system on analysing two factors: perplexity, which refers to randomness in the text, and burstiness, which refers to variations in sentence formulations.Taking in feedback from educators, Tian added more nuance to the tool, which can now identify a mix of AI and human text, and highlights portions of text that are most likely to be AI generated. The team of four engineers working on the system also built a pipeline to handle file batch uploads in PDF, Word, and .txt format so educators can run multiple files through GPTZero at once.Related stories🎨 The best examples of DALL-E 2’s strange, beautiful AI art💸 Microsoft makes its third multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI🌐 Microsoft is expanding access to its AI toolkit, including ChatGPTMore from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

With inflation steadily easing, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell might further lower the magnitude of the rate hike. Economists are eyeing a quarter basis point increase in the benchmark interest rate.Despite cooling inflation, market pundits continue to see headwinds in the form of softness in consumer spending. Also, geopolitical turbulence as well as higher borrowing costs might just push the economy into a likely recession.So, the question is how to refine the portfolio to endure any unprecedented circumstances. Well, apply a holistic approach. Look for stocks that are fundamentally sound and offer security as well as resilience with long-term upside potential.Here's an Investing TipWe always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless blessed with Midas touch. When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that have good things going on for them, even at a time when they have been beaten down by some external factors.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis — the lower the number, the better. Signet Jewelers Limited SIG, NRG Energy, Inc. NRG, ACCO Brands Corporation ACCO and Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL boast a low P/CF ratio.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial HealthQuestions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesWhat’s the Best Strategy?An investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and also consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the eight stocks that qualified the screening:Signet, the world's largest retailer of diamond jewelry, sports a Zacks Rank #1. It has an expected EPS growth rate of 8% for three-five years. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Signet has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 44.8%, on average. SIG has a Value Score of B.

(NASDAQ:WBA) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.48 per share on the 10th of March. Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 5.2%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance Walgreens Boots Alliance's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. The company is paying out a large amount of its cash flows, even though it isn't generating any profit. These payout levels would generally be quite difficult to keep up.According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio will be 38%, which makes us pretty comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendWalgreens Boots Alliance Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.90 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.92. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 7.9% a year over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Over the past five years, it looks as though Walgreens Boots Alliance's EPS has declined at around 11% a year. Dividend payments are likely to come under some pressure unless EPS can pull out of the nosedive it is in. On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable.Story continuesThe Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Walgreens Boots Alliance's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Just as an example, we've come across 2 warning signs for Walgreens Boots Alliance you should be aware of, and 1 of them doesn't sit too well with us.

So before you make your next drugstore haul, see if Dollar Tree has what you need first. To help, here are seven common drugstore items to buy at Dollar Tree, recommended by consumer experts.Eva-Katalin / Getty ImagesLip Balm""If you're in need of some lip balm, Dollar Tree is a good place to look for name brands like Blistex,"" said consumer analyst Julie Ramhold with DealNews.""There may only be one flavor to choose from -- I only saw cherry -- but if you don't care about that and just want the benefits of the balm, this is a good drugstore purchase you can make at Dollar Tree for less. Drugstores will charge around $1.79 or more for a single tube of Blistex but Dollar Tree has it for just $1.25.""Take Our Poll: Are You in Favor of More Inflation Relief in 2023?Oleksandra Liedovska / Getty Images/iStockphotoTravel-Size Deodorants""You'll be limited to brands like Speed Stick, Lady Speed Stick, Suave and Secret with potential for other brands available at different stores, but sizes range from 0.5 oz to 1.8 oz and are approved for both carry-on and checked luggage when flying,"" said Ramhold. ""Drugstores will charge at least $1.89 for travel-sized deodorant, but Dollar Tree has various types for $1.25 each.""bojanstory / Getty ImagesKleenex Go-Packs""These are great to keep on hand any time of year, but especially during cold and flu season, Ramhold said.""Dollar Tree has 3-count packs (that's 30 Kleenex total) for just $1.25. Elsewhere, drugstores tend to charge about $2.29 for basically the same thing. You may be able to find them cheaper online. For example, CVS had a 6-count pack of these for just $2 on sale when I checked, but it was also available online only in my area. If you're in the same boat, then you may have to spend $5.49 or more for shipping, unless you place a larger order for $35 to get free shipping, and by then, it's probably not worth all the trouble when you could just pop down to Dollar Tree and pick up a 3-count pack for $1.25.""Story continuesDUSAN ZIDAR / Shutterstock.comTravel Toothpaste""Dollar Tree has a couple of different kinds typically available that range in size from 2 oz to 2.7 oz, but they all cost just $1.25 each,"" said Ramhold.""If you're looking for travel toothpaste at drugstores, you can expect to pay at least $1.39 and for a smaller amount overall -- that particular size was 0.88 oz but I also saw 0.85 oz tubes for $1.69, and other tubes were even more expensive.""olhakozachenko / Getty Images/iStockphotoCotton Rounds""For disposable products, like cotton rounds, consider cheaper options that will save you money and get you the same results,"" said Rebecca Gramuglia, consumer expert at TopCashback.""Dollar Tree offers an 80-count of cotton rounds for $1.25, while CVS Pharmacy sells an 80-count for $4.19. So if you're in need of this basic bathroom staple, shopping at the dollar store saves you close to $3.""metinkiyak / Getty Images/iStockphotoHair Accessories""Small items, like hair ties, can get lost easily, so stocking up on them at a discount is a good idea,"" Gramuglia said.""You can score a 20-count pack of elastic hair ties from Dollar Tree for $1.25. CVS Pharmacy, on the other hand, offers a similar 18-count pack of elastic hair ties for $3.59. To save over $2 on this often-lost item, shop at Dollar Tree instead.""JohnnyGreig / Getty ImagesReading Glasses""Whether they're to help you read a menu at a restaurant or enjoy a calm evening with a good book, reading glasses are a staple necessity for many,"" said Gramuglia.""Typically, you can score a multipack of them at your local drugstore for less than $20. For example, Walgreens offers a 3-pack of reading glasses for $17.99 total. To save money, however, you can score individual pairs of various strengths for $1.25 each at Dollar Tree. So for the same price as Walgreens' three-pack, you can get over 10 pairs of reading glasses at Dollar Tree -- one for every occasion!""More From GOBankingRatesExperts: Here's How Much You Should Have in Your Checking AccountExplore GOBankingRates' 2023 Banking Resource CenterThe 10 Best Credit Cards for 2023Here's How To Build a 6-Month Emergency FundThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 7 Common Drugstore Items To Buy at Dollar Tree Instead]"

96,5a090984-5ec6-3ee9-a0e7-1a03cfdfa06b,SBUX,2023-02-01,Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chipotle-mexican-grill-cmg-reports-150003172.html,1675177203,STORY,"['CMG', 'SBUX']","[The market expects Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 7, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis Mexican food chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $8.90 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +59.5%.Revenues are expected to be $2.23 billion, up 13.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.54% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Chipotle?For Chipotle, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.24%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Chipotle will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Chipotle would post earnings of $9.11 per share when it actually produced earnings of $9.51, delivering a surprise of +4.39%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Chipotle doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, Starbucks (SBUX), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.76 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +5.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $8.79 billion, up 9.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Starbucks has been revised 0.9% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 1.81%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Starbucks will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $0.57 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -3.61%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this food distributor would post earnings of $0.99 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.97, delivering a surprise of -2.02%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Sysco , which belongs to the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, posted revenues of $18.59 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.74%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $16.32 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Sysco shares have added about 2.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.6%.What's Next for Sysco?While Sysco has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Sysco: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.96 on $18.67 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.14 on $76.5 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Food - Miscellaneous is currently in the top 25% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Lancaster Colony (LANC), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022. The results are expected to be released on February 2.This specialty food maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +20.8%.

106,f51da2ee-426d-3cff-b45d-df40c41e3b38,ADM,2023-02-01,"ADM (ADM) Loses -11.42% in 4 Weeks, Here's Why a Trend Reversal May be Around the Corner",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adm-adm-loses-11-42-143502754.html,1675175702,STORY,['ADM'],"[Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) has been on a downward spiral lately with significant selling pressure. After declining 11.4% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.Guide to Identifying Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why a Trend Reversal is Due for ADMThe RSI reading of 27.33 for ADM is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.3-month RSI Chart for ADMThis technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering ADM in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 4.5% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, ADM currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

108,35bb0bf7-c312-35c3-a096-2bbcbf948488,ADM,2023-02-01,5 Stocks That Investors Are Loving Post Upgrade by Brokers,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-investors-loving-post-121912233.html,1675167552,STORY,['ADM'],"[The Q4 earnings season is slowly picking up pace with companies from multiple industries reporting their financial numbers. With results from more than 28%of S&amp;P 500 participants already out, the season is off to a decent start, with earnings beats from quite a few players.Investors will be hoping that the momentum continues and a high proportion of companies report better-than-expected numbers. This is because, generally, an earnings beat by a company leads to an uptick in its stock price. Given this backdrop, investors will like to add outperformers to their portfolios for healthy returns.Nonetheless, the task is far from easy with a plethora of companies present in the market. Apart from this, the complexities related to the stock market and the surrounding uncertainties make it even more difficult for individual investors to select outperformers in their portfolios without proper guidance.This clearly suggests that one needs to have in-depth knowledge of the minute details of the investing space. This is quite impossible for individual investors. Consequently, advice of “experts” in this field is much sought after by investors. The experts in the field of investing are brokers. We believe that investors bet on broker-favorite stocks like American Airlines AAL, Delta Air Lines DAL, Cleveland-Cliff CLF, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. ANFand Archer Daniels Midland Company ADM for healthy returns.Why Broker Advice Holds Value?Brokers scrutinize publicly available financial documents, and also attend company conference calls and other presentations. Since brokers recommend (buy, sell or hold) a stock after thoroughly analyzing the nitty-gritty associated with the company, it is then perfect for investors to be guided by their direction of estimate revisions while deciding their course of action on a particular stock.The estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock. In fact, a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation. Similarly, the price of a stock may plummet following a rating downgrade. Estimates can move north for a number of reasons, including a favorable earnings performance, bullish guidance, product launch or an optimistic macro scenario.  To take care of the earnings performance, we designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendations and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Story continuesWinning StrategyThe above write-up clearly suggests that one can arrive at a winning portfolio of stocks by following broker actions. Keeping this in mind, we designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendations and upward revisions in earnings estimates over the last four weeks.Also, since the price/sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information, it is taken into consideration. The price/sales ratio takes care of the company’s top line, making the strategy foolproof.Screening Criteria# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75: This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks.% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10: This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter.To ensure that the strategy is a winning one, covering all bases, we have added the following screening parameters:Price-to-Sales = Bot%10: The lower the ratio, the better. Companies meeting this criterion are in bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio.Price greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors.Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization.Com/ADR/Canadian= Com: This takes out the ADR and Canadian stocks.Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, TX. The gradual increase in air-travel demand (particularly for leisure) is aiding AAL. However, high fuel costs are hurting the bottom line.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AAL’s 2023 earnings has been revised 21.3% upward. American Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

DAL is being bolstered by an uptick in demand for air travel (particularly for leisure). High fuel costs are, however, a bane.Delta’s earnings outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters and missed the mark in the remaining two quarters, with the average negative surprise being 0.09%.Cleveland-Cliffs is a leading iron ore producer in the United States. It supplies differentiated iron ore pellets under long-term contracts to major blast furnace steel producers in North America. The Mining and Pelletizing operation gains from low-cost, high-quality iron ore pellet production with substantial logistics and transportation advantages to serve the Great Lakes steel market. The company should gain from its merger with AK Steel Holding Corporation.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CLF’s 2023 earnings has been revised 101% upward. Cleveland-Cliffs currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.Abercrombie &amp; Fitch operates as a specialty retailer of premium, high-quality casual apparel for men, women and kids through a network of approximately 850 stores across North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.The company stated recently that its brands performed well in the holiday season. Abercrombie, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2, is working toward rationalizing its store base by reducing dependence on underperforming tourist-driven locations. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has skyrocketed 200% over the past 60 days. ADM currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.Archer Daniels: This Chicago, IL-based leading agricultural products player’s leadership in key global trends like flexitarian diets, nutrition and sustainable materials is a contributor to its momentum. ADM’s focus on making investments in assets and technological capabilities to serve customers efficiently is likely to be a key driver.Archer Daniels’ Readiness program, positive cash flow and solid performance at the Nutrition unit are aiding results.

The outage was a boost to consumer protection activists.Blumenthal predicted airlines would mobilize an army of lobbyists to fight the proposals despite having received $54 billion in government assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic.""They come into this moment with reduced power,"" he told reporters in a phone call, adding airlines ""have lost a lot of credibility"" by opposing new consumer protections.Airlines for America, a group representing major airlines, said the ""proposed policies in this bill – instituting government-controlled pricing, establishing a private right of action and dictating private sector contracts – would drastically decrease competition, leading to a subsequent increase in airfare.""In the past airlines have succeeded in defeating consumer protections proposed by lawmakers. Congress in September 2018 dropped plans to mandate ""reasonable and proportional"" baggage and change fees"" in the face of heavy lobbying.Story continuesA group of U.S. House of Representatives lawmakers also introduced the FAIR act which they said in a statement would ""prohibit airlines from charging unreasonable fees... not proportional to the costs of the service actually provided.""Lawmakers want to require airlines to provide ticket refunds and alternative transportation, including for instance seats on other air carriers, for flights delayed between one and four hours.The bills would direct the Transportation Department (DOT) to facilitate interline agreements between airlines to ensure availability of alternative flights. Southwest Airlines does not have such agreements.The bills would requires airlines to disclose ""true costs of flying"" and offer lowest fares on multi-segment flights and allow passengers to sue airlines for unfair and deceptive practices.They would eliminate a cap on fines that DOT charges airlines for violating consumer protection laws and prevent ""airlines from negotiating low, slap-on-the wrist fines for egregious conduct.""In August, a bipartisan group of 36 state attorneys general said states and federal agencies should have new powers to investigate airline passengers' complaints and complained DOT had not done enough to hold airlines accountable.

DAL kick started the fourth-quarter earnings season for the airline space. Overall, the season has been mixed for the industry. The sector still has a way to go before it can reach the pre-pandemic level.However, the pureplay airlines ETF U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS has gained 23% past month (as of Jan 27, 2022). In fact, the fund beat the S&amp;P 500 (up 7.3%) in the past one-month period.This makes JETS a great bet to make the most of recovery in airline industry. Still, we need to pay attention to the earnings picture of the industry. Let’s delve a little deeper.Inside the HeadlinesOn Jan 13, Delta Air Lines DAL kick-started the fourth-quarter 2022 earnings season for the airline space. This Atlanta-based carrier reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues. Delta’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 19 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.48 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29 per share.DAL reported earnings of 22 cents per share a year ago, dull in comparison to the current scenario, as air-travel demand was not so buoyant then. Delta reported revenues of $13,435 million, which also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,030.3 million.United Airlines Holdings, Inc. UAL reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2022 results, wherein earnings and revenues outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Quarterly earnings of $2.46 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07. In the year-ago quarter, UAL incurred a loss of $1.60 per share when air-travel demand was not as buoyant as in the current scenario. The fourth quarter of 2022 was the third consecutive profitable quarter at UAL since the onset of the pandemic. Operating revenues of $12,400 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,230 million.JetBlue Airways’ JBLU fourth-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 15 cents from non-recurring items) of 22 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents. Results were aided by strong air-travel demand. In the year-ago quarter, JBLU incurred a loss of 36 cents per share. Operating revenues of $2,415 million climbed 31.68% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,407.5 million. The double-digit year-over-year jump reflects improving air-travel demand.Story continuesAlaska Air Group Inc. ALK reported mixed fourth-quarter 2022 results, wherein earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same. Quarterly earnings of 92 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents. The bottom line surged more than 100% year over year. Operating revenues of $2,479 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,504.4 million.American Airlines’ AAL fourth-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 3 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.17 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share despite higher costs. In the year-ago quarter, AAL incurred a loss of $1.42 per share. Operating revenues of $13,189 million increased 39.9% year over year, reflecting upbeat air-travel demand. However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,218.7 million.Southwest Airlines Co. LUV reported fourth-quarter 2022 loss of 38 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 3 cents. In the year-ago reported quarter, LUV had reported earnings of 14 cents per share. Revenues of $6,172 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,270.9 million but improved 22.2% year over year.ETF JETS in FocusThe $2.15-billion-fund JETS holds about 30 stocks in its portfolio and is concentrated on a few individual securities. All the above-mentioned stocks get a place in the portfolio. The product charges 60 bps in fees.Bottom LineWhile the earnings picture is yet to improve fully, some companies beat on estimates. This shows a ray of hope for faster recovery in the coming days. If there is a steady improvement in the coronavirus scenario globally, one can surely see a jump in this otherwise-undervalued product JETS. Rise in energy prices is still a concern.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

116,91abf131-ead8-3191-99b9-1b8d9cdbc10d,TDG,2023-02-01,TransDigm Group (TDG) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/transdigm-group-tdg-reports-next-150003164.html,1675177203,STORY,['TDG'],"[The market expects TransDigm Group (TDG) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 7, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis aircraft components maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.31 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +43.7%.Revenues are expected to be $1.36 billion, up 14.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for TransDigm?For TransDigm, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.28%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that TransDigm will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that TransDigm would post earnings of $4.94 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.50, delivering a surprise of +11.34%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.TransDigm doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

127,07a6245c-c9e7-325d-aba3-30194e0f9b65,HOLX,2023-02-01,LabCorp (LH) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/labcorp-lh-report-q4-earnings-153203925.html,1675179123,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings LH, also known as LabCorp, is slated to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 16, before market open.In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings of $4.68 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.6%. The company beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in one, the average surprise being 6.06%.Factors at PlayLabCorp has been registering an ongoing sales rebound in the base business for both Diagnostics and Drug Development segments. However, as the severity of the pandemic has declined, we expect the demand for COVID-19 testing services and vaccines to have been lower than the year-ago period’s levels, impacting the fourth-quarter sales performance. Also, the ongoing Ukraine-Russia crisis, a strengthening U.S. dollar and supply chain issues are expected to have adversely impacted LabCorp’s fourth-quarter performance.Covance Drug Development is likely to have benefited in Q3 from continued growth in the organic base business and a strong backlog of $15.2 billion at the end of the third quarter. The company expects approximately $4.7 billion of this backlog to convert into revenues over the next 12 months.Similar to the last reported quarter, growth in early development and clinical development is expected to have been offset by central labs on account of a significant slowdown in COVID-related work and the Russia-Ukraine crisis. On a positive note, LabCorp completed a comprehensive laboratory relationship with Ascension in the third quarter to manage Ascension’s hospital-based laboratories in 10 states and purchase select assets of the health system’s outreach laboratory business. The company also completed its acquisition of the outreach lab business and related assets of New Jersey-based RWJBarnabas Health during the third quarter. We believe these developments to have contributed to LabCorp’s Q4 revenues.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise Story continuesLaboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS SurpriseLaboratory Corporation of America Holdings price-eps-surprise | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Quote Turning to oncology. the company continues to deepen its leadership position by expanding its cancer-related diagnostic screening and testing portfolio and by partnering with its pharmaceutical clients. During the third quarter, the company formed a strategic partnership with MD Anderson Cancer Center Foundation in Spain to increase access to early-phase oncology clinical trials. The company also entered into a collaboration with Becton, Dickinson and Company to help match patients with critical and potentially life-changing treatments for cancer and other diseases. These developments are likely to have made significant contributions to the company’s fourth-quarter performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Covance Drug Development segment’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.41 billion, indicating a decline of 2.4% from the prior-year quarter’s figure. Our model projects Q4 drug development revenues to be $1.42 billion, a 2.2% decline year over year.Within LabCorp Diagnostics, base business organic volume is anticipated to have continued its rally, led by consistent growth in esoteric and routine procedures. However, a slowdown in COVID-19 testing is likely to have hampered sales performance within the segment. In this regard, in the third quarter, COVID-19 testing rates dropped and LabCorp expected the decline to continue further. This is expected to get reflected in the company’s Q4 earnings release.However, in terms of base business, during the third quarter, the company witnessed growing demand for its at-home testing and collection options through Labcorp OnDemand. The company also noted that its FDA authorization, combination COVID, flu and RSV at-home collection test continues to register strong demand with the rise of respiratory virus cases expected this fall and through the winter. We believe this trend to have continued through the fourth quarter, thus adding to the top line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LabCorp Diagnostics’ fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.34 billion, implying a 10.9% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Our model projects Q4 LabCorp Diagnostics’ revenues to be $2.32 billion, suggesting an 11.5% decline year over year.Key Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of $4.06 per share implies a 40% plunge from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.75 billion, suggesting a 7.5% fall from the prior-year reported number.What Our Model SuggestsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for LabCorp this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +2.67%.

Going by the sector’s scorecard, 8.9% of the companies in the Medical sector, constituting 28.4% of the sector’s market capitalization, reported earnings till Jan 25. Of these, 80% beat earnings estimates and 20% beat the same for revenues. Earnings increased 5% year over year on 7% higher revenues.Overall, fourth-quarter earnings of the Medical sector are expected to plunge 10.9% on a 2.9% revenue decrease. This compares with the third-quarter reported earnings decline of 3.3% on revenue growth of 5.1%.The projection reflects the ongoing global inflationary pressure leading to an extremely tough situation related to raw material and labor cost as well as freight charges, which have put the industry in a tight spot again. The majority of the players within this space have witnessed mounting raw material costs and other expense pressure through the Q4 months. Added to this, labor-supply constraints with rising labor costs and global supply-chain hazards are expected to have moderated the growth process.Medical Device Quarterly SynopsysIntegral to the broader Medical sector, medical device or the Zacks-defined Medical Products companies’ collective business growth is likely to have displayed improvement compared with the last year, with a significant reduction in COVID-led severity across the United States and other developed countries. Through the Q4 months, new waves of coronavirus spread rapidly across various developed and emerging nations. Yet, the companies’ successful addressing of a couple of years’ pent-up demand is likely to have led to higher year-over-year growth within the legacy base businesses of the industry players.Also, diagnostic testing companies might have shown a sequential rise in testing demand, thanks to rising new cases in select geographies, leading to business growth for many companies.Story continuesOverall, the legacy base business recovery and testing demand of the companies through the months of the fourth quarter are expected to have been impressive. Medical device companies like Boston Scientific BSX, Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO, Hologic HOLX and Align Technology ALGN are likely to have been positively influenced by these factors in Q4.However, as discussed earlier, replicating the market-wide trend, this sector’s Q4 results are likely to be significantly dampened by the ongoing macroeconomic threat in the United States and outside. Despite the reopening of the economy, the vicious cycle of deteriorating inflationary situation along with aggressive rate hikes has put the global investment scenario in a tighter spot again. Within medical device, going by the industry-wide trend so far, logistical challenges and increasing unit costs have been heavily weighing on the corporate profitability of the stocks across the board. On the other hand, the tightened monetary policy is starkly altering consumer preferences and once again, demand for the non-essential category line of medical device businesses is on the back foot.This might have, in a way, shrunk the companies’ revenues in Q4 compared to the prior quarter.Let's take a look at three MedTech players scheduled to announce results on Feb 1.Boston Scientific: Boston Scientific expects fourth-quarter 2022 operational revenue growth in the range of 8.5% to 10.5% year over year. This excludes an approximate 650-basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on rates during the Q3 earnings release. Meanwhile, BSX’s top line is likely to have improved year over year, with non-COVID elective medical procedures running in a full-fledged way in the United States and elsewhere across the globe. Given the improving scenario along with an innovative pipeline, expansion into faster growth markets, globalization efforts and enhanced digital capabilities, Boston Scientific is well-positioned to register decent fourth-quarter 2022 results.(Read more: Will Boston Scientific Beat Q4 Earnings Estimates?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $3.24 billion for the fourth quarter suggests a 3.6% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for BSX’s earnings of 47 cents per share indicates a 4.4% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Per our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates. This is exactly the case as you can see below.BSX has an Earnings ESP of +2.64% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.

The company is expected to have recorded growth, driven by a favorable business mix and new launches. The company advanced its Orbitrap portfolio, launching the Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid mass spectrometer. In electron microscopy, the company introduced the Thermo Scientific Arctis Cryo-Plasma Focused Ion Beam, an automated microscope that streamlines cryoelectron tomography. These are all expected to have contributed to the Q4 top line of Thermo Fisher.(Read more: What's in Store for Thermo Fisher in Q4 Earnings?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Thermo Fisher’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $10.36 billion, which implies a decline of 3.2% from the year-ago figure. The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $5.19, suggesting a fall of 20.6% from the prior-year reported figure.TMO has an Earnings ESP of -0.62% and a Zacks Rank #3.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. price-eps-surprise | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. QuoteHologic: In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Hologic is expected to have witnessed strong growth in the Diagnostics business (excluding COVID) from the growing adoption of Panther instruments and an expanded Panther installed base. During the fourth-quarter earnings update, Hologic noted that the company has nearly 3,250 Panthers instruments placed globally. Its performance might have been driven by both legacy and new assays, namely the BBCVTV vaginitis panel, MGen, CTMG and its respiratory menu on the Panther Fusion. However, with COVID testing significantly down over the past few months, Hologic’s Molecular Diagnostics business is likely to have been impacted by lower COVID-related sales.(Read more: Hologic to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hologic’s fiscal first-quarter revenues is pegged at $980.9 million, which implies a decline of 33.3% from the year-ago figure. The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at 96 cents, suggesting a fall of 55.8% from the prior-year reported figure.HOLX has an Earnings ESP of +5.05% and a Zacks Rank #2.Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHologic, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHologic, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Hologic, Inc. QuoteAlign Technology: Align Technology is likely to have gained from increasing clear aligners shipments to Invisalign doctors worldwide. In the last reported quarter, the company witnessed increased shipments in Invisalign case volumes across almost all markets — led by Taiwan, Thailand, India and Korea — driven by increased submitters.  Analysts expect this trend to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, aiding sales growth. However, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the heightened volatility in foreign exchange rates might have posed hindrances to recovery, hampering business performance in Q4. Staffing shortages and the ongoing inflationary pressure are expected to have dragged the company’s profitability down in Q4.(Read more: Align Technology to Post Q4 Earnings: What's in Store?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of $1.52 per share implies a 46.3% plunge from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $889.9 million, suggesting a 13.7% fall from the prior-year reported number.ALGN has an Earnings ESP of +2.56% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Align Technology, Inc.

Valero's margins more than doubled to $6.3 billion from a year earlier.""Most people in the trade today think that the sanctions will actually result in a reduction in Russian refinery utilization, and you'll see lower exports of VGO and diesel coming out of Russia when the sanctions take place,"" Gary Simmons, chief commercial officer at Valero, said last week.Lower diesel inventories with VGO and the EU ban's potential impact on Russian exports will further bolster refining margins, Rick Hessling, a Marathon senior vice president, said Tuesday.Marathon exports up to 350,000 barrels per day to Latin America, but is seeing ""an incremental pull into Europe,"" according to Brian Partee, senior vice president of global clean products. The full impact of the EU ban likely won't be felt until the second quarter, he added.If Russia discounts its fuel exports, they may set the ""minimum price"" in those marketplaces where U.S. refiners also compete, said Richard Harbison, senior vice president of refining at Phillips 66.Story continuesRussian exports into Northwest Europe accelerated ahead of the ban, which could impact U.S. exports, refiners said.""We're entering the sanction period of time at really historically high levels of inventory,"" said Marathon's Partee.Still, Russian fuel has product specification that could make it difficult to place in markets unaccustomed to the fuel, he said."" supply assurance component is really a big unknown,"" he added.

This compares to earnings of $2.94 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -7.83%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this oil refiner would post earnings of $4.98 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.46, delivering a surprise of 29.72%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Phillips 66 , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, posted revenues of $40.91 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 19.26%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $33.57 billion.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Amgen: mixed.

We're seeing that stock up nearly 3% in extended trading.Let's take a closer look at Snap, shares off just about 7 and 1/2% here, a disappointing report from the company, revenue and EPS both missing the Street's expectations. Guidance-- first quarter revenue guidance also coming up a bit short, so that's placing some pressure on Match Group.We're talking about Match Group right now, off just about 7%. Fourth quarter-- fourth quarter payers declining about 1% here, so it doesn't necessarily look like Match, the dating app, the dating scene is recession proof, looking at a 7% drop here in extended trading.

Current quarter and full-year net booking guidance coming up short. That, of course, is a big focal point here for the Street, for investors when they're digging through this report here from EA.Also, another piece of bad news here. The new ""Star Wars"" game has been delayed to April, was initially expected to launch in March. We're looking at pressure on that stock here. Over the last three months, it didn't stray too far from the flat line, up just about 2%.And rounding it out with Amgen, that stock off just a fraction here in extended trading. EPS $4.09, beating by a penny. Revenue, though, ticking down to $6.84 billion. A 4% boost in product sales was offset by slowing sales of the manufacturing related to COVID-19. We're looking at losses of just about 6% in the last three months. Over the last six months, taking a look at a bit of a longer-term chart, that stock is actually in positive territory, up just about 2%.]"

That equated to 12% of the company's total spending.Global Witness said that its own calculations showed Shell spent only 1.5%, or $288 million, of its total spending of $20 billion on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar.Shell rejected the accusations, saying it is ""confident that its financial disclosures are fully compliant with all SEC and other reporting requirements"".The complaint also requested that the SEC examine whether the inclusion of gas trading in Shell's renewables and energy solutions division ""constitutes a materially misleading misstatement"".Shell accelerated its investments in renewables in 2022 with the $1.55 billion acquisition of India-based Sprng and an agreement to buy Danish renewable natural gas company Nature Energy for $2 billion.

The gauge was being taken to a facility in the suburbs of state capital Perth - a distance further than the length of Great Britain.Rio was willing to pay for the cost of the search if asked by the state government, iron ore division head Simon Trott told reporters.""Of course the simple fact is this device should never have been lost,"" he said. ""We're sorry that that has occurred and we’re sorry for the concern that that has caused within the Western Australian community.""People had been told to stay at least five metres (16.5 feet) away if they spotted the capsule, because exposure could cause radiation burns or radiation sickness. However, driving past it was believed to be relatively low risk, akin to taking an X-ray.'NEEDLE IN THE HAYSTACK'Western Australia's Emergency Services Minister Stephen Dawson said the find was an ""extraordinary result"" after a search involving the state's emergency response department, defence authorities and radiation specialists.Story continues""When you consider the scope of the search area, locating this object was a monumental challenge, the search groups have quite literally found the needle in the haystack,"" he said.A 20-metre exclusion zone has been set up around the capsule while defence force members verify it via a serial number.It will then be placed in a lead container and stored overnight at a secure location in Newman, a mining town roughly 1,200 km (745 miles) north-west of Perth, before being taken to the state capital on Thursday. The silver capsule, 6 mm in diameter and 8 mm long, contains Caesium-137 which emits radiation equal to 10 X-rays per hour.Officials said the capsule apparently fell off a truck during transport and landed on the side of the road, adding that it was unlikely there would be contamination in the area.SEEKING ANSWERSRio said in a statement that it would investigate whether the use of specialist contractors had been appropriate, having entrusted the gauge to SGS Australia and Centurion for packaging and transport respectively.SGS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Centurion said in a statement it was seeking answers about how the capsule became dislodged during transport given the crate and pallet provided by SGS arrived in Perth in the same condition as at the start of the journey, and GPS data had shown no sudden changes in speed.""From a freight and logistics perspective this indicates a routine journey, and the fact that the crate was not opened for a week until after delivery reinforces that view,"" Centurion said.Western Australia's Chief Health Officer Andrew Robertson said there would be an investigation and prosecutions would be considered under state radiation safety laws from 1975.The maximum penalty for failing to safely handle radioactive substances is A$1,000 and A$50 per day the offence continues, though the state government said on Wednesday it was considering a change to laws to allow for bigger penalties.Officials said any change to penalties would not be retrospective.(Writing by Praveen Menon; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Jamie Freed)]"

Yet pandemic-induced supply-chain disruption in the U.S. defense electronics space remains a threat to stocks in the aerospace-defense space.Nevertheless, the outlook remains bright for the defense side of the aerospace-defense industry, cushioned by steady government support, which should keep investors interested in this industry. The frontrunners in the aerospace-defense industry are Lockheed Martin, Airbus Group and General Dynamics.About the IndustryThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry comprises companies that primarily design and manufacture heavy-built products like commercial as well as military jets and helicopters, tankers and other combat vehicles, missiles, combatant ships as well as auxiliary ships, submarines, bombs, guns, space transportation vehicles, military satellites and a few more. The industry also includes cyber security players who offer information technology (IT) services and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions. A portion of revenues comes from defense contractors, offering spare parts, aircraft modification, ship repair and overhaul services and supply chain management services.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense IndustryImproved Air Traffic Outlook Boosts Prospects: Recovering global air traffic data in recent times has boosted the near-term growth prospects of the industry. As stated in a report published by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in November 2022, industry-wide revenue per kilometer increased 41.3% year over year.Story continuesThis must have driven IATA to forecast that total airline revenues should increase to an estimated 93% of the pre-pandemic level in 2023. Such impressive projections bode well for commercial aerospace giants, which have long borne the brunt of poor air travel in the form of delayed jet deliveries and, in some cases, cancellation of their orders altogether by airlines.Expanding Defense Budget Remains a Growth Catalyst: While the commercial aerospace market has been recovering steadily over the past couple of quarters, the defense side of the industry stood its ground amid the COVID-19 crisis, cushioned by steady government support. To this end, it is imperative to mention that the U.S. House passed the $839 billion National Defense Authorization Act in July 2022, thereby authorizing the U.S. government to spend $37 billion more than what President Joe Biden had requested in his budget for national security spending. Such improved budgetary provisions set the stage for industry players focused on the defense business to win more contracts, which should enhance their top line.Supply Chain Issues May Hurt: Significant supply-chain disruption has been observed in the Aerospace and Defense industry, of late, courtesy of the pandemic-induced lower aircraft demand and restrictions on the movement of people and goods. This primarily affected smaller suppliers, like aircraft parts makers, especially those with heavy exposure to commercial aerospace and the aftermarket business.Although the global economy has started to improve, lingering market disequilibria will likely continue to keep prices high, including that of labor, as estimated by IATA. This, in turn, might keep the growth trajectory of the U.S. aerospace and defense industry constricted, to some extent, in the near term.Strengthening Dollar Adds to industry Woes: The recently appreciating U.S. dollar is adding another layer of cost to airlines’ operations, which are already burdened with high inflation and jet fuel prices. The Federal Reserve’s policy rate now stands at 4.5%, having started 2022 at 0.25%, and will likely peak in 2023 in the vicinity of 5%, as reported by IATA. All U.S. dollar-denominated costs are rising for airlines, which earn revenues in non-U.S. currency.Similarly, the debt burden has increased for all non-dollar-based entities that have borrowed in dollars. Such a burden on airlines might lead to lower aircraft delivery, thereby hurting aerospace-defense industry players that operate in commercial aerospace, in particular.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry is housed within the broader Zacks Aerospace sector.

160,e39b8517-31e6-3478-90e9-852d69d0b4f8,NOV,2023-02-01,Jacobs Solutions (J) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jacobs-solutions-j-earnings-expected-150003594.html,1675177203,STORY,"['NOV', 'J']","[The market expects Jacobs Solutions (J) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 7, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis construction and technical services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.61 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.2%.Revenues are expected to be $3.62 billion, up 7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Jacobs Solutions?For Jacobs Solutions, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.18%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Jacobs Solutions will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Jacobs Solutions would post earnings of $1.78 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.80, delivering a surprise of +1.12%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

With inflation steadily easing, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell might further lower the magnitude of the rate hike. Economists are eyeing a quarter basis point increase in the benchmark interest rate.Despite cooling inflation, market pundits continue to see headwinds in the form of softness in consumer spending. Also, geopolitical turbulence as well as higher borrowing costs might just push the economy into a likely recession.So, the question is how to refine the portfolio to endure any unprecedented circumstances. Well, apply a holistic approach. Look for stocks that are fundamentally sound and offer security as well as resilience with long-term upside potential.Here's an Investing TipWe always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless blessed with Midas touch. When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that have good things going on for them, even at a time when they have been beaten down by some external factors.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis — the lower the number, the better. Signet Jewelers Limited SIG, NRG Energy, Inc. NRG, ACCO Brands Corporation ACCO and Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL boast a low P/CF ratio.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial HealthQuestions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesWhat’s the Best Strategy?An investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and also consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the eight stocks that qualified the screening:Signet, the world's largest retailer of diamond jewelry, sports a Zacks Rank #1. It has an expected EPS growth rate of 8% for three-five years. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Signet has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 44.8%, on average. SIG has a Value Score of B.

NRG Energy has a Value Score of A.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NRG Energy’s current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 19.9% and 45.9%, respectively, from the year-ago period.

162,d1510f0c-7ba4-38b2-bd4c-69029a3a6268,NEE,2023-02-01,10 Most Undervalued Solar Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-undervalued-solar-stocks-195752127.html,1675195072,STORY,"['CSIQ', 'AGR', 'CWEN-A', 'NEE-PR', 'JKS']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 10 most undervalued solar stocks to buy according to hedge funds. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Solar Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.The solar energy market is set to make new growth records in 2023 and beyond as the world scrambles to find alternative energy sources to cut its reliance on conventional energy amid rising costs and climate worries. According to a BloombergNEF piece, global solar deployment in 2023 will reach about 316 gigawatts, up from about 268GW in 2022.The report said that the growth in the space outperformed expectations as BNEF was expecting solar deployments for 2022 to come in at 228GW. The report said that rising demand in Chinese solar markets was one of the reasons for this solid growth. Another reason was rising solar deployment in Europe amid rising electricity prices.Another report published by Bloomberg in January highlighted that the production of solar panels is set to soar in 2023 as manufacturers seem to have solved one of the key problems that was keeping a lid on production. The problem was the high cost of polysilicon — a key material for most panels.  The Bloomberg report said that with several new manufacturing facilities coming online in China, the cost of the material has dropped by more than a third since mid-November.The energy sector has always been rewarding for investors, especially during difficult economic times. In 2022, energy stocks provided a refuge to investors amid the broader market turmoil. Solar stocks present an attractive opportunity since they are operating in an industry that has long-term growth prospects. Many of the stocks in the industry also pay dividends and are diversified enough across the renewable energy spectrum to offset any losses or uncertainty for a specific business area.Copyright: lassedesignen / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyFor this article we scanned the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF holdings and listed the top solar stocks owned by the ETF. We then narrowed down to the stocks that have attractive PE ratios when compared to the green and renewable industry average PE of 83, which was calculated by NYU Stern.

In fact, about 60% of the agreements are tied to the consumer price index.

He believes the PM stock is leading the shift “over to the tobacco model of the future.”By 2025, the company says it wants half of all sales to come from smoke-free products.

With oil and natural gas demand on the rise, we’ll see many more years of dividend hikes from CVX.The company is also buying back $75 billion worth of stock, which is mind-blowing.

The current market conditions, however, are nowhere near the downtrends that were seen in late 2008 or during the early parts of COVID-19, according to a new white paper published by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.The white paper, Machines Signal Q4'22 Guidance Not Falling Off a Cliff, is the inaugural edition of a new quarterly series featuring natural language processing algorithms to systematically review an earnings conference call season. The first of its kind analysis leverages original frameworks that were developed by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence to extract sentiment, financial growth, guidance and topics of interest to demonstrate the insights that can be discovered algorithmically from textual data.""One key takeaway is that firms' guidance for Q4'22 is not as dire as some may anticipate according to our framework. In fact, the percent of S&amp;P 500 firms expecting top-line, bottom-line and profitability growth hover at their respective 15-year historical averages."" said Frank Zhao, Senior Director, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. ""Another takeaway is that supply chain constraints or inflationary pressures were of waning focus for firms while the rapidly rising and elevated U.S. interest rate has gained prominence.""Key takeaways of the inaugural edition:Guidance Not Falling Off a Cliff: The breadth of firms that are expecting growth in their financials for Q4'22 hover at their historical averages, an encouraging sign that firms are not expecting broad-based softness (yet) as actuals tend to unfold much better than guidance.Interest Rate Top of Mind: Supply chain-, inflation- and pandemic-related worries were of waning focus on Q3'22 calls whereas 'rising interest rate' has taken center stage.Neutral Sentiment: The overall sentiment has deteriorated from highly positive to neutral in a span of three seasons, but remains well above the pessimistic depths of the two previous bear markets induced by the COVID-19 global pandemic and the 2008 housing crisis.Unevenness to the Financials: The number of firms citing profitability growth has been a bright spot as Q3'22 is ranked 12th best in the past 60 quarters in part due to cost control while the percent of firms citing bottom-line growth has been in an 'earnings recession' for the past three quarters in part due to rising expenses and currency headwinds.Story continuesRank of Overall Sentiment Level for S&amp;P 500 Firms in the Past 60 Earnings Seasons Q4'07 - Q3'22Q4'22 S&amp;P 500 Bank Earnings Sentiment Analysis: The Q4'22 season kicks off on a sour note, as sentiment continued its decline among the large banks, which announce early in the season.

(NYSE:SPGI) is another company we own that is part of a duopoly in the business of credit rating. S&amp;P and Moody’s have roughly equal market shares and rate more than 90% of all bonds worldwide. The service provides high value for the cost. A company that chooses to issue debt without a rating will pay an interest rate that could be higher by half of a percent. The cost of a higher interest rate far exceeds any savings gained by not using the services of S&amp;P.We think of S&amp;P as a toll road that earns fees from its customers in exchange for cost-effective access to capital. As such, the company has extraordinary margins and pricing power and requires little of its own capital to grow. Even after fully reinvesting in its business, S&amp;P still has an excess of cash. In 2021, S&amp;P produced $3.5 billion of free cash from $8.3 billion of revenues. The company returns the majority of its free cash to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases.”Story continuesS&amp;P Global Inc.

Data released today for November 2022 show that home price gains declined across the United States. More than 27 years of history are available for the data series and can be accessed in full by going to https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/index-family/indicators/sp-corelogic-case-shiller/.YEAR-OVER-YEARThe S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index, covering all nine U.S. census divisions, reported a 7.7% annual gain in November, down from 9.2% in the previous month. The 10-City Composite annual increase came in at 6.3%, down from 8.0% in the previous month. The 20-City Composite posted a 6.8% year-over-year gain, down from 8.6% in the previous month.Miami, Tampa, and Atlanta reported the highest year-over-year gains among the 20 cities in November. Miami led the way with a 18.4% year-over-year price increase, followed by Tampa in second with a 16.9% increase, and Atlanta in third with a 12.7% increase. All 20 cities reported lower price increases in the year ending November 2022 versus the year ending October 2022.MONTH-OVER-MONTHBefore seasonal adjustment, the U.S. National Index posted a -0.6% month-over-month decrease in November, while the 10-City and 20-City Composites posted decreases of -0.7% and -0.8%, respectively.After seasonal adjustment, the U.S. National Index posted a month-over-month decrease of -0.3%, and the 10-City and 20-City Composites both posted decreases of -0.5%.In November, all 20 cities reported declines before seasonal adjustments. After seasonal adjustments, 19 cities reported declines, with only Detroit increasing 0.1%.ANALYSIS""November 2022 marked the fifth consecutive month of declining home prices in the U.S.,"" says Craig J. Lazzara, Managing Director at S&amp;P DJI. ""For example, the National Composite Index fell -0.6% for the month, reflecting a -3.6% decline since the market peaked in June 2022. We saw comparable patterns in our 10- and 20-City Composites, both of which stand more than -5.0% below their June peaks. These declines, of course, came after very strong price increases in late 2021 and the first half of 2022. Despite its recent weakness, on a year-over-year basis the National Composite gained 7.7%, which is in the 74th percentile of historical performance levels.Story continues""All 20 cities in our November report showed price declines on a month-over-month basis, with a median decline of -0.8%. Moreover, for all 20 cities, year-over-year gains in November were lower than those of October, with a median year-over-year increase of 6.4%. Interestingly, home prices in San Francisco were down by -1.6% year-over-year, the first negative result for any city since San Francisco's -0.4% decline in October 2019. This is the worst year-over-year result for San Francisco in more than 10 years (since a -3.0% result in March 2012). West coast weakness was not limited to California, as San Francisco was followed by Seattle (+1.5%) and Portland (+3.9%) at the bottom of the league table.""In contrast, November's best-performing cities were clustered in the Southeast. Miami (+18.4%) was the best performer, followed by Tampa (+16.9%). November is the eighth consecutive month that one of our Florida cities has been the national leader. The month's bronze medal went to Atlanta (+12.7%), narrowly edging out Charlotte (+12.6%). Unsurprisingly, the Southeast (+15.1%) and South (+14.3%) were the strongest regions and the West (+4.0%) was the weakest.""As the Federal Reserve moves interest rates higher, mortgage financing continues to be a headwind for home prices. Economic weakness, including the possibility of a recession, would also constrain potential buyers. Given these prospects for a challenging macroeconomic environment, home prices may well continue to weaken.""SUPPORTING DATATable 1 below shows the housing boom/bust peaks and troughs for the three composites along with the current levels and percentage changes from the peaks and troughs.2006 Peak2012 TroughCurrentIndexLevelDateLevelDateFromPeak (%)LevelFromTrough (%)FromPeak (%)National184.61Jul-06134.00Feb-12-27.4 %297.29121.9 %61.0 %20-City206.52Jul-06134.07Mar-12-35.1 %301.51124.9 %46.0 %10-City226.29Jun-06146.45Mar-12-35.3 %313.07113.8 %38.3 %Table 2 below summarizes the results for November 2022.

TSN is likely to witness year-over-year growth in the top line when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on Feb 6. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $13,102 million, suggesting an increase of 1.3% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.However, Tyson Foods’ quarterly bottom line is likely to decline year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has moved down by a couple of cents to $1.44 per share over the past 30 days.

Price and EPS SurpriseTyson Foods, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Tyson Foods, Inc. Quote Things To NoteTyson Foods is benefiting from its focus on operational and supply chain efficiency programs. Solid customer and consumer demand for its brands and products amid rising protein consumption have been working in TSN’s favor. Strength in the company’s omnichannel capabilities has also been contributing to the upside. Tyson Foods is seeing continued growth in the retail core business and greater demand in the foodservice business. We believe that the continuation of these aspects bodes well for the quarter to be reported.However, Tyson Foods has been battling rising cost inflation for a while, which is marring its margin performance. In this regard, escalated cost of goods throughout the business, including feed ingredients, labor, live animals and freight costs, is a concern. Tyson Foods’ international presence keeps it exposed to unfavorable currency fluctuations. The persistence of such hurdles might have hurt Tyson Foods’ performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Tyson Foods this time around.

When shows are syndicated, redistributed, released on DVD, purchased by a streaming service or otherwise used beyond what the actors were originally paid for, those actors get residual checks called royalties.Read: Celebrities Who Are Even Richer Than You ThinkWatch Out: With a Recession Looming, Make These 3 Retirement Moves To Stay On TrackSo, do all actors get paid for reruns? According to the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, some do, and some don't. For principal performers, royalties can lead to long-term payoffs that trump the original salary. Background actors, on the other hand, won't be getting any residual checks in the mail. Find out how much your favorite TV stars get paid for reruns and more.Paul Smith/Featureflash Photo Ag'Friends' Royalties""Friends"" ran for 10 seasons between 1994 and 2004. The show made stars out of Matthew Perry, Matt LeBlanc, Courteney Cox, David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow and, of course, Jennifer Aniston -- one of the richest actresses of all time.The show's success still pays dividends for the cast. In 2015, USA Today reported that Warner Bros. earns $1 billion a year from ""Friends."" Of that amount, 2% -- or $20 million -- goes to each of the stars every single year.Take Our Poll: Are You Planning To Buy or Sell a House This Year?Paul Smith/Featureflash Photo Ag'Seinfeld' RoyaltiesOne of the most beloved and successful sitcoms of all time, ""Seinfeld"" -- the show about nothing -- ran for nine seasons, ending in 1998. As far as payouts to the cast, Jerry Seinfeld and co-creator Larry David take the lion's share of royalties because co-stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Michael Richards and Jason Alexander don't own a stake in the show, according to International Business Times.David and Seinfeld can each make $400 million per syndication cycle, New York Magazine reported.Frazer Harrison / Getty Images'Gilligan's Island' RoyaltiesAlthough it's one of history's most familiar sitcoms, ""Gilligan's Island"" ran for only three seasons -- the first of which was filmed in black and white. You can still watch the marooned castaways in streaming reruns, but one of the show's stars claims royalties never paid off.Story continuesDawn Wells, who played the iconic Mary Ann, told Forbes in 2016 that a ""misconception is that we must be wealthy, rolling in the dough, because we got residuals. We didn't really get a dime."" She continued, ""Sherwood Schwartz, our producer, reportedly made $90 million on the reruns alone.""Characters like Thurston Howell III didn't get to enjoy their riches either, even if they were fictional.Paul Smith/Featureflash Photo Ag'Everybody Loves Raymond' RoyaltiesRay Romano -- one of the richest Emmy Award winners of all time -- took the No. 94 position on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list in 2013. Although the publication mentioned Romano's big-screen successes, like his character voice work in the ""Ice Age"" franchise, Forbes wrote that Romano's place on the list was largely attributed to ""the bulk of his annual earnings coming from syndication of the long-running CBS sitcom.""Forbes was referring to ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" which ran for nine seasons, ending in 2005, and continues in reruns on TV Land.  Romano can earn up to $18 million a year, mainly from show residuals, Forbes and Vanity Fair reported.Bureau of Industrial Service'I Love Lucy' RoyaltiesOver 60 years after the show went off the air in 1957, reruns of the groundbreaking sitcom ""I Love Lucy"" can still be seen on CBS online and the Hallmark Channel -- and it continues to pay the salaries of TV executives.In 2012, former CBS chief executive Leslie Moonves boasted to a gathering of bankers that ""I Love Lucy"" continued to pull in $20 million a year, the Los Angeles Times reported.Lucille Ball, the eponymous star of ""I Love Lucy,"" died in 1989.Frazer Harrison / Getty Images for TV Land'The Brady Bunch' RoyaltiesGenerations of children grew up with ""The Brady Bunch,"" and you can continue to watch reruns on CBS online, Hulu and the Hallmark Channel. The show, which ran from 1969 to 1974, is among the most successful in history -- but it didn't make the stars rich, according to one cast member.Eve Plumb, who played Jan Brady, told OK! Magazine in 2011 that the ""biggest misconception is that we're all rich from it, but we are not. We have not been paid for reruns of the show for many, many years. We are not making money off of it at all.""Kevin Winter / Getty Images'Frasier' RoyaltiesIn a 2004 interview with John Mahoney, who played Martin Crane in ""Frasier,"" the Chicago Tribune wrote in reference to his salary and syndication royalties that ""there's enough in the bank to ensure he never has to work again on something he'd rather not do.""You can catch ""Frasier"" -- which was one of the most expensive TV shows to produce -- on the Hallmark Channel, Cozi TV and CBS Online.Mahoney passed away in 2018 at age 77.Alberto E.

That equated to 12% of the company's total spending.Global Witness said that its own calculations showed Shell spent only 1.5%, or $288 million, of its total spending of $20 billion on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar.Shell rejected the accusations, saying it is ""confident that its financial disclosures are fully compliant with all SEC and other reporting requirements"".The complaint also requested that the SEC examine whether the inclusion of gas trading in Shell's renewables and energy solutions division ""constitutes a materially misleading misstatement"".Shell accelerated its investments in renewables in 2022 with the $1.55 billion acquisition of India-based Sprng and an agreement to buy Danish renewable natural gas company Nature Energy for $2 billion.

The gauge was being taken to a facility in the suburbs of state capital Perth - a distance further than the length of Great Britain.Rio was willing to pay for the cost of the search if asked by the state government, iron ore division head Simon Trott told reporters.""Of course the simple fact is this device should never have been lost,"" he said. ""We're sorry that that has occurred and we’re sorry for the concern that that has caused within the Western Australian community.""People had been told to stay at least five metres (16.5 feet) away if they spotted the capsule, because exposure could cause radiation burns or radiation sickness. However, driving past it was believed to be relatively low risk, akin to taking an X-ray.'NEEDLE IN THE HAYSTACK'Western Australia's Emergency Services Minister Stephen Dawson said the find was an ""extraordinary result"" after a search involving the state's emergency response department, defence authorities and radiation specialists.Story continues""When you consider the scope of the search area, locating this object was a monumental challenge, the search groups have quite literally found the needle in the haystack,"" he said.A 20-metre exclusion zone has been set up around the capsule while defence force members verify it via a serial number.It will then be placed in a lead container and stored overnight at a secure location in Newman, a mining town roughly 1,200 km (745 miles) north-west of Perth, before being taken to the state capital on Thursday. The silver capsule, 6 mm in diameter and 8 mm long, contains Caesium-137 which emits radiation equal to 10 X-rays per hour.Officials said the capsule apparently fell off a truck during transport and landed on the side of the road, adding that it was unlikely there would be contamination in the area.SEEKING ANSWERSRio said in a statement that it would investigate whether the use of specialist contractors had been appropriate, having entrusted the gauge to SGS Australia and Centurion for packaging and transport respectively.SGS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Centurion said in a statement it was seeking answers about how the capsule became dislodged during transport given the crate and pallet provided by SGS arrived in Perth in the same condition as at the start of the journey, and GPS data had shown no sudden changes in speed.""From a freight and logistics perspective this indicates a routine journey, and the fact that the crate was not opened for a week until after delivery reinforces that view,"" Centurion said.Western Australia's Chief Health Officer Andrew Robertson said there would be an investigation and prosecutions would be considered under state radiation safety laws from 1975.The maximum penalty for failing to safely handle radioactive substances is A$1,000 and A$50 per day the offence continues, though the state government said on Wednesday it was considering a change to laws to allow for bigger penalties.Officials said any change to penalties would not be retrospective.(Writing by Praveen Menon; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Jamie Freed)]"

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 0.32%. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.36%, on average.QCOM, one of world’s leading digital wireless telecom products and service provider, is expected to have recorded lower year-over-year revenues due to falling demand for its smartphone chips amid global uncertainty.Factors at PlayQualcomm is concentrating on creating autonomous driving technologies to diversify its commercial portfolio. Its Snapdragon digital chassis offer a comprehensive set of connected automotive platforms for telematics and connectivity, computing, and driver assistance and autonomy. In addition to immersive experience, it offers augmented reality-based navigation systems, engine noise suppression capabilities and in-cabin monitoring. Business diversity could benefit its first-quarter profitability and put it in a better position to withstand macroeconomic challenges.Qualcomm anticipates a fall in demand for its handset chips as the December quarter is likely to have witnesses the worst smartphone shipment volume in the last 10 years, down 17% from the prior-year quarter’s levels. High inventory combined with low demand situations in post-pandemic period forced vendors to reduce shipments drastically. The company had decreased its outlook for smartphone shipments from a mid-single-digit fall to a low-double-digit percentage decline, signaling a downtrend in the handset market.Rising geopolitical tension in Europe and Asia is fuelling global instability and adding to the macroeconomic challenges. These elements are probably going to hurt the company’s first-quarter revenues.For the December quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $9,700 million, indicating a decline of 9.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Adjusted earnings per share are pegged at $2.35, suggesting a contraction from $3.23 recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Qualcomm for the fiscal first quarter.

Now, this as the likes of AMD and Qualcomm gear up to report quarterly results. Here to discuss the wider sector is Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and Managing Partner. Good to see you, Thomas. So--THOMAS HAYES: Great to see you, Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: --a lot to unpack here. Thank you. So as we look at some of the pressures that are in this sector, give us the temperature of what's been happening as we look at this push by US policymakers and the ripple effects.THOMAS HAYES: Yeah, it's been a strong move. Since October, the US kind of made US chipmakers get a license in order to sell advanced calculations and semiconducting equipment to China. So moving forward, the big news now is that they've gotten the Netherlands and Japan to join on restricting exports of advanced chipmaking equipment.This is a big deal because ASML focuses on the extreme ultraviolet lithography machines-- they're the only company in the world that makes them-- whereas Japan focuses on the deep ultraviolet light lithography machines. And this will hamstring China's initiative to develop their only-- their own semiconductor business domestically, but it won't completely impair it.I mean, right now, SMIC, which is the big fab that was developed in 2000 to compete with Taiwan Semiconductor, is producing chips at about 45 nanometers versus Taiwan Semiconductor, though, is producing at 7 nanometers. So I think the big issue that came today is now it's a unified front. It's not just the US unilaterally making these restrictions. It's now the Netherlands and Japan, which are the major suppliers for this advanced machinery.Story continuesRACHELLE AKUFFO: And obviously, this is coming at a time where we have a chip glut at the moment. And we're seeing that ripple effect then affecting some of these Asian suppliers as well. What is the outlook then? Because obviously, demand isn't going to be picking up any time soon from some of the estimates that we're looking at. What is the play here for some of these chip companies?THOMAS HAYES: Well, we may have hit peak inventory. And usually when we hit peak inventory historically, the sector starts to rally in anticipation of it easing. And we may have actually seen the bottom of semiconductors in October. I know that's hard to believe when you saw Intel really not deliver what everyone expected last week. But I think if you look longer term-- and I think we're going to see some more green shoots from AMD tonight and maybe even Qualcomm. Qualcomm is with the handsets, but AMD has the data center. And the PCs has been the most hurt.The other thing to keep in mind when you see, like, Texas Instruments, the auto industry, the amount of chips that go into each car is accelerating. And there's been two years of pent-up demand for new cars. We do think used cars will do poorly in the next year or two. However, we think new cars with dealer incentives-- and you're already seeing it with Tesla cutting prices, with Ford following suit with their Mach-E-- that demand for chips and capacity is going to shift to auto chip demand.And with the average car on the road at 13.1 years old, Rachelle, I think the chip sector is going to do just fine reallocating that capacity until the data center, the PC, and the handsets recovers after some pull forward in 2020 and 2021.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, and as we look at things like handsets, in terms of strategy, we're looking at Samsung. They're actually expecting-- they're actually going to be increasing. They're keeping their capital spending at last year's levels, when you have Micron, Hynix, Kyosho all pulling back on their spending. What's your take on that strategy? What could they potentially be risking by focusing so much on market share that they might end up losing out on profitability?THOMAS HAYES: Well, I think they're certainly playing the long game. I think you saw the IMF last night come out and say that global growth was going to be better than expected. I think a lot of people really underestimated the impact of China's reopening. The government set 5% reopening targets. The government in China has also been stimulating and easing since March of last year, but it didn't matter.Until they opened the doors and allowed people to leave their apartments and get back to life, all the stimulus in the world wasn't going to help. Now it's all happening at once. You have nine months of backlogged stimulus, monetary policy easing, coupled with people getting back to life and the pent-up demand. Revenge spending, revenge travel, like we saw in the US from late 2020 to 2021, that's now just starting. And I do think those 5% GDP targets that the government set are going to be very, very conservative.And we're seeing a lot of banks now come out expecting growth. And what that means for the global economy, a rising tide lifts all boats. The second largest economy in the world is going to grow faster than expected. And that's going to help Europe tremendously, which is why everyone calling for a recession in Europe this winter has been incorrect, in part, number one, the US has stepped up as a natural gas producer. But number two, that China reopening is really helping get things back in gear.And number three, it's going to help US earnings. And that's a key factor moving forward because the S&amp;P 500, some of the-- a considerable amount of those earnings will benefit from China's reopening as well. So I think things are pointing in the right direction. And I think Samsung might be right to play the long game, pick up share while everyone else is weak. Inventories are peaking. And then when the demand picks up in 12 or 18 months, they've gained share.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Now, it's interesting because Samsung is expecting the chip recovery to begin in the second half of this year. Are you seeing anything, though, that supports that kind of recovery starting that quickly?THOMAS HAYES: I do. I see it in the auto sector. So you have seen capacity reallocation. So where there's excess supply in the handsets and the PCs, they've been moving towards auto. And every single company that provides auto chips has been reporting record sales, demand is picking up. And you're seeing it also in the automakers starting to rise because they're finally getting the chips they need to sell cars.For two years, on the one hand, they had the luxury of selling above sticker, you know, and people would pay whatever they could to get the limited supply. Now the chips are coming in. The semiconductor companies are making a lot of money on the chips. But now the OEMs, the car manufacturers, are putting supply on the lots. They're going to start to do incentives, and you're going to see a massive amount of new cars.So we do think used cars will do very, very poorly over the next 12 to 24 months. New cars are going to do much better than expected. Everyone's saying in a slowdown, no one's going to buy new cars. But in a 7% interest rate environment, when the dealers start coming out and saying 0% APR, 2.9% APR, you can buy it at sticker or below sticker, I think people, with their 13-year-old cars on average, are going to get out there and take advantage.RACHELLE AKUFFO: That offer certainly will start looking a lot better. A big thank you there. Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and Managing Member, thank you so much.]"

Growing demand for the company’s cloud products from the new and existing clients using on-premises products might have acted as a tailwind.The increasing traction for core products like Jira Software and Confluence Cloud and the rising adoption of new products like Jira Service Management may have acted as key catalysts. An improvement in product quality and performance, multiple product launches and increased pricing are likely to have boosted the firm’s performance as well.Robust growth in subscription revenues, aided by the solid uptake of the company’s subscription-based offerings, is likely to get reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s results. Atlassian expects a non-GAAP gross margin of 83-84% and non-GAAP operating margin of around 13% in the second-quarter fiscal 2023.However, increased investments in its systems and infrastructure, research &amp; development and sales and marketing initiatives might have weighed on the bottom line in the first quarter.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Atlassian this time.

This earnings season will be important as market participants will closely monitor any sign of earnings, revenues or margin decline.In addition to tech companies, several non-tech components of the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite are also slated to report financial numbers. We have selected five such companies with a favorable Zacks Rank that are set to beat earnings estimates. The combination of a favorable Zacks Rank and a possible earnings beat should drive their stock prices in the near-term.These companies are Expedia Group Inc. EXPE, IDEXX Laboratories Inc. IDXX, Tradeweb Markets Inc. TW, SolarEdge Technologies Inc. SEDG and Sanofi SNY.Nasdaq Composite in Q4 2022Wall Street wrapped up 2022 as the worst year since 2008, terminating a three-year winning streak. Major stock indexes suffered a bloody blow last year. The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 33.1% year over year and 32.9% from its all-time high.The technology sector, which enabled Wall Street to get rid of the coronavirus-induced short bear market and formed the new bull market, suffered the most in 2022 due to overvaluation, a high-interest rate regime and tighter monetary control adopted by the Fed to combat 40-year high inflation.However, in fourth-quarter 2022, the Nasdaq Composite Index declined just a little over 1%. Peak inflation seems behind us. Less-than-expected inflation rates in October, November and December with respect to several measures and an unexpected drop in wage rate in December and November have clearly indicated this.Q4 2022 Earnings Results So FarAs of Jan 27, 143 S&amp;P 500 companies reported their earnings results. Total earnings of these companies are down 3.3% year over year on 6.1% higher revenues with 71.3% beating EPS estimates and 67.1% beating revenue estimates. Our current projection shows that for fourth-quarter 2022, total earnings of the S&amp;P 500 Index as a whole are expected to decline 6.9% year over year on 4.3% higher revenues.Story continuesOur Top PicksFive Nasdaq Composite companies are set to beat earnings estimates.

Yet pandemic-induced supply-chain disruption in the U.S. defense electronics space remains a threat to stocks in the aerospace-defense space.Nevertheless, the outlook remains bright for the defense side of the aerospace-defense industry, cushioned by steady government support, which should keep investors interested in this industry. The frontrunners in the aerospace-defense industry are Lockheed Martin, Airbus Group and General Dynamics.About the IndustryThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry comprises companies that primarily design and manufacture heavy-built products like commercial as well as military jets and helicopters, tankers and other combat vehicles, missiles, combatant ships as well as auxiliary ships, submarines, bombs, guns, space transportation vehicles, military satellites and a few more. The industry also includes cyber security players who offer information technology (IT) services and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions. A portion of revenues comes from defense contractors, offering spare parts, aircraft modification, ship repair and overhaul services and supply chain management services.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense IndustryImproved Air Traffic Outlook Boosts Prospects: Recovering global air traffic data in recent times has boosted the near-term growth prospects of the industry. As stated in a report published by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in November 2022, industry-wide revenue per kilometer increased 41.3% year over year.Story continuesThis must have driven IATA to forecast that total airline revenues should increase to an estimated 93% of the pre-pandemic level in 2023. Such impressive projections bode well for commercial aerospace giants, which have long borne the brunt of poor air travel in the form of delayed jet deliveries and, in some cases, cancellation of their orders altogether by airlines.Expanding Defense Budget Remains a Growth Catalyst: While the commercial aerospace market has been recovering steadily over the past couple of quarters, the defense side of the industry stood its ground amid the COVID-19 crisis, cushioned by steady government support. To this end, it is imperative to mention that the U.S. House passed the $839 billion National Defense Authorization Act in July 2022, thereby authorizing the U.S. government to spend $37 billion more than what President Joe Biden had requested in his budget for national security spending. Such improved budgetary provisions set the stage for industry players focused on the defense business to win more contracts, which should enhance their top line.Supply Chain Issues May Hurt: Significant supply-chain disruption has been observed in the Aerospace and Defense industry, of late, courtesy of the pandemic-induced lower aircraft demand and restrictions on the movement of people and goods. This primarily affected smaller suppliers, like aircraft parts makers, especially those with heavy exposure to commercial aerospace and the aftermarket business.Although the global economy has started to improve, lingering market disequilibria will likely continue to keep prices high, including that of labor, as estimated by IATA. This, in turn, might keep the growth trajectory of the U.S. aerospace and defense industry constricted, to some extent, in the near term.Strengthening Dollar Adds to industry Woes: The recently appreciating U.S. dollar is adding another layer of cost to airlines’ operations, which are already burdened with high inflation and jet fuel prices. The Federal Reserve’s policy rate now stands at 4.5%, having started 2022 at 0.25%, and will likely peak in 2023 in the vicinity of 5%, as reported by IATA. All U.S. dollar-denominated costs are rising for airlines, which earn revenues in non-U.S. currency.Similarly, the debt burden has increased for all non-dollar-based entities that have borrowed in dollars. Such a burden on airlines might lead to lower aircraft delivery, thereby hurting aerospace-defense industry players that operate in commercial aerospace, in particular.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry is housed within the broader Zacks Aerospace sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #80, which places it in the top 32% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few aerospace-defense stocks that you may want to add to your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Beats S&amp;P 500, Lags SectorThe Aerospace-Defense industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite but underperformed its own sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 7.5% compared with the Aerospace sector’s slip of 0.8%. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has gone down 11.8% in the said timeframe.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/Sales ratio, which is used for valuing capital-intensive stocks like aerospace-defense, the industry is currently trading at 1.90, compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 3.36 and the sector’s 2.25.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.99X, as low as 1.51X, and at the median of 1.81X.3 Aerospace-Defense Stocks to Keep on Your WatchlistAirbus Group: Based in Mendelweg, Netherlands, Airbus develops, manufactures, markets and sells commercial jet aircraft, military transport aircraft and special mission aircraft, civil and military helicopters, satellites, orbital infrastructures and launchers as well as space-related services missiles systems, military combat and training aircraft. On Jan 27, 2023, the company announced that Air France-KLM Group has placed a firm order for four A350Fs, the brand new Airbus widebody freighter. This surely reflects the significant position that Airbus already enjoys in the rapidly growing freighter market backed by its expanding e-commerce business worldwide.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Airbus’ 2022 sales implies a solid improvement of 11% from the 2021 reported figure. The stock also boasts an average four-quarter earnings surprise of 59.88%. EADSY currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Lockheed Martin: Based in Bethesda, MD, Lockheed is the largest defense contractor in the world, with its main areas of focus being defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cyber security. The company recently announced that along with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Air Force Research Lab and Aerojet Rocketdyne, Lockheed Martin has accomplished the primary objectives during its second Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) flight test,  doubling the amount of scramjet-powered vehicle data. This indicates Lockheed’s significance in the booming hypersonic technologies market.Lockheed currently boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.9%. The company delivered an earnings surprise of 6.86% in the last reported quarter.  LMT currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.General Dynamics: Based in Falls Church, VA, General Dynamics is the leading designer and builder of nuclear-powered submarines and a leader in surface combatants and auxiliary ship design and construction for the U.S. Navy. It is also a premier manufacturer and integrator of land combat solutions worldwide, along with renowned business jets. The company announced on Jan 26, 2023 that its G700 jet has achieved 25 speed records on the recently completed G700 world tour. This should bolster General Dynamics’ position in the business jet market.GD boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.6%. The company delivered an average earnings surprise of 2.63% in the last four quarters. General Dynamics currently holds a Zacks Rank #3.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Yet pandemic-induced supply-chain disruption in the U.S. defense electronics space remains a threat to stocks in the aerospace-defense space. Nevertheless, the outlook remains bright for the defense side of the aerospace-defense industry, cushioned by steady government support, which should keep investors interested in this industry. The frontrunners in the aerospace-defense industry are Lockheed Martin LMT, Airbus Group EADSY and General Dynamics GD.  About the IndustryThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry comprises companies that primarily design and manufacture heavy-built products like commercial as well as military jets and helicopters, tankers and other combat vehicles, missiles, combatant ships as well as auxiliary ships, submarines, bombs, guns, space transportation vehicles, military satellites and a few more. The industry also includes cyber security players who offer information technology (IT) services and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions. A portion of revenues comes from defense contractors, offering spare parts, aircraft modification, ship repair and overhaul services and supply chain management services.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense IndustryImproved Air Traffic Outlook Boosts Prospects: Recovering global air traffic data in recent times has boosted the near-term growth prospects of the industry. As stated in a report published by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in November 2022, industry-wide revenue per kilometer increased 41.3% year over year. This must have driven IATA to forecast that total airline revenues should increase to an estimated 93% of the pre-pandemic level in 2023. Such impressive projections bode well for commercial aerospace giants, which have long borne the brunt of poor air travel in the form of delayed jet deliveries and, in some cases, cancellation of their orders altogether by airlines.Expanding Defense Budget Remains a Growth Catalyst: While the commercial aerospace market has been recovering steadily over the past couple of quarters, the defense side of the industry stood its ground amid the COVID-19 crisis, cushioned by steady government support. To this end, it is imperative to mention that the U.S. House passed the $839 billion National Defense Authorization Act in July 2022, thereby authorizing the U.S. government to spend $37 billion more than what President Joe Biden had requested in his budget for national security spending. Such improved budgetary provisions set the stage for industry players focused on the defense business to win more contracts, which should enhance their top line.Supply Chain Issues May Hurt: Significant supply-chain disruption has been observed in the Aerospace and Defense industry, of late, courtesy of the pandemic-induced lower aircraft demand and restrictions on the movement of people and goods. This primarily affected smaller suppliers, like aircraft parts makers, especially those with heavy exposure to commercial aerospace and the aftermarket business. Although the global economy has started to improve, lingering market disequilibria will likely continue to keep prices high, including that of labor, as estimated by IATA. This, in turn, might keep the growth trajectory of the U.S. aerospace and defense industry constricted, to some extent, in the near term.Strengthening Dollar Adds to industry Woes: The recently appreciating U.S. dollar is adding another layer of cost to airlines’ operations, which are already burdened with high inflation and jet fuel prices. The Federal Reserve’s policy rate now stands at 4.5%, having started 2022 at 0.25%, and will likely peak in 2023 in the vicinity of 5%, as reported by IATA. All U.S. dollar-denominated costs are rising for airlines, which earn revenues in non-U.S. currency. Similarly, the debt burden has increased for all non-dollar-based entities that have borrowed in dollars. Such a burden on airlines might lead to lower aircraft delivery, thereby hurting aerospace-defense industry players that operate in commercial aerospace, in particular.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry is housed within the broader Zacks Aerospace sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #80, which places it in the top 32% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

QuoteTotal revenues of $5.17 billion also beat the consensus mark of $4.6 billion by 12.3% and increased 13.4% from the year-ago figure of $4.36 billion.Segment DiscussionPulteGroup primarily operates through two business segments — Homebuilding and Financial Services.Revenues from the Homebuilding segment were up 19.8% year over year to $5.1 billion. Home sale revenues of $5.05 billion increased 19.7% year over year, mainly due to the higher average price of homes closed. Land sale revenues also rose 22.3% from a year ago to $45.5 million.The number of homes closed increased 3% from the year-ago level to 8,848 units. The average selling price of homes delivered was $571,000, up 17% year over year.Most importantly, its backlog, which represents orders yet to be closed, was 12,169 units, down 32.4% year over year. In addition, potential housing revenues from backlog decreased 22.2% from the prior-year quarter to $7.67 billion.New home orders dropped 41% year over year to 3,964 units for the quarter, owing to several headwinds like rising mortgage rates, lower affordability, lower consumer confidence and slowed demand. This resulted in a cancellation rate of 32%, up from 11% in the prior year period and 24% in the third quarter of 2022. Home orders were down across all operating regions served. The value of new orders also declined 43.1% from a year ago to $2.15 billion.Home sales gross margin was up 200 bps year over year to 28.8% for the reported quarter. Adjusted SG&amp;A expenses (as a percentage of home sales revenues) improved 50 bps to 8.2% from 8.7% a year ago. Adjusted operating margin increased by 250 bps year over year to 20.6%.Revenues from the Financial Services segment declined 28.6% year over year to $72.1 million. Pretax income for the segment decreased to $24 million from $55 million a year ago. The decline was due to a reduction in loan volumes owing to a fall in capture rate to 75% compared with 85% last year and the more competitive pricing environment.Story continuesFinancialsAt the end of 2022, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $1.09 billion, down from $1.83 billion in 2021-end.

(NASDAQ: MIRO) and Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) today announced a collaborative research agreement to help support additional treatment options for patients with acute liver failure (ALF) in need of organ support therapies. As part of the collaboration, Miromatrix has created a new liver therapy called miroliverELAP that combines a Miromatrix single-use bioengineered liver with Baxter’s PrisMax system. Miromatrix submitted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for miroliverELAP to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2022, which appears to be the first IND for a bioengineered organ. Miromatrix intends to commence a Phase I clinical trial using miroliverELAP to treat patients suffering from ALF, following FDA’s decision that the trial may proceed. Baxter is both a collaborator and shareholder of Miromatrix.“Miromatrix believes that miroliverELAP has the potential to save and improve the lives of ALF patients while simultaneously increasing the availability of livers for transplant into other patients,” said Jeff Ross, Ph.D., Miromatrix CEO. “We are excited to be partnering with Baxter to pioneer this next generation innovation in acute care and liver disease.”ALF is a serious condition with limited clinical interventions. Over 50,000 people in the United States die from liver failure each year,i often because they cannot receive a liver transplant in time.ii However, the liver is capable of regenerating itself back to health in certain circumstances, making therapy to support the native liver during ALF highly clinically relevant. MiroliverELAP is designed to provide external support to the patient’s native liver as a bridge-to-transplant or bridge-to-recovery, potentially helping to avoid a liver transplant. The miroliverELAP Phase I clinical trial will serve as a foundational building block to start generating evidence on how this pioneering therapy may help support patients with ALF.Story continuesMiromatrix’s bioengineered liver is designed to replicate key functions of a human liver and is connected to Baxter’s PrisMax system outside of the patient’s body to create the miroliverELAP system. MiroliverELAP is designed to provide therapeutic support to ALF patients in hopes their native livers will regenerate themselves back to health. Baxter’s PrisMax system is designed to help simplify delivery of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and other therapies, while providing hospitals the flexibility to meet the unique demands of the intensive care unit (ICU).

BAX is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 9, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Its earnings beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, met once and missed once, the average surprise being 4.02%.Q4 EstimatesCurrently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.77 billion, indicating an improvement of 7.4% from the prior-year period. The consensus mark for earnings stands at 94 cents per share, indicating a decline of 9.6% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to NoteBaxter anticipates total revenues to grow by mid-to-high single-digit percentage points year over year in the fourth quarter. The company expects sales growth of mid-teens on a constant currency basis and approximately flat on an operational basis.Robust demand for Baxter’s broad multi-chamber product offering is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter, driving sales of Baxter’s Clinical Nutrition segment. Moreover, a continued rise in surgical volume and elective surgical procedures is likely to have fueled strong growth in Advanced Surgery sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Clinical Nutrition segment and Advanced Surgery segment is pegged at $238 million and $255 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter.However, Renal Care segment sales declined in the first nine months of 2022 and the trend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter. Strong growth in Baxter’s PD business and IV therapy portfolio is likely to have been more than offset by lower in-center HD sales, lower infusion system sales and unfavorable currency movement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment stands at $938 million.The company has multiple collaborations to help manufacture COVID-19 vaccines. However, sales growth of the BioPharma Solutions segment is likely to have been hurt by challenging year-over-year comparisons, resulting from prior-year COVID-related sales. Sales at Acute Therapies segment is also likely to have faced a similar impact in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the BioPharma Solutions segment and the Acute Therapies segment is pegged at $140 million and $185 million, respectively.Story continuesBaxter International Inc. Price and ConsensusBaxter International Inc. Price and ConsensusBaxter International Inc. price-consensus-chart | Baxter International Inc. QuoteSales of the Pharmaceutical segment are likely to have been hurt by generic competition for certain molecules and supply constraints that impacted product availability. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment stands at $543 million.In the third quarter, Baxter’s global regions performed weakly due to unfavorable currency movements. In the Americas, Baxter reported revenues of $1.7 billion, down 1%. In EMEA, revenues totaled $692 million, down 11% from the year-ago quarter. In APAC, revenues of $643 million were down 11% year over year. The trend is likely to have continued in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, three new product categories added with the Hillrom buyout in December 2021 are likely to have brought additional sales during the fourth quarter. These product categories generated $735 million in the third quarter. Baxter anticipates that shortage of electromechanical components is likely to hamper sales growth for select businesses, including medication delivery, front line care and patient support systems.What Our Quantitative Model SuggestsPer our proven model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

The report also referred to Bloomberg’s data from December 1999 to December 2021 and highlighted that equity dividends have become the primary source of income in a typical 60/40 portfolio.Another report by JPMorgan revealed that dividends have shown resilience during recessionary periods, even when earnings-per-share tend to drop.

Medtronic (MDT), which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Products industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This medical device company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1.23%.For the most recent quarter, Medtronic was expected to post earnings of $1.28 per share, but it reported $1.30 per share instead, representing a surprise of 1.56%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.12 per share, while it actually produced $1.13 per share, a surprise of 0.89%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Medtronic. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Medtronic has an Earnings ESP of +1.47% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 21, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

217,8ab80a78-b845-30cd-a25a-117dc02f96cc,CCI,2023-02-01,Crown Castle (NYSE:CCI) shareholders have earned a 10% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crown-castle-nyse-cci-shareholders-110016432.html,1675249216,STORY,['CCI'],"[If you buy and hold a stock for many years, you'd hope to be making a profit. Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) share price is up 36% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. The last year has been disappointing, with the stock price down 20% in that time.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Crown Castle To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Crown Castle managed to grow its earnings per share at 37% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 6% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Crown Castle the TSR over the last 5 years was 62%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 11% in the twelve months, Crown Castle shareholders did even worse, losing 16% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 10%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  Crown Castle is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 2 of those are concerning...There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

Built in 1967 to produce the mammoth jet, it remains the world's largest manufacturing plant according to Boeing.But after five decades, customer demand for the 747 eroded as Boeing and Airbus developed more fuel efficient two-engine widebody planes. When Boeing confirmed in July 2020 that it would end 747 production, it was already only producing at a rate of half an aircraft a month.Story continuesBoeing delivered five 747s in 2022, while in 1990, the peak delivery year of the bestselling 747-400 version, Boeing delivered 70 747s.As different sections of the last 747 – the wings or fuselage structures, for example – were complete, the production line ""just slowly started to shut down,"" said Kim Smith, Boeing's vice president and general manager for the 747 and 767 programs.Smith said all 747 program workers were transferred to other jobs or voluntarily retired.The last 747 rolled out on Dec. 7, capping the program at 1,574 total. The plane has since completed inspections and flight tests, flying to Portland over the holidays to get a paint job. The plane will fly off on Wednesday morning to Atlas’ headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio.While Boeing also builds the 767 and 777 in Everett, the company has yet to decide which program will permanently take over the 747 production bay, which is currently being used for 787 inventory and 777X work, Smith said.Boeing will remain tied to the 747 through the aftermarket business and the Air Force One replacement program, which Boeing won in 2018.The heir apparent to the 747, the 777X will not be ready for delivery until 2025, but Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun focused his goodbye on that future: “The 777, the next plane to dominate this space, displaced all its competition just like that - and we haven’t even introduced the best version.” (Reporting by Valerie Insinna; additional reporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Josie Kao)]"

With no new jet program on the horizon, the decision secures additional work at the facility through 2035, said Scott Hamilton, aerospace analyst at Leeham Co. But it won’t entirely fill the holes left by the consolidation of final assembly work on the 787 Dreamliner to South Carolina in early 2021 and the discontinuation of the 747, the last of which will be delivered to customer Atlas Air this week. Rework on the Dreamliner currently underway in Everett following a delivery stoppage over quality control problems will similarly last only a couple of years, Hamilton said.Continue reading]"

232,2090f01c-ee1c-319b-8028-04bf30faedfc,ILMN,2023-02-01,Analysts Estimate Illumina (ILMN) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-illumina-ilmn-report-150003477.html,1675177203,STORY,['ILMN'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Illumina (ILMN) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 7, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis genetic testing tools company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.26 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -65.3%.Revenues are expected to be $1.05 billion, down 12% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 12.26% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Illumina?For Illumina, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -71.85%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Illumina will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Illumina would post earnings of $0.29 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.34, delivering a surprise of +17.24%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Illumina doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, Techne (TECH) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.49 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +4.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $289.98 million, up 7.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Techne has been revised 1.5% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -1.02%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Techne will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MAA — commonly known as MAA — is slated to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 results on Feb 1 after market close. MAA’s quarterly results are likely to reflect growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.The Germantown, TN-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a surprise of 4.78% in terms of FFO per share in the last reported quarter. This residential REIT’s quarterly results were driven by an increase in the average effective rent per unit for the same-store portfolio.MAA has a decent surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, MAA surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, the average being 2.50%. This is depicted in the chart below:Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for the announcement.Factors to ConsiderFor the U.S. apartment market, low consumer confidence and high inflation have taken a toll, with net demand for apartments ending in negative territory for calendar 2022, per a report from the real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage. Despite solid job growth and wage gains, there was weak demand for all types of housing.Amid this soft demand, new-lease apartment rents fell in December for the fourth consecutive month, declining another 0.4%. The cumulative rent drop was around 1.6% since September. Also, the national apartment vacancy surged from a record seasonal low of 2.5% one year ago to 5.0% in December 2022.However, MAA’s diversified Sunbelt portfolio is well-poised to benefit from the favorable fundamentals of this market. The pandemic accelerated employment shifts and a population inflow into the company’s markets as renters seek more business-friendly, lower-taxed and low-density cities. These favorable longer-term secular dynamic trends are increasing the desirability of its markets.The high pricing of single-family ownership units continues to drive the demand for rental apartments. Amid this, MAA is well-poised to capture recovery in demand and leasing compared to expensive coastal markets. In the fourth quarter, MAA is expected to have experienced strong rent growth and stable occupancy, thereby driving revenue growth.MAA also continues to implement its three internal investment programs — interior redevelopment, property repositioning projects and Smart Home installations. The programs are expected to have helped the company capture the upside potential in rent growth, generate accretive returns and boost earnings from its existing asset base.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $525.5 million, suggesting a 13.36% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Same-store revenues are projected at $517.65 million, indicating an increase from the $495.38 million reported in the prior quarter and $444.39 million in the year-ago period.The consensus estimate for physical occupancy is presently pegged at 95.7% for the fourth quarter, slightly lower than 95.8% in the prior quarter.MAA projects the fourth-quarter 2022 core FFO per share in the band of $2.19-$2.35, with $2.27 at the midpoint.Before the fourth-quarter earnings release, the company’s activities were adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has been revised a cent upward to $2.28 in the past month. This suggests year-over-year growth of 20%.This residential REIT estimates 2022 core FFO per share in the range of $8.37-$8.53, with a midpoint of $8.45. This is backed by a projection for same-store property revenue growth of 13.0-14.0%, same-store property operating expense growth between 7.0% and 7.5% and same-store NOI growth anticipated between 16.0% and 18.0%.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for core FFO per share is pegged at $8.46. The figure indicates a 20.7% increase year over year on 13.5% year-over-year growth in revenues to $2.02 billion.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for MAA this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is not the case here.MAA currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of -0.06%.

236,15f60e99-799d-36f9-873a-3c5faa1f4ad3,CI,2023-02-01,Cigna (CI) to Post Q4 Earnings: Here's What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-ci-post-q4-earnings-175505078.html,1675187705,STORY,['CI'],"[Cigna Corporation CI is set to report its fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 3, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the health service company’s adjusted earnings per share of $6.04 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6%, primarily on solid performances of the Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare businesses, and strong membership growth. However, the upside was partly offset by higher benefits and expenses.Let’s see how things have shaped up before the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.What Do Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share of $4.84 suggest a 1.5% increase from the prior-year reported figure of $4.77. The consensus mark has been unchanged over the past week. The consensus estimate for fourth-quarter revenues of $45.6 billion indicates a 0.2% decrease from the year-ago reported figure, while our estimate suggests a 2.9% year-over-year decline.Cigna’s earnings beat estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average being 9.8%. This is depicted in the graph below.Cigna Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Cigna Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseCigna Corporation price-eps-surprise | Cigna Corporation QuoteFactors to NoteStrong performances across CI’s Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare businesses are likely to have contributed to its fourth-quarter performance. The Evernorth unit is expected to have gained from a growing customer base and higher pharmacy script volumes in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for pharmacy revenues implies a 5.9% rise from the year-ago quarter’s actuals. The metric is expected to have aided Evernorth’s December-end quarter's performance. The consensus mark for Evernorth’s revenues is pegged at $36,308 million, signaling a 3.5% year-over-year increase.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for pre-tax adjusted income from Evernorth is pegged at $1,749 million for the fourth quarter, indicating a 7% year-over-year increase, whereas our estimate indicates 9.4% growth. The consensus estimate for the pre-tax income of Cigna Healthcare predicts an 8.3% jump from the prior-year period, while our estimate suggests a 4.6% increase.Story continuesThe consensus estimate for the medical care ratio for the fourth quarter is pegged at 85%, suggesting a year-over-year improvement of 200 basis points. These are expected to have helped the company increase its profits year over year.However, our estimate for pre-tax income from other operations is pegged at $178.5 million, indicating a decline of 18%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for premiums signals a 6.7% year-over-year decline for the fourth quarter, whereas our estimate suggests an 11.7% fall from the year-ago period’s reported figure.Cigna’s net investment income is expected to have taken a hit in the fourth quarter. The consensus mark for net investment income is pegged at $289 million, suggesting a decrease of 23.9% from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for the metric indicates a 35.8% decrease. The decline in the metric is expected to have partially offset the positives in the quarter under review, making an earnings beat uncertain.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Cigna this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%.

237,4911e82b-4656-3c92-a4eb-20407a9f9eca,CI,2023-02-01,Should Value Investors Buy Cigna (CI) Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/value-investors-buy-cigna-ci-144002877.html,1675176002,STORY,"['CI', 'ZFSVF']","[While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks, we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies. With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is Cigna (CI). CI is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value.Investors should also note that CI holds a PEG ratio of 1.09. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. CI's industry has an average PEG of 1.59 right now. CI's PEG has been as high as 1.27 and as low as 0.87, with a median of 1.03, all within the past year.Another notable valuation metric for CI is its P/B ratio of 2.09. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 3.11. Over the past year, CI's P/B has been as high as 2.30 and as low as 1.53, with a median of 1.85.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. CI has a P/S ratio of 0.53. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.89.Story continuesFinally, our model also underscores that CI has a P/CF ratio of 9.92. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 11.02. CI's P/CF has been as high as 11.10 and as low as 8.65, with a median of 10.08, all within the past year.If you're looking for another solid Insurance - Multi line value stock, take a look at Zurich Insurance Group (ZURVY). ZURVY is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value score of A.Zurich Insurance Group is currently trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 11.62 while its PEG ratio sits at 1.54. Both of the company's metrics compare favorably to its industry's average P/E of 9.72 and average PEG ratio of 1.59.Over the past year, ZURVY's P/E has been as high as 15.14, as low as 9.97, with a median of 11.59; its PEG ratio has been as high as 2.03, as low as 1.05, with a median of 1.03 during the same time period.Zurich Insurance Group also has a P/B ratio of 2.54 compared to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 3.11. Over the past year, its P/B ratio has been as high as 2.56, as low as 1.60, with a median of 2.16.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Cigna and Zurich Insurance Group are likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, CI and ZURVY feels like a great value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is worth considering Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency industry.This chipmaker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 3.58%.For the last reported quarter, Skyworks came out with earnings of $3.02 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.91 per share, representing a surprise of 3.78%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.36 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.44 per share, delivering a surprise of 3.39%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Skyworks lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Skyworks currently has an Earnings ESP of +14.72%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on February 6, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

The company pedaled so hard, it sweated off more than half their market cap last year. But they've attacked the climb this year. I got Seana with that one. Shares up nearly 60% this year.Multiple companies meanwhile reportedly eyeing an acquisition of Peloton which would have cost $50 billion at their peak but now riding through a bit of a valley below $5 billion in terms of market cap. Blackwell Capital, one of the company's largest investors, suggested a few names in a recent letter to the company, writing Apple, Disney, Sony, Nike, plus any number of tech, streaming, metaverse, and sportswear companies might get Peloton back towards the front of the pack.While neither has commented publicly, Amazon and Nike are both reportedly interested here. Peloton will report results tomorrow. And ahead of that release, revenue estimates have been down-- downward revised 22 times, just once upward. And look at the stock, a huge jump up today, not necessarily on this report, just ahead of earnings tomorrow.I want to throw in a name. I'm not a large investor or an investor at all. I think Netflix ought to be considered here because they internally talk a lot about wanting people on the platform more regularly.This is not about streaming a series but they want people on it each day. And there aren't many things to do that. That's why I think this makes sense for Netflix.SEANA SMITH: That is a compelling story there. And I'm not sold, but I think it's interesting. And I wouldn't count it out when you talk about the content--DAVE BRIGGS: You can say that's a heck no.SEANA SMITH: I think it's far fetched. But I do think maybe there is some sort of possibility there. In terms of the most likely, I think, if Peloton were to get bought, I would have to go with Amazon, given that partnership that we've already seen from Peloton. It does certainly seem to be paying off a bit when you take a look at their subscriber numbers, what is expected to see-- what we're expected to see tomorrow morning when they do report.Story continuesSubs are expected to be added there, although it might be slightly below the Street's expectations. But Peloton needs to do something to diversify their business, to get some of that momentum back that they have lost pretty significantly since peak pandemic times.INES FERRE: My bet is on Apple, hardware.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah.SEANA SMITH: And they certainly have the money for it.DAVE BRIGGS: Apple and Amazon have the most cash and a ton of content needs as well, certainly.

246,7a7e3a98-6c60-3e42-a276-a81d8d547fd7,VFC,2023-02-01,Analysts Estimate V.F. (VFC) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-v-f-vfc-150003546.html,1675177203,STORY,"['RL', 'VFC']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when V.F. (VFC) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 7, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of brands such as Vans, North Face and Timberland is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.99 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -26.7%.Revenues are expected to be $3.48 billion, down 4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for V.F.For V.F.The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +5.79%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that V.F. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that V.F. Would post earnings of $0.74 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.73, delivering a surprise of -1.35%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.V.F. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Textile - Apparel industry, Ralph Lauren (RL), is soon expected to post earnings of $2.91 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.75 billion, down 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Ralph Lauren has been revised 1.6% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -1.35%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ralph Lauren will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

247,a2cf198b-9394-39bf-b785-58b05e205926,VFC,2023-02-01,Investors Heavily Search V.F. Corporation (VFC): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-v-f-140002050.html,1675173602,STORY,['VFC'],"[V.F. (VFC) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this maker of brands such as Vans, North Face and Timberland have returned +9.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.8% change. The Zacks Textile - Apparel industry, to which V.F. belongs, has gained 5.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, V.F. is expected to post earnings of $0.99 per share, indicating a change of -26.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.7% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.09 points to a change of -34.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.35 indicates a change of +12.6% from what V.F. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.5%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, V.F. is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VFC _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of V.F. the consensus sales estimate of $3.48 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -4%. The $11.57 billion and $12.2 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -2.3% and +5.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryV.F. reported revenues of $3.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -3.7%. EPS of $0.73 for the same period compares with $1.11 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.1 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.73%. The EPS surprise was -1.35%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.V.F. is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about V.F. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 74% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Last week's US$5.9b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 14% losses.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Wells Fargo. View our latest analysis for Wells Fargo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Wells Fargo?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Wells Fargo. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Wells Fargo, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Wells Fargo is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.5% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.9% and 4.2%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Wells FargoThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Wells Fargo &amp; Company insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$95m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 26% stake in Wells Fargo. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

The company delivered an EPS surprise of +10.68%, with the consensus EPS estimate being $1.03.While investors closely watch year-over-year changes in headline numbers -- revenue and earnings -- and how they compare to Wall Street expectations to determine their next course of action, some key metrics always provide a better insight into a company's underlying performance.Since these metrics play a crucial role in driving the top- and bottom-line numbers, comparing them with the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated about them helps investors better project a stock's price performance.Here is how Pfizer performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:Ibrance-Worldwide: $1.28 billion versus the four-analyst average estimate of $1.29 billion.

(NYSE:PFE) fell 15% in the month of January, ending the month on a low note with an earnings report that included a lackluster outlook for 2023. Following record revenue of $100 billion for full-year 2022, the pharmaceutical company guides for revenue between $67 billion and $71 billion in the coming year as the flow of money from its Covid vaccine and its Covid antiviral pill begin to wane.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Signs with PFE. Click here to check it out. PFE 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PFEPeter Lynch Chart of PFEGiven the expected decline in the top line, it is no wonder Pfizers stock cannot catch a break, but for value investors, this is the kind of opportunity we are always on the lookout for. With the bear market in full swing, the market seems determined not to overpay for anything, which has led to Pfizers stock already fully pricing in the future declines in Covid revenue.The big question is, can Pfizer emerge from the other side of its Covid-related rise and fall as a growing company, or is it doomed to keep its low valuation multiples?Pfizer Can't Catch a Break, but Investors CanPfizer isnt just about CovidIt is undeniable that Pfizers growth has been mainly fueled by Covid-related revenues ever since it developed its Covid vaccine. However, what about the other segments of the business? Can these segments continue growing once Covid revenue streams normalize to an ex-pandemic level?Pfizer separates its Covid-related revenue from its other operation revenue, and for full-year 2022, the non-Covid-related parts of the business grew 2% collectively year over year. This is a slowdown from the 6% growth in ex-Covid businesses in 2021, but we also have to keep in mind that 2022 results included a 7% foreign exchange headwind due to the strong U.S. dollar.The company continues to see strong operational growth for Prevnar 20, Vyndaqel and Eliquis, and in total, it had 10 medicines and vaccines that generated more than $1 billion in revenue in 2022.Story continuesPfizer also completed its acquisition of Biohaven Pharmaceuticals in October 2022, showing its continued willingness to invest in acquiring promising treatments on top of its own research and development.Cash injection can fuel growth and secure dividendsWhile caution on the impending decline of Pfizers Covid-related revenue is certainly merited, one often overlooked point is the cash injection has the potential to help the company grow for many years to come, giving it the financial flexibility to make key acquisitions, invest in research and development and even continue paying its dividend, which has a trailing 12-month yield of 3.64%.Pfizers balance sheet is more stable than it has been since 2014 with a GuruFocus financial strength rank of 7 out of 10, driven by an Altman Z-Score of 3.57, and interest coverage ratio of 27.5 and a cash-debt ratio of 1.01.All too often, mature drug giants can end up slowing down or even entering long-term decline due to being unable to invest sufficient funds to continue developing their pipelines. The cash from Pfizers Covid vaccine and treatment decreases the chances of this happening to it in the near future.Valuation breakdownAt a price-earnings ratio of 8.49, Pfizer is just over half of its historical average price-earnings ratio. To put things into historical perspective, 2020 revenue clocked in at $41 billion, and Pfizers stock traded in a range of $29 to $41 for the year (the stock was not impacted overmuch by the Covid market crash and subsequent bull market due to its defensive nature and its early involvement in researching Covid vaccine candidates). Now the stock trades around $41 while projected 2023 revenue is in the range of $67 billion to $71 billion.The GF Value chart rates the stock as modestly undervalued; note that it is not just trading below its current GF Value estimate, it is also trading below the GF Value for 2025. This estimate takes into account historical growth, past valuation multiples and analysts estimates of future growth (analysts from Morningstar (MORN) project revenue to decline about 14.82% per year for the next three to five years).Pfizer Can't Catch a Break, but Investors CanThe vast majority of this decline will be related to Covid revenues, according to Pfizer. The company expects its ex-Covid operating business to grow between 7% and 9% in full-year 2023, which is consistent with recent years when we take foreign exchange into consideration.I doubt Pfizers stock price will show much upward movement while the fall-off from Covid-related revenue is still ongoing. The stock may also be suffering somewhat of a reputational blow as Pfizer has been called out for focusing on profits when it could have saved more lives if it had waived its intellectual property rights to the Covid vaccine, thereby allowing low-income countries the ability to access the vaccine without waiting for Pfizer to finish distributing to high-income countries.However, once everything evens out from the pandemic era, the growth in the companys operational revenue should carry the day, boosted by strong investments in research and development and new acquisitions.TakeawayPfizer has become increasingly undervalued as investors anticipate the impending fall-off of Covid-related revenue streams. When we look at the numbers as well as estimates of future growth in ex-Covid revenue streams and new pipeline opportunities, the decline in Pfizers valuation looks overblown. A recovery may take a while to develop potentially as long as it takes for Pfizers top line to begin growing again but investors do get a dividend yield of 3.64%, which is solid for a drug giant that is focusing its considerable cash reserves on growth.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Amazon has cut 18,000 jobs, with Google saying that it would trim 12,000 staff. Microsoft has said it will lay off 10,000 workers.Tech companies have been cutting staff numbers after aggressively hiring during the pandemic, betting on a permanent digital boom. However, amid a wider economic slowdown, they have been forced to scale back their ambitions.Mr Schulman, 65, said staff leaving would be treated with the “utmost respect and empathy”. He added he was “confident we will come through… together with compassion for each other”.Morale at tech companies has been plummeting after mass layoffs. Some staff have discovered they have been let go when their corporate login details stop working, or their work passes automatically deactivate.Mr Schulman, who last year received $32m (£26m) in salary and share-based payments, is a proponent of “stakeholder capitalism”, which calls for companies to serve the interests of employees, suppliers, the planet and the general public, rather than just their shareholders.The theory has been attacked by critics in the US by Republican politicians as a kind of “woke capitalism”.Mr Schulman has said the company’s values “centre around the fight against any kind of discrimination”. However, the company has come in for criticism from some UK politicians after last year it briefly cut off payments to free speech campaigner Toby Young. It later reversed the ban.The job cuts come after PayPal announced a share buyback programme worth up to $15bn last summer under pressure from activist shareholder Elliott Management.The company has also been seeking to cut costs after its share price tumbled last year.Separately, Intel, the chipmaker, is planning to cut executive pay as it seeks to save money without making mass redundancies. Its chief executive will take a 25pc base pay cut while other senior managers will see pay fall by 10pc.]"

The wave of layoffs continuing. Yeah, McDonald's.SEANA SMITH: I liked it. I like [INAUDIBLE].DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, digestion joke. All right, cheesy.Continuing now with PayPal joining the list. The company announcing it's letting go of 7% of its employees. Here now with what we can expect we have the Allies, Allie Canal and Allie Garfinkle. I've been working on ideas, names. Like ""Allie Oop"" I think is where I settled.ALEXANDRA CANAL: ""Allie Squared."" I like ""Allie Oop,"" though.DAVE BRIGGS: ""Allie Squared.""SEANA SMITH: ""Allie Oop"" is a little-- it rolls off the tongue a little bit.DAVE BRIGGS: ""Allie Oop"" I kind of like.ALLIE GARFINKLE: There's a simple elegance to it.DAVE BRIGGS: We can have a Twitter poll, and we'll decide. Nice to have you both here in studio. We'll start with this Allie on the PayPal layoffs continuing throughout the tech sector.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Just another example of this trend that we continue to see. PayPal confirming that 7% reduction in staff, which translates to roughly 2,000 employees, and the cuts will take place over the coming weeks.Now, shares of PayPal did touch session highs on the heels of this news, climbing as much as 3.5%. Shares are currently up about 2% at the moment.But like I said, we've seen this story before, a surge in layoffs after a period of really high personnel spend, heavy investments during the pandemic. So that's trend number one surrounding this earnings season.And then trend number two is that unfavorable macro environment-- a hawkish Fed, a pullback in spending, and probably most important heading into this week in particular, that advertising slowdown still very much in the background. We've heard from several companies that advertising is still an up-and-down story. Spotify saying this morning the ad market is still uncertain.Story continuesAnd coupled with that, Cowan actually published a survey earlier this month that showed online ad buyers expect their spending in 2023 to rise just 3.3%, which is the softest ad-growth outlook in five years.So for companies like Snap, companies like Google, whose businesses really rely on advertising, that ain't good, and that's just a trend that's weighing on earnings, weighing on guidance moving forward in the tech industry.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, it certainly has. And, Allie, I know you're digging into the Snap results, what we're expecting to see here in just under an hour from now. That ad spending is going to be front and center here because we know last quarter, it was pretty ugly when it came to Snap.ALLIE GARFINKLE: Yeah, and front and center doesn't even actually begin to describe it. When I was looking at Snap's figures, something became really clear to me, and it's that Snap's revenue is ad revenue.Here are some staggering numbers for you guys. In 2021, 2020, and 2019, advertising revenue accounted for between 99% and 98% of Snap's total revenue. So this time last year, Snap was describing its advertising business as seasonal and volatile.So the stakes are high. They're uncertain. And in the company's last earnings call-- Snap is aware of this, right? In the company's last earning call, CEO Evan Spiegel talked about needing to diversify, needing to have other sources of revenue. However, we'll see if they can actually do that.In that earnings call, what he talked about was efficiency, ROI. What he said, essentially, was ""To achieve this, we're driving-- we're investing in driving scalable, lower-funnel performance for our advertising partners and making improvements to our ad platform."" So in about an hour-- less now, we'll see if they've started to deliver on that.Second thing to remember is TikTok. We've talked about on this show quite a bit. Analysts are really worried about the competition from TikTok, and I think I wouldn't count them out. Despite all the talk about bans, I wouldn't count them out by any means at all as a competitor to Snap because the reality is Gen Z is TikTok's demographic. Gen Z is Snap's demographic.DAVE BRIGGS: No question. Here's where the ""Allie Oop"" comes in. She puts it up in the air. You slam dunk it--ALEXANDRA CANAL: I got it.DAVE BRIGGS: --and add to it.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I want to pick up on something you said, which is the word efficiency. And this is going to be the million-dollar word on all of these earnings calls. On Spotify this morning, if I had a penny for every time CEO Daniel Ek said the word efficiency, I'd probably have about a quarter, but that's where all of these tech companies are going towards, right? This growth at all costs strategy, it doesn't fly anymore on Wall Street.They had to spend a lot in order to keep up. They can't really do that anymore. They need to curb their expenses, and that's not just on the headcount front. I think they're looking at their products. They're looking at their brands. They're looking at everything within their companies to see where they could trim costs because that's what they need to do amid this unfavorable environment. So that's something to look out for, I think.SEANA SMITH: And they certainly do need to cut costs. That's going to be in focus here with Snap. We know Snap was one of the early ones in terms of trimming their headcount so significantly. So I think analysts are asking whether or not more cuts are likely on the table and what exactly that will look like.""Allie Oops,"" thanks so much. I like it.DAVE BRIGGS: We can work on it.[INTERPOSING VOICES]ALLIE GARFINKLE: I like it. I like it. I like it. Let's do it.]"

(PRNewsfoto/IBM)Foundation models are types of AI models that are trained on a broad set of unlabeled data, can be used for different tasks, and can apply information about one situation to another. These models have rapidly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP) technology over the last five years, and IBM is pioneering applications of foundation models beyond language.Earth observations that allow scientists to study and monitor our planet are being gathered at unprecedented rates and volume. New and innovative approaches are required to extract knowledge from these vast data resources. The goal of this work is to provide an easier way for researchers to analyze and draw insights from these large datasets. IBM's foundation model technology has the potential to speed up the discovery and analysis of these data in order to quickly advance the scientific understanding of Earth and response to climate-related issues.IBM and NASA plan to develop several new technologies to extract insights from Earth observations. One project will train an IBM geospatial intelligence foundation model on NASA's Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset, a record of land cover and land use changes captured by Earth-orbiting satellites. By analyzing petabytes of satellite data to identify changes in the geographic footprint of phenomena such as natural disasters, cyclical crop yields, and wildlife habitats, this foundation model technology will help researchers provide critical analysis of our planet's environmental systems.Story continuesAnother output from this collaboration is expected to be an easily searchable corpus of Earth science literature. IBM has developed an NLP model trained on nearly 300,000 Earth science journal articles to organize the literature and make it easier to discover new knowledge. Containing one of the largest AI workloads trained on Red Hat's OpenShift software to date, the fully trained model uses PrimeQA, IBM's open-source multilingual question-answering system. Beyond providing a resource to researchers, the new language model for Earth science could be infused into NASA's scientific data management and stewardship processes.""The beauty of foundation models is they can potentially be used for many downstream applications,"" said Rahul Ramachandran, senior research scientist at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. ""Building these foundation models cannot be tackled by small teams,"" he added. ""You need teams across different organizations to bring their different perspectives, resources, and skill sets.""""Foundation models have proven successful in natural language processing, and it's time to expand that to new domains and modalities important for business and society,"" said Raghu Ganti, principal researcher at IBM. ""Applying foundation models to geospatial, event-sequence, time-series, and other non-language factors within Earth science data could make enormously valuable insights and information suddenly available to a much wider group of researchers, businesses, and citizens. Ultimately, it could facilitate a larger number of people working on some of our most pressing climate issues.""Other potential IBM-NASA joint projects in this agreement include constructing a foundation model for weather and climate prediction using MERRA-2, a dataset of atmospheric observations. This collaboration is part of NASA's Open-Source Science Initiative, a commitment to building an inclusive, transparent, and collaborative open science community over the next decade.For more information about this collaboration, visit the IBM Research Blog.Statements regarding IBM's future direction and intent are subject to change or withdrawal without notice, and represent goals and objectives only.Press contactBethany Hill McCarthyIBM ResearchBethany@ibm.comCisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-and-nasa-collaborate-to-research-impact-of-climate-change-with-ai-301735386.htmlSOURCE IBMCisionView original content to download multimedia: http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/February2023/01/c5512.html]"

Valero's margins more than doubled to $6.3 billion from a year earlier.""Most people in the trade today think that the sanctions will actually result in a reduction in Russian refinery utilization, and you'll see lower exports of VGO and diesel coming out of Russia when the sanctions take place,"" Gary Simmons, chief commercial officer at Valero, said last week.Lower diesel inventories with VGO and the EU ban's potential impact on Russian exports will further bolster refining margins, Rick Hessling, a Marathon senior vice president, said Tuesday.Marathon exports up to 350,000 barrels per day to Latin America, but is seeing ""an incremental pull into Europe,"" according to Brian Partee, senior vice president of global clean products. The full impact of the EU ban likely won't be felt until the second quarter, he added.If Russia discounts its fuel exports, they may set the ""minimum price"" in those marketplaces where U.S. refiners also compete, said Richard Harbison, senior vice president of refining at Phillips 66.Story continuesRussian exports into Northwest Europe accelerated ahead of the ban, which could impact U.S. exports, refiners said.""We're entering the sanction period of time at really historically high levels of inventory,"" said Marathon's Partee.Still, Russian fuel has product specification that could make it difficult to place in markets unaccustomed to the fuel, he said."" supply assurance component is really a big unknown,"" he added.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $35.61 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Marathon Petroleum shares have added about 11% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.6%.What's Next for Marathon Petroleum?While Marathon Petroleum has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook.

276,1f96b79c-412f-3d5a-be63-ff272fa2218e,TAP,2023-02-01,Molson Coors Beverage Company's (NYSE:TAP) Financials Are Too Obscure To Link With Current Share Price Momentum: What's In Store For the Stock?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/molson-coors-beverage-companys-nyse-115003903.html,1675252203,STORY,['TAP-A'],"[Molson Coors Beverage's (NYSE:TAP) stock up by 6.3% over the past three months. However, we decided to study the company's mixed-bag of fundamentals to assess what this could mean for future share prices, as stock prices tend to be aligned with a company's long-term financial performance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Molson Coors Beverage's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Molson Coors Beverage How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Molson Coors Beverage is:3.6% = US$486m ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.04 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Molson Coors Beverage's Earnings Growth And 3.6% ROEAs you can see, Molson Coors Beverage's ROE looks pretty weak. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 16%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. For this reason, Molson Coors Beverage's five year net income decline of 39% is not surprising given its lower ROE. We believe that there also might be other aspects that are negatively influencing the company's earnings prospects. Such as - low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesThat being said, we compared Molson Coors Beverage's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 11% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is TAP worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether TAP is currently mispriced by the market.Is Molson Coors Beverage Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Molson Coors Beverage's low three-year median payout ratio of 15% (or a retention ratio of 85%) over the last three years should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings to fuel its growth but the company's earnings have actually shrunk. This typically shouldn't be the case when a company is retaining most of its earnings. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For example, the company's business may be deteriorating.Moreover, Molson Coors Beverage has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 37% over the next three years. However, Molson Coors Beverage's future ROE is expected to rise to 6.3% despite the expected increase in the company's payout ratio. We infer that there could be other factors that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that the performance shown by Molson Coors Beverage can be open to many interpretations. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate.

So is there a pricing problem in the sector, or is it pretty isolated at this point?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I think you could say it's company by company in terms of what they need to kind of get done to meet their goals, right? And speaking of GM, a huge quarter for them, strong results, strong guidance. I have some key takeaways here, like you mentioned.So they blew the doors off 2022, record Q4 revenue. And then 2023 EBIT guidance, really strong there. Citi called it solid. Morgan Stanley said it was-- sets a high bar for the year. So a really strong performance financially there--And like you said from what-- from Paul Jacobson, pricing not a problem. He said that we're-- they're not-- they don't need to compete on that level. Mary Barra really hit that hard, GMC on the conference call, saying that we've got the cheap Equinox coming out, the cheap EV Blazer, the Silverado work truck all coming out this year.They're all going to be below that $55,000 EV tax credit price cap. So they're pretty happy with where they're at with these cheaper EVs. So they don't see the need to cut prices like Ford and Tesla are doing right now.Story continuesAnd then finally, demand is strong there. They're talking about how they're the number one large truck maker, large SUVs, midsize pickups, full-size pickups, number one in the-- over Ford. And then also the Chevy Bolt EV had its record-selling year this year. They're going to increase output next year. So they're confident that they have the right game plan in place, right portfolio in place to do that.DAVE BRIGGS: And they've even invested $650 million in Lithium Americas, which popped 13% today, an interesting sidebar to their report, Seana.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Pras, it was interesting what you just said when you compared all three, when you compare Tesla to GM to Ford, what we're seeing in terms of pricing. Obviously, we got the news last week about Ford cutting the price of its Mustang Mach-E. Why were then they forced to cut prices? And does this signal that maybe we could see broader price cuts at Ford?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So that Mustang Mach-E is taking-- really battling head-to-head with Tesla's Model Y. And after Elon Musk cut the price of that truck-- or that SUV by 20% at certain levels, Ford had to respond.It seems that some of those trim levels might be selling at a loss for Ford, but they said that we're not going to cede ground in this battle. So they see it as a protracted, sort of winner-take-all, who can kind of live out these sort of margin compression type of battle. But I think Ford understands that this is just the beginning of this. And they're ready to do that.But also the F-150 Lightning, they're not cutting that price. They've raised the prices. They can't sell enough. So it's only for specific, I guess, product models and product segments.DAVE BRIGGS: It's one car!PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, I think there was too much made of the cut at Ford. There was one automobile that they-- that they cut prices on and only because, to your point, it's a direct competitor with that Tesla model. I think a little bit too much made.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, but it's also important to point out that GM did cut prices, what, six months ago, back last summer--DAVE BRIGGS: In June.SEANA SMITH: --in terms of some of their EVs. So there certainly has been a pricing war brewing now--PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Huge, huge price cut for Bolt.SEANA SMITH: --for some time.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, yeah.SEANA SMITH: Yeah.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: And it ginned up sales.SEANA SMITH: And they did, yeah. It certainly seems to be working out, at least in their favor for now.]"

If the technology is successful, Blue Blade is expected to proceed with the construction of a pilot facility in 2024, followed by a full-scale facility that could begin commercial operations by 2028. The offtake agreement could provide for enough SAF to fly more than 50,000 flights annually between United's hub airports in Chicago and Denver.*Blue Blade's new SAF technology was developed by researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), a leading center for technological innovation in sustainable energy. SAF, which uses non-petroleum feedstock, is a low-carbon alternative to traditional jet fuel that offers up to 85%** lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions.""The production and use of SAF is the most effective and scalable tool the airline industry has to reduce carbon emissions and United continues to lead the way,"" said United Airlines Ventures President Michael Leskinen. ""This new joint venture includes two expert collaborators that have the experience to construct and operate large-scale infrastructure, as well as the feedstock supply necessary for success. Once operational, Blue Blade Energy has the potential to create United's largest source of SAF providing up to 135 million gallons of fuel annually.""United, Tallgrass, and Green Plains will each provide their unique industry expertise to help develop the joint venture. Under this collaborative approach:Story continuesTallgrass will manage research and development of the technology, including pilot plant development, and will manage the construction of the production facility.Green Plains will supply the low-carbon ethanol feedstock, and use its ethanol industry expertise to manage operations once the pilot facility is constructed.United Airlines will assist with SAF development, fuel certification and into-wing logistics, and has also agreed to purchase up to 2.7 billion gallons of SAF produced from the joint venture.""At Tallgrass, we are striving to innovate how we deliver the energy that powers our nation and enables our quality of life,"" said Alison Nelson, Vice President, Business Development at Tallgrass. ""Air travel uniquely connects people and improves lives, and the advancement of this novel SAF technology presents a meaningful opportunity to reduce emissions from aviation.  We are excited to partner with industry leaders United Airlines and Green Plains on this initiative.""If the technology is commercialized, the location of Blue Blade's initial plant would allow easy access to low-carbon feedstock from Green Plains' Midwest ethanol production facilities. While the initial SAF facility intends to use ethanol, the technology has the capability to work with any alcohol-based feedstock as its fuel source.""Our transformation to a true decarbonized biorefinery model has positioned Green Plains to help our customers and partners reduce the carbon intensity of their products by producing low-carbon proteins, oils, sugars and now decarbonized ethanol to be used in SAF,"" said Todd Becker, President and CEO of Green Plains. ""This partnership with world class organizations like United Airlines and Tallgrass, shows the value creation that is possible with our low-carbon platform. The potential impact of this project is a gamechanger for US agriculture, aligning a strong farm economy and a robust aviation transport industry focused on decarbonizing our skies.""Blue Blade Energy marks one of the largest direct investments from United Airlines Ventures (UAV), United's corporate venture arm, into SAF. Launched in 2021, UAV targets startups, upcoming technologies, and sustainability concepts that will complement United's goal of net zero emissions by 2050 without relying on traditional carbon offsets. United has aggressively pursued strategic investments in SAF producers and revolutionary technologies including carbon capture, hydrogen-electric engines, electric regional aircraft and air taxis.*Assuming current regulations requiring SAF to be blended with conventional jet fuel are removed to allow for the use of unblended SAF.  **Based on United’s current SAF supplyAbout UnitedUnited's shared purpose is ""Connecting People.

This compares to FFO of $1.55 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 1.09%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of $1.87 per share when it actually produced FFO of $1.91, delivering a surprise of 2.14%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates four times.Boston Properties , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $739.09 million for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.85%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $690.91 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Boston Properties shares have added about 6.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.6%.What's Next for Boston Properties?While Boston Properties has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Boston Properties: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure, but we believe the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO and FFO per share to be useful measures for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO per share can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies.Our calculation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current Nareit definition or that interpret the current Nareit definition differently.In order to facilitate a clear understanding of the Company’s operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders as presented in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. FFO should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to the Company’s financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.PORTFOLIO LEASING PERCENTAGES% Leased by LocationDecember 31, 2022December 31, 2021Boston90.2 %91.4 %Los Angeles88.3 %88.8 %New York86.8 %87.6 %San Francisco88.5 %87.3 %Seattle88.3 %90.9 %Washington, DC88.7 %87.2 %Total Portfolio88.6 %88.8 %View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230131006159/en/ContactsAT BXP Michael LaBelleExecutive Vice President,Chief Financial Officer and Treasurermlabelle@bxp.comHelen HanVice President, Investor Relationshhan@bxp.com]"

296,d233655b-5b81-35f6-98be-31c75f513e9e,NAVI,2023-02-01,What Makes Navient (NAVI) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-navient-navi-strong-momentum-170005405.html,1675184405,STORY,['NAVI'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Navient (NAVI), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Navient currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if NAVI is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this student loan servicing company holds up.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor NAVI, shares are up 6.11% over the past week while the Zacks Financial - Consumer Loans industry is up 2.26% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 12.77% compares favorably with the industry's 12.77% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Navient have risen 20.38%, and are up 6.43% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 3.5% and -7.86%, respectively.Investors should also take note of NAVI's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, NAVI is averaging 998,968 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with NAVI.Over the past two months, 4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost NAVI's consensus estimate, increasing from $2.87 to $3.16 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that NAVI is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Navient on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(""Grupo Gondi"") for $970 million, plus the assumption of debtDivested two uncoated recycled paperboard mills (""URB"") for $50 million, subject to a working capital adjustment, and recorded an $11 million pre-tax gain on sale""I’m pleased to report that WestRock grew packaging revenue and margins in the first quarter, even in this challenging environment,"" said David B. Sewell, chief executive officer. ""We also finalized the acquisition of Grupo Gondi, which expands our global footprint and enables us to take a leading position in the packaging marketplace in Mexico.""During the quarter, elevated inflation and softening macroeconomic conditions negatively impacted our Global Paper business. While we expect these market conditions to continue in the near-term, we remain committed to executing on our strategy and delivering on our productivity efforts. WestRock’s broad portfolio of products provides us with flexibility to manage through changing market conditions to maximize our performance.""Story continuesConsolidated Financial ResultsWestRock’s performance for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in millions):Three Months EndedDec. 31, 2022Dec. 31, 2021$ Var.% Var.Net sales$4,923.1$4,952.2$(29.1)-0.6%Net income$45.3$182.3$(137.0)(75.2)%Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA$652.1$680.3$(28.2)-4.1%Net sales decreased $29 million, or 0.6%, year-over-year. Consumer Packaging segment sales increased $76 million, or 6.7%, Corrugated Packaging segment sales increased $15 million, or 0.7%; Distribution segment sales decreased $3 million, or 1.0%; Global Paper segment sales decreased $229 million, or 16.9%; and intersegment sales decreased $10 million. Net sales in the current year quarter included $102 million related to the consolidation of Grupo Gondi.Net income decreased $137 million year-over-year to $45 million. The decrease in net income was driven by increased net cost inflation, lower volumes, economic downtime, the Mahrt mill work stoppage, increased non-cash pension costs, increased restructuring and other costs, business systems transformation costs and a non-cash loss related to the Grupo Gondi acquisition which were partially offset by the margin impact from higher price/mix and a gain on sale of two URB mills. The Grupo Gondi loss primarily relates to the non-cash write-off of prior foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, as well as the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the carrying value of our prior ownership interest.Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA decreased $28 million, or 4.1%, year-over-year, primarily due to lower Global Paper segment Adjusted EBITDA that was partially offset by increased Adjusted EBITDA in our Corrugated Packaging and Consumer Packaging segments. Grupo Gondi contributed $17.3 million of Adjusted EBITDA for the month of December 2022.Additional information about the changes in segment sales and Adjusted EBITDA by segment are included below.Restructuring and Other CostsRestructuring and other costs during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were $33 million. The charges were primarily related to acquisition, integration and divestiture costs aggregating $17 million, with the balance due primarily to severance related to reduction in force initiatives and costs associated with previously announced closures.Cash Flow ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $266 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $253 million in the prior year quarter.Total debt was $9.5 billion at December 31, 2022, $9.3 billion excluding $171 million of unamortized fair market value step-up of debt acquired in mergers and acquisitions, and $8.9 billion after further excluding cash and cash equivalents of $415 million. Total debt increased $1.7 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining 67.7% interest in Grupo Gondi including the assumption of debt. The Company had approximately $3.3 billion of available liquidity from long-term committed credit facilities and cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022.During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, WestRock invested $282 million in capital expenditures and returned $70 million in capital to stockholders in dividend payments.Segment ResultsDue to the timing of the Grupo Gondi acquisition, it was not practicable to allocate its results to our operating segments for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. As a result, we included the results for the month of December 2022 in ""Other unallocated"".WestRock’s segment performance for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was as follows (in millions):Corrugated Packaging SegmentThree Months EndedDec. 31, 2022Dec. 31, 2021Var.% Var.Segment sales$2,235.2$2,220.0$15.20.7%Adjusted EBITDA$309.2$288.9$20.37.0%Adjusted EBITDA Margin13.8%13.0%80 bpsCorrugated Packaging segment sales increased $15 million, or 0.7%, primarily due to higher selling price/mix that was largely offset by lower volumes. The first quarter of fiscal 2023 had one less shipping day than the prior year quarter.Corrugated Packaging Adjusted EBITDA increased $20 million, or 7.0%, primarily due to the margin impact from higher selling price/mix, that was largely offset by increased net cost inflation, lower volumes and higher operating costs, including economic downtime.

accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP""). However, management believes certain non-GAAP financial measures provide WestRock’s management, board of directors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our ongoing performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions, and in evaluating WestRock’s performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, WestRock’s GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we present may differ from similarly captioned measures presented by other companies.Business Systems Transformation CostsIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, WestRock launched a multi-year phased business systems transformation project. Due to the nature, scope and magnitude of this investment, management believes these incremental transformation costs are above the normal, recurring level of spending for information technology to support operations. Since these strategic investments, including incremental nonrecurring operating costs, will cease at the end of the investment period, are not expected to recur in the foreseeable future, and are not considered representative of our underlying operating performance, management believes presenting these costs as an adjustment in the non-GAAP results provides additional information to investors about trends in our operations and is useful for period-over-period comparisons. This presentation also allows investors to view our underlying operating results in the same manner as they are viewed by management.We discuss below details of the non-GAAP financial measures presented by us and provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAWestRock uses the non-GAAP financial measure ""Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA"", along with other factors such as ""Adjusted EBITDA"" (a GAAP measure of segment performance the Company uses to evaluate our segment results), to evaluate our overall performance. Management believes that the most directly comparable GAAP measure to ""Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA"" is ""Net income attributable to common stockholders"". It can also be derived by adding together each segment’s ""Adjusted EBITDA"" plus ""Non-allocated expenses"". Management believes this measure provides WestRock’s management, board of directors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate WestRock’s performance because it excludes restructuring and other costs, business systems transformation costs and other specific items that management believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of the business. WestRock’s management and board use this information to evaluate WestRock’s performance relative to other periods.Adjusted EBITDA, a GAAP measure of segment performance, is defined as pretax earnings of a reportable segment before depreciation, depletion and amortization, and excludes the following items the Company does not consider part of our segment performance: gain on sale of certain closed facilities, multiemployer pension withdrawal income, restructuring and other costs, non-allocated expenses, interest expense, net, other income, net, and other adjustments - each as outlined in the table on page 7 (""Adjusted EBITDA"").Adjusted Segment Sales and Adjusted EBITDA Margins, Excluding Trade SalesWestRock uses the non-GAAP financial measures ""Adjusted Segment Sales"" and ""Adjusted EBITDA Margins, excluding trade sales"". Management believes that adjusting segment sales for trade sales is consistent with how our peers present their sales for purposes of computing segment margins and helps WestRock’s management, board of directors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others compare companies in the same peer group. Management believes that the most directly comparable GAAP measure to ""Adjusted Segment Sales"" is ""segment sales"". Additionally, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to ""Adjusted EBITDA Margin, excluding trade sales"" is ""Adjusted EBITDA Margin"". ""Adjusted EBITDA Margin, excluding trade sales"" is calculated by dividing that segment’s Adjusted EBITDA by Adjusted Segment Sales. ""Adjusted EBITDA Margin"" is a GAAP profitability measure, and it is calculated for each segment by dividing that segment’s Adjusted EBITDA by segment sales.Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted ShareWestRock uses the non-GAAP financial measures ""Adjusted Net Income"" and ""Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share"". Management believes these measures provide WestRock’s management, board of directors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate WestRock’s performance because they exclude restructuring and other costs, business systems transformation costs and other specific items that management believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of the business. WestRock and its board of directors use this information to evaluate WestRock’s performance relative to other periods. WestRock believes that the most directly comparable GAAP measures to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share are Net income attributable to common stockholders.This release includes reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their respective directly comparable GAAP measures, as identified above, for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages).Reconciliations of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAThree Months EndedDecember 31,20222021Net Income attributable to common stockholders$45.3$182.3Adjustments: (1)Less: Net Income attributable to noncontrolling interests1.51.5Income tax expense8.358.6Other income, net(25.2)(0.2)Interest expense, net97.386.7Restructuring and other costs33.02.3Multiemployer pension withdrawal income-(3.3)Gain on sale of certain closed facilities(0.9)(14.4)Depreciation, depletion and amortization373.2366.5Other adjustments119.60.3Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA$652.1$680.3(1) Schedule adds back expense or subtracts income for certain financial statement and segmentfootnote items to compute Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA.Reconciliations of Adjusted Net IncomeThree Months Ended December 31, 2022Consolidated ResultsPre-TaxTaxNet of TaxAs reported (1)$55.1$(8.3)$46.8Mahrt mill work stoppage (2)41.6(10.2)31.4Restructuring and other costs33.0(8.0)25.0Loss on sale of previously held equity method investment net of deferred taxes (2)46.8(22.2)24.6Business systems transformation costs (2)20.2(4.9)15.3Purchase accounting inventory related adjustments (2)8.5(2.1)6.4Losses at closed facilities, transition and start-up costs (2)2.5(0.5)2.0Gain on sale of two uncoated recycled paperboard mills(11.1)2.8(8.3)Gain on sale of certain closed facilities(0.9)0.2(0.7)Other (2)0.5(0.1)0.4Adjusted Results$196.2$(53.3)$142.9Noncontrolling interests(1.5)Adjusted Net Income$141.4(1) The as reported results for Pre-Tax, Tax and Net of Tax are equivalent to the line items ""Income before income taxes"", ""Income tax expense"" and ""Consolidated net income"", respectively, as reported on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.(2) These footnoted items are the ""Other adjustments"" called out in the Segment Information table on page 7.

300,f979d142-c476-384b-a228-e83795929ccb,RCL,2023-02-01,Royal Caribbean (RCL) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/royal-caribbean-rcl-expected-beat-150003989.html,1675177203,STORY,['RCL'],"[The market expects Royal Caribbean (RCL) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 7, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis cruise operator is expected to post quarterly loss of $1.37 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +71.3%.Revenues are expected to be $2.6 billion, up 165.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 25.62% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Royal Caribbean?For Royal Caribbean, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.97%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Royal Caribbean will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Royal Caribbean would post earnings of $0.23 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.26, delivering a surprise of +13.04%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Royal Caribbean appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Visa (V) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Visa currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.18, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 22 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.18 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 22 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 19 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 86.4% and 9.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for VBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for VCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Visa here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Visa, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in V?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Visa, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1.5% over the past month to $8.41.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Visa.

(V) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-v-trending-stock-140002427.html,1675173602,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this global payments processor have returned +10.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.8% change. The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, to which Visa belongs, has gained 8.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Visa is expected to post earnings of $1.97 per share, indicating a change of +10.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.41 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12.1%. This estimate has changed +1.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.54 indicates a change of +13.5% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.7%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Visa is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for V _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Visa, the consensus sales estimate of $7.72 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.4%. The $32.16 billion and $35.49 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.7% and +10.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $7.94 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.4%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.81 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.68 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.38%. The EPS surprise was +8.46%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That equated to 12% of the company's total spending.Global Witness said that its own calculations showed Shell spent only 1.5%, or $288 million, of its total spending of $20 billion on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar.Shell rejected the accusations, saying it is ""confident that its financial disclosures are fully compliant with all SEC and other reporting requirements"".The complaint also requested that the SEC examine whether the inclusion of gas trading in Shell's renewables and energy solutions division ""constitutes a materially misleading misstatement"".Shell accelerated its investments in renewables in 2022 with the $1.55 billion acquisition of India-based Sprng and an agreement to buy Danish renewable natural gas company Nature Energy for $2 billion.

The gauge was being taken to a facility in the suburbs of state capital Perth - a distance further than the length of Great Britain.Rio was willing to pay for the cost of the search if asked by the state government, iron ore division head Simon Trott told reporters.""Of course the simple fact is this device should never have been lost,"" he said. ""We're sorry that that has occurred and we’re sorry for the concern that that has caused within the Western Australian community.""People had been told to stay at least five metres (16.5 feet) away if they spotted the capsule, because exposure could cause radiation burns or radiation sickness. However, driving past it was believed to be relatively low risk, akin to taking an X-ray.'NEEDLE IN THE HAYSTACK'Western Australia's Emergency Services Minister Stephen Dawson said the find was an ""extraordinary result"" after a search involving the state's emergency response department, defence authorities and radiation specialists.Story continues""When you consider the scope of the search area, locating this object was a monumental challenge, the search groups have quite literally found the needle in the haystack,"" he said.A 20-metre exclusion zone has been set up around the capsule while defence force members verify it via a serial number.It will then be placed in a lead container and stored overnight at a secure location in Newman, a mining town roughly 1,200 km (745 miles) north-west of Perth, before being taken to the state capital on Thursday. The silver capsule, 6 mm in diameter and 8 mm long, contains Caesium-137 which emits radiation equal to 10 X-rays per hour.Officials said the capsule apparently fell off a truck during transport and landed on the side of the road, adding that it was unlikely there would be contamination in the area.SEEKING ANSWERSRio said in a statement that it would investigate whether the use of specialist contractors had been appropriate, having entrusted the gauge to SGS Australia and Centurion for packaging and transport respectively.SGS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Centurion said in a statement it was seeking answers about how the capsule became dislodged during transport given the crate and pallet provided by SGS arrived in Perth in the same condition as at the start of the journey, and GPS data had shown no sudden changes in speed.""From a freight and logistics perspective this indicates a routine journey, and the fact that the crate was not opened for a week until after delivery reinforces that view,"" Centurion said.Western Australia's Chief Health Officer Andrew Robertson said there would be an investigation and prosecutions would be considered under state radiation safety laws from 1975.The maximum penalty for failing to safely handle radioactive substances is A$1,000 and A$50 per day the offence continues, though the state government said on Wednesday it was considering a change to laws to allow for bigger penalties.Officials said any change to penalties would not be retrospective.(Writing by Praveen Menon; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Jamie Freed)]"

In these rigorous and scientific network tests, Verizon’s network is undefeated in 95% of the metro drive tests (119 out of 125 markets) they performed in the last half of 2022. And if customers are interested in accessing the network quickly while on the go, Verizon is undefeated in the category of network accessibility in 90% of the markets tested (112 out of 125). Verizon is also undefeated in 89% of the metro markets (111 out of 125) when it comes to network reliability.* These tests, with data accumulated over several months, show a pattern of exceptional performance for customers who live and travel throughout the US.“Verizon customers don’t stand still and neither does our network,” said Kyle Malady, EVP and President, Global Network and Technology at Verizon. “Customers rely on Verizon’s network everyday and our engineers are hard at work for them– continuously enhancing, expanding and improving the wireless network to ensure they have the best possible experience when and where they need it.”Verizon’s network successes underscore a relentless focus on innovation and continued investment to provide the very best for Verizon customers. Verizon’s multi-purpose network is grounded on best-in-class spectrum position, extensive fiber ownership, and the incorporation of advanced technologies deployed from the core to the edge of Verizon’s award-winning network. This network-building formula enables a reliable, robust, secure, and high-performing network for innovation that can accommodate a variety of use cases including mobility, and fixed wireless access broadband for consumers and small businesses.Story continuesThe best is yet to comeAccelerated access to extensive spectrum holdings, a massive fiber footprint with evolved data capacity, and the use of the most advanced technologies available in the industry has allowed Verizon to offer a variety of services from a single, secure, robust and programmable multi-purpose network platform. In 2023, Verizon engineers have no plans to slow down.This year, Verizon will continue to expand coverage, introducing 5G Ultra Wideband service into even more rural and suburban areas. Additionally, as Verizon gains access to and deploys more C-band spectrum, network performance will continue to improve. Verizon will also build in new technologies that will allow customers to take advantage of customized experiences, and where more robust network resources are needed, Verizon engineers will continue to layer in capacity and performance using millimeter wave spectrum holdings.In addition to providing greater coverage, especially in rural and suburban areas, Verizon is also enhancing capacity by activating 100 MHz of C-Band spectrum in many markets, a significant step up from the 60 MHz of spectrum available when deployment first began. Once all of its licensed spectrum is made available, Verizon will have up to 200 MHz of C-Band spectrum deployed in many markets, which will provide exceptional speed and capacity.Complementing the wide coverage of Verizon’s premier C-Band spectrum, Verizon continues deploying 5G on millimeter wave spectrum, which provides for exponential capacity in areas with significantly dense populations such as venues, stadiums, arenas, airports, major metro areas, office complexes and more. Millimeter wave also continues to be used for private network deployments when enterprise customers need the fastest, most robust 5G service available for their enterprise applications.In addition to making 5G more accessible to more people, Verizon continues to focus on building out the advanced technologies that provide robust security, reliability and customized experiences for customers. Those advancements include fully deploying the 5G core with Verizon’s proprietary cloud platform built specifically for telco workloads, advancing the fiber network to handle expected exponential increases in data traffic, continuing massive virtualization of the network to add programmability and flexibility into the network, using artificial intelligence to drive reliability and performance, continuing to develop edge computing capabilities to drive down latency, and continuing to advance antenna configurations to drive speed and efficiency.Take advantage of the Verizon networkSwitch to Verizon to get our best price ever.

The carrier added 927,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the fourth quarter, the highest among its peers.But its churn rate, which refers to the percentage of customers who stopped using the company's services, was also the highest compared to rivals, at 0.92%. By contrast, Verizon reported churn of 0.89% for monthly phone subscribers while AT&amp;T's came in at 0.84%.Moreover, industry executives have hinted at a cool-down in growth as demand for phones with video-conferencing and premium plans that supported remote work fades as offices reopen.T-Mobile is also still growing its enterprise business to catch up with peers.It expects to add between 5 million and 5.5 million net monthly-bill paying subscribers in 2023, compared with the 6.4 million additions it reported in 2022.Many analysts shrugged off the tepid guidance, noting the company's track record of starting the year off conservative and then posting beat-and-raises. T-Mobile raised it subscriber additions forecast three times in 2022.The company earned $1.18 per share on revenue of $20.27 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with analysts' average estimate of $1.10 per share profit on revenue of $20.60 billion, according to Refinitiv data.Executives did not provide an update on the costs it may incur related to the data breach it reported in January, that may have exposed 37 million postpaid and prepaid accounts.Adjusted profit after deducting lease revenues is expected to be between $28.7 billion and $29.2 billion in 2023, up 10% year over year at the mid-point, T-Mobile said.Shares in the Bellevue, Washington-based company fell 1.6% in premarket trading. They are up about 7% so far this year. (Reporting by Eva Mathews in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli and Mark Porter)]"

With 65% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of NVIDIA, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NVIDIA?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that NVIDIA does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NVIDIA's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. NVIDIA is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.3% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.2% and 5.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. In addition, we found that Jen-Hsun Huang, the CEO has 3.5% of the shares allocated to their name.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of NVIDIAThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.We can see that insiders own shares in NVIDIA Corporation. Insiders own US$19b worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipWith a 31% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over NVIDIA. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for NVIDIA  you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

Elsewhere, the Dow gained 1.09%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 6.63%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence had gained 31.12% over the past month. This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 9.6% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.75% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Nvidia as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be February 22, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Nvidia to post earnings of $0.81 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 38.64%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $6.01 billion, down 21.31% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.26 per share and revenue of $26.94 billion. These totals would mark changes of -26.58% and +0.09%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Nvidia should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.01% lower. Nvidia is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Story continuesValuation is also important, so investors should note that Nvidia has a Forward P/E ratio of 58.71 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 21.4, which means Nvidia is trading at a premium to the group.Meanwhile, NVDA's PEG ratio is currently 4.88. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate.

""Although the demand environment is mixed, we are confident in our ability to gain market share in 2023 and deliver long-term growth based on our differentiated product portfolio.”AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su speaks at the AMD Keynote address during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) on January 4, 2023 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Robyn BECK / AFP) (Photo by ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images)Despite the positive Q4 report, AMD warned that it will see a 10% decline in revenue in Q1. That looks to be largely the result of an expected drop in its Client and Gaming segments' revenue.AMD’s earnings come as the broader PC industry deals with a massive slowdown in computer sales following the explosive growth the sector saw during the pandemic. The company reported a 51% year-over-year decline in processor shipments, and an operating loss for its Client segment of $152 million, compared to income of $530 million just last year.According to Gartner, Q4 worldwide PC shipments declined a stunning 28.5%, the biggest decline since the firm started following shipments in the mid-1990s. Intel saw similarly poor performance in its Client Computing business revenue falling 36% year-over-year to $6.6 billion from $10.1 billion in Q4 2021.Microsoft (MSFT), meanwhile, saw its Windows OEM business, which supplies Windows licenses to third-party customers, fall 39% year-over-year in its most recent quarter.Story continuesStill, AMD reported 42% year-over-year grown in its Data Center business on revenue of $1.7 billion.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +31.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.8% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has gained 21.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share, indicating a change of -38.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.26 points to a change of -26.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.38 indicates a change of +34.2% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NVDA _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $6.01 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -21.3%. The $26.94 billion and $29.3 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.1% and +8.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNvidia reported revenues of $5.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -16.5%. EPS of $0.58 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.93 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.02%. The EPS surprise was -17.14%.Over the last four quarters, Nvidia surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in one, the average surprise being 6.06%.Factors at PlayLabCorp has been registering an ongoing sales rebound in the base business for both Diagnostics and Drug Development segments. However, as the severity of the pandemic has declined, we expect the demand for COVID-19 testing services and vaccines to have been lower than the year-ago period’s levels, impacting the fourth-quarter sales performance. Also, the ongoing Ukraine-Russia crisis, a strengthening U.S. dollar and supply chain issues are expected to have adversely impacted LabCorp’s fourth-quarter performance.Covance Drug Development is likely to have benefited in Q3 from continued growth in the organic base business and a strong backlog of $15.2 billion at the end of the third quarter. The company expects approximately $4.7 billion of this backlog to convert into revenues over the next 12 months.Similar to the last reported quarter, growth in early development and clinical development is expected to have been offset by central labs on account of a significant slowdown in COVID-related work and the Russia-Ukraine crisis. On a positive note, LabCorp completed a comprehensive laboratory relationship with Ascension in the third quarter to manage Ascension’s hospital-based laboratories in 10 states and purchase select assets of the health system’s outreach laboratory business. The company also completed its acquisition of the outreach lab business and related assets of New Jersey-based RWJBarnabas Health during the third quarter. We believe these developments to have contributed to LabCorp’s Q4 revenues.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise Story continuesLaboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS SurpriseLaboratory Corporation of America Holdings price-eps-surprise | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Quote Turning to oncology. the company continues to deepen its leadership position by expanding its cancer-related diagnostic screening and testing portfolio and by partnering with its pharmaceutical clients. During the third quarter, the company formed a strategic partnership with MD Anderson Cancer Center Foundation in Spain to increase access to early-phase oncology clinical trials. The company also entered into a collaboration with Becton, Dickinson and Company to help match patients with critical and potentially life-changing treatments for cancer and other diseases. These developments are likely to have made significant contributions to the company’s fourth-quarter performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Covance Drug Development segment’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.41 billion, indicating a decline of 2.4% from the prior-year quarter’s figure. Our model projects Q4 drug development revenues to be $1.42 billion, a 2.2% decline year over year.Within LabCorp Diagnostics, base business organic volume is anticipated to have continued its rally, led by consistent growth in esoteric and routine procedures. However, a slowdown in COVID-19 testing is likely to have hampered sales performance within the segment. In this regard, in the third quarter, COVID-19 testing rates dropped and LabCorp expected the decline to continue further. This is expected to get reflected in the company’s Q4 earnings release.However, in terms of base business, during the third quarter, the company witnessed growing demand for its at-home testing and collection options through Labcorp OnDemand. The company also noted that its FDA authorization, combination COVID, flu and RSV at-home collection test continues to register strong demand with the rise of respiratory virus cases expected this fall and through the winter. We believe this trend to have continued through the fourth quarter, thus adding to the top line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LabCorp Diagnostics’ fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.34 billion, implying a 10.9% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Our model projects Q4 LabCorp Diagnostics’ revenues to be $2.32 billion, suggesting an 11.5% decline year over year.Key Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of $4.06 per share implies a 40% plunge from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.75 billion, suggesting a 7.5% fall from the prior-year reported number.What Our Model SuggestsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for LabCorp this time around.

The consensus mark for earnings stands at 94 cents per share, indicating a decline of 9.6% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to NoteBaxter anticipates total revenues to grow by mid-to-high single-digit percentage points year over year in the fourth quarter. The company expects sales growth of mid-teens on a constant currency basis and approximately flat on an operational basis.Robust demand for Baxter’s broad multi-chamber product offering is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter, driving sales of Baxter’s Clinical Nutrition segment. Moreover, a continued rise in surgical volume and elective surgical procedures is likely to have fueled strong growth in Advanced Surgery sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Clinical Nutrition segment and Advanced Surgery segment is pegged at $238 million and $255 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter.However, Renal Care segment sales declined in the first nine months of 2022 and the trend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter. Strong growth in Baxter’s PD business and IV therapy portfolio is likely to have been more than offset by lower in-center HD sales, lower infusion system sales and unfavorable currency movement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment stands at $938 million.The company has multiple collaborations to help manufacture COVID-19 vaccines. However, sales growth of the BioPharma Solutions segment is likely to have been hurt by challenging year-over-year comparisons, resulting from prior-year COVID-related sales. Sales at Acute Therapies segment is also likely to have faced a similar impact in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the BioPharma Solutions segment and the Acute Therapies segment is pegged at $140 million and $185 million, respectively.Story continuesBaxter International Inc. Price and ConsensusBaxter International Inc. Price and ConsensusBaxter International Inc. price-consensus-chart | Baxter International Inc. QuoteSales of the Pharmaceutical segment are likely to have been hurt by generic competition for certain molecules and supply constraints that impacted product availability. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment stands at $543 million.In the third quarter, Baxter’s global regions performed weakly due to unfavorable currency movements. In the Americas, Baxter reported revenues of $1.7 billion, down 1%. In EMEA, revenues totaled $692 million, down 11% from the year-ago quarter. In APAC, revenues of $643 million were down 11% year over year. The trend is likely to have continued in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, three new product categories added with the Hillrom buyout in December 2021 are likely to have brought additional sales during the fourth quarter. These product categories generated $735 million in the third quarter. Baxter anticipates that shortage of electromechanical components is likely to hamper sales growth for select businesses, including medication delivery, front line care and patient support systems.What Our Quantitative Model SuggestsPer our proven model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

336,a7835743-c4cb-336a-83d8-1db6f4b1772f,APD,2023-02-01,Earnings Preview: DuPont de Nemours (DD) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-dupont-nemours-dd-150003905.html,1675177203,STORY,"['DD', 'APD']","[The market expects DuPont de Nemours (DD) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 7, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis specialty chemicals maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.79 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -26.9%.Revenues are expected to be $3.08 billion, down 27.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10.19% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for DuPont de Nemours?For DuPont de Nemours, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.73%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that DuPont de Nemours will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that DuPont de Nemours would post earnings of $0.81 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.82, delivering a surprise of +1.23%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.DuPont de Nemours doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAir Products and Chemicals (APD), another stock in the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $2.73 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +8.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.29 billion, up 10% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Air Products and Chemicals has been revised 0.2% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 2.67%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggests that Air Products and Chemicals will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Don't Ignore These 2 Basic Materials Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-140002102.html,1675173602,STORY,"['ATI', 'APD']","[Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock.

(NASDAQ:CHRW) Delivered A Better ROE Than Its Industry",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/c-h-robinson-worldwide-inc-113429171.html,1675251269,STORY,['CHRW'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for C.H. Robinson Worldwide is:64% = US$1.1b ÷ US$1.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.64.Does C.H. Robinson Worldwide Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, C.H. Robinson Worldwide has a better ROE than the average (14%) in the Logistics industry.roeThat's what we like to see. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for C.H. Robinson Worldwide visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining C.H. Robinson Worldwide's Debt And Its 64% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by C.H. Robinson Worldwide, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.31. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

345,9f1857fb-1bea-3463-8873-50be3efd0dd2,DIS,2023-02-01,The Walt Disney Company's (NYSE:DIS) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 33% Above Its Share Price,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walt-disney-companys-nyse-dis-120039883.html,1675252839,STORY,['DIS'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Walt Disney The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.36bUS$7.47bUS$9.63bUS$13.3bUS$16.1bUS$18.2bUS$20.0bUS$21.5bUS$22.8bUS$23.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x10Analyst x7Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ 13.16%Est @ 9.81%Est @ 7.46%Est @ 5.82%Est @ 4.67% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.4% US$4.9kUS$6.4kUS$7.6kUS$9.6kUS$10.8kUS$11.2kUS$11.4kUS$11.3kUS$11.0kUS$10.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$95bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$24b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.4%– 2.0%) = US$379bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$379b÷ ( 1 + 8.4%)10= US$169bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$264b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$108, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 25% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Walt Disney as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.069. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Walt DisneyStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessNo major weaknesses identified for DIS.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

UWMC and Sprinklr CXM.Bet on These 3 Top-Ranked Liquid Stocks for Robust ReturnsInvestors looking for solid returns will benefit from adding stocks with favorable liquidity to their investment portfolio.Liquidity measures a company’s ability to meet short-term debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents. These stocks have always been on investors’ radar owing to their potential for solid returns.However, one should be cautious enough before investing in such stocks. High liquidity levels may indicate that the company is clearing its dues faster than its peers. However, it may also suggest that the company is unable to utilize its assets effectively.Hence, one may consider a company’s efficiency level in addition to its liquidity for identifying prospective winners.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. The ratio gauges a company’s potential to meet short- and long-term debt obligations. A current ratio — also known as the working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always suggest that the company is in good financial shape. It may also suggest that the firm failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1-3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike the current ratio, the quick ratio — also called the ‘acid-test ratio’ or the ‘quick assets ratio’ — indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory, excluding the current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of more than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, considering cash and cash equivalents and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet current debt obligations using the most liquid assets. Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may suggest sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.Story continuesA ratio greater than 1 is always desirable but may not always represent a company’s financial condition.Here are three stocks that qualified for the screen:Helmerich &amp; Payne is engaged in the contract drilling of oil and gas wells in the United States &amp; internationally.

Hydraulic fracturing firm Liberty Energy last week said it would reallocate equipment to more oily areas if there is a pullback on natural gas drilling due to low prices.Roughly 28 of Helmerich and Payne's 185 active drilling rigs, or 15%, are focused on gas plays and most of those are on term contracts, the company said on Tuesday.In North America, the company anticipates activating some 16 rigs this year, bringing its total to around 191. It said it lost one rig due to a fire.The company said it experienced higher costs associated with labor and supplies last year, but anticipates those to stabilize in 2023.Shares were down about 1% in midmorning trading to $48.12 each.Helmerich &amp; Payne reported net income of $97.1 million for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2022, up from a loss of $51.4 million in the same period last year.

These stocks have always been on investors’ radar owing to their potential for solid returns.However, one should be cautious enough before investing in such stocks. High liquidity levels may indicate that the company is clearing its dues faster than its peers. However, it may also suggest that the company is unable to utilize its assets effectively.Hence, one may consider a company’s efficiency level in addition to its liquidity for identifying prospective winners.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. The ratio gauges a company’s potential to meet short- and long-term debt obligations. A current ratio — also known as the working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always suggest that the company is in good financial shape. It may also suggest that the firm failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1-3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike the current ratio, the quick ratio — also called the ‘acid-test ratio’ or the ‘quick assets ratio’ — indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory, excluding the current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of more than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, considering cash and cash equivalents and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet current debt obligations using the most liquid assets. Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may suggest sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.Story continuesA ratio greater than 1 is always desirable but may not always represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersTo pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization — a widely-used measure of a company’s efficiency — as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales in the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.To ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than the industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Growth Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed the universe of more than 7,700 stocks to only threeHere are three stocks that qualified for the screen:Helmerich &amp; Payne HP is engaged in the contract drilling of oil and gas wells in the United States &amp; internationally. Its technologically-advanced FlexRigs are in great demand and it has upgraded most of its drilling feet with the latest technology. Customer acceptance of Helmerich &amp; Payne's digitization efforts has led to cost reduction, improvement in efficiency and higher profits. The contract driller's low debt levels, on an absolute and relative basis, are also positive in this difficult operating environment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2023 earnings is pegged at $4.48 per share, up 4.7% in the past 60 days. The company has a Growth Score of B and a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 124.2%, on average.UWM Holdings Corporation UWMC primarily underwrites and provides closing documentation for residential mortgage loans. It is the indirect parent company of United Wholesale Mortgage. The company is one of the leading wholesale mortgage lenders and purchase lenders in the United States. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings is pegged at 24 cents per share, up 9.1% in the past 60 days.

With the consensus EPS estimate being $0.65, the company has not delivered EPS surprise.While investors closely watch year-over-year changes in headline numbers -- revenue and earnings -- and how they compare to Wall Street expectations to determine their next course of action, some key metrics always provide a better insight into a company's underlying performance.As these metrics influence top- and bottom-line performance, comparing them to the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated helps investors project a stock's price performance more accurately.Here is how Juniper performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:Net revenues- AI-Driven Enterprise: $318.30 million versus the five-analyst average estimate of $281.85 million.

This compares to earnings of $0.56 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this computer network equipment maker would post earnings of $0.50 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.58, delivering a surprise of 16%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Juniper , which belongs to the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, posted revenues of $1.45 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.23%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.3 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Juniper shares have added about 0.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.6%.What's Next for Juniper?While Juniper has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Juniper: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.39 on $1.31 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.21 on $5.72 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Wireless Equipment is currently in the bottom 38% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher revenue, one-time debt extinguishment costs in 2021, and a lower tax rate, partially offset by a lower gross margin and higher operating expenses.Non-GAAP net income was $642.6 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $1.95, an increase of 12% year-over-year.The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is provided in a table immediately following the Preliminary Net Revenues by Geographic Region table below.Story continues""We experienced strong business momentum during the December quarter, including a second consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth, a record performance by our enterprise business, and our second-highest cloud revenue quarter,"" said Juniper’s CEO, Rami Rahim. ""Our experience-first networking strategy, focused on leveraging AI and cloud-delivered automation to improve customer operations and the end-user experience, continues to resonate across the markets we serve. We believe our differentiated solutions, along with our go-to-market investments and strong backlog, should position us to deliver another year of solid revenue growth in 2023.""""In addition to record revenue results, we achieved strong profitability during the December quarter, as non-GAAP gross and operating margin both exceeded the mid-point of our forecast and enabled us to beat the mid-point of our non-GAAP EPS outlook,"" said Juniper’s CFO, Ken Miller. ""We remain focused on delivering profitable growth and are confident in our ability to expand our non-GAAP operating margin by at least 100 basis points in 2023.""Balance Sheet and Other Financial ResultsTotal cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2022 were $1,230.0 million, compared to $1,693.5 million as of December 31, 2021, and $1,254.9 million as of September 30, 2022.Net cash flows provided by operations for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $119.6 million, compared to $116.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, and $51.8 million in the third quarter of 2022.Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was 76 days in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 69 days in the fourth quarter of 2021, and 65 days in the third quarter of 2022.Capital expenditures were $31.7 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was $51.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2022.First Quarter 2023 OutlookThese metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. Non-GAAP earnings per share is on a fully diluted basis. The outlook assumes that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies will remain relatively stable at current levels.We are still experiencing supply chain related headwinds associated with shortages as well as elevated component and freight costs, which are expected to continue through the course of 2023.At the mid-point of guidance, revenue is expected to be up 15% year-over-year.First quarter gross margin is expected to be down sequentially due to a normalized software mix and seasonality.We expect first quarter non-GAAP operating expense to increase sequentially, primarily driven by the typical seasonal increase of fringe costs. Despite these increases, operating margin is expected to increase more than 100 basis points versus Q1'22.Our guidance for the quarter ending March 31, 2023 is as follows:Revenue will be approximately $1,340 million, plus or minus $50 million.Non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 57.0%, plus or minus 1%.Non-GAAP operating expenses will be approximately $580 million, plus or minus $5 million.Non-GAAP operating margin will be approximately 13.7% at the mid-point of revenue guidance.Non-GAAP tax rate will be approximately 19.0%, plus or minus 1%.Non-GAAP net income per share will be approximately $0.42, plus or minus $0.05. This assumes a share count of approximately 330 million.For more detailed insight on guidance, please refer to the CFO Commentary that can be found on our website.Capital ReturnJuniper today announced that the Board of Directors declared a 5% increase in its quarterly cash dividend to $0.22 per share, to be paid on March 22, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 1, 2023.Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2022 Financial Commentary Available OnlineA CFO Commentary reviewing the Company’s fourth quarter 2022 and fiscal year 2022 financial results, as well as the first quarter 2023 financial outlook will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and published on the Company’s website at http://investor.juniper.net.

Juniper is unable to provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the overall high variability and low visibility of most of the foregoing items that have been excluded from these non-GAAP measures. For example, share-based compensation expense is impacted by the Company’s future hiring needs, the type and volume of equity awards necessary for such future hiring, and the price at which the Company’s stock will trade in those future periods. Amortization of intangible assets is significantly impacted by the timing and size of any future acquisitions. The items that are being excluded are difficult to predict and a reconciliation could result in disclosure that would be imprecise or potentially misleading.This press release, including the tables above, includes the following non-GAAP financial measures derived from our Preliminary Consolidated Statements of Operations: operating income; operating margin; net income; and diluted net income per share. These measures are not presented in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for GAAP. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the table above should not be considered in isolation from measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. Certain of the adjustments to our GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future.We utilize a number of different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, in analyzing and assessing the overall performance of our business, in making operating decisions, forecasting and planning for future periods, and determining payments under compensation programs. We consider the use of the non-GAAP measures presented above to be helpful in assessing the performance of the continuing operation of our business. By continuing operation, we mean the ongoing revenue and expenses of the business, excluding certain items that render comparisons with prior periods or analysis of on-going operating trends more difficult, such as expenses not directly related to the actual cash costs of development, sale, delivery or support of our products and services, or expenses that are reflected in periods unrelated to when the actual amounts were incurred or paid. Consistent with this approach, we believe that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the readers of our financial statements provides such readers with useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, allows for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance. In addition, we have historically reported non-GAAP results to the investment community and believe that continuing to provide non-GAAP measures provides investors with a tool for comparing results over time. In assessing the overall health of our business for the periods covered by the table above and, in particular, in evaluating the financial line items presented in the table above, we have excluded items in the following three general categories, each of which are described below: Acquisition Related Charges, Other Items, and Share-Based Compensation Related Items. We also provide additional detail below regarding the shares used to calculate our non-GAAP net income per share. Notes identified for line items in the table above correspond to the appropriate note description below. With respect to the items excluded from our forward-looking non-GAAP measures and reconciliation of such measures, please see the ""Outlook"" section above.The above tables and reconciliations can also be found on our Investor Relations website at http://investor.juniper.net.Note A: Acquisition Related Charges. We exclude certain expense items resulting from acquisitions including amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. The amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with acquisitions results in recording expenses in our GAAP financial statements that were already expensed by the acquired company before the acquisition and for which we have not expended cash. Moreover, had we internally developed the products acquired, the amortization of intangible assets, and the expenses of uncompleted research and development would have been expensed in prior periods. Accordingly, we analyze the performance of our operations in each period without regard to such expenses. In addition, acquisitions result in non-continuing operating expenses, which would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our business operations. We believe that providing non-GAAP information for acquisition-related expense items in addition to the corresponding GAAP information allows the users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historic and current results of our continuing operations, and also facilitates comparisons to less acquisitive peer companies.Note B: Other Items. We exclude certain other items that are the result of either unique, infrequent or unplanned events, including the following, when applicable: (i) strategic investment-related gain or loss, including gain or loss from our equity method investment; (ii) legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits; (iii) gain or loss on significant isolated events or transactions, including divestitures and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which are directly related to the events, objectively quantifiable, and not expected to occur regularly in the future that are not indicative of our core operating results; (iv) loss on extinguishment of debt; (v) significant effects of tax legislation and judicial or administrative interpretation of tax regulations, including the impact of income tax reform; (vi) recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits that are non-recurring in nature; and (vii) the income tax effect on our financial statements of excluding items related to our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, the non-GAAP results exclude the effects of NQDC-related investments. It is difficult to estimate the amount or timing of these items in advance. Although these events are reflected in our GAAP financial statements, these transactions may limit the comparability of our on-going operations with prior and future periods.In addition, we exclude restructuring benefits or charges as these result from events that arise from unforeseen circumstances, which often occur outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations. As such, we believe these expenses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred or comparisons to past operating results. We also exclude gains or losses related to strategic investments as well as significant isolated events as they are directly related to an event that is distinct and does not reflect current ongoing business operations. In the case of legal reserves and settlements, these gains or losses are recorded in the period in which the matter is concluded or resolved even though the subject matter of the underlying dispute may relate to multiple or different periods. As such, we believe that these expenses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing operations for the period in which they are incurred. Additionally, we exclude previously unrecognized tax benefits that are non-recurring in nature which are recorded in the period in which applicable statutes of limitation lapse or upon the completion of tax review cycles as the tax matter may relate to multiple or different periods. Further, certain items related to global tax reform may continue to impact the business and are generally unrelated to the current level of business activity. We believe these tax events limit the comparability with prior periods and that these expenses or benefits do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred. We also believe providing financial information with and without the income tax effect of excluding items related to our non-GAAP financial measures provide our management and users of the financial statements with better clarity regarding the on-going performance and future liquidity of our business. Because of these factors, we assess our operating performance with these amounts both included and excluded, and by providing this information, we believe the users of our financial statements are better able to understand the financial results of what we consider our continuing operations.Note C: Share-Based Compensation Related Items. We provide non-GAAP information relative to our expense for share-based compensation and related payroll tax. Due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types, which affect the calculations of share-based compensation, we believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation and related payroll tax allows for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to our peer companies and is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation on our results of operations. Further, expense associated with granting share-based awards does not reflect any cash expenditures by the company as no cash is expended.Note D: Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share Items. We provide diluted non-GAAP net income per share. The diluted non-GAAP net income per share includes additional dilution from potential issuance of common stock, except when such issuances would be anti-dilutive.Juniper Networks, Inc.Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets(in millions)(unaudited)December 31, 2022December 31, 2021ASSETSCurrent assets:Cash and cash equivalents$ 880.1$ 922.5Short-term investments210.3315.5Accounts receivable, net of allowances1,227.3994.4Inventory619.4272.6Prepaid expenses and other current assets680.0451.6Total current assets3,617.12,956.6Property and equipment, net666.8703.0Operating lease assets141.6161.3Long-term investments139.6455.5Purchased intangible assets, net160.5284.3Goodwill3,734.43,762.1Other long-term assets866.7564.2Total assets$ 9,326.7$ 8,887.0LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITYCurrent liabilities:Accounts payable$ 347.4$ 273.7Accrued compensation306.1336.0Deferred revenue1,020.5937.9Other accrued liabilities404.9328.9Total current liabilities2,078.91,876.5Long-term debt1,601.31,686.8Long-term deferred revenue642.6475.7Long-term income taxes payable279.4330.5Long-term operating lease liabilities117.7142.2Other long-term liabilities131.758.4Total liabilities4,851.64,570.1Total stockholders' equity4,475.14,316.9Total liabilities and stockholders' equity$ 9,326.7$ 8,887.0Juniper Networks, Inc.Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows(in millions)(unaudited)Twelve Months Ended December 31,20222021Cash flows from operating activities:Net income$471.0$252.7Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:Share-based compensation expense209.3222.6Depreciation, amortization, and accretion217.7237.4Operating lease assets expense40.344.9Gain on divestiture(45.8)—Loss from equity method investment4.8—Loss on extinguishment of debt—60.6Deferred income taxes(222.5)71.7Other(2.6)(1.1)Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions:Accounts receivable, net(232.0)(31.8)Prepaid expenses and other assets(658.0)(310.0)Accounts payable67.40.2Accrued compensation(23.1)70.3Income taxes payable21.124.3Other accrued liabilities(1.6)(80.8)Deferred revenue251.6128.7Net cash provided by operating activities97.6689.7Cash flows from investing activities:Purchases of property and equipment(105.1)(100.0)Proceeds from divestiture, net89.1—Purchases of available-for-sale debt securities(104.1)(649.8)Proceeds from sales of available-for-sale debt securities118.2546.1Proceeds from maturities and redemptions of available-for-sale debt securities390.3394.0Purchases of equity securities(16.5)(10.1)Proceeds from sales of equity securities47.725.6Payments for business acquisitions, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired—(182.6)Subsequent payments related to acquisitions in prior years(14.6)(10.1)Other2.50.7Net cash provided by investing activities407.513.8Cash flows from financing activities:Repurchase and retirement of common stock(315.2)(443.5)Proceeds from issuance of common stock57.256.4Payment of dividends(270.4)(259.1)Payment of debt—(423.8)Payment for debt extinguishment costs—(58.3)Other—(3.4)Net cash used in financing activities(528.4)(1,131.7)Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash(21.7)(12.1)Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash(45.0)(440.3)Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at beginning of period942.71,383.0Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at end of period$897.7$942.7Non-cash investing activity:Equity method investment$40.3$—View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230131005971/en/ContactsInvestor Relations: Jess LubertJuniper Networks(408) 936-3734jlubert@juniper.netMedia Relations: Leslie MooreJuniper Networks(408) 936-5767llmoore@juniper.net]"

I'm grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with people across the country who are passionate about an issue that's persisted since I worked in the Clinton Administration. To close out my ""digital equity tour"" of 2022, I had the privilege of traveling to the great city of Atlanta to spend time with many of the city's outstanding leaders and welcoming citizens.Striking StoriesOne of my favorite things about traveling is connecting with people whose lives are being changed through our digital equity efforts. Atlanta had no shortage of these inspiring stories.I met Shanard at a Digital Equity Summit, hosted by Inspiredu, a nonprofit that drives digital inclusion and literacy for Georgia families, communities, and schools. Shanard had recently been released from prison after having been incarcerated for more than 20 years. At first, he tried to succeed in his reentry journey without access to the Internet. But because the outside world had changed so much during his decades behind bars, he struggled.Early in 2022, Inspiredu helped Shanard enroll in Comcast's Internet Essentials program, which now provides free Internet service for millions when combined with the vouchers made available under the Federal Government's Affordable Connectivity Program. It was a big deal for him, because it was the first time in his life that he has home-based Internet access. Shanard described his newfound access to me as a ""game-changer"" in his life's prospects. Through the Internet, he has already obtained three educational certifications and even started his own home inspections company.During the summit, I also participated in a fireside chat with Richard Hicks, President and CEO of Inspiredu. We discussed the importance of home-based broadband adoption, digital literacy, and digitally centered workforce development programs. We also talked about digital navigators, who are trusted individuals in the community who can help people get online and teach them digital skills. They can make a big difference in helping people, like Shanard, overcome some of the challenges of signing up for Internet service and the ACP. And we discussed how signing up isn't all that's to it; the magic of Internet access comes when people make the most of what the Internet has to offer.Story continuesAttendees to the summit also heard from local community organizations as well. Representatives from Atlanta-based nonprofits TechBridge, Urban League of Greater Atlanta, Westside Works, and Advocates for Kids all shared impactful stories about their efforts to increase digital adoption in the community one family at a time.Sarah Winograd-Babayueski, Program Manager at Advocates for Children, shared an especially powerful story about a mother of two her organization is helping to get back on her feet. Hard times forced this mom and her kids to live in their car and in temporary motel housing. Despite all those harsh challenges, the family's high school-aged daughter still somehow had the fortitude to complete her ACTs so she could apply for college. Sarah, and Advocates for Children, are currently working on finding permanent housing for the mom and her two children. On behalf of Comcast, I donated a free laptop to this family, and we also pledged to help them apply for the Affordable Connectivity Program once they're established in a home.Dynamic DevicesSpeaking of free laptops, my trip to Atlanta wouldn't have been complete without a special holiday surprise! At KIPP Vision Primary and Academy School, we announced that all 500 students from grades three to seven were receiving free laptops courtesy of Comcast. Before the pandemic started, the students at KIPP Vision were ranked at the top of their district for academic achievement. However, since schools were shut down and the students were all sent home during the pandemic, many fell behind because they lacked the tools and technology necessary for remote learning. And, the school itself subsequently fell in its academic rankings. But now, with their new laptops, all those students can get online at home to do their homework and make up for some of the learning loss that they experienced.At KIPP Vision, I also had the opportunity to meet Muhammad Yungai, a mural artist and parent of two KIPP alumni. He was so inspired by the learning environment KIPP Public Schools has created, that he decided to ""give back"" by designing striking murals in KIPP schools across the Atlanta area. His images help foster a culture of pride, a sense of belonging, and a dash of style. For example, in one of the hallways we toured, Muhammed had painted book spines to inspire children to grow up with a love of reading. He also painted portraits of students throughout the building so they could see themselves as the special children they are.Giving BackAs a child, knowing you are valued and that your future matters to others can greatly impact your confidence and success throughout life. Growing up in Baltimore in the 1960's and 1970's, I faced challenges and experienced disparities comparable to other Black males of my generation, and even today. I was blessed by parents who refused to allow me to surrender to the obstacles. And, just as importantly, my mom and dad instilled in me the responsibility to give back and reach back. I've had unbelievable opportunities within my professional and personal life, but I'm always mindful about where I came from and how I can help create impactful change for others.This personal mission is what drives my passion to expand digital equity for all, so everyone can use their individual talents to change their lives for the better. I know that closing the digital divide carries with it the capacity to close other divides as well - housing, educational gaps, economic and work skill disparities, food insecurity, health care inequities, and so much more.I'm so proud of the work we at Comcast accomplished last year, and over the last decade. I look forward to 2023 and beyond as we travel to more cities and support more community partners in helping to get as many people connected to the Internet as possible so everyone can enjoy their own future of UNLIMITED POSSIBILITIES!Broderick Johnson is Executive Vice President, Public Policy &amp; Executive Vice President, Digital EquityView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Comcast Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Comcast CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/comcast-corporationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Comcast CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/737448/Empowering-Atlanta-and-Beyond-To-Reach-Unlimited-Possibilities]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Hot Oil Stocks To Buy Now. According to a Reuters poll on December 30, oil price gains in 2023 could remain capped amid threats to demand growth from a deteriorating global economy and reemergence of COVID-19 in China. A survey of 30 economists and analysts predicted that Brent crude would average $89.37 per barrel in 2023, a 4.6% decrease from the previous consensus of $93.65 in a November survey. The average price for the global benchmark in 2022 was $99 per barrel. Analysts forecast that the average price of U.S. crude in 2023 will be $84.84 per barrel, a decrease from the previous consensus of $87.80 in the previous month. Edward Moya, senior analyst with OANDA, told Reuters:""The oil market is still tight despite a weakening global demand outlook as recession fears run wild.""Oil demand will experience significant growth in the latter half of 2023 due to the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in China and central banks taking a more relaxed approach to interest rates. It is anticipated that the effects of Western sanctions on Russian oil will be minimal, and analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a research note:""We do not expect an impact from the price cap, which was designed to give bargaining power to third-country buyers."" To delve deeper in the oil industry, investors can also check out Top 20 Oil Exporting Countries in 2023, 12 Best Oil Stocks To Buy Now, and 20 Countries with the Largest Oil Reserves.

Enterprise provides processing and transportation services to producers and consumers of natural gas, natural gas liquids, and oil. These hydrocarbons are critical for modern life and have few, if any, ready substitutes. Commodity prices do not greatly affect the company’s toll road fees. Enterprise is priced at less than nine times distributable cash flows and pays a 7.5% cash distribution.”9. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)Average 3-month Volume as of January 31: 5.97 MillionYTD Share Price Gains as of January 31: 6.55%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is a Texas-based company that produces, transports, and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and natural gas liquids worldwide.

Given the long-life nature of its oil sand assets and its low cost of production, we estimate Cenovus is free cash flow break-even at an oil price of ~US$40/bbl. Despite the recent fall, oil prices remain more than double this break-even point, implying considerable free cash flow generation potential for the company at current levels, with Cenovus currently trading on a consensus FY22 free cash flow yield of around 20%. There are also additional value realization catalysts with the company continuing to progress the de-gearing of its balance sheet via organic cash generation and asset sales.”7. BP p.l.c.

(NYSE:URI)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-consider-buying-united-rentals-120036696.html,1675252836,STORY,['URI'],"[United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE:URI) saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine United Rentals’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for United Rentals What Is United Rentals Worth?According to my valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 24%, trading at US$441 compared to my intrinsic value of $355.22. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that United Rentals’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will United Rentals generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. United Rentals' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 41%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? URI’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe URI should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on URI for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for URI, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at United Rentals (URI), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. United Rentals currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if URI is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this equipment rental company holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor URI, shares are up 13.14% over the past week while the Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry is up 3.39% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 20.71% compares favorably with the industry's 7.72% performance as well.While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of United Rentals have risen 32.83%, and are up 34.03% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 3.5% and -7.86%, respectively.Investors should also take note of URI's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, URI is averaging 710,106 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with URI.Over the past two months, 6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost URI's consensus estimate, increasing from $36.81 to $40.60 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that URI is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep United Rentals on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Right now, United Rentals is sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while James Hardie has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that URI's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.URI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 10.57, while JHX has a forward P/E of 15.17. We also note that URI has a PEG ratio of 0.65. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. JHX currently has a PEG ratio of 5.29.Another notable valuation metric for URI is its P/B ratio of 4.21. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, JHX has a P/B of 6.69.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to URI's Value grade of B and JHX's Value grade of C.URI has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than JHX, so it seems like value investors will conclude that URI is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.09% lower. Oracle currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Looking at its valuation, Oracle is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 17.8. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 27.75.Story continuesWe can also see that ORCL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.23. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. Computer - Software stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.1 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 100, which puts it in the top 40% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

Growth in core P&amp;C also benefited the results. However, the positives were partially offset by the frail performance of Wealth Solutions.Now, let us see how things have shaped up prior to the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share of $3.67 has witnessed two upward estimate revisions in the past 30 days against one movement in the opposite direction. The estimated figure, however, suggests a decrease of 1.1% from the prior-year reported number. Our estimate for fourth-quarter earnings suggests a 3.6% year-over-year decline. AON beat the consensus estimate in three of the prior four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 2.8%. This is depicted in the graph below:Aon plc Price and EPS Surprise Aon plc Price and EPS SurpriseAon plc price-eps-surprise | Aon plc QuoteBoth the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate for fourth-quarter revenues of $3.1 billion indicate a 1.3% increase from the year-ago reported figure.What the Quantitative Model SuggestsOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for AON this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is +1.52%. The Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at $3.73 per share, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.67. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Story continuesZacks Rank: AON currently holds a Zacks Rank #2.Factors to NoteCommercial Risk Solutions’ performance is likely to have gained from business generation, robust retention and management of the renewal book portfolio. Increased travel-related spending is expected to have aided the Data &amp; Analytics Services business, which has become part of Commercial Risk Solutions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Commercial Risk Solutions line’s revenues is pegged at $1,869 million, suggesting an increase from the prior-year reported figure of $1,847 million. Our estimate for the metric is pegged at $1,865.5 million for the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Health Solutions line’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $652 million, remaining flat from the year-ago period’s actuals. Growth in the more discretionary portions of the business, led by an increase in project-related work and strength in voluntary benefits, is likely to have aided the segment.The consensus mark for Reinsurance Solutions’ revenues is pegged at $232 million, indicating an increase from $222 million a year ago. Our estimate for the fourth quarter suggests a 9% year-over-year increase. It is likely to have witnessed growth in the to-be-reported quarter on the back of consistent business generation and growth in capital market transactions. All these factors are likely to have positioned the company for an earnings beat.However, the consensus mark for Wealth Solution’s revenues in the fourth quarter indicates a 5.5% year-over-year decline, while our estimate predicts a 7% fall. Unfavorable effects of currency exchange are likely to have impacted the company’s margins.Also, escalating expenses due to substantial investments in the priority areas for long-term growth and an increase in certain discretionary expenses are likely to have affected bottom-line growth, resulting in a year-over-year decline.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies from the broader finance space that you may also want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Ares Capital Corporation ARCC has an Earnings ESP of +8.29% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ares Capital’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 56 cents per share, implying a 7.7% improvement from the year-ago figure. ARCC beat earnings estimates in two of the past four quarters, met once and missed on the other occasion, with an average surprise of 3%.Manulife Financial Corporation MFC has an Earnings ESP of +2.20% and a Zacks Rank of 2.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Manulife Financial’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 61 cents per share, which witnessed two upward estimate revisions in the past 30 days against no downward movement.

Let's get you up to speed with McDonald's, another big mover here. The company reported better than expected earnings, yet we're looking at the stock off just about 1 and 1/2 percent, the beat coming after McDonald's raises prices by about 10% in its previous quarter to combat those higher operating costs that we've been hearing about.Now, to put the prices in perspective, we took a look at some of their most popular items. You have the Big Mac, fries, and the McChicken. So this is comparing to prices back in 2019, about three years ago. The Big Mac price is up 7%. Fries have jumped nearly 25%, the McChicken up nearly 28%.Despite these price hikes, Dave, it looks like when you take a look at some of the traffic inside their stores, consumers are trading down to McDonald's and willing to spend there.- Look, when I look at this report, I'm shocked at the investor reaction across the board. They do say their prices, to your point, up 10% on average from a year earlier. But dive inside these numbers. US visits up 26%. That's from prepandemic, from 2019 levels. They're up 30% from a year ago. And if you want one more thing, how about an operating margin of 45%? That was 40 a year ago. They have raised prices. Consumers continue to pay it. And we have seen in the past, McDonald's has proven to be recession resistant. I think it's a pretty stellar report.- It is a stellar report. And also, when you look inside and see what is working for McDonald's, yes, they're able to raise prices. Yes, consumers are continuing to spend. But some of their initiatives-- we talked about the McRib. That clearly was a huge hit.- You ever had it?- McDonald's-- I've never had it. Have you?- Oh, yeah.- Do you like it?- Many McRibs.- How do you-- you got a McRib and not a Big Mac?- I have had several McRibs in my life.Story continues- Oh, OK.- The texture bothers me now--- Does it live up to the hype?- --as a young kid-- the texture will freak you out.- Yeah, yeah, yeah.- And I can't do it anymore. But as a young kid, I loved it. Still never had a Big Mac, though.- Yeah. That blows my mind. Their fries are my favorite. McDonald's fries are my favorite. But cer-- they're not yours?- No. No, not close. Wendy's. But no, I actually wanted to mention, something in the report caught my eye. Difficult decisions coming when it comes to corporate staffing levels. Sounds like layoffs are ahead, although they are opening new stores in 2023. A lot to digest, like always, with McDonald's.]"

We expect this will contribute, along with restaurants opened in 2022, nearly 1.5% to systemwide sales growth,"" he added.The growth strategy marks the first time since 2014 that McDonald's has made a big push into growing its U.S. locations. But BTIG Managing Director Peter Saleh said he expects U.S. store openings to be a very small portion of the new stores.""The growth in the U.S. is still going to be rather nominal. At best, I think they're going to open about 100 stores, [then, those] that are closed, maybe another 80 get to about a net number of about 20.""Saleh said the chain's growth strategy is welcome news to U.S. franchisee owners. Franchise owners make up roughly 95% of McDonald's total portfolio.""From our conversations with franchisees, they've been telling us, 'Yes ... We need more stores, because the volumes in the stores that we have, has grown so much that we need to offset it with with additional units'.""

""It's not one or the other; it's the two of them in combination...[when] you want to be growing units is when you got strong comparable sales, because that reflects the underlying health of the business.""Florida, Davenport, McDonald's fast food restaurant, drive-thru window.

(NYSE:PLD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Following strong quarterly results, the shares of Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD), the world’s largest industrial REIT, performed well in the fourth quarter of 2022. The company owns a high-quality real estate portfolio that is concentrated in major global trade markets and large population centers across the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Prologis has an unmatched global platform, strong competitive advantages (scale, data, and technology), and attractive embedded growth prospects. The company is the only industrial REIT with an ‘A’ credit rating.Following a roughly 33% decline in its shares in 2022, we believe Prologis’ current valuation of only 22 times cash flow and a 4.6% implied capitalization rate is compelling given that the company’s rents on its in-place leases are more than 65% below current market rents, thus providing a strong runway for growth in the next three to five years.”Story continuesTravel mania/Shutterstock.comPrologis, Inc.

In fact, estimates suggest the global travel industry will see huge growth in 2023. According to a Bloomberg report, global tourism in 2023 is expected to reach 80% to 95% of pre-pandemic levels. The report, which quoted data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization, said the tourism industry reached about 63% of the pre-pandemic levels in 2022.However, the United Nations World Tourism Organization said travel patterns will be affected amid financial worries and inflation. For example, the UN body said travelers will expect more value for money this year and are expected to stay closer to home. The report also said that growth in travel demand in the Middle East and Europe will be the fastest. These two regions are expected to catch up with the pre-pandemic levels this year when it comes to travel and tourism.According to the Bloomberg report, about half of American travelers say financial pressures will impact their travel decisions in the coming six months, according to a January 2023 sentiment survey from tourism market research firm Longwoods International.

(NASDAQ:TRIP) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP)’s world class board has appointed a new CEO to optimize every aspect of its core business — something it has long gone without. Matt Goldberg’s background at The Trade Desk (TTD) and multiple direct-to-consumer web properties (such as the Lonely Planet) make him perfectly positioned to better monetize TripAdvisor’s long admired position as the world’s most visited travel website. The exciting part of Matt’s mission is that he wants to make core TripAdvisor great again, in its hotel auction, in the TripAdvisor Plus model, and in the new advertising verticals it has developed for hotels, restaurants and tour operators.This year’s travel season is absolutely on fire, but there are substantially more legs to this rally. Americans are traveling abroad 30% less frequently than before Covid. This is a core demographic for TripAdvisor’s traffic and purchase intent. So while the market worries that certain travel businesses are experiencing peak earnings in 2022, we believe there is substantial room to run for those focused on a more international destination, like TripAdvisor. But the real upside will come from TripAdvisor’s determination to extract value from its two fastest-growing supply aggregation properties: Viator and The Fork. Both platforms dominate their respective fields and are aggressively acquiring new customers. Viator’s experiences supply is without comparison in the world, and it is currently processing twice the amount of transactions than it was prior to Covid. Given over 80% of travel experiences are still booked offline, Viator looks as attractive to us, if not more so, than booking.com did a few decades ago.”7. Travel + Leisure Co.

Shares closing higher despite the company missing the Street's revenue estimates by more than $1 billion. You can see 4.6% gain on the day. UPS projecting full year revenue for 2023 between $97 and $99.4 billion, just shy of the Street's estimates.UPS CFO Brian Newman saying on Thursday's earnings call, quote, ""we expect 2023 to be a bumpy year."" Headwinds that will impact the business, including record high inflation, recession fears, a war in Eastern Europe, COVID disruptions in China, and US labor negotiations-- still, shares of UPS edging higher today as the company projects some of those concerns to subside in the second half of the year. So, again, just reiterating-- they see a recession first half, a recovery in the economy and in their business in the second half.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, you've got to look at this package volume-- a little bit concerning when you take a look at the broader economy, what that could signal at least for the coming quarters. We know that the holiday period is so important for UPS, so important for its rival FedEx. And when you see that package volume drop, coming up a bit short, rather, I should say consumers really pulling back on their spending, what exactly this signals here for the next quarter or two, could be something to really keep an eye on.And then also labor negotiations-- we know that's going to be front and center for UPS over the next couple of quarters. Those negotiations are expected to start in April. Of course, how that pans out could have real implications for UPS.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, some feel this will be the most contentious labor talks they've had since the strike in 1997. They're dealing with the Teamsters. This is going to be a real tough road and it's going to cost them a pretty penny.They did increase shipping prices 6.9%. That's on top of the 5.9% the prior year and 4.9% prior to that. So not a great story in terms of inflation coming down, because they are continuing to increase prices there at UPS.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. They certainly are. When you take a look at that price increase, it's also going to be a question of whether or not consumers are willing to spend, how much they will be shipping, whether or not that, of course, is going to impact their behavior down the line-- certainly something to watch.]"

NetApp (NTAP), which belongs to the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This data storage company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 9.77%.For the last reported quarter, NetApp came out with earnings of $1.48 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.34 per share, representing a surprise of 10.45%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.10 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.20 per share, delivering a surprise of 9.09%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor NetApp, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.NetApp currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.03%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. NetApp (NTAP) earns a Zacks Rank #3 22 days from its next quarterly earnings release on February 22, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.34 a share.NTAP has an Earnings ESP figure of 2.03%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.34 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.31.NTAP is part of a big group of Computer and Technology stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Infosys (INFY) as well.Slated to report earnings on April 12, 2023, Infosys holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.19 a share 71 days from its next quarterly update.For Infosys, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.19 is 0.87%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, NTAP and INFY could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of Oreo cookies, Cadbury chocolate and Trident gum would post earnings of $0.68 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.74, delivering a surprise of 8.82%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Mondelez , which belongs to the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, posted revenues of $8.7 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.84%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $7.66 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Mondelez shares have lost about 2.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.6%.What's Next for Mondelez?While Mondelez has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook.

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Mondelez: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future.

You can see, shares popping a bit after hours, after reporting their fourth quarter earnings beat. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma here to break down the numbers. You got to love Ritz crackers. If you don't, we're not friends.BROOKE DIPALMA: Oh, we are certainly friends, Dave. Because I love Ritz crackers. And it turns out investors do too. Oreo maker Mondelez, certainly beating on both the top and bottom line here as consumers look to their favorite chocolate treats, and perhaps those Ritz crackers, during inflation. As you can see here, they posted a Bed revenue coming in at $8.7 billion. Adjusted earnings per share, coming in at $0.73-- both higher than Wall Street's expectations, largely driven by pricing and volume.CEO, saying that on the release today. As I noted before, consumers are hammered by their spending power. But they are still flocking to those known brands like Oreos, their favorite here. In addition to that, taking a closer look at full-year revenue here, jumping across all markets. Latin America, up nearly 30%. Asia, Middle East, and Africa, up nearly 5%. Europe, up 2.4%. North America, up 16.6%.CEO, noting that these results were underscored by the strength in emerging markets-- largely Latin America. In addition to that, they also did note that drivers of this past year, as well as the fourth quarter results, were based upon acquisitions of Clif Bar, among other acquisitions. But they were offset by unfavorable currency that impacted across the board in 2022.In addition to that, they did note that they announced an agreement with Perfetti Van Melle to acquire developed markets of gum business. So of course, they are the makers behind Trident and Stride. Those businesses are in US, Canada, and Europe. That deal, expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2023.Story continuesAnother announcement made on this earnings release is a $6 billion share buyback program that's expected to go through December of 2025. So lots to unpack as investors and Main Street certainly look to this company for a sweet relief, I guess you could say.DAVID BRIGGS: Toblerone. Legendary airport purchase, the Toblerone. Cadbury is pretty good, too. All right. What are analysts looking for on the call? What do they want to hear?BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah. Well, I really think they do want to understand how exactly the consumer is responding during this time-- largely looking, as Easter is around the corner, for that Cadbury purchases perhaps. Are they responding to a higher price? Are they still going to flock to those favorite treats, especially upon the Easter season?I think, in addition to that, they definitely want to hear more on just the impact that we're seeing overseas, as Europe continues to work through those high inflationary pressures as we heard from other executives, like McDonald's, today on the call. In addition to that, as we spoke to Mondelez last year, and I believe what was 2021, Ukraine continues to be a major business for them. So perhaps analysts hoping to hear more on that front, as well.DAVID BRIGGS: A huge number in Latin America-- about 30% revenues. Brooke DiPalma, thanks so much. Good to see you, my friend.]"

Per the latest Earnings Preview, quarterly results have been dull year over year, reflecting the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and record level of inflationary pressure worldwide. Going by the sector’s scorecard, 8.9% of the companies in the Medical sector, constituting 28.4% of the sector’s market capitalization, reported earnings till Jan 25. Of these, 80% beat earnings estimates and 20% beat the same for revenues. Earnings increased 5% year over year on 7% higher revenues.Overall, fourth-quarter earnings of the Medical sector are expected to plunge 10.9% on a 2.9% revenue decrease. This compares with the third-quarter reported earnings decline of 3.3% on revenue growth of 5.1%.The projection reflects the ongoing global inflationary pressure leading to an extremely tough situation related to raw material and labor cost as well as freight charges, which have put the industry in a tight spot again. The majority of the players within this space have witnessed mounting raw material costs and other expense pressure through the Q4 months. Added to this, labor-supply constraints with rising labor costs and global supply-chain hazards are expected to have moderated the growth process.Medical Device Quarterly SynopsysIntegral to the broader Medical sector, medical device or the Zacks-defined Medical Products companies’ collective business growth is likely to have displayed improvement compared with the last year, with a significant reduction in COVID-led severity across the United States and other developed countries. Through the Q4 months, new waves of coronavirus spread rapidly across various developed and emerging nations. Yet, the companies’ successful addressing of a couple of years’ pent-up demand is likely to have led to higher year-over-year growth within the legacy base businesses of the industry players.Also, diagnostic testing companies might have shown a sequential rise in testing demand, thanks to rising new cases in select geographies, leading to business growth for many companies.Story continuesOverall, the legacy base business recovery and testing demand of the companies through the months of the fourth quarter are expected to have been impressive. Medical device companies like Boston Scientific BSX, Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO, Hologic HOLX and Align Technology ALGN are likely to have been positively influenced by these factors in Q4.However, as discussed earlier, replicating the market-wide trend, this sector’s Q4 results are likely to be significantly dampened by the ongoing macroeconomic threat in the United States and outside. Despite the reopening of the economy, the vicious cycle of deteriorating inflationary situation along with aggressive rate hikes has put the global investment scenario in a tighter spot again. Within medical device, going by the industry-wide trend so far, logistical challenges and increasing unit costs have been heavily weighing on the corporate profitability of the stocks across the board. On the other hand, the tightened monetary policy is starkly altering consumer preferences and once again, demand for the non-essential category line of medical device businesses is on the back foot.This might have, in a way, shrunk the companies’ revenues in Q4 compared to the prior quarter.Let's take a look at three MedTech players scheduled to announce results on Feb 1.Boston Scientific: Boston Scientific expects fourth-quarter 2022 operational revenue growth in the range of 8.5% to 10.5% year over year. This excludes an approximate 650-basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on rates during the Q3 earnings release. Meanwhile, BSX’s top line is likely to have improved year over year, with non-COVID elective medical procedures running in a full-fledged way in the United States and elsewhere across the globe. Given the improving scenario along with an innovative pipeline, expansion into faster growth markets, globalization efforts and enhanced digital capabilities, Boston Scientific is well-positioned to register decent fourth-quarter 2022 results.(Read more: Will Boston Scientific Beat Q4 Earnings Estimates?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $3.24 billion for the fourth quarter suggests a 3.6% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for BSX’s earnings of 47 cents per share indicates a 4.4% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Per our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates.

The company is expected to have recorded growth, driven by a favorable business mix and new launches. The company advanced its Orbitrap portfolio, launching the Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid mass spectrometer. In electron microscopy, the company introduced the Thermo Scientific Arctis Cryo-Plasma Focused Ion Beam, an automated microscope that streamlines cryoelectron tomography. These are all expected to have contributed to the Q4 top line of Thermo Fisher.(Read more: What's in Store for Thermo Fisher in Q4 Earnings?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Thermo Fisher’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $10.36 billion, which implies a decline of 3.2% from the year-ago figure.

QuoteHologic: In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Hologic is expected to have witnessed strong growth in the Diagnostics business (excluding COVID) from the growing adoption of Panther instruments and an expanded Panther installed base. During the fourth-quarter earnings update, Hologic noted that the company has nearly 3,250 Panthers instruments placed globally. Its performance might have been driven by both legacy and new assays, namely the BBCVTV vaginitis panel, MGen, CTMG and its respiratory menu on the Panther Fusion. However, with COVID testing significantly down over the past few months, Hologic’s Molecular Diagnostics business is likely to have been impacted by lower COVID-related sales.(Read more: Hologic to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hologic’s fiscal first-quarter revenues is pegged at $980.9 million, which implies a decline of 33.3% from the year-ago figure.

However, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the heightened volatility in foreign exchange rates might have posed hindrances to recovery, hampering business performance in Q4. Staffing shortages and the ongoing inflationary pressure are expected to have dragged the company’s profitability down in Q4.(Read more: Align Technology to Post Q4 Earnings: What's in Store?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of $1.52 per share implies a 46.3% plunge from the year-ago reported figure.

441,4fb2e8d3-ea12-383e-b787-3f499e54f6ef,COF,2023-02-01,Why Are People Investing in Cobalt? Should I?,SmartAsset,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-people-investing-cobalt-140043745.html,1675173643,STORY,"['KC=F', 'C=F', 'GC=F', 'HG=F']","[How to Invest in CobaltTo investors, natural resources are known as the “commodities” market. This is a major sector of investing, with both professionals and retail investors alike putting their money into assets like coffee, steel and corn every day. Although, given the extreme volatility of this market and the potential for losses that exceed your initial investment, retail investors should generally avoid direct investment in commodities.Consider working with a financial advisor as you evaluate your asset allocations and consider new sectors to invest in.Cobalt is an industrial metal, prized for its physical properties, which has a wide variety of applications in electronics, metalworking, art and more. Most notably, it’s used to create the lithium-ion batteries in your phone, laptop and electric vehicle. As with any commodity, this creates an opportunity for investors. However, significant ethical questions surround the production of cobalt, including the use of child labor to mine it.Understanding the Cobalt Market and IndustryFirst, what exactly is cobalt?Cobalt is a relatively common metallic element with physical properties broadly similar to nickel and iron. It is hard and (unlike iron) brittle, and generally nonreactive to common environments like air and water. It can be toxic when inhaled or otherwise ingested and has a very potent lab-created radioactive isotope. Cobalt is often found as a byproduct of copper and nickel production, and is mined in much of the world.Cobalt is a widely used industrial metal that has applications in a wide range of modern technologies. Applications include engines and turbines, which it is prized for its corrosion and heat resistance. It’s also used in batteries and electronics, steel and alloy smelting, chemical engineering, medical devices and even art. Cobalt blue, made from powdered cobalt metal, has also long been a prized color for paints and glazes.What You Need to Know About Investing in CobaltHow to Invest in CobaltAs with all industrial materials, the cobalt market is sizable. Although exact numbers are hard to pin down,  the global market for cobalt is expected to reach around $20 billion annually by the end of this decade. This obviously isn’t the footprint of a commodity like steel or coffee, but it’s still a very large market. As an investor, this gives you a number of opportunities. As with all commodities, you can invest in cobalt in a number of different ways, from individual securities to various sorts of funds. Some of the most common options include:Story continuesCommodities ContractsThe first choice is the direct option. You can invest in cobalt as a metal itself. One way to do this is through futures contracts, which allow you to literally purchase quantities of cobalt metal. You can also buy options contracts around cobalt futures, letting you invest in the future value of cobalt as a metal.Cobalt as a commodity has grown more valuable in recent years particularly due to its uses in batteries and turbines. These technologies are central to emerging green technology such as electric cars and wind farms, increasing the demand for this metal. However,  directly investing in any commodity always brings significant risk. Futures contracts in particular can be unpredictable assets, in which retail investors often take losses.StocksAs with all commodities, you can also invest indirectly in cobalt by investing in companies and industries that use it. This approach is far less volatile. While individual equities are considered a speculative asset class, they’re typically far more stable than direct investment in a futures or options contract.Good ways to invest in cobalt stocks can involve buying into the producers of the metal. Mining companies like Glencore (GLNCY) or Polymet Mining (PLM) mine and sell cobalt to the businesses that use it, so you can expect good performance from their stock if the price of this asset goes up. You can also invest in companies that use cobalt heavily in their products, such as electric car battery manufacturers. This is a way of investing against the price of cobalt, as those firms will typically do better when the commodity is cheaper.Mutual Funds and ETFsFinally, arguably the safest way to invest in cobalt is to seek out exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds that are either built explicitly around cobalt as an asset or that invest in the mining industry in general. Due to the nature of cobalt production, investing in copper and nickel-related funds would also give you exposure to the cobalt market, since almost all cobalt production is a byproduct of copper and nickel mining.Funds may directly invest in mining, such as the Vanguard Materials ETF. They may also invest in technology companies that rely on cobalt, particularly those oriented around batteries and next-generation energy.Why You Should Invest in CobaltHow to Invest in CobaltThe biggest advantage to investing in cobalt right now is its surge in demand. In recent years, purchase orders for this metal have skyrocketed as companies push to build next-generation batteries and devices, including electric vehicles. With governments taking climate change increasingly seriously, demand for these devices will only grow. In particular, since cobalt is an essential element in lithium-ion batteries, this has pushed the price significantly up. Producers and their shareholders have made some real money off of this blue gold rush.Why You May Want to Avoid Investing in CobaltThere are also some significant problems, most of which have to do with the production of cobalt.While cobalt is mined around the world, some of the largest producers are in politically unstable areas. The Democratic Republic of Congo alone produced 74% of all cobalt in 2021, according to the Cobalt Institute. Another massive, untapped reserve exists under the mountains of Afghanistan, where the second-largest deposit of copper on Earth has been found.The political instability of the DRC makes production and prices unusually volatile even for a raw commodity. Worse, the practices of companies operating in this country have been questioned on an ethical level. Industrial Safety &amp; Hygiene News wrote that the cobalt supply chain starts “mostly by digging for cobalt by hand – often children’s hands.”While long used as an industrial metal, cobalt has also been a relatively niche material. Few mining companies have ever looked for natural deposits of the ore, instead generating more than enough to meet demand by filtering it out of copper and nickel deposits. This process involves using toxic chemicals and practices that make cobalt mining an environmental disaster. Cobalt is often found in proximity to uranium which can exacerbate the environmental harm of extraction.Companies have started trying to phase it out of their supply chains, looking to develop products that don’t rely on an environmentally and ethically dubious material, and its production has become increasingly controversial. In fact, the industry site Mining.com gave the blunt recommendation in 2019 that “a wise investor would do well to give this fraught industry a wide berth.”How to Diversify a Cobalt Investment PortfolioDiversification would be wise in this industry. All commodities are volatile, but cobalt is especially unpredictable. While it is currently in demand, the combination of environmental and human rights issues surrounding this material has made it a target for corporate divestment. So investors who would like to get into this area should consider hedging their bets with a combination of mining funds that will continue to perform across commodities, as well as industry stocks that will continue to perform even after changing product composition.Bottom LineAn industrial metal long known for its corrosion resistance and magnetic properties, cobalt is used in many next-generation batteries and energy production industries. However, the environmental issues caused by its production, as well as the human rights concerns in many of the largest production sites, make this a particularly volatile asset for investors.Tips for Investing in CobaltIf you’re interested in cobalt, that means you’re interested in the commodities market. It’s important to have a solid foundation in commodities investing, understanding the upside and potential risks of investing in raw materials. Be sure to read our explainer piece on investing in commodities before jumping into cobalt.A financial advisor can help determine whether cobalt is a good investment for you. Finding a financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard.

442,3c3a5900-594c-343b-9a5e-5ef3e36a06a9,COF,2023-02-01,Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) Will Pay A Dividend Of $0.60,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/capital-one-financial-nyse-cof-133427232.html,1675172067,STORY,"['COF', 'COF-PJ']","[The board of Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.60 per share on the 17th of February. This means that the annual payment will be 2.1% of the current stock price, which is in line with the average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Capital One Financial Capital One Financial's Dividend Forecasted To Be Well Covered By EarningsSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable.Capital One Financial has a long history of paying out dividends, with its current track record at a minimum of 10 years. While past data isn't a guarantee for the future, Capital One Financial's latest earnings report puts its payout ratio at 13%, showing that the company can pay out its dividends comfortably.EPS is set to fall by 12.4% over the next 3 years. Fortunately, analysts forecast the future payout ratio to be 16% over the same time horizon, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.20 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.40. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 28% a year over that time. Capital One Financial has grown distributions at a rapid rate despite cutting the dividend at least once in the past. Companies that cut once often cut again, so we would be cautious about buying this stock solely for the dividend income.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. Capital One Financial has impressed us by growing EPS at 37% per year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.Story continuesWe Really Like Capital One Financial's DividendOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Capital One Financial might even raise payments in the future. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. To that end, Capital One Financial has 4 warning signs (and 1 which is a bit unpleasant) we think you should know about. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

446,e3e82cec-4e76-3695-9109-74deedd14609,VRTX,2023-02-01,Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vertex-pharmaceuticals-vrtx-earnings-expected-150003955.html,1675177203,STORY,['VRTX'],"[Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 7. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.53 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.8%.Revenues are expected to be $2.29 billion, up 10.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.76% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Vertex?For Vertex, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Vertex will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Vertex would post earnings of $3.69 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.01, delivering a surprise of +8.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Vertex doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP). CCEP is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 14.28, while its industry has an average P/E of 21.06. Over the past 52 weeks, CCEP's Forward P/E has been as high as 16.43 and as low as 11.84, with a median of 14.54.Investors will also notice that CCEP has a PEG ratio of 1.22. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate.

Over the last 12 months, CCEP's PEG has been as high as 1.59 and as low as 0.96, with a median of 1.28.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Coca-Cola Europacific Partners is likely being undervalued right now.

Investments in product innovations, premiumization and technology platforms bode well for players. These favorable trends are likely to have bolstered the top and bottom-line performances of beverage companies in the to-be-reported quarter.Companies are also expected to have gained from accelerating digital investments, momentum in spirits and expansion into newer categories, including the Ready-to-Drink (RTD) category. Notably, RTD has emerged as the fastest-growing alcohol segment since 2018. Most companies in the industry have been collaborating with counterparts to grow their market share in the fast-growing RTD category.Beverage companies have been investing in the latest capabilities, and leveraging technology to better connect with customers and consumers to expand their digital capabilities. Additionally, companies have been benefiting from price increases and supply productivity savings, offsetting the effects of cost inflation. Effective marketing and exceptional commercial execution have been boosting the sales of beverage companies.However, margins are likely to have been an area to watch in the quarter under review. Players in the beverage industry are anticipated to have witnessed higher advertising and promotional expenses, and SG&amp;A costs. Additionally, the industry players have been experiencing elevated ingredient and other input costs, including shipping and freight, labor, trucking, fuel, co-packing fees, secondary packaging materials, and increased outbound freight costs, leading to increased costs of sales and higher operating costs. These are expected to have dented the gross and operating margins in the to-be-reported quarter.The Winning StrategyA strategy to arrive at the potential winners is by picking stocks that have the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Story continuesQ4 ExpectationsThe Beverage industry, which is part of the Zacks Consumer Staples sector, seems poised for growth in the fourth quarter of 2022, owing to the aforementioned trends and initiatives of players. Overall earnings for the Consumer Staple sector are projected to witness a year-over-year decline of 4.4% despite 4.8% higher revenues, per the latest Earnings Preview.Some of the industry players, which are lined up to report earnings in the coming weeks, are PepsiCo Inc. PEP, The Boston Beer Co. Inc. SAM, The Coca-Cola Company KO and Molson Coors Beverage Company TAP.PepsiCo looks well-poised for growth in the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by the resilience and strength of global beverage and convenient food businesses. PEP is expected to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $26.8 billion, implying 6.2% growth from the year-ago quarter's reported figure.For PepsiCo’s quarterly earnings, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.64 per share, suggesting 7.2% growth from $1.53 reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days.Boston Beer’s fourth-quarter results are expected to reflect gains from strong pricing across its portfolio, growth in depletions and shipments, and focus on innovation to revive the Truly brand and expand Twisted Tea’s potential. SAM is expected to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $403.2 million, implying 15.8% growth from the year-ago quarter's reported figure.For Boston Beer’s quarterly earnings, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 64 cents per share, suggesting 811.1% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has moved down 5.9% in the past 30 days.Our PicksOf the companies slated to report earnings, we have identified two beverage stocks that are poised to trump fourth-quarter earnings estimates.Coca-Cola, the soft-drinks behemoth, is likely to record top-line growth and flat earnings when it reports fourth-quarter 2022 numbers on Feb 14, 2023. The company’s fourth-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and an increase in concentrate sales. Underlying share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels are also expected to have bolstered the performance.Currently, Coca-Cola has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +2.98%. The New York City-based company registered an earnings surprise of 8.8%, on average, in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for KO’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $9.97 billion, suggesting 5.3% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.

The consensus mark has moved down 4.3% in the past 30 days.CocaCola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise CocaCola Company (The) Price and EPS SurpriseCocaCola Company (The) price-eps-surprise | CocaCola Company (The) QuoteMolson Coors’ fourth-quarter 2022 results, scheduled to be released on Feb 21, are likely to reflect gains from a favorable sales mix and improved pricing trends across regions. Strength across its Coors Light and Miller Lite brands, as well as the beyond beer approach, bodes well. Also, the company has been gaining from the revitalization plan and the premiumization of its global portfolio. TAP is likely to record top and bottom-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter 2022 numbers.Molson Coors, a manufacturer and seller of beer and other beverage products, has an Earnings ESP of +2.24% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

454,4095f4e3-9b19-3d18-a4e6-4a83eb769e6a,INCY,2023-02-01,Incyte (INCY) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/incyte-incy-report-q4-earnings-153103129.html,1675179063,STORY,"['INCY', 'NVS']","[Incyte Corporation INCY is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 results on Feb 7, before market open.The company’s earnings surprise history has been dismal so far, with its earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only one of the trailing four quarters and missing on the other three occasions, with the average negative surprise being 20.11%. In the last reported quarter, Incyte missed earnings by 16.67%.Shares of Incyte have risen 12.5% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 10.4%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s see how things are shaping up for the quarter to be reported.Factors at PlayIncyte primarily derives product revenues from sales of its lead drug, Jakafi (ruxolitinib), in the United States, as well as its other marketed drugs.Patient demand for Jakafi, a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, in all approved indications (polycythemia vera, myelofibrosis and refractory acute graft-versus-host disease [GvHD]), increased by 13% year over year in the third quarter. The trend is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Jakafi’s sales stands at $636 million.Incyte also earns product royalty revenues from Novartis AG NVS for the commercialization of Jakafi in non-U.S. markets. Novartis licensed ruxolitinib from Incyte for development and commercialization outside the United States.Jakafi is marketed by Incyte in the United States and is marketed as Jakavi by Novartis outside the country. Incyte is likely to have received higher royalties from NVS in the fourth quarter on higher Jakavi sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $92 million.Incyte also receives royalties from the sales of Tabrecta (capmatinib), which is approved for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Novartis has exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to Tabrecta.While Jakafi’s sales and royalties are key catalysts for the company’s revenue growth, Iclusig’s sales and Olumiant’s royalties from Eli Lilly are likely to have contributed to the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesIncremental sales from newly approved drugs like Opzelura are also likely to have added to sales in the fourth quarter. The adoption of other newly approved drugs like Monjuvi and Pemazyre is also a positive and is likely to have boosted sales in the fourth quarter.In August 2022, the FDA approved Pemazyre (pemigatinib), a selective fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor, for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms (MLNs) with FGFR1 rearrangement. MLNs with FGFR1 rearrangement are extremely rare and aggressive blood cancers that may affect less than 1 in 100,000 people in the United States. So Incyte has most likely generated incremental revenues on label expansions.Total costs and expenses increased year over year in the third quarter and the same is likely to have increased in the fourth quarter due to a rise in R&amp;D, selling, general and administrative expenses.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Incyte this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP for Incyte is -6.02% as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 62 cents per share and the Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged at 58 cents per share.Zacks Rank: INCY currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.

The price action of recent weeks is sending a positive message to shareholders, especially considering how poorly these REITs performed last year.Park Hotels &amp; Resorts owns 47 brand-name hotels and resorts with 30,000 rooms. The company affiliates with such well-known brands as Hilton, Marriott and Hyatt — Park itself was a Hilton spinoff in 2017. During 2022, funds from operations (FFO) increased by 68.1%. For the past five years, it’s negative 37.4%.Market capitalization for the company comes to $3.19 billion.The REIT is trading at a 26% discount from its book value as long-term debt slightly exceeds shareholder equity. The company pays investors a dividend of 6.93%. Park is actively traded with an average daily volume of 3.16 million shares.The daily price chart is here:It might be considered a good sign, from a strict chart analyst’s point of view, that the price is back above the declining 200-day moving average (the red line). That the 50-day moving average (the blue line) appears to be turning up is also a potential positive. The relative strength indicator (RSI) below the price chart is now into its Overbought status.Weyerhaeuser is a specialty real estate investment trust focused on forest products, including the underlying value of the land. The REIT structure means the company is not required to pay federal taxes on income earned from timber harvest activities, but earnings from wood products are subject to taxation.It’s a major forest products firm with a market capitalization of $25.25 billion.Weyerhaeuser trades with a price-earnings ratio of 13.62 and at 2.34 times book value. Earnings in 2022 were up by 225.8% and the earnings-per-share growth for the past five years is 44.9%. Shareholder equity is greater than long-term debt. The REIT is actively traded, with an average daily volume of 3.75 million shares.Story continuesThe company is paying a dividend of 2.1%.The daily price chart looks like this:Note that this is another of the REITs with the price now crossing above a declining 200-day moving average and an upward-trending 50-day moving average. There are no guarantees that this kind of price action will continue, but if you own Weyerhaeuser, it’s good to see.Not investment advice.

A quarter ago, it was expected that this garbage and recycling hauler would post earnings of $1.50 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.56, delivering a surprise of 4%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Waste Management , which belongs to the Zacks Waste Removal Services industry, posted revenues of $4.94 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.72%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.68 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Waste Management shares have lost about 2.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.6%.What's Next for Waste Management?While Waste Management has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Waste Management: mixed.

The decline in both periods was primarily driven by a sharp decline in market prices for recycled commodities in the fourth quarter and persistent inflationary pressures on operating costs, particularly for labor at non-automated facilities, throughout the year.In the fourth quarter of 2022, operating EBITDA in the Company’s renewable energy business declined $5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year, operating EBITDA in the Company’s renewable energy line of business increased by $19 million compared to 2021 driven by improved pricing for electricity and renewable natural gas.Free Cash Flow &amp; Capital AllocationThree Months EndedYear EndedDecember 31,2022December 31,2021December 31,2022December 31,2021(in millions)(in millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$1,049$991$4,536$4,338Capital expenditures, excluding sustainability growth investments(623)(571)(2,026)(1,665)Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets, net of cash divested9262796Free cash flow without sustainability growth investments(a)4354462,5372,769Capital expenditures – sustainability growth investments(239)(203)(561)(239)Free Cash Flow(a)$196$243$1,976$2,530During the fourth quarter of 2022, $705 million was returned to shareholders, including $439 million of share repurchases and $266 million of cash dividends.

This will be the 20th consecutive year of increases in the Company’s per share dividend. The Board of Directors must separately approve and declare each dividend.In December 2022, the Board of Directors refreshed the Company’s share repurchase authorization, providing for the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of the Company’s common stock, signaling confidence in the Company’s cash flow outlook and financial position.""Our 2022 results established a strong foundation for continued growth in 2023.

You should view these statements with caution. They are based on the facts and circumstances known to the Company as of the date the statements are made. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to be materially different from those set forth in such forward-looking statements, including but not limited to failure to implement our optimization, automation, growth, and cost savings initiatives and overall business strategy; failure to obtain the results anticipated from strategic initiatives, investments, acquisitions or new lines of business; failure to identify acquisition targets, consummate and integrate acquisitions; environmental and other regulations, including developments related to emerging contaminants, gas emissions, renewable energy and ESG performance and disclosure; significant environmental, safety or other incidents resulting in liabilities or brand damage; failure to obtain and maintain necessary permits due to land scarcity, public opposition or otherwise; diminishing landfill capacity, resulting in increased costs and the need for disposal alternatives; failure to attract, hire and retain key team members and a high quality workforce; increases in labor costs due to union organizing activities or changes in wage and labor related regulations; disruption and costs resulting from extreme weather and destructive climate events; failure to achieve our sustainability goals or execute on our sustainability-related strategy and initiatives; public health risk, increased costs and disruption due to a COVID-19 resurgence or similar pandemic conditions; macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical conflict and market disruption resulting in labor, supply chain and transportation constraints, inflationary cost pressures and fluctuations in commodity prices, fuel and other energy costs; increased competition; pricing actions; impacts from international trade restrictions; competitive disposal alternatives, diversion of waste from landfills and declining waste volumes; weakness in general economic conditions and capital markets, including potential for an economic recession; adoption of new tax legislation; fuel shortages; failure to develop and protect new technology; failure of technology to perform as expected; failure to prevent, detect and address cybersecurity incidents or comply with privacy regulations; negative outcomes of litigation or governmental proceedings; and decisions or developments that result in impairment charges. Please also see the Company’s filings with the SEC, including Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs, for additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties applicable to its business. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, including financial estimates and forecasts, whether as a result of future events, circumstances or developments or otherwise.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTo supplement its financial information, the Company has presented, and/or may discuss on the conference call, adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted net income, adjusted income from operations, adjusted operating EBITDA, adjusted operating EBITDA margin, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted SG&amp;A expenses, and free cash flow, as well as projections of adjusted operating EBITDA and free cash flow for 2023. All of these items are non-GAAP financial measures, as defined in Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company reports its financial results in compliance with GAAP but believes that also discussing non-GAAP measures provides investors with (i) financial measures the Company uses in the management of its business and (ii) additional, meaningful comparisons of current results to prior periods’ results by excluding items that the Company does not believe reflect its fundamental business performance and are not representative or indicative of its results of operations.In addition, the Company’s projected future operating EBITDA is anticipated to exclude the effects of other events or circumstances that are not representative or indicative of the Company’s results of operations. Such excluded items are not currently determinable, but may be significant, such as asset impairments and one-time items, charges, gains or losses from divestitures or litigation, and other items. Due to the uncertainty of the likelihood, amount and timing of any such items, the Company does not have information available to provide a quantitative reconciliation of such projection to the comparable GAAP measure.The Company discusses free cash flow and provides a projection of free cash flow because the Company believes that it is indicative of its ability to pay its quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay its debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace ""Net cash provided by operating activities,"" which is the most comparable GAAP measure. The Company believes free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how the Company views its liquidity, but the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that the Company has committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested); this definition may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.The quantitative reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the accompanying schedules, with the exception of projected adjusted operating EBITDA. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(In Millions, Except per Share Amounts)(Unaudited)Three Months EndedYear EndedDecember 31,December 31,2022202120222021Operating revenues$4,935$4,678$19,698$17,931Costs and expenses:Operating3,0932,95512,29411,111Selling, general and administrative4874921,9381,864Depreciation, depletion and amortization5455102,0381,999Restructuring—218(Gain) loss from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items, net45162(16)4,1703,96016,33314,966Income from operations7657183,3652,965Other income (expense):Interest expense, net(109)(83)(378)(365)Loss on early extinguishment of debt, net———(220)Equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities(18)(2)(67)(36)Other, net59(2)5(122)(76)(447)(616)Income before income taxes6436422,9182,349Income tax expense143136678532Consolidated net income5005062,2401,817Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests1—21Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc.$499$506$2,238$1,816Basic earnings per common share$1.22$1.21$5.42$4.32Diluted earnings per common share$1.21$1.20$5.39$4.29Weighted average basic common shares outstanding409.2417.9412.8420.4Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding411.5420.6415.0422.9WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(In Millions)(Unaudited)December 31,20222021ASSETSCurrent assets:Cash and cash equivalents$351$118Receivables, net2,7522,546Other448405Total current assets3,5513,069Property and equipment, net15,71914,419Goodwill9,3239,028Other intangible assets, net827898Other1,9471,683Total assets$31,367$29,097LIABILITIES AND EQUITYCurrent liabilities:Accounts payable, accrued liabilities and deferred revenues$3,980$3,374Current portion of long-term debt414708Total current liabilities4,3944,082Long-term debt, less current portion14,57012,697Other5,5395,192Total liabilities24,50321,971Equity:Waste Management, Inc. stockholders’ equity6,8497,124Noncontrolling interests152Total equity6,864]"

Organic net sales increased 8.4% and 7.0% in the quarter and full year including 11.4% and 9.9% from increased unit volume partially offset by 3.0% and 2.9% from lower prices.Earnings AnalysisReported net earnings of $563 million and $2.4 billion decreased 15.0% and increased 18.3% in the quarter and full year. Reported net earnings per diluted share of $1.47 and $6.17 decreased 15.0% in the quarter and increased 18.4% in the full year. Reported gross profit margin and reported operating income margin were 62.2% and 15.6% in the quarter and 62.8% and 15.4% in the full year. In the quarter, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $216 million related to our Spine business. Reported net earnings include certain items, such as charges for acquisition and integration-related activities, the amortization of purchased intangible assets, asset write-offs and impairments and restructuring-related and other charges, costs to comply with certain medical device regulations, recall-related matters, regulatory and legal matters and tax matters. Excluding the aforementioned items, adjusted gross profit margin(1) was 62.7% and 63.1% in the quarter and full year, and adjusted operating income margin(1) was 26.6% and 23.8% in the quarter and full year. Adjusted net earnings(1) of $1.1 billion and $3.6 billion increased 11.1% and 2.8% in the quarter and full year. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share(1) of $3.00 and $9.34 increased 10.7% and 2.8% in the quarter and full year.2023 Outlook As we assess the current operating environment, we believe that there will continue to be macro-economic volatility caused by alleviating supply chain disruptions, inflationary risks and currency fluctuations. Despite the volatile macro-economic environment, we have good momentum in many parts of our business heading into 2023. We expect 2023 organic net sales growth(2) to be in the range of 7.0% to 8.5% and expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share(2) to be in the range of $9.85 to $10.15. Based on the steady progress of our pricing actions, we expect the impact of price to be between 0% and -0.5%. If foreign exchange rates hold near their current levels, we anticipate sales and EPS will be modestly unfavorably impacted as compared to 2022.(1) A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures: gross profit margin, operating income and operating income margin, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, and other important information accompanies this press release.(2) We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of our expected net sales growth to expected organic net sales growth as we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable effort the impact and timing of acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of our expected net earnings per diluted share to expected adjusted net earnings per diluted share as we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable effort the impact and timing of restructuring-related and other charges, acquisition-related expenses and fair value adjustments to inventory and the outcome of certain regulatory, legal and tax matters. The financial impact of these items is uncertain and is dependent on various factors, including timing, and could be material to our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.Conference Call on Tuesday, January 31, 2023As previously announced, we will host a conference call on Tuesday, January 31, 2023 at 4:30 p.m., Eastern Time, to discuss our operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022 and provide an operational update.Please register for this conference call at: Stryker’s Q4 and Full Year 2022 Earnings Call.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESWe supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including: percentage sales growth; percentage sales growth in constant currency; percentage organic sales growth; adjusted gross profit; adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted research, development and engineering expenses; adjusted operating income; adjusted other income (expense), net; adjusted effective income tax rate; adjusted net earnings; adjusted net earnings per diluted share (Diluted EPS); free cash flow; and free cash flow conversion. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures.To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate. To measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures, which affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. To measure free cash flow, we adjust cash provided by operating activities by the amount of purchases of property, plant and equipment and proceeds from long-lived asset disposals and remove the impact of certain legal settlements and recall payments. To measure free cash flow conversion we divide free cash flow by adjusted net earnings.Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, research, development and engineering expenses, operating income, other income (expense), net, effective income tax rate, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures below, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of non-GAAP net earnings per diluted share are the same as those used in the calculation of reported net earnings per diluted share for the respective period.STRYKER CORPORATIONFor the Three Months and Full Year December 31(Unaudited - Millions of Dollars, Except Per Share Amounts)Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Most Directly Comparable GAAP Financial MeasuresThree Months 2022      Gross ProfitSelling, General &amp;

Both metrics declined year over year. Results were hurt by the ongoing challenging environment and sluggish demand from rising inflation. The headwinds are likely to recover in the second half of fiscal 2023. Consequently, management issued the 2023 view.Shares of the company have gained 11.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 13.5% growth. We also note that shares of WHR jumped more than 2% after the trading session on Jan 30. This might be owing to the earnings beat in the quarter under review.Notably, management concluded the strategic review of EMEA. As part of this, the company’s European major domestic appliance business will form a new entity with Arçelik. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2023. The company announced the successful buyout of InSinkErator, which has had no material impact on Q4 results. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Insight Into Q4The appliance maker delivered adjusted earnings of $3.89 per share, declining 37% from $6.14 in the year-ago quarter. However, the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.23 and our estimate of $3.23.Net sales of $4,923 million dropped 15.3% from the year-ago quarter. The top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,047 million and our estimate of $5,254.2 million. Excluding the unfavorable impacts of foreign exchange, net sales amounted to $5,059 million, down 13% year over year. The downside is mainly due to a one-off supply disruption in North America and drab demand, which somewhat offset favorable price/mix.The gross profit for fourth-quarter 2022 was $645 million, down 39.3% from $1,063 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Ongoing EBIT of $171 million declined 66% from $502 million in the year-ago quarter. The ongoing EBIT margin of 3.5% contracted 510 bps year over year.Story continuesRegional PerformancesNet sales for the North America segment decreased 13.6% year over year to $2,874 million. Excluding the currency impact, sales in the region dropped 13%. The segment’s EBIT plunged 67.1% year over year to $166 million, while the EBIT margin contracted 950 bps to 5.8% due to elevated cost inflation and one-off supply-chain disruption.Net sales for the EMEA segment were down 27.2% year over year to $1,028 million. Excluding currency impacts, sales in the region dipped 18.1%. The metric was hurt by drab demand in key countries. The segment’s EBIT was at a loss of $4 million compared with the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $20 million due to lower volume, cost inflation and unfavorable currency, which offset cost-based pricing actions.Net sales from Latin America remained flat year over year to $831 million, owing to a sequential demand rise in Mexico and Brazil, which offset cost-based pricing efforts. Excluding the currency impacts, sales in the region fell 3.1%. The segment’s EBIT of $49 million declined 12.5% from the year-ago period’s $56 million. The EBIT margin contracted 80 bps to 5.9%, mainly affected by inflation, somewhat offset by cost-saving efforts.Net sales in Asia fell 22.1% year over year to $219 million mainly due to muted consumer demand, which was partly offset by cost-based pricing. Excluding the currency impacts, sales for the region were down 15.9%. The segment’s EBIT of $6 million reflected a 65% plunge from the $17 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The segment’s EBIT margin of 2.7% contracted 320 bps from the prior-year quarter, driven by cost inflation and a top-line decline.Other Financial DetailsAs of Dec 31, 2022, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company had cash and cash equivalents of $1,958 million, long-term debt of $7,363 million and a stockholders’ equity of $2,336 million, excluding non-controlling interests of $170 million.As of Dec 31, 2022, Whirlpool provided cash of $1,390 million from operating activities.

(Frank Hoermann / Associated Press )With astronomical natural gas prices squeezing the pocketbooks of Southern California Gas Co.'s 21.8 million customers, the company says relief may be on the way as soon as next month.In a statement, the company said the price of natural gas for its customers would be down 68% for February compared with January.“While we’re relieved that prices have dropped significantly since last month, they remain higher than usual for this time of year,” said Gillian Wright, a SoCalGas executive.The utility attributed the drop in consumer gas prices primarily to a commensurate drop in the wholesale price that SoCalGas will pay for gas in February compared with January.The utility said in December that a customer who paid $130 in their peak month of winter consumption last year would this year pay $315, a 142% increase, due to a more than 300% increase in the wholesale price of natural gas since January 2022.The higher gas prices have spurred elected officials to take action.Long Beach Mayor Rex Richardson addressed the price hikes, saying in a tweet that he would call an emergency City Council meeting Wednesday afternoon ""to establish a financial assistance fund for seniors and families struggling to make ends meet.""California Senate Minority Leader Brian M. Jones, a Republican from San Diego, wrote a letter Monday with other Republican senators to the California Public Utilities Commission urging the body to expedite the distribution of California Climate Credits to residents. Those credits, typically distributed in April and October, come from a state program requiring industrial polluters to buy carbon offsets from the California Air Resources Board.SoCalGas, for its part, announced a $1-million contribution to the Gas Assistance Fund, which provides one-time payments of as much as $100 for residents below specified income thresholds.

467,46412974-8667-3135-b5f3-a50ca78333ef,LYB,2023-02-01,Linde (LIN) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/linde-lin-earnings-expected-grow-150003089.html,1675177203,STORY,['LYB'],"[The market expects Linde (LIN) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 7, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis gas supplier is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.91 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5.1%.Revenues are expected to be $8.09 billion, down 2.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.71% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Linde?For Linde, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.62%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Linde will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Linde would post earnings of $2.94 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.10, delivering a surprise of +5.44%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Linde appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry, LyondellBasell (LYB) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.09 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -70%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $10.43 billion, down 18.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for LyondellBasell has been revised 3.2% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.76%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that LyondellBasell will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

468,34953800-2a15-3acb-a4d4-ebaf18703220,VMC,2023-02-01,2 Concrete & Aggregates Stocks to Watch Amid Industry Headwinds,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-concrete-aggregates-stocks-watch-133901625.html,1675172341,STORY,"['VMC', 'EXP', '^GSPC']","[Rising raw material costs, housing market slowdown, supply-chain disruptions, and higher labor and transportation costs are some of the hurdles for the Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry players. Nonetheless, a boost in infrastructural and public construction spending should continue to act as a major tailwind. An improving non-residential construction market and favorable pricing dynamics have also been aiding companies in navigating hard times. Prominent names in the industry, like Vulcan Materials Company VMC and Eagle Materials Inc. EXP, have been gaining from the positives.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry consists of manufacturers, distributors and sellers of construction materials like aggregates and concrete along with other related items for public infrastructure, residential and non-residential, as well as other end markets. The materials also include gypsum wallboard, recycled paperboard, concrete blocks, ready-mix concrete, and oil and gas proppants. The industry players are also involved in designing, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and installation of external building products for commercial, residential, and repair and remodel markets in domestic as well as international markets.3 Trends Shaping the Future of Concrete &amp; Aggregates IndustryFluctuation in Input Prices, Weather Woes, Residential Slowdown, &amp; Shortage of Skilled Labors: The industry players are struggling with escalating material expenses, the shortage of skilled laborers and rising wage costs. The companies use electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. Hence, supply-related woes and significant fluctuations in the prices of these resources affect operating results. Also, the businesses are exposed to weather-related risks that affect production schedules and hence profitability. Excessive rainfall, flooding or severe droughts jeopardize shipments and production. The first and fourth quarters are mostly affected by winter. Again, hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast are most active during these quarters. These impediments may continue to bump up costs and mar the industry participants’ profits. This apart, the recent slowdown in the residential market is causing a downdraft in wallboard, cement and other products of the industry, thereby weighing on companies’ performance. Notably, rising mortgage rates and home prices have been prompting a moderation in housing demand.Focus on Reviving Infrastructure: On Nov 15, 2021, President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan infrastructure bill of $550 billion, in addition to the approved funds of $450 billion for five years in August. Total spending may go up to $1.2 trillion if the plan is extended to eight years. This bill comprises new investments in almost every infrastructure sector over the next five-year period, including transportation, energy, broadband and water. Out of the total allotted spending, the infrastructure development law will provide $100 billion toward roads, bridges and other major projects. It will invest $66 billion in freight and passenger rail, including potential upgrades to Amtrak. The project will allocate $11 billion to reducing car crashes and fatalities through a “Safe Streets for All” program. The Biden administration’s endeavor to pump money for rebuilding the nation's roads, bridges and other infrastructure would give construction companies like Vulcan, Martin Marietta and others a solid foundation for growth.Acquisitions &amp; Focus on Operating Efficiency: The industry participants follow a well-chalked-out acquisition plan to enhance domestic and international portfolios. Moreover, companies are increasingly focusing on reducing controllable costs and maximizing operating efficiency across business lines to generate higher earnings and cash flows. The industry players have also been experiencing a solid pricing environment across their product portfolios, thereby helping to boost margins.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry is an eight-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #224, which places it in the bottom 10% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a weak earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s bottom-line growth potential. Since December 2022, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have moved downward to $2.09 per share from $2.15.Despite the industry’s gloomy near-term view, we will present a few stocks that one may consider adding to the portfolio. Before that, it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation.Industry Lags Sector, Outperforms S&amp;P 500The Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry has lagged the broader Zacks Construction sector but outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.Stocks in this industry have collectively lost 8.8% versus the broader sector’s decline of 4.5% over the past year. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has slipped 11.1% in the same period.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price to earnings, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates stocks, the industry is currently trading at 17.6X versus the S&amp;P 500’s 18.3X and the sector’s 18.3X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 24.5X, as low as 13.5X and at a median of 18.5X, as the chart below shows.Industry’s P/E Ratio (Forward 12-Month) Versus S&amp;P 5002 Concrete &amp; Aggregates Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnNone of the stocks in the Zacks Concrete &amp; Aggregates universe currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Below, we have discussed two stocks from the industry that have solid earnings growth potential. The chosen companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Vulcan Materials Company: This Birmingham, AL-based company produces and supplies construction aggregates, asphalt mix as well as ready-mixed concrete.

Vulcan Materials has been generating higher earnings on the back of prudent cost-control efforts and increased pricing in aggregates. Its focus on a systematic inorganic strategy for expansion is adding to the positives.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Valero Energy (VLO) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Valero Energy currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.23, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.23 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 11 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 84.6% and 7.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for VLOBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for VLOCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Valero Energy here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Valero Energy, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in VLO?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Valero Energy, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 22.8% over the past month to $22.22.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Valero Energy. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Valero Energy may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To combat this, the Fed has continually increased interest rates to combat rising inflation. While this has been mildly successful, with inflation only rising 6.5% in December, it poses an entirely new challenge.What happened: Since 2020, the U.S. debt has increased by $8 trillion, with several record-breaking spending bills since former President Donald Trump’s first landmark COVID-19 spending bill — the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. This brought the total federal debt to over $31 trillion.With the current Fed Funds rate at 4.25% to 4.5%, that puts the estimated yearly interest payment on the nation’s debt at over $575 billion for 2023. For comparison, the U.S. paid roughly $475 billion in 2022 and $352 billion in 2021.To stay updated with top startup investments, sign up for Benzinga’s Startup Investing &amp; Equity Crowdfunding NewsletterAs this number continues to spiral, there’s no clear answer on how to get it under control. If the central bank begins printing more money to repurchase the debt “that’s how you get hyperinflation,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, former chair of the Fed, said in a 2019 investors conference.What investors can do: Inflation is a difficult concept from an investing perspective. You can’t hold cash because you’re losing purchasing power while you wait for inflation to pass. With inflation rates hitting as much as 9.1% in recent years, you’re effectively losing a substantial amount of money by holding it. But as markets have shown, the uncertainty causes high-growth stocks to decline substantially, and inflation can hurt margins, causing earnings misses and stock declines. Rising interest rates also could begin to cripple any company already struggling or relying on debt to fund growth and operations.Story continuesTraditionally, one of the best ways to weather this storm is investing in companies focused on products or services that are in high demand regardless of economic conditions. For example, healthcare companies have performed well compared with the overall market. UnitedHealth Group Inc. is up 2.8% in the past year, despite many companies declining in the same period. UnitedHealth also has a yearly dividend of $6.60 per share further adding to its performance.For those with a longer investment timeline and higher risk tolerance, startups can also be a strong option. Valuations are currently suppressed and many don’t have debt because they raised funds from venture capital or retail investors. Sensate, for example, is a startup raising on Wefunder, which means anyone can invest for a limited time. The startup has created a patented solution to stress relief and raised over $2 million from everyday investors and venture capitalists.Other easily recognizable brands like Walmart Inc. can be strong options, depending on your investment thesis. As the Fed works to address these issues, investors can look to both find value in suppressed companies and pivot to safer options until a clearer plan is in place to address these concerns around the looming national debt crisis.See more on startup investing from Benzinga.Never Lose Your Things Again — The Startup Pouring Gasoline on the Apple AirTagMartin Tobias Invested in Google, DocuSign, OpenSea and Over a Dozen Other Unicorns — Here’s What Startup He Is Investing in Next and How to Invest Alongside HimDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Exact Sciences (EXAS) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at -$0.79 a share, just 28 days from its upcoming earnings release on February 28, 2023.EXAS has an Earnings ESP figure of 11.73%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the -$0.79 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.90.EXAS is just one of a large group of Medical stocks with a positive ESP figure. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on April 13, 2023, UnitedHealth Group holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $6.25 a share 72 days from its next quarterly update.UnitedHealth Group's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.57% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.22.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, EXAS and UNH could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

According to a report by Fidelity, during decades when inflation was high since 1930, dividends represented 54% of the stock market’s returns. Moreover, the companies that continuously raised their dividends during high inflationary periods outplayed the broader market.According to a report by iShares, dividend growers fell by 12.5% in bear markets from December 1978 to December 2021, whereas non-dividend payers reported a 30.7% decline in the same period. The report also referred to Bloomberg’s data from December 1999 to December 2021 and highlighted that equity dividends have become the primary source of income in a typical 60/40 portfolio.Another report by JPMorgan revealed that dividends have shown resilience during recessionary periods, even when earnings-per-share tend to drop. The report also mentioned during the high-inflation decade of the 1970s, dividends represented two-thirds of the S&amp;P 500 total return.Dividend companies that have grabbed investors’ attention over the years include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as these companies have raised their payouts for decades, offering long-term benefits to investors.10 Best February Dividend Stocks To BuyDaily newspaper economy stock market chartOur Methodology:For this article, we first identified dividend stocks that pay monthly dividends to shareholders.

The approximately $480 million impairment charge recognized this quarter together with the $409 million impairment charge previously recognized in 2020, effectively reverse a portion of the $2.559 billion gain attributable to the 2019 required write-up.The above amounts are preliminary estimates.

With results from more than 28%of S&amp;P 500 participants already out, the season is off to a decent start, with earnings beats from quite a few players.Investors will be hoping that the momentum continues and a high proportion of companies report better-than-expected numbers. This is because, generally, an earnings beat by a company leads to an uptick in its stock price. Given this backdrop, investors will like to add outperformers to their portfolios for healthy returns.Nonetheless, the task is far from easy with a plethora of companies present in the market. Apart from this, the complexities related to the stock market and the surrounding uncertainties make it even more difficult for individual investors to select outperformers in their portfolios without proper guidance.This clearly suggests that one needs to have in-depth knowledge of the minute details of the investing space. This is quite impossible for individual investors. Consequently, advice of “experts” in this field is much sought after by investors. The experts in the field of investing are brokers. We believe that investors bet on broker-favorite stocks like American Airlines AAL, Delta Air Lines DAL, Cleveland-Cliff CLF, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. ANFand Archer Daniels Midland Company ADM for healthy returns.Why Broker Advice Holds Value?Brokers scrutinize publicly available financial documents, and also attend company conference calls and other presentations. Since brokers recommend (buy, sell or hold) a stock after thoroughly analyzing the nitty-gritty associated with the company, it is then perfect for investors to be guided by their direction of estimate revisions while deciding their course of action on a particular stock.The estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock. In fact, a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation. Similarly, the price of a stock may plummet following a rating downgrade. Estimates can move north for a number of reasons, including a favorable earnings performance, bullish guidance, product launch or an optimistic macro scenario.  To take care of the earnings performance, we designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendations and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Story continuesWinning StrategyThe above write-up clearly suggests that one can arrive at a winning portfolio of stocks by following broker actions. Keeping this in mind, we designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendations and upward revisions in earnings estimates over the last four weeks.Also, since the price/sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information, it is taken into consideration. The price/sales ratio takes care of the company’s top line, making the strategy foolproof.Screening Criteria# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75: This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks.% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10: This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter.To ensure that the strategy is a winning one, covering all bases, we have added the following screening parameters:Price-to-Sales = Bot%10: The lower the ratio, the better. Companies meeting this criterion are in bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio.Price greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors.Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization.Com/ADR/Canadian= Com: This takes out the ADR and Canadian stocks.Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, TX. The gradual increase in air-travel demand (particularly for leisure) is aiding AAL. However, high fuel costs are hurting the bottom line.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AAL’s 2023 earnings has been revised 21.3% upward.

High fuel costs are, however, a bane.Delta’s earnings outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters and missed the mark in the remaining two quarters, with the average negative surprise being 0.09%.Cleveland-Cliffs is a leading iron ore producer in the United States. It supplies differentiated iron ore pellets under long-term contracts to major blast furnace steel producers in North America. The Mining and Pelletizing operation gains from low-cost, high-quality iron ore pellet production with substantial logistics and transportation advantages to serve the Great Lakes steel market. The company should gain from its merger with AK Steel Holding Corporation.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CLF’s 2023 earnings has been revised 101% upward.

(NASDAQ:ORLY) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for O'Reilly Automotive Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.03bUS$2.28bUS$2.19bUS$2.55bUS$2.67bUS$2.76bUS$2.84bUS$2.92bUS$2.99bUS$3.06bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.51%Est @ 3.05%Est @ 2.73%Est @ 2.51%Est @ 2.35% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$1.9kUS$1.9kUS$1.7kUS$1.9kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$17bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.1b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.0%) = US$50bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$50b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$23bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$40b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$792, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at O'Reilly Automotive as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.041. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for O'Reilly AutomotiveStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.ThreatTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value? For O'Reilly Automotive, there are three relevant elements you should assess:Risks: Take risks, for example - O'Reilly Automotive has   3 warning signs  (and 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable)  we think you should know about.Future Earnings: How does ORLY's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

However, an active catastrophe environment and persistent inflationary pressures are likely to have thrown roadblocks for insurers. Some of the insurers, including MetLife, Inc. MET, Aflac Incorporated AFL, The Allstate Corporation ALL, American Financial Group, Inc. AFG and MGIC Investment Corporation MTG, are set to report their fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 1.The insurance space is housed within the broader Finance sector (one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification). Per the latest Earnings Preview, the total earnings of finance companies for fourth-quarter 2022 are anticipated to fall 9.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure, while revenues of these companies are expected to grow 2.8%.Factors Likely to Shape Insurers’ Performance in Q4The top lines of insurance companies are likely to have benefited on the back of growing premiums resulting from uninterrupted rate hikes, exposure growth and solid customer retention rates in the fourth quarter. A rising premium level bodes well, as they contribute a chunk to an insurer’s revenues. Diversified portfolios, which minimize concentration risks, possessed by insurers, are also expected to have provided an impetus to their fourth-quarter premiums.Per MarketScout, a Texas-based insurance distribution and underwriting company, the commercial insurance rates in the United States grew at a composite rate of 5.1% in the to-be-reported quarter. The same source cited a composite rate increase of 5.2% across the personal lines insurance business in the fourth quarter of 2022.However, significant catastrophe losses stemming from Winter Storm Elliott are expected to have acted as drags on the underwriting results of insurance companies in the to-be-reported quarter. Karen Clark &amp; Company expects the storm to produce an estimated loss of $5.4 billion for the U.S. insurance industry.Story continuesDespite coming with its share of worries, catastrophe losses usually ramp up the policy renewal rate and prompt insurers to implement rate hikes. In the fourth quarter, an improving interest rate scenario is likely to have boosted investment yields for those insurers that have exposure to rate-sensitive products. An aging U.S. population is expected to have sustained steady premium flows for life insurers from their insurance and protection products in the to-be-reported quarter.Easing of border restrictions and receding effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have imparted more confidence to people in traveling, which, in turn, is likely to have boosted auto premiums in the fourth quarter. However, inflationary pressures are anticipated to have elevated auto part expenses or labor costs, which is likely to have exerted pressure on the margins of auto insurers.Strength in the mortgage market, supported by increased policy renewal and lower unemployment rates, is likely to have favored mortgage insurance premiums in the to-be-reported quarter.The insurance industry frequently resorts to significant technology investments in blockchain, AI and advanced analytics, which are aimed to accelerate claim payments and automate processes. These investments are likely to have curbed costs and aided the margins of insurers in the fourth quarter.   Let’s find out how the following insurers are placed before their fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 1.The Zacks model suggests that a company needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.MetLife: In the fourth quarter, revenues of MetLife are likely to have benefited on the back of solid performances of its U.S., Latin America, and the Europe, the Middle East and Africa segments. However, reduced net investment income, and universal life and investment-type product policy fees are likely to have acted as headwinds. (Read more: Can Lower Premiums Dampen MetLife's Q4 Earnings?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MET’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings is pegged at $1.76 per share, indicating an 18.9% plunge from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for revenues is pinned at $17 billion, suggesting a 16.1% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.MetLife has an Earnings ESP of -1.50% and a Zacks Rank #3.MET’s earnings outpaced estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 28.00%.

QuoteAflac: Fed interest rate hikes are likely to have provided an impetus to Aflac’s U.S. operations in the fourth quarter, but Japan’s operations are likely to have suffered a blow from adversities on sales. Multiple cost-curbing efforts pursued by AFL are expected to have led to a decline in expenses, thereby aiding margins in the to-be-reported quarter.

Management estimates pretax catastrophe losses of $779 million for the fourth quarter.

However, lower net investment income and an elevated expense level are likely to have created headwinds to the quarterly performance of American Financial. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AFG’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings of $2.95 per share indicates a 28.4% decrease from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $1.7 billion, suggesting a 3.8% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reading.American Financial has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and is Zacks #3 Ranked.AFG’s earnings outpaced estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 28.16%.

Claim payments are likely to have witnessed a downtrend in the to-be-reported quarter. However, escalating underwriting and other expenses are expected to have exerted pressure on the margins of MGIC Investment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MTG’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings is pegged at 59 cents per share, which hints toward a 3.3% fall from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $334.1 million, suggesting 14% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.MGIC Investment has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank of 3.MTG’s earnings outpaced estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 36.34%.

There's no denying a buy of that magnitude suggests conviction in a brighter future, although we do note that proportionally it only increased their holding by 0.6%. See our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams Sherwin-Williams Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn fact, the recent purchase by Chairman &amp; CEO John Morikis was not their only acquisition of Sherwin-Williams shares this year. Earlier in the year, they paid US$260 per share in a US$519k purchase. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being US$237). While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. It is generally more encouraging if they paid above the current price, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 5.21k shares worth US$1.3m. But insiders sold 1.54k shares worth US$401k. In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by Sherwin-Williams insiders. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Sherwin-Williams insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$173m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Sherwin-Williams Insiders?It is good to see the recent insider purchase. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest Sherwin-Williams insiders are well aligned, and quite possibly think the share price is too low. Looks promising! So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

Investments in product innovations, premiumization and technology platforms bode well for players. These favorable trends are likely to have bolstered the top and bottom-line performances of beverage companies in the to-be-reported quarter.Companies are also expected to have gained from accelerating digital investments, momentum in spirits and expansion into newer categories, including the Ready-to-Drink (RTD) category. Notably, RTD has emerged as the fastest-growing alcohol segment since 2018. Most companies in the industry have been collaborating with counterparts to grow their market share in the fast-growing RTD category.Beverage companies have been investing in the latest capabilities, and leveraging technology to better connect with customers and consumers to expand their digital capabilities. Additionally, companies have been benefiting from price increases and supply productivity savings, offsetting the effects of cost inflation. Effective marketing and exceptional commercial execution have been boosting the sales of beverage companies.However, margins are likely to have been an area to watch in the quarter under review. Players in the beverage industry are anticipated to have witnessed higher advertising and promotional expenses, and SG&amp;A costs. Additionally, the industry players have been experiencing elevated ingredient and other input costs, including shipping and freight, labor, trucking, fuel, co-packing fees, secondary packaging materials, and increased outbound freight costs, leading to increased costs of sales and higher operating costs. These are expected to have dented the gross and operating margins in the to-be-reported quarter.The Winning StrategyA strategy to arrive at the potential winners is by picking stocks that have the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Story continuesQ4 ExpectationsThe Beverage industry, which is part of the Zacks Consumer Staples sector, seems poised for growth in the fourth quarter of 2022, owing to the aforementioned trends and initiatives of players. Overall earnings for the Consumer Staple sector are projected to witness a year-over-year decline of 4.4% despite 4.8% higher revenues, per the latest Earnings Preview.Some of the industry players, which are lined up to report earnings in the coming weeks, are PepsiCo Inc. PEP, The Boston Beer Co. Inc. SAM, The Coca-Cola Company KO and Molson Coors Beverage Company TAP.PepsiCo looks well-poised for growth in the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by the resilience and strength of global beverage and convenient food businesses. PEP is expected to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $26.8 billion, implying 6.2% growth from the year-ago quarter's reported figure.For PepsiCo’s quarterly earnings, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.64 per share, suggesting 7.2% growth from $1.53 reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days.Boston Beer’s fourth-quarter results are expected to reflect gains from strong pricing across its portfolio, growth in depletions and shipments, and focus on innovation to revive the Truly brand and expand Twisted Tea’s potential. SAM is expected to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $403.2 million, implying 15.8% growth from the year-ago quarter's reported figure.For Boston Beer’s quarterly earnings, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 64 cents per share, suggesting 811.1% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has moved down 5.9% in the past 30 days.Our PicksOf the companies slated to report earnings, we have identified two beverage stocks that are poised to trump fourth-quarter earnings estimates.Coca-Cola, the soft-drinks behemoth, is likely to record top-line growth and flat earnings when it reports fourth-quarter 2022 numbers on Feb 14, 2023. The company’s fourth-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and an increase in concentrate sales. Underlying share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels are also expected to have bolstered the performance.Currently, Coca-Cola has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +2.98%. The New York City-based company registered an earnings surprise of 8.8%, on average, in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for KO’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $9.97 billion, suggesting 5.3% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. For fourth-quarter earnings, the consensus mark is pegged at 45 cents per share, flat with the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.

Also, the company has been gaining from the revitalization plan and the premiumization of its global portfolio.

502,1c0a7aea-07ea-3642-9b05-89dd22cf7d54,PEP,2023-02-01,7 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now or You’ll Be Kicking Yourself Later,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dividend-stocks-buy-now-181208375.html,1674929528,STORY,"['CVX', 'KO', 'PEP', 'ABBV', '^GSPC', 'LOW', 'VZ']","[The recent rally in equities may be prying some cash off the sidelines. But if you’re investing in pure growth stocks and avoiding dividend stocks altogether, I’d urge caution.No, I’m not talking about what the Federal Reserve will do with interest rates. I’m looking at corporate layoff announcements, the weak housing market, and inflation that may not be going up (but is certainly not going down), at least not where Americans need it most.I know what the bulls are saying. As I write this, more than 60% of the companies that reported this earnings season posted higher earnings. However, earnings are a lagging indicator. I’m not hearing a bullish outlook on the economy from many of these companies, at least looking out over the next couple of quarters.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThis means that there may be one or more legs down to go for stocks. One way to manage through this situation is to buy dividend stocks.I usually like to provide a little something for every investor. But this time, I’m sticking to some of the top dividend stocks on the market today. For some investors, that means looking at dividend yield. Others look at the annual payout per share. That’s the money that’s going back into my brokerage account every quarter – the money that makes the magic of compounding work.So, let’s get right to it. Here are seven dividend stocks that you should buy now, or you’ll wish you had.CVXChevron$179.45VZVerizon$40.64KOCoca-Cola$60.49PEPPepsiCo$169.62ABBVAbbVie$146.28LOWLowe’s$202.49UNHUnitedHealth Group$486.05Chevron (CVX) CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) is one of the first dividend stocks that came to mind, mainly because the company recently announced a 6% increase in its quarterly dividend. This makes it 37 consecutive years of dividend increases for the Dividend Aristocrat.Chevron’s dividend is growing this year and will likely continue growing. The company’s payout ratio is just over 32%. Its dividend yield of 3.2% is slightly better than the average of the S&amp;P 500. But it’s below the sector average. That shouldn’t concern investors too much, because with this dividend increase, Chevron will have paid out $5.77 per share in dividends for the year.Story continuesCVX stock has been moving up and down with oil prices. But some economists and industry analysts suggest that Russia’s continued war with Ukraine and China’s economy reopening is putting a floor of around $80 for crude oil prices. That means that Chevron may have more runway for growth, even after a 40% gain in the last 12 months.Verizon (VZ) Verizon Wireless sign and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for dividend stocks with a nice payout and an excellent yield, you should check out the current situation with Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). The wireless company reported earnings on Jan. 24, announcing a quarterly dividend of 65 cents per share. That gives VZ stock an annual payout of approximately $2.60 per share. Notably, Verizon has also been increasing its dividend for the last 18 consecutive years.On top of that, it has one of the best dividend yields in the entire market at over 6.4%. There is some concern about the company’s payout ratio, which is currently around 50%. This is because Verizon’s earnings are projected to slow to between $4.55 and $4.85 per share in 2023, as opposed to the $5.17 it posted in 2022.However, at just under 8-times earnings, the stock is cheap. And the company believes that much of the spending to build out its 5G infrastructure is behind it. That creates an opportunity for the company to focus on increasing earnings even as it still is heavily reliant on its consumer business.Coca-Cola (KO) coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comMany investors would say that the stocks owned by Warren Buffett are like the simple black dress – always in fashion. That may be a weird way to think about Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), but there’s nothing strange about owning the company’s stock.Coca-Cola fits Buffett’s definition of a “forever” stock. But critics might note that KO stock has only grown 30% over the past five years and is currently just above pre-pandemic levels. Plus, at 26-times earnings, there are cheaper options out there.But the story of Coca-Cola is its iconic brand that allows the company to generate steady earnings back to shareholders. Coke has increased its dividend for 61 consecutive years, making it part of the exclusive Dividend Kings group. And iys dividend yield of 2.9% is above the sector average of 2.62%.Like that simple black dress, Coca-Cola isn’t a stock you’ll embrace daily. But in times like these, you’ll be glad it’s in your portfolio.PepsiCo (PEP) Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comWhen it comes to the taste of their products, there may be a difference between Coca-Cola and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). But as dividend stocks, there’s not much distinction, so it’s good to have both stocks in your portfolio.What many investors prefer about PepsiCo is that the company has branched out from fighting the cola wars. Pepsi has become a snack food giant that houses the Frito-Lay’s and Quaker Foods brands, among others. As I wrote in early January, PepsiCo “straddles the line between “junk foods” and healthy options.”As for the company’s dividend, PepsiCo currently pays $4.60 per share annually with a yield of 2.7%. Like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo is a Dividend King. The company has increased its dividend in each of the last 51 years. There could be some concern over a payout ratio of 65%, but there is no sign that the dividend is in trouble.AbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USASource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comI can’t fault investors for thinking that AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is a “show me” story in this market. The company’s upcoming patent expiry for its key Humira drug in Europe, with a pending expiry in the U.S., means that this is a biotech company with an uncertain outlook. Indeed, Humira has been a cash cow for AbbVie, so investors are right to show some concern.So far, however, it appears that AbbVie has passed its check-up. A big reason for that is the revenue being delivered by Skyrizi and Rinvoq. These two drugs are expected to bring in approximately $15 billion over the next three years.And then there’s the dividend. AbbVie is another Dividend King with a history of increasing its dividend for the last 51 years. It currently sports a yield of 4% and an impressive annual payout of $5.92 per share. AbbVie’s payout ratio of over 70% is probably not sustainable. But ABBV stock is trading at just 19-times earnings, roughly equivalent to the S&amp;P 500.Lowe’s (LOW) the front of a Lowe's storeSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comFairways and greens are a good mantra for golfers facing volatility. It can also apply to dividend stocks like Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW), which can keep your lawn green, as well as your portfolio.Okay, that was terrible, but it does lead to my point. Lowe’s is a home improvement company. And home improvement doesn’t stop just because the housing market is weak. People need to “love the one they’re with,” so to speak, and Lowe’s is well-positioned to help with products for the professional and the do-it-yourselfer.Lowe’s is yet another Dividend King on this list, with a yield of 2.1% and an annual payout of $4.20 per share. The company also has an attractive price-earnings ratio of just 19-times earnings, equivalent to the S&amp;P 500. And with a profit margin that is above the sector average, investors should feel confident about the company’s earnings growth in the coming years.United Health Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comLast on this list of dividend stocks is United Health Group (NYSE:UNH). I’ve included this stock because healthcare continues to be a hot sector for investors.Joel Baglole recently reminded investors that United Health Group is “the largest healthcare company by revenue and the largest insurance company by net premiums in the world.” Looking at sector leaders is an excellent place to start when you’re looking for dividend stocks to buy for the long haul.And if investors are looking for a short-term catalyst, the company’s pharmacy services arm, Optum Rx, just launched Price Edge. This drug price comparison tool helps its members get the lowest prices for generic drugs.Then you can see the company’s dividend. The yield of 1.3% is unimpressive compared to the S&amp;P 500 average. However, it’s desirable among other healthcare stocks. And with a payout ratio that is only 30%, the dividend looks very sustainable.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch had LONG positions in CVX and LOW.

(NASDAQ:REGN) By 31%?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-inc-110027615.html,1675249227,STORY,['REGN'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.44bUS$4.80bUS$5.19bUS$5.60bUS$5.96bUS$6.24bUS$6.48bUS$6.69bUS$6.88bUS$7.06bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.62%Est @ 3.83%Est @ 3.27%Est @ 2.89%Est @ 2.61% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$4.2kUS$4.2kUS$4.3kUS$4.3kUS$4.3kUS$4.2kUS$4.1kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$41bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.1b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.0%) = US$148bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$148b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$76bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$117b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$758, the company appears quite good value at a 31% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.812. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Regeneron PharmaceuticalsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Shareholders have been diluted in the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

505,44a55861-1e86-3afd-8c3b-69e3cb4badcb,REGN,2023-02-01,Analysts Estimate Exelixis (EXEL) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-exelixis-exel-report-150003680.html,1675177203,STORY,"['EXEL', 'REGN']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Exelixis (EXEL) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 7, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis drug developer is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.05 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -117.2%.Revenues are expected to be $416.33 million, down 7.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 12.16% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Exelixis?For Exelixis, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -50%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Exelixis will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Exelixis would post earnings of $0.25 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.31, delivering a surprise of +24%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Exelixis doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, Regeneron (REGN), is soon expected to post earnings of $9.69 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -59.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.17 billion, down 36.1% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Regeneron has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 4.30%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Regeneron will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

When COVID-19 began to spread throughout Puerto Rico, particularly in underserved communities, SIM found itself with a crucial role to play in supporting the health of the medically underserved.While SIM has helped many Puerto Ricans recover from the virus, many are experiencing long COVID, where symptoms persist long past the point of active infection. Recognizing the suffering experienced by these long-haulers, SIM set up the first clinic in Puerto Rico to provide treatment and care specifically for these patients. Made possible through funding support from Q4HE, Puerto Rico's first post-COVID-19 Care Clinic was opened by SIM, and a growing number of patients experiencing long COVID symptoms have been receiving critical tailored care.Through this funding, SIM provides post-COVID-19 patients with care from a multidisciplinary team comprised of specialists in cardiology, psychology, dermatology, gastroenterology, pneumology, and nephrology who are equipped to address respiratory issues, heart and vascular problems, fatigue, neurological abnormalities, and more. Patients benefit by having all their needs examined at once rather than having to visit different doctors who lack access to the electronic health records managed by a different facility.These services are available not only to those inside the scope of SIM's service areas, but also to people across all 78 municipalities of the island, reflecting SIM's long-standing commitment to serving those with the greatest need. Through this innovative clinic, SIM expects to deliver integrated care for at least 2,450 patients who meet clinical admission criteria during the first year of operation, and this number will likely increase.Story continuesWith a strong track record and a comprehensive suite of services, SIM is well positioned to support this post-COVID-19 community and serve as a model for other clinics and centers around the world. With our support, SIM will be able to build upon these resources and help thousands of Puerto Ricans manage and overcome the impacts of long COVID.""There's no doubt that we have a big responsibility; however, we feel proud of being selected by Quest for Health Equity to open the first and only post-COVID-19 Care Clinic in Puerto Rico. We also feel confident that we can accomplish this important task by improving the lives of our post-COVID-19 patients and that this experience will enable SIM to understand the cause of a post-COVID-19 patient's symptoms, find out if the patient is at risk of additional health issues, and create a treatment plan that meets the patient's needs.""- Dr. Gloria del C. Amador FernándezPresident and Chief Executive Officer, SIM""Scientific evidence reveals that a majority of patients who suffer or have suffered from COVID-19 face a variety of ongoing symptoms, from respiratory and cardiac problems to fatigue and neurological symptoms to any number of other symptoms and diseases. In response, we established a team of medical specialists who can help our patients address and overcome these debilitating ailments. With Q4HE's support, this team will be able to serve a growing number of Puerto Ricans in need of this highly specialized and critical care.""- Dr. Nelson AlmodóvarMedical Director, SIM""I am a survivor of COVID-19. Since my family and I overcame the disease in December 2020, we have been waiting for a post-COVID clinic in Puerto Rico. We were pleasantly surprised when we received a call from Salud Integral en la Montaña inviting us to the first clinic. They have met my expectations regarding the follow-up of all symptoms with corresponding specialists to ensure my optimal health and wellness. I urge all the surviving patients of COVID wherever SIM is present to access these valuable services. Thank you for taking care of my and my family's health, and may this clinic continue to help many more people.""- Alberto VazquezPatientRead moreQuest Diagnostics , Tuesday, January 31, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Quest Diagnostics on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Quest Diagnostics Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/quest-diagnosticsEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Quest DiagnosticsView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/737468/Helping-Puerto-Ricans-Recover-From-Long-COVID]"
