I know this is a topic you're passionate about and one that honestly we don't talk about on the show enough. Thanks for being here."", 'Anthony Schiavone: You bet Ricky. Happy to be here.', ""Ricky Mulvey: We'll kick things off for newer investors because we're still in January, and this is when people are getting interested in investing, and there's a lot of big stories about these huge growthy companies. But set the table with maybe the long term case for the dividend paying stocks."", ""Matt Argersinger: Sure. I think when most investors, especially newer investors, when they think about dividend stocks or companies that pay dividends, their immediate thought is, OK, well great, this is a company I'm going to invest in. It's paying out a quarterly or regular dividend and it's all about income. That's what I'm going for. I see stock, it's got a 3% yield are great. But if I'm looking for income, that's all fine. Our arguments though are that it's the place you really want to focus, whether you're a new investor or old investor who's going to retire, or even an investor who's 25 years old just looking to build capital because it turns out there are a lot of studies that support this, but one that we go back to, Anthony Nine, and Anthony actually found this data a while ago. It's data from the Hartford Funds and Ned Davis research, and it goes back and it looks like the S&P 500. The biggest market index out there looks at all the components of the S&P 500 going back to 1971 or 1973. It broke it down and looked at all the companies in the index and companies that pay dividends, companies that didn't pay dividends, and how they performed over this long 50 year stretch, and what it turns out is that if you look at the average stock in the index, the average stock in the index went up about 8% over that time span. The companies that paid a dividend though, went up over 9% on analyzed basis. Even more exciting for us, companies that grew their dividends consistently though increased over 10%. The amazing thing is you got better returns from companies that are paying dividends or growing dividends with much less volatility than the rest of the market. It's a smoother ride. You get income along the way and you're out performing to us that it set so many light bulbs for us, and that's why we started a dividend service here at The Motley Fool recently. But it totally for me, reframed how I approach investing, and what I'm looking for when I think about the core of my portfolio. The core of my portfolio today is dividend growth companies. That was not the case just a few years ago."", ""Ricky Mulvey: But Matt, let's say I'm a young company, I can't afford to pay this dividend because I have too many growth opportunities to invest in. This is the sign that I'm really growing."", ""Matt Argersinger: I'll say one thing I'll pass it over to Ant because he's got some interesting data on that. But even younger companies, Ricky, should think about paying a dividend because as it turns out, small companies, growing companies, great companies, large companies. Companies don't actually do a great job, believe it or not, of reinvesting their capital. We think of companies well there's Apple. Look at the great examples, Microsoft, Alphabet, Starbucks these companies of course they should retain their capital because they've earned such high rates of return for so long. It turns out that's really hard to do and there's only a very small number of companies that actually do that. As Ant is going to talk about here, companies actually are better off paying a lot of their earnings out in dividends and there are some interesting reasons why."", ""Anthony Schiavone: I think that's probably one of the most overlooked part of dividend paying companies, is that when companies pay a dividend, the constructive tension that the dividend puts on the management team is pretty impressive. Say a company pays out say 50% of its earnings, debt management team really needs to make sure that the capital that is getting reinvested into the business is going toward the highest returning projects, and conversely, if the company is generating a lot of cash and they're not paying out a dividend, you're essentially as a shareholder, you're placing a lot of faith in the management team to reinvest that capital at a high rate, and not engage in like foolish behavior, like making a large value destroying acquisition. To that point, I actually came across a study from AQR Capital Management called Surprise. Higher dividends equals higher earnings growth. The study is a bit dated, it took place in 2003, but it contains 130 years worth of data. Ultimately what they found was just that when a company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings as dividends, future earnings growth tends to be higher. Conversely, when a company pays out a lower percentage of its dividends, future earnings growth tends to be lower. Some of the main reasons that the study cited was that major teams tend to pay out more when they have an optimistic outlook on the business. Since they're paying out a large portion of earnings, they're forced to be more prudent when allocating capital."", ""Ricky Mulvey: That's the long term. Right now things are a little bit different than they were just a few years ago. Interest rates are higher. You can get a treasury bill that's paying 4-5% a year. We've seen that hit companies like Charles Schwab. I can get debt funds. I never thought I'd be looking at bond funds, Matt and Anthony, but here I am. I bought a few of them because they're going to pay, and this is diversified across a bunch of companies. They'll pay, 6-8ish percent."", ""Matt Argersinger: No, I agree. The paradigm is certainly shifted and I think that's a really great point to bring up. We are looking in a world of higher interest rates and it's cool, man. You can get 5% on money market, 5% treasury, and these are risk-free for risk-free instruments. Why in the world would I look at a dividend-paying company which has all the risk to get a 3% or 4% yield or lower yield and my best argument would be when you're buying a company or investing in a company that pays a dividend and it's a good company, that company is going to be able to grow that dividend over time. That dividend you're getting is probably going to be protected by inflation and probably going to grow, it's going to vastly exceed inflation if you're finding the right companies and you just can't get that in a T bill or in a bond. It's a fixed payment, and even though those yields look really great today, I would still argue that with dividend paying companies, you're getting growth, you're getting that inflation protection, you're taking on a little more risk. But as we've seen throughout going back many years, that risk is well worth it."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Let's get into some of the filters that we use to find dividend-paying companies that are growing those payments back to shareholders. We've talked about it on the show before and I think you came up with it a few years ago. But I want to reintroduce it to listeners who may be less familiar to the concept of the dividend knights. Maybe they've heard of the dividend kings, the dividend aristocrats, but the dividend knights Matt a little bit less familiar so walk us through what's it take to be a dividend knight and maybe your thought process of putting it together."", ""Matt Argersinger: Sure. This was Anthony and me maybe trying to come up with a more foolish version, more Motley Fool version of the dividend aristocrats or dividend kings, achievers, all those more popular labels. We came up with this dividend knights idea. I think the reason we came up to it, the reason we like it, is because if you look at say, the dividend kings, which is a very impressive list of companies that have raised their dividend 50 or more consecutive years. It's remarkable, but oftentimes a lot of companies on that list will stay on the list by raising their dividend a fraction of a cent even in a given year, so they can actually claim. We raised our dividends, we still were still dividend king, even though the dividend went up a paltry amount. We said, what if we focused instead on the degree by which companies are growing their dividend, not just by 1% or one cent but let's say, what about companies that grew their dividend at better than 10% per year? Not only that, what about companies that beat the market as well? Not just stodgy dividend companies that are slowly raising their dividend over time, we want companies that are beating the market and raising their dividend at a double digit rate. Those are the core tenets of the dividend knights. For us, it's become an awesome source of new dividend paying ideas. Because if you think about a company that over the last 10 years, that's the time frame we use, over the last 10 years, has not only beaten the market, but raised its dividend at a compound annual rate of more than 10%. Well, that company is doing a lot of things. Who's us to study that company and figure out what's going on there and maybe recommend it? That's why we're so excited about this dividend knights concept."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Anthony, I'll kick it to you. Are there any companies, any members of the knights that maybe you want to put the spotlight on?"", 'Anthony Schiavone: Yes, I recently did some boots on the ground research and went to Texas Roadhouse, ticker symbol TXRH. I went there for dinner one night, and it was pretty awesome. Great atmosphere. They had line dancing, which is unique at a casual.', ""Matt Argersinger: That's what drew you in the first place, he was the line dancing."", 'Ricky Mulvey: That was a passive-voice sentence there. Did you watch line dancing? Did you line dance yourself?', ""Anthony Schiavone: I watched it. But anyways, the food was awesome, especially the free rolls they give out as soon as you sit down. It was super affordable. I started to do some more research into Texas Roadhouse, which is a dividend knight, and the company is pretty impressive. They own 722 restaurants primarily in the US, but they also have some international locations too. They're dinner only. They do zero national advertising, zero limited time offers, and they currently have zero debt on their balance sheet. I thought this was pretty impressive. Since they're IPO in 2004, they've grown their revenue and earnings per share every single year except for 2020, when the restaurants were forced to shut down because of COVID. If I just looking at its dividend growth, it's grown its dividend by 16% over the last decade, and that even includes a dividend cut there in the pandemic. I think Texas Roadhouse is a pretty interesting one to keep on your watch list. I think it's a little expensive right now, but maybe investors will get a break in the future."", ""Matt Argersinger: I'll just add. The stock itself is up almost 400% over the last 10 years. It's crushed the market. I mean, I'm not sure a lot of people would think of Texas Roadhouse as this powerhouse little restaurant company, but it certainly has been."", ""Ricky Mulvey: That's actually something I don't think we talked about with the dividend knights list that I liked, is it does give companies the flexibility to cut their dividend for a little bit if they need to. What you mentioned, with the kings and a lot of the aristocrats list, maybe it's actually not in a company's best interest to pay a dividend for a couple of years. You think of Vail Mountain Resorts in 2020 when they have to shut everything down for the pandemic, but because the rules, you get kicked off the list, and that gives them a little bit of flexibility."", ""Matt Argersinger: Exactly, that's why. We're focused on just the growth of the dividend, not not necessarily the frequency or the consistency of it."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Also, I'll throw in a company that has recently got kicked off the list. Anthony, I know you follow it. It is the Grocer Kroger, it was there for a while when I checked last time. No more Kroger on the list. I think it's because it's not really beating the market anymore. Had a lot of pricing power over the pandemic, sales have dipped a little bit. There's a big question mark about whether or not it will merge with Albertsons. Anthony, what do you think it's going to take for that Cincinnati grocer to get back on the Dividend Knights list?"", ""Anthony Schiavone: I think it's going to take some type of resolution to the Albertsons Kroger merger. I think there's a lot of uncertainty around it right now, but I think, either way, once that gets resolved, whether the FTC allows the deal to go through or whether they ultimately shut it down, I think just that certainty will allow the market to move forward with Kroger. You talk about Kroger, I mean, just a massive company, and really the competitive advantage comes down to their scale. They operate 2,700 stores, that's going to be around 5,000 stores. If the merger closes, their average store has about 80,000 SKUs. They have about 430,000 employees. This is a super complex business, and they only get razor thin margins. It's super difficult business, but ultimately the scale is really their competitive advantage helps them to leverage their distribution in advertising costs. I think once we get some resolution to this merger, I think it would be better for Kroger moving forward."", ""Matt Argersinger: I think the scrutiny has been so interesting because they're already saying they're going to divest a certain number of their stores. A significant number of their stores actually, to get this merger done. But even after the merger goes through, they're distant second to Walmart in terms of grocery sales. I'm trying to figure out why it's getting so much regulatory scrutiny, especially since they are divesting because in certain markets. It's not going to be a complete a merger as originally designed, yet the process here is taking forever, and I just don't see why that's the case."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I think there might be some pressure, you have a little bit more of a administration that is hungry to stop a lot of large mergers. There might also be some political pressure from the grocery prices that people are paying. It's a sensitive topic where it's not a secret that grocery prices have gone up. Even for a company like Kroger, sales have declined over the past year, but the margin has gone up, and I think that might capture some folks attention. I'm going to concern troll a bit on Kroger, because I'm a shareholder, so I'll start with that. But I worry it could be like a utility, where it passes that snap test, people would immediately recognize if Kroger was not there, it would be ruinous. But maybe it's not a market beater over the long term, and it's only paying me about 2.5% to wait."", ""Anthony Schiavone: I don't think Kroger will ever be a high-growth business, and it probably, well, never will be. I don't think. But I think labeling as a utility or some type of infrastructure companies is definitely reasonable. I would just say that it's current valuation around 10 times earnings, gives it the market-beating potential. Between dividends and buybacks, management aims to return around 5-6% of the company to shareholders each year. I mean, then if you look at you get 3-5% earnings growth each year. The total return starts to look around high single digits, low double digits. Then with the trading at 10 times earnings, maybe you get a little bit of multiple expansion. Then maybe you're looking at a market beater."", 'Ricky Mulvey: There you go. I want to move on.', 'Matt Argersinger: Hold those shares, Ricky.', ""Ricky Mulvey: I'm on. I want to move on to a topic I don't think we've done on a previous podcast. That is one level down on basically when you google a company, and you see their dividend pay out, and that is the special dividend. A few months ago, Costco announced that it was paying $115 special dividend to shareholders. Setting the table, why do companies pay out special dividends? What is the strategic capital allocation reason?"", 'Matt Argersinger: It\'s an interesting question. It\'s funny that here in the US we call them special, because we\'re very unique to other developed market economies and stock markets. In the US, we have a culture and tradition where companies tend to pay regular dividends; quarterly, semiannual, sometimes annual dividends. Shareholders get used to that. A company will declare the dividend. We\'re paying a 15 cent dividend in a month. Then we\'re likely going to pay that same dividend three months from now, and so forth, and it goes on. We get used to that. But then now and then a company like Costco or another company will come out and say, ""Well, not only are we continue to pay our regular dividend, we\'re going to throw in $15 special dividend."" It\'s like, ""Wow, that\'s incredible,"" amazing shareholders feel good about that. This is actually common practice in a lot of European or Asian stock markets. That\'s because a lot of those companies will tend to tie their dividend to their earnings. If a company has a good year for earnings, they have excess cash flow.', ""They declare a dividend that's appropriate to that level of cash flow. In the US, we can do it differently. It's more of a surprise. It is more special. But I think a company like Costco does it absolutely right. You have a regular dividend, investors get used to that. It gets mentioned that discipline that we talked about earlier about we have to pay this dividend every quarter, but in good times when we have excess cash flow, and we want to share more profits with our shareholders, we're going to pay a special dividend as well. Costco tends to do it pretty regularly, so their special dividend is almost becoming a regular dividend. I think it's important when it is a company like Costco, factor that into your yield. Factor that into your return expectations. You might look at Costco's regular dividend yield. It might look pretty paltry. I think it's less than 1%, but if you factor in those special dividends, it's got a much higher yield over time."", ""Ricky Mulvey: It's also a specific choice for management. We'll focus on the American companies to not buyback shares and pay out those special dividends especially when you have companies doing a mix of both. Maybe they're saying, you know what? In our view, these shares aren't undervalued."", ""Matt Argersinger: No, I agree. I would say we could do a whole show on buybacks. [laughs] If you ask Anthony and me, we're so much more in favor of dividends and special dividends, because management teams like they reinvest capital, they tend to buy back their shares at really bad times as well, and so a good mix of both. If you can find a company that does a good mix of both, maybe an emphasis on the dividend and buybacks are more of the infrequent capital allocation choice, that tends to be the right mix from our point of view."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I got a company that's buying back a lot of shares in about 30 seconds. So you guys focus on dividend-paying companies, are there special something you hunt for? Or is there something where maybe investors can find companies that are a little bit better about paying these special dividends especially when it's not as visible on that surface level search when you're looking at a company on google and it shows up is a paltry dividend, but you may not know that they're paying out 15, 20 bucks a share on a regular basis?"", ""Matt Argersinger: That's a good question. It's not a big part of my process. In other words, I'm focused on the regular dividend because I like to see the history and the growth over time and the special dividends tend to distort that. You can't really get an easy gauge on, OK, well, if they paid a special dividend one year and they waited three or four years to the next one, is that really something I should factor into my return expectations for the stock? It's a little wonky. To me it's still a bonus. You can find a company like a rare company like Costco that does it both does it really well, that's a bonus to the research. But generally we're focused on regular dividends."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I want to talk about a dividend night that we don't talk about on the show that I've been dying to talk about. So Matt, I appreciate you signing up to talk about Dillard's with me. It's a big clothing store and it's a survivor in terms of anchor stores at the mall. E-commerce didn't kill it, and e-commerce is not a big part of its business. This is another one where I'm a shareholder of. I have a small position and here's the story. It's a family run company. A ton of inside ownership. Very little short term debt. Enough cash to pay off its entire debt load. Long term debt load. It's not a revenue growth story, but what they're trying to do, is basically pay a lot of special dividends to the employees which own a lot of stock in Dillard's through their 401(k) plan. Also the Dillard's family, which I would assume likes receiving those special dividends. You have some ownership, at least as of 2021, from Ted Wexler, who's on the Berkshire Hathaway team. I don't know. Give me your take, shoot some bullets in my arguments on Dillard's."", ""Matt Argersinger: I don't know, no bullets here. Maybe Anthony has some bullets. But I am just amazed by this story. But this is a story, believe it or not, that I think would be you said if you told someone, one of the best performing stocks over the last 5, 10 years is a department store in a mall, in mostly southern Midwestern states, I think most people would just know, no way. But that is true, but this is actually something that's a little more common in companies that we tend to follow. That's because, take a company like Altria just to use a bad example. But there's a company, Philip Morris Brand Cigarette brand. Revenue hasn't grown at all. In fact, revenues declining. Just like Dillard's, you said it's not a revenue store. I was looking at Dillard's. Their 10-year revenue change, this is cumulative for Dillard's 3%. In other words, the revenue is only 3% higher than it was 10 years ago. But then look at the normalized earnings per share, up 540% over the last 10 years. That's because of buybacks, by the way. Look at the stock price change, 340%. Look at the dividend change, 320%. So this is a company and a management team and a board that made a decision a while ago. It's not about revenue, it's not about opening new Dillard stores because there's not a great future for that. But it's about maximizing the efficiency and operations of our existing stores and allocating a ton of capital to our employees and our shareholders and just see if we can have this profitable business that generates great returns. Look at it, look what it's done. There are a lot of examples of this, actually and why Anthony and I will tend to preach this. But as an investor, you don't have to go out there and find the company that's growing its revenue the fastest. If someone's going to look at Dillard and say, wait, the revenue is like flat or down, why would I even think about investing in this company? You ignore the idea of what's happening underneath the surface at the bottom line, the capital allocation, what management is doing and you can ignore a lot of great, wonderful investment stories by doing that. I would say it's not always about finding the fastest growing companies, the companies can grow their sales the most, the companies that have the biggest market opportunity in something like AI or something. You can find some amazing invest investments digging in the surface, looking at companies that just simply are allocating capital well."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Well into your point, that's because it's not necessarily about revenue, it's about total shareholder return. While I know y'all aren't a huge fan of the share buybacks, Dillard's has executed it to a tremendous degree, they've more than half their shares, they're very interested in buying back their own shares. It gives you a 5.5% dividend yield over the past year if you include the special. If you look at Google Finance, it's less than a percent, but they're very much, this is relatively new within the past few years, paying 15, 20 bucks a share back to their shareholders, which aligns you with the management a little bit."", ""Matt Argersinger: Exactly. You mentioned the buybacks. So I'll just point out last 10 years shares outstanding for Dillard's down 63%. So they've bought back 63% of the business over the last 10 years. Amazing."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I will say one thing it has in common with Altria, both are trading at less than nine times earnings, single digits there. We have focused on individual companies. But building a portfolio of dividend paying stocks, you don't necessarily need to just pick companies. There's a lot of ETFs you can get. I like dividend ETFs for the defensive part of my portfolio. Maybe this is good for helping someone else invest in your family. Maybe they don't like picking stocks. I know this is something that's happened recently for you, Matt. Let's talk about some of the dividend ETFs. Are there any you want to talk about or any that you have used personally?"", ""Matt Argersinger: One that I've followed for a while and invested in is the US Schwab Dividend Equity ETF, ticker is SCHD, and it's got a great track record. Up until about a couple of years ago, it was handily outperforming the market. Then recently, with the rise of the rebound of the Nasdaq and rest of the market, it's fallen a little bit behind. But it is a wonderfully managed ETF, really focused on high-quality dividend-paying companies that can grow their dividends over time. Recently we decided to roll over one of my wife's old 401(k)s to an IRA. It was a big lump sum, and rather than try to invest in individual stocks, which would take a while, this was the end of last year, I said one of the ETFs that I love, that's really lagged that I think is going to have a great future is the Schwab Dividend Equity ETF. So I said, you know what? We're going to do, we're going to take 50% of this new IRA and we're going to put it right into the Schwab ETF. We'll think of it as our core dividend index of this IRA that we're just going to invest whole, reinvest the dividends over time. Then with the rest we'll probably buy some individual stocks. But I wanted that to be one of the core investments of that new IRA. I'll say one more too, if you're interested in dividend growth specifically, and we talked a lot about that in the show, it's our preferred strategy, there is the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, V-I-G, VIG and it also has a pretty good track record and there with that ETF, you'll see a smaller yield because it's investing in companies that are tending to grow their dividend fast rates over time. That also has really done well as well. That's just another, again, another low cost big ETF, dividend ETF that's out there that you could invest in as well."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Matt Argersinger, Anthony Schiavone. They also work on a service at The Motley Fool. You can guess what it's about. It's called dividend investor. Appreciate your time and talking about investing with me on this Saturday."", 'Matt Argersinger: Thank you, Ricky.

Often the mistake involves taking on more company-specific risk than expected, but sometimes the problem is more subtle. The risk of a lower total return is what investors need to consider when comparing SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT: SPYD), which has a yield of 4.6%, to Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEMKT: SCHD) and its 3.5% yield.', ""From a big-picture perspective, investors buying broad-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF and Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF are looking for simplification. In this case, instead of trying to build a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks one at a time, you can simply buy a single investment that provides you with a prebuilt portfolio. That's great, but you need to understand what you're buying, and that can require a little bit of work."", ""SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF, for example, isn't just an S&P 500 index clone, which should be clear from the name. It is focused on the highest-yielding stocks in the S&P 500. But how does it actually go about creating that portfolio? Keeping things simple, it lines up the components of the index according to yield and pulls out the 80 highest-yielding stocks to populate its ETF. The index is equal-weighted."", ""There are a few takeaways. First, the S&P 500 index is selected to represent the broader U.S. economy. So stocks in the starting universe are there because of human intervention, and they may not actually be the best stocks in each industry but instead the most important from an economic perspective. Second, high-yield stocks are often out of favor for one reason or another. So SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF might be concentrated in value-oriented companies. Third, there are some sectors that tend to always have stocks with higher yields in them. Thus, the ETF is likely to be more heavily weighted in some sectors. And fourth, the fund is equally weighted. That ensures that each stock has the same opportunity to affect performance, but it also means the best-performing stocks, which are often the largest in a market cap-weighted index, won't have a disproportionate impact on performance."", 'Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF is built off the Dow Jones U.S. Broad Stock Market Index, but real estate investment trusts (REITs) are specifically excluded. To be approved for the ETF, a company must have at least 10 years of consecutive dividend payments and meet minimum size and liquidity requirements. The resulting list is then ordered based on yield, with the top half eligible for inclusion in the ETF. The eligible securities are then ranked on a composite score that looks at free cash flow to total debt, return on equity, yield, and five-year dividend growth. The top 100 stocks from this ranking are added to the index based on market cap.', ""This evaluation is a lot more complex, but unlike the SPDR ETF, it is largely data driven without material human intervention. The starting universe is also larger. And the fundamental screens involved take into account company quality, which would probably weed out many value stocks. That, in turn, should lead to a more growth-oriented portfolio. Meanwhile, the market cap weighting means the largest stocks, which will probably be the best performing, will drive the ETF's performance. These are not trivial differences."", 'For example, there are only two overlapping securities in the top 10 holdings of these two funds: Verizon Communications and Amgen. In SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF, they account for around 3.2% of fund assets combined. In Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, those two stocks make up 8.4% of assets.', ""There are no banks in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF's top 10 holdings. Meanwhile, there are three banks in SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF, all of them regional. Regional banks as a group struggled in 2023 after a series of bank runs in the sector, leaving them out of favor right now."", 'From a bigger-picture perspective, the Schwab ETF has a higher average price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-cash flow ratio. Both of those facts make sense given that the index construction leans more toward growth than the SPDR index.', 'None of these differences is shocking, given the way the ETFs are constructed. But you need to take the time to understand the construction approach to each ETF to understand just how different the two ETFs are. But what do you do with all of this information?', ""If what you're looking to do is maximize the income your portfolio generates, SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF's 4.6% dividend yield easily wins out over Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF's 3.5%. Given the construction of the SPDR ETF, this is exactly the outcome you would expect. To be fair, however, both are notably higher than the yield of the S&P 500 index, which is a scant 1.4%. But picking the highest yield here may miss the bigger picture."", ""In this comparison, the best way to look at long-term performance is through total return, which assumes dividend reinvestment. On a total return basis, Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF is easily the better-performing ETF over the past five years, as the following chart shows. However, it still didn't manage to beat the S&P 500 index (as represented by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF), even though it got a lot closer than the SPDR ETF."", ""From that last point, you have to go back to the purpose of your investment. If you're reinvesting the dividends, then why even focus on an ETF that highlights dividends? Just buy an S&P 500 index and be done with it. But there's a nuance for those looking to live off dividend income but who still want to see capital appreciation, something of a growth-and-income tactic."", ""As the chart above highlights, the price of SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF has basically gone nowhere for five years, meaning the dividend has represented most of your return. The price of Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, on the other hand, rose roughly 50%, leading to a mixture of growth and income for shareholders. And that's probably the biggest takeaway for investors comparing these two ETFs."", ""If you're trying to maximize income over a shorter period, going with SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF probably makes sense. But if you expect to live for another 20 years in retirement, the more growth-oriented Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF looks as if it would better protect you from the ravages of inflation. For many investors, that will be the winning call, even though it will mean less income upfront."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF wasn't one of them.

You probably couldn't live off of the income stream such a yield would generate unless, of course, you own a particularly large nest egg. So, most dividend-focused investors, particularly those in retirement, will probably be looking for stocks with notably higher yields."", ""There are plenty of these high-yield offerings to choose from, but there's a potential problem you need to address before you start making any decisions about which ones to add to your portfolio."", 'Real estate investment trusts (REITs) and utilities are two great places to look for dividend stocks. Financially strong REITs with decades of annual dividend increases under their belts, like Realty Income (NYSE: O), can be bought with a yield over 5%. In the utility sector, you can buy Dividend King Black Hills (NYSE: BKH) with a yield of 4.9%.', ""These aren't anomalies, either; they are just examples of the attractive dividend yields that are often on offer in the REIT and utility sectors. There's another option for finding dividend stocks, though. Sometimes a sector will hit on hard times, and you can pick up some of the strongest companies on the cheap and with historically high yields. During the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, for example, you could have bought integrated energy giants ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) with historically high yields nearing 10%."", ""There's a potential problem here, though, and that's diversification. REITs and utilities are generally filled with high-yield investments most of the time. And industries that have fallen on hard times, by definition, are a concentrated investment opportunity. If all you look at is dividend yield, you may end up with too many stocks from too few industries. You need to cast a wider net, and that may require you to consider lower-yielding investments."", ""As an example, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) has a yield of around 3.1% today. That's not nearly as good as the 5%-plus you could get from Realty Income or its peers, including NNN (NYSE: NNN) and W.P. Carey (NYSE: WPC). However, the chipmaker has increased its dividend annually for decades, and the dividend yield today happens to be near the highest levels in the company's history."", 'Would you be better off owning three companies that do almost the exact same thing or two companies in completely different industries? From a diversification standpoint, spreading your eggs into different baskets is likely to be the safer choice. Technology companies with high yields, like Texas Instruments today, can be tough to find, so when they do show up, you might want to consider adding them to your portfolio to spread your bets around a little more.', 'Gold and silver streamer Franco-Nevada (NYSE: FNV) is another example. It has a 1.2% yield, which is near its highest levels over the past five years. Yes, the yield is modest on an absolute basis, but gold is a hard asset that investors often include in a portfolio specifically for diversification. Franco-Nevada might be worth a deep dive.', ""The thing is, you have to think beyond yield to view Texas Instruments and Franco-Nevada as options for your portfolio. And there are more that could be added to the list, as well. For example, medical device maker Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) has a historically high 3.1% yield. That 3.1% yield isn't as attractive as what you could get from many utilities today, but if all you buy is utilities, you expose yourself to concentration risk. That's a risk that you can easily avoid if you take just a little broader view with your dividend approach and opportunistically add companies in other areas, like healthcare."", ""There isn't one right way to invest, but there are ways that have a history of leading to problems. One big mistake that investors make is focusing so much on yield that they fail to adequately diversify their portfolios. The reason is simple: High-yield stocks are often found in the same sectors. Take a look at your portfolio. If you are highly concentrated in just a few sectors, you might want to widen your investment lens. You may have to lower your yield expectations, but the long-term diversification benefit will likely be well worth it (and it will probably help you sleep better at night, too)."", 'When\xa0our analyst team has an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

It's a pleasure to be here with you all today, sharing the journey of Unum throughout 2023 and where we're headed in 2024. This is the first time we've shared our outlook in conjunction with our year-end results, and I think it works well given the consistency of our actions and performance across the company. As we reflect on our progress and look ahead, I am proud to affirm our unwavering commitment to our purpose of helping the working world thrive throughout life's moments. Steadfast focus and commitment to this purpose is delivering value to customers, employees, communities, and of course to shareholders. 2023 was a year of exceptional results across the board, with the highlight being our decades-long leadership in disability insurance shining through, and core business growth momentum building stronger with significant strides in accelerating our industry-leading digital capabilities."", 'The capabilities we are bringing to market such as HR Connect, Total Leave, Gather, and Help at Hand are becoming connection points with employers and employees to bring greater customer satisfaction to the benefits experience. These advancements have been influential in attracting and retaining customers, setting us apart in a competitive landscape, and ultimately driving strong top line results, including sales of over 13% for the full-year of 2023, and premium growth of over 5%. This top line growth has returned steadily throughout the year, and has us on the trajectory that we look for in our business model. As the topline has returned in 2023 our discipline with how we run the business has now wavered. Our pricing in underwriting has remained consistent to continue to deliver growth and high returns on equity.', ""Overall, we grew EPS 23%, with most of our product line delivering on our expectations throughout the year. I mentioned the highlight of group disability returns, but I would extend that to most of our products that continue to generate mid to high-teen returns. An area that understandably received attention in the third quarter was our closed block. We have seen volatility in the performance of that block, and today Steve will provide some ways to look at its overall health and performance outside of just its loss ratio. From a capital standpoint, we've executed our plans exactly how we described them coming into the year and with good results. So we exceeded expectations on value delivered to our shareholders. We raised our dividend by 10% and increased the pace of our share repurchases throughout 2023 and announced a plan to double the amount we repurchased in 2024 with our $500 million authorization."", 'Most notably, we described the desire to fully fund the premium deserve -- premium deficiency reserve and contribute the capital needed to support our long-term care block. Steve will discuss further, but let me emphasize given our current assumptions and capital buffers, we have stated that we believe long-term care will not need additional capital for five years, but in reality our belief is that will be true for much longer. Across the company the reason that we have been able to achieve such capital results goes back to the fact that our businesses steadily generate strong cash flow and with a year of good results we ended the year with financial metrics that were stronger-than-expected including holding company cash of $1.7 billion and RBC of 415%.', ""Looking forward, we now expect to generate free cash flow between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion per year. As we transition to think about 2024, the momentum from the past several years continues. We're witnessing both a market backdrop and economic environment that are highly supportive of our business, providing us with ample opportunities to grow and thrive. Our focus is to continue building on our solid foundation. We're dedicated to enhancing our core operations, maintaining our discipline approach and continuing to innovate in ways that resonate with our customers and the market. When we look across the company, we are hitting the ground running and our teams are looking to build on some very strong growth rates with consolidated sales growth of high-single-digits and combined with good persistency yielding premium growth in the 5% to 7% range."", ""Consistent margins and the purchasing of shares will deliver growth of 7% and 9% on top of the 23% adjusted EPS growth we delivered in 2023. Our customer-centric approach remains at the heart of our strategy. We're constantly adapting our services to meet changing market needs, ensuring we remain the preferred choice for our clients. When we met last February, we outlined our strategy and plans to build on our market-leading position. We can report that we are advancing along all fronts and we are seeing the results. For Unum in the U.S., we are leveraging our go to market expertise to connect benefit solutions to HR platforms effectively, while also ensuring our leave management is a differentiator. With over 1,500 customers and counting, we've reached a notable sales milestones with our HR connect capability, which deeply integrates with leading human capital management platforms, and we now cover over 1 million employees through Unum’s total leave offering."", 'In addition, we saw strong momentum in the trend of customers bundling products. Our efforts are geared towards seamless enrollment, billing, and administration via MyUnum, and establishing robust connections with select third-party platforms. These efforts to leverage technology to improve the customer experience are paying off. And in 2023, we saw record levels of employer satisfaction for customers on the MyUnum platform. In Colonial Life, the focus is on continuing to build and support our independent sales force with enhanced tools and solutions such as our proprietary industry leading agent assist technology, which enables automated lead generations, CRM and workflow, boosting agent productivity. Another key development are arsenals gather, which modernizers enrollment and benefits administration and streamlines the client experience.', ""The offering has been building is evidenced by the annual premium associated with it increasing from $10 million to $50 million over the course of 2023. And finally enabling Colonial Life agents to offer Unum employer paid products ensures they have the solution for any employer or broker. For Unum U.K., our approach has been to redefine the broker experience, setting a market leading standard that is distinctively Unum, and enhancing our relationship management model. We are dedicated to providing value-added services that drive customer engagement and loyalty, such as through Help at Hand, which offers integrated value-added services, and by delivering comprehensive management information that yields actionable insights. Moreover, we're expanding our product set to encompass a broader spectrum of risk and well-being solutions, ensuring we meet the diverse needs of our clients."", ""And finally, in Unum Poland, we're forging ahead with a robust strategy tailored to the local market. We're scaling our direct to SME sales team and fortifying partnerships with local brokers, thereby extending our distribution network and geographical reach. All these efforts will drive growth in the number of employers and customers we serve and in turn will generate the growth of premiums and earnings we have articulated. Looking forward we will also remain disciplined stewards of our capital and franchise value and consistency of our capital priorities remains intact. First, we ensure investments directly supporting our business. We have a clear growth strategy continue to build at our offering and capitalize on our well positioned and profitable products."", 'Second, we will look externally to identify and pursue selective M&A that supports our internal initiatives and that are in line with this strategy. And third, we will continue to return capital to shareholders via regular dividend increases and share repurchases as we have demonstrated through our actions and increasing both commensurate with our plans. Summing it up, our strong capital generation $500 million of share repurchases and no LTC contributions will leave us in a position of greater than 400% RBC and holding company cash greater than $2 billion. For 2024, our commitment to innovation, prudent capital allocation, and shareholder returns remain steadfast. As a result, we are on track to surpass the objectives we established a year ago and our fortified position in the market is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our teams across the globe.', ""The strides we've made in our digital footprint, customer engagement and capital management are the very engines of our growth. In closing, we enter 2024 with confidence in our position and ready to build off of our achievements of 2023. With our customer first mindset, agile operations, and comprehensive financial strategies, we are not just anticipating the future, we are actively shaping it. 2024 is going to be an exciting year for Unum. I'd like to now hand it over to Steve to provide further insights into our financial strategy and outlook, as well as provide insight into the Closed Block. Thanks for your attention once again today, and Steve, I'll turn it over to you."", ""Steve Zabel: Great, thanks, Rick, and good morning to everyone. As Rick mentioned, we were extremely pleased with the strong finish to the year across the board. This caps two years of continued momentum building in our core operating segments. This is evident in both our sales and operating results. For the full-year sales, we're up 15.1% in Unum U.S., 26.7% in Unum International, and 6.2% in Colonial Life, where we saw accelerating growth each quarter, including 11.5% growth in the fourth quarter, compared to the same period a year ago. Premium for our core operations increased 6.1% in the quarter, compared to a year ago and finished up 5.2% for the full-year, exceeding the expectation laid out last February and more consistent with our long-term expectation."", ""Disability results were favorable across the company as well, highlighted by a group disability benefit ratio of 59.1% for the full-year and 59.5% in the quarter. We do expect benefit ratios in the low-60s to continue in the near to mid-term as we continue to see support for these levels in both our operations and in the market. These same trends are also supporting strong performance in our individual disability and U.K. Group income protection product lines. We ended the year with after-tax adjusted operating income at $1.5 billion and after-tax adjusted operating EPS of $7.66, which represents growth of 23.3% over historically reported full-year 2022. The fourth quarter's results of reported after-tax adjusted operating EPS of $1.79 was impacted by two items that I would like to mention."", 'First, the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was elevated at 22.8%. We expect the long-term rate to be between 21.5% to 22% and vary some from period-to-period due to foreign tax dynamics. The variance in the fourth quarter lowered EPS by approximately $0.03. Further, Colonial Life benefits were higher by $21.7 million or $0.09 of EPS pressure due to a one-time reserve model refinement. When adjusting for these two items, which represents a better view of underlying earnings power, adjusted operating EPS in the quarter would have been $0.12 higher. The strong earnings power for GAAP was also apparent in our statutory results, with full-year after-tax operating earnings of over $1.3 billion, well ahead of our outlook last year of roughly $1 billion.', ""These results drove significant upside to our original expectation of capital generation and as a result, our capital position. Top line results were also notable this year with both sales and premium for our core operations outperforming the top end of their outlook ranges at 13.4% and 5.2% respectively. Fourth quarter's results also show that momentum isn't slowing, which we believe will set us up nicely for continued growth in 2024. These strong growth metrics are a testament to the value of our offering in the market and the success we are seeing with our key strategic initiatives that Rick discussed. Investing in these capabilities to grow our core business is a key capital priority, and as a result, the full-year 2023 adjusted operating expense ratio increased to 21.7%, slightly above our expectations coming into the year."", 'We continue to expect the expense ratio to taper off over time as the impact of our investments take further hold. For full-year 2024, we expect our adjusted operating expense ratio to be slightly lower than 2023. Now let me briefly review our 2023 results by segment. For Unum U.S., adjusted operating income increased 39.4% to $1.36 billion in 2023, compared to $972.6 million in 2022. As mentioned earlier, these results were bolstered by disability performance with group disability experiencing full-year adjusted operating earnings growth of 56.1% and our individual disability line of business, driving overall supplemental and voluntary growth of 11.7% for the year. Further, group disability ended the year with an ROE of 30.8%. The Group Life and AD&D lines experienced adjusted operating earnings growth of 94.8% as the impacts from the pandemic waned.', ""The fourth quarter's results of $68 million were the highest since the beginning of the pandemic and were driven by favorable labor experience, lower incidence in AD&D with continued lower mortality results. From a growth perspective, Unum U.S. earned premium grew 5.2% to $6.6 billion due to natural growth, higher sales and solid persistency. This result was in line with our expected premium growth rate of 4% to 6%. Now moving to Unum International, the segment continued to show strong trends in its underlying earnings power, with adjusted operating income of $158.1 million for the year of 18%, compared to the prior year. Fourth quarter U.K. results were in line with our outlook for adjusted operating earnings levels in the mid-GBP20 million range excluding the impacts of inflation."", ""Inflation has moderated since last year's highs, and we expect this will continue as the environment normalizes, but still benefited the U.K. this quarter by approximately GBP5 million. We are extremely pleased with the growth levels in the U.K,. highlighted by full-year sales growth of 18.6% and premium growth of 11.6% well ahead of our original expectations of 2% to 5% and 2% to 4% respectively. While the U.K. business is the major driver of this segment, Poland saw significant levels of growth, increasing sales 76% and premium 24.2% for the year. Now turning to Colonial, the segment saw growth return after a couple years of challenged results due to the impacts of the pandemic on our sales process and agent productivity. Sales growth of 6.2% and premium growth of 1.4% for the full-year does drive optimism for the further growth in 2024 and our ultimate target to return to the high-single-digits level of growth that this segment historically achieved."", 'From an adjusted operating earnings perspective full-year results of $400.1 million were lower than $412.9 million a year ago largely due to a number of unique items throughout the year, including the reserve model refinement in 4Q. That said, full-year ROE was impressive at 18.1% and we expect a high level of earnings power from this line as we enter 2024. Switching gears to the Closed Block of business and focusing on this quarter, adjusted operating earnings of $21.3 million or below our expected run rate of $30 million to $40 million. And last quarter’s results of $34.2 million, as both long-term care and the remainder of our Closed disability block saw sequential declines. The net premium ratio which is indicative of the life time benefit ratio expectations increased slightly to 93.5% from 93.4% in the third quarter of 2023.', 'Under LDTI, the combination of earnings results and movements in the net premium ratio provides a more comprehensive view of long-term care claims performance, compared to the previously reported interest adjusted loss ratio, which we observed could distort underlying claims experience trends and focus solely on experience in that quarter. Overall underlying claims experience for the Block was largely in line with third quarter. Incidents remained above long-term expected levels, but has improved from the higher levels seen earlier in 2023. We continue to believe that the elevated incidence rates in 2023 were a function of inventory levels normalizing in the environment following the pandemic. We expect to see a continuation of claims catch up in 2024, albeit at a dissipating rate.', ""Lastly, for the Closed Block, our alternative investment portfolio, which largely backs LTC, produced income of $21.5 million in the quarter. Since inception, our diversified alternative portfolio has produced returns in line with our long-term expectation of 8% to 10%. Rounding out the segments, the corporate segment produced a loss of $36.5 million in the quarter and we expect this level loss to continue at slightly higher levels in 2024. So then stepping back 2023 was an incredible year for the company and as we turn to 2024 we see many of the same tailwinds and opportunities to win. So with all that considered it's time to talk about our outlook for this year and I'll start with our view of business growth and earnings power discuss how that plays in the capital generation and then I'll end with a little bit of a discussion on how we're executing on our strategy for long-term care."", ""So just to orient everyone on the slides and make sure that we're following along we're on page seven and I want to kick off this discussion. I really reflect back to a year ago at our last Outlook meeting and in summary we have delivered what we described last February when we were in New York city and are poised to deliver even stronger performance in 2024. We let off that discussion with a key message and that message was that we have the ability and capacity to chart our course in 2023, and I believe that is even more true as we go into 2024. So four key messages for the outlook discussion. Number one is top line growth. It is very strong and it's fueled by momentum and the digital capabilities that Rick mentioned. Number two, the earning growth rates really stabilizing back to our long-term expected range after two years of very high levels of growth coming out of the pandemic, and specifically some highlights that I'd like to note."", ""First, group disability is back to pre-pandemic incidence rates with historically favorable levels of recovery. The second thing to note is Group Life is back to pre-pandemic levels of earnings. Third, we have a full recovery of our U.K. business model with double-digit growth rates. And lastly, momentum continuing to build in Colonial Life and the franchise that we have there. The third message for the outlook is we're at an inflection point in free cash flow and that's due to no contributions needed for long-term care in 2024, which will allow us to return more capital to shareholders, while maintaining significant capital buffers. And I would end with a key message of our capital generation is really at full strength with all capital metrics well in excess of targets."", ""Then I'll move on to page eight and I just want to briefly hit on some highlights for top line expectations. We have healthy core businesses, which will deliver strong levels of growth in 2024, but I want to reflect a little bit that we just came off a really good growth story in 2023 in Unum U.S. sales grew 15% with premium growing over 5% in international sales, we're close to 30% premium growing over 14% and in Colonial sales growing at 6.2% with premium close to 1.5% growth. And then I would say the top this all off, we have maintained industry leading margins. Our secret sauce is really to grow in a disciplined way that is sustainable and leads ultimately to earnings growth and capital generation for future growth and deployment to our shareholders."", ""Moving on to page nine, talk a little bit more about earnings growth. So the top of the house view here is with most of our 2024 metrics they are in or relatively in line with our long-term expectations. Long-term expectations for sales increased as we see the benefits of our investments in technology. We have strong projected earnings growth, despite record levels of earnings power in 2023. It really shows the strength of the franchise. But what I'm most optimistic about is our premium growth story as we believe that growth rates of our core businesses can surpass the growth we saw in 2023, which was still a year of recovery in some ways. Then transitioning to page 10, talk a little bit about our sources and uses of capital and I'll orient you on the left side of the page around capital generation and really start with statutory earnings."", ""Similar to the GAAP earnings that we just discussed, U.S. Statutory earnings are also projected to be robust. But the one thing just to remind the audience of is that these earnings will be available for dividends up to the holding company in the following year or 2025. But 2023 Statutory earnings of over $1.3 billion are available to us this year in 2024. I'd move next to International dividends. Given the recent performance in the U.K., they are now able to contribute their fair share of earnings through dividends to the holding company. Next, our service agreements. Those are mainly through investment management agreements and they continue to be a strong source of free cash flow to the holding company. And so our capital generation capacity remains strong and in line with our 2023 actuals, but well above last year's outlook."", 'So considering our interest expense expectation of $200 million, our free cash flow generation is a healthy $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion as we move past the period of capital contributions being needed for LTC. So then we arrive at capital deployment back to our shareholders and that is also increasing significantly with an expected increase in the dividend of 10% to 15%, which we will discuss with our board later this spring and announce in the coming months. And doubling the amount of dollars spent on share repurchase consistent with the authorization we received at the end of last year. I would note that these repurchases in 2024 may not be straight line throughout the year if we do see opportunities in the market to maximize this authorization throughout the year.', ""And then our use of excess capital generated will follow our capital priorities, grow core businesses either through organic investment or inorganically, shareholder dividends and then share repurchase. So then moving on to slide 11 talk a little bit about capital targets I'm not going to spend too much time here as you will see consistency in our targets and our company performance. 2023 saw capital levels well in excess of our targets and 2024 projections to be similar, providing a substantial financial flexibility. I will add that these levels of flexibility are supportive of our goal of maintaining a single A financial [strength] (ph) rating. We continue to make progress on that front in 2023 with our upgrade by Fitch towards the end of last year."", ""Okay, let's move on to a few topics regarding long-term care, and I will move to page 13. So to recap our strategy, we have a focused strategy for managing the Closed Block, which we have progressed and continue to progress, and is focused on three things: creating value; reducing the footprint; and increasing predictability of outcomes. In line with this strategy, we executed on a number of items we teed up as priorities with you in early 2023, and we continue to use a number of actions as we enter 2024. We have continued to mitigate interest rate risk and have done so at the current favorable interest rate environment. By repositioning cash flows and hedging, we've been able to reduce interest rate sensitivity to-date by 2%. And how we measure that is with a basic DV01 measurement, which is really the dollar duration impact to surplus."", 'So think about the sensitivity of our surplus to 100 basis point movement in prevailing interest rates. We continue to pursue justified rate increases. Last year we achieved over $450 million in GPV of increases and are nearing $4.5 billion of rate increase value since we started our program. And then we are using our strong capital position to create capital capacity and flexibility, providing the ability to navigate adverse events and creating confidence in our go forward free cash flows. As committed last year, we fully recognized the premium deficiency reserve at year end. This was an important step in protecting our future cash flows, and we will talk more on this in a moment. And finally, we remain active and will continue to look for risk transfer solutions.', ""So then moving on to page 14, I want to spend a little bit of time talking about our interest rate risk management and really want to cover three topics here. One, discuss where we've been and accomplished over the last year. Two, what the benefit of those actions were. And three, how that has helped to mitigate any capital requirements in a downside interest rate scenario. So first of all, I'll talk about hedging and repositioning and how that's allowed us to better match duration, improve quality and reduce interest sensitivity. So we kicked off our more recent hedging program at the beginning of last year. Since then, we have entered into $2.6 billion of notional treasury fords, and those do have an average treasury yield of 4%. And as you know, we look out and take a seven-year horizon and it's really to try to de-risk the yields at which we can invest those cash flows as we look to the near to medium term."", ""Secondly, in the third quarter of last year, we executed on a $700 million repositioning program within the LTC portfolio. And the objective of that was really to look at shorter duration assets and de-risk the new money rate that we would be able to invest those on and extend the duration to longer duration assets. We took the opportunity to do that at a nice place in the interest rate environment. We improved portfolio quality, we increased yield, and we did extend duration with no capital impact. And so the results of that is we were able, as I mentioned, we were able to improve our duration matching measures by 25%, but we also reduced the PDR in Unum America, the sensitivity to interest rate movements by 30%. And that's really demonstrated then in the chart on the right side of the page."", ""And so let me explain the table on the right quickly. It's really the same concept that we used in our investor day materials last year, but I just want to orient you on it. At year-end, the premium deficiency reserve that was recorded was at $1.6 billion, and then the sensitivities that we're showing here are for the 30-year treasury yield and the impact that those would have over time with our new money rate assumption that then is incorporated into our liability discount rate. And so as an example at a 4% assumption, the $1.6 billion of PDR would be reduced by $1.1 billion, assuming that the 4% assumption worked its way all the way into our three-year trailing average that we use for that construct. So the [Technical Difficulty], it really provides flexibility and appropriately manage our LTC commitments."", ""And so I think it's key to concepts here. One, we do have time to adapt as those rates work into our assumption. But I think the other thing that's very important, and we have a note on the page, is that our interest rate management actions have significantly dampened any downside risk of interest rate movements on the PDR and I'll call out the 2% assumption here and highlight the fact that that sensitivity has been reduced by $450 million, because of the actions that we have taken over the last couple years around both hedging and our repositioning of the portfolio. Alright then I'll move on to page 15. And we wanted to give a little bit more information about both how we think about reserve sufficiency, but also some sensitivities. And so the orientation for this page is we talk about $2.8 billion of protection, what that really represents is our view of our current level of statutory reserves in excess of our view of the best estimate of that liability for the liability that's within Unum America and reinsured to fair win."", 'Plus the excess capital that we have within the fair win entity in excess of those targets that we set. Then when you go to the table, those are really sensitivities independent of that protection where we look at the assumptions built into our best estimate and we look at the dollar amount impact to our best estimate given the sensitivities. And so specifically, I would say these are liability assumption sensitivities. We addressed interest rate sensitivities on the previous page. So let me walk you through a little bit sensitivities themselves. So on the premium rate increase, the $1 billion really represents the full amount of value we have currently in our best estimate assumption. And so the sensitivity is to completely remove that. I would say from my perspective, we have had a great track record over the years to be able to deliver on achieving our premium rate targets.', ""In fact, we've already made very good progress in the achievement of that $1 billion just since we've launched the program back in the fall. Secondly, morbidity and mortality improvement, the assumption within the best estimate reserve is $700 million. And so this sensitivity would be to fully remove that. We do believe, and we've seen over time, improvement in both morbidity and mortality in our experience. So we do believe that, that assumption is backed up by the data and the experience that we've seen, but we've gone ahead just for purposes of the presentation to fully remove that, to give an indication of the size of that assumption. And then we have three more assumptions, which are policy lapse mortality or claim and incidence and our claim resolutions."", ""We've given sensitivities here down 7.5% for the level of lapses and mortalities, an increase in claim incidence of 3%, and a decrease in claim resolutions mostly due to mortality of 2%. And the way to think about that is that those roughly approximate a one standard deviation difference over the entire life of the business for the sensitivities. And you can see the resultant impacts to our best estimate. The one thing to also remember, though, when it comes to those last three assumptions, it's critical to remember that we still do have the ability to increase our rate increase actions as a form to mitigate those adverse developments and the impact of those additional rate increases are not reflected in these individual liability sensitivities."", 'So then two other items to note on this page. First of all, excess capital as it emerges, which we do think will emerge in Fairwind over time, it can be used to meet LTC needs across all legal entities. And the point there is we do have the ability over time to make decisions about how to use that excess capital that over time we believe will build in Fairwind. And then the second item note is given our current position along with the PDR balance dynamics described above would be expected to meet the capital needs of the book as it does progress to peak reserves in the next 10-years. So just to reiterate, under our current assumptions and in a current interest rate environment, the actions we have taken create confidence that future cash flows of the enterprise will be insulated from LTC needs.', ""And then I'll finish off on page 16. So to close this out, let's discuss some key indicators of long-term health of the business. And we look at four metrics. First, the net NPR or net premium ratio. With the shift to LBTI, we believe that NPR provides a long-term outlook for block claim experience. And we will look at the movement in that metric over time. We gave that movement in our comments this quarter and we'll continue to do that over time. Secondly, Closed Block earnings. While we expect quarterly volatility, we would expect an annualized run rate in the $130 million to $160 million range in an environment where experience may vary quarter-to-quarter, assuming alternative asset yields are near longer-term ranges. The third metric would be rate increased progress, and this is a key element of our strategy, and we monitor progress against our best estimate assumptions."", ""We call that we increase the scope of the program with our latest assumption review, and so we'll give information over time how we're progressing as a percentage against that best estimate assumption within the reserve liability. And then lastly the 30-year treasury rate and in particular we will look for the three-year average to remain above the 2.84% rate, which represents the current three-year average. That rate underlines our new money assumption that feeds into our liability discount rate for the premium deficiency reserve. Rates above this would signal a positive impact on the overall discount rate and related balance of the premium deficiency reserve as we represented on page 14 of this stack. So to wrap up, we have very exciting top and bottom line expectations for 2024."", ""We think our financial flexibility has never been stronger and we look forward to the year ahead. Thank you again for attending today's call and I look forward to your questions and now I'll turn the call back over to Rick to close."", ""Rick McKenney: Great thank you Steve. As you can see and based on Steve's and my comments, 2024 is shaping up to be a great year for Unum. The teams are very focused on what we want to achieve this year and continued momentum in our core business and the inflection point we're seeing with capital now that our LTC block is funded as Steve articulated, really puts us in a very good spot. So there's plenty of topics to discuss today. So with that, our team is here to field questions and I'll turn it back to you, Rob."", 'See also 15 High Quality Flannel Shirts for Men and 15 Countries With Highest Mortgage Rates.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Edwards’ Evoque device is inserted through a minimally invasive surgery and is designed to replace the tricuspid valve.', 'Competitor Abbott has submitted a device for FDA approval called TriClip, which clips together a portion of the leaflets of the tricuspid valve to prevent blood from leaking back. The FDA plans to hold an advisory panel on Feb. 13 to discuss the device. ', 'The approval for Evoque is a “meaningful milestone for [Edwards] as well as for the industry,” Shagun Singh, an RBC Capital Markets analyst, wrote in a research note.', 'The FDA’s approval came earlier than expected, with Edwards forecasting a decision by mid-2024, Singh wrote. It was based on the results of Edwards’ Triscend II pivotal trial, which found that 98.8% of patients achieved moderate or lower tricuspid regurgitation after six months and had an adverse event rate of 27.4% after 30 days.\xa0', 'Edwards, which announced the FDA approval Friday, also received a CE Mark for the device in October.\xa0', 'Singh expects adoption of the device to be more gradual than with transcatheter aortic valve replacement, given different disease etiologies and patient anatomies and the lack of a parallel surgery pool.\xa0', '“Our checks also suggest that it is early for the field as more clinical evidence is established, and as doctors assess which patients are best suited for such therapies. That said, this is a highly underserved population as most tricuspid patients have limited to no treatment options today,” Singh wrote.\xa0', 'Currently, tricuspid valve repair is usually done with open-heart surgery or managed using medications to control symptoms. Edwards’ device is indicated for patients with symptomatic severe tricuspid regurgitation despite treatment with medications.\xa0', 'Other minimally invasive treatments are also on the horizon. BTIG analyst Marie Thibault expects Abbott’s TriClip G4 will be approved given positive safety and efficacy data from its Triluminate pivotal study.\xa0', '“We are not sure why an FDA panel is being convened for TriClip, but Evoque was approved without a panel,” Thibault wrote in a research note.\xa0', 'Edwards’ Evoque system is part of its transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies segment, which brought in $52 million in sales in the third quarter.', 'This story was originally published on MedTech Dive.

However, though equity markets may experience periods of low volatility, historical trends and data suggest that volatility is an inherent and cyclical aspect of these markets.', 'Charlie Bilello, Chief Strategist at Creative Planning, pointed out yesterday that ""The S&P 500 fell 1.6% today, the first daily decline of 1% or more this year. Since 1928, the average year has 29 of these declines. It was a very mild January up until today – expect more volatility to come."" Knowing that the data favors more volatility ahead, now is the time for investors to understand how to handle such volatility. Below are x ways to handle volatility:', 'Knowing and understanding your investment time horizon is essential at any time but is especially important to know during high volatility periods in the equities market. Below are two examples', '· Long-term or retirement investment: In this time horizon, investors should understand that volatility is inherent, but the general market will rise in a long enough time frame - nothing should change.', '· Active/intermediate investors or traders: These investors may want to wait for the smoke to clear.', ""Since there is not much to do for long-term investors other than stay the course, let's dive deeper into three important ways active investors can handle volatility:"", 'Excessive position sizes during volatile market conditions can harm traders for several reasons. High volatility amplifies price swings, leading to an increased risk of significant losses. Top-heavy positions magnify the impact of adverse market moves and cause poor, knee-jerk decisions.', 'The fix:Get off margin and lower your position size until the smoke clears. A good rule of thumb I have implemented is to never risk more than 1% of my capital on a trade. In other words, if my account is $100,000, I should never lose more than $1,000 on a trade. This simple risk mitigation framework allows me to be wrong often and not blow up my account.', ""Active traders can alleviate many headaches by simply trading in sync with the trend. When a moving average is flat or trending down, it's best to avoid overtrading. Conversely, the odds are stacked in the bull's favor when a moving average is trending higher. Below is an example using the Nasdaq 100 ETF :"", ""The fix: The 50-day moving average slope is the best timeframe to watch for intermediate traders. Consult a chart and ensure the moving average's slope is trending higher if you are trading to the long side."", ""Beta measures a stock's volatility relative to a market index; lower beta stocks tend to be more stable and experience smaller price swings than the overall market. In volatile conditions, these stocks are less risky and more conservative. You can find a stock's beta on the Zacks.com homepage."", 'For example, tobacco giant Altria has a .66 beta, meaning its expected volatility is lower than the S&P 500 Index. The low beta makes sense – regardless of the economy or market, people will still smoke cigarettes. Other low-beta stocks include discount retailers Dollar General, Walmart and Costco Wholesale.', 'As investors navigate the dynamic landscape of the stock market, the certainty of volatility becomes apparent. Investors can combat volatility by decreasing position size, ensuring the market is in an uptrend, and gravitating toward low-beta stocks.', ""Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? "", ""Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal year 2024 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.We are including information in our press release and on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information in our earnings press release which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website. I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our earnings press release and in the reconciliations on our website.Net sales in the December quarter were $1.766 billion, which was down 21.7% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 63.8%, operating expenses were 22.5% and operating income was 41.2%. Non-GAAP net income was $592.7 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.08.On a GAAP basis, in the December quarter, gross margins were 63.4%. Total operating expenses were $590.6 million and included acquisition and tangible amortization of $151.3 million, special charges of $1.1 million, share-based compensation of $38.8 million and $1.5 million of other expenses. GAAP net income was $419.2 million, resulting in $0.77 in earnings per diluted share. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted from an IRS notice that clarified the treatment of costs incurred by a research provider under contract that we had been accruing for and that accrual was released in the quarter.Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 13.2% in the December quarter. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal year 2024 is expected to be just under 14%, which is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. Our fiscal '24 cash tax rate is higher than our fiscal '23 tax rate was for a variety of factors, including lower availability of tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits, lower tax depreciation with our expectation for lower capital expenditures in the U.S. in fiscal '24, as well as the impact of current tax rules requiring the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes.We are still hopeful that the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&D expenses will be pushed out or repealed. The House actually passed the tax bill last night that would achieve this, and we will see how this progresses through the Senate. If this were to happen, we would anticipate about a 200 basis points favorable adjustment to Microchip's non-GAAP tax rate in future periods.Our inventory balance at December 31, 2023, was $1.31 billion. We had 185 days of inventory at the end of the December quarter, which was up 18 days from the prior quarter's level. Although we reduced inventory dollars in the quarter, we were not able to make as much progress as we would have liked, as we continue to accommodate requests by customers to push out delivery schedules for products that were very far through the manufacturing process. At the midpoint of our March 2024 quarter guidance, we would expect inventory dollars to be up modestly and days of inventory to be in the range of 225 to 230 days due to the significant reduction in revenue and cost of goods sold.We also continue to invest in building inventory for long-lived, high-margin products whose manufacturing capacity is being end of life by our supply chain partners and these last time buys represented 10 days of inventory at the end of December. Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter were 37 days, which was up 2 days from the prior quarter's level.Our cash flow from operating activities was $853.3 million in the December quarter. Included in our cash flow from operating activities was $30.4 million of long-term supply assurance receipts from customers. We have adjusted these items out of our free cash flow to determine the adjusted free cash flow that we will return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, as these supply assurance payments will be refundable over time as purchase commitments are fulfilled. Our adjusted free cash flow was $763.4 million in the December quarter. As of December 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $281 million.Our total debt decreased by $392 million in the December quarter, our net debt decreased by $416.4 million in the quarter. Over the last 22 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down $7.1 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends and stock buyback to bring down this debt.Our adjusted EBITDA in the December quarter was $796.2 million and 45.1% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was $4.26 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.27x at December 31, 2023, down from 1.56x at December 31, 2022. Capital expenditures were $59.5 million in the December quarter. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2024 is between $300 million and $310 million which is down from the $300 million to $325 million we shared with investors last quarter as we are delaying certain capital given the more challenging economic backdrop.We expect that our capital investments will continue to provide us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $47.1 million.I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter as well as our guidance for the March quarter. Ganesh?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', 'Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our December quarter results were disappointing and below our expectations with net sales down 21.7% sequentially and down 18.6% from the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP gross and operating margins came in at 63.8% and 41.2%, respectively, down from our recent strong performance, but somewhat resilient despite the significant sequential decline in revenue. Our consolidated non-GAAP diluted EPS came in at $1.08 per share, down 30.8% from the year ago quarter.Adjusted EBITDA was 45.1% of net sales in the December quarter, continuing to demonstrate some resiliency. As a result, we had good debt reduction in the December quarter and despite the lower adjusted EBITDA we generated, our net leverage ticked down to 1.27x. However, we expect our net leverage ratio to rise for a few quarters, as trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA drops when replacing stronger prior year quarters with weaker ones.Our capital return to shareholders in the March quarter will increase to 82.5% of our December quarter adjusted free cash flow as we continue on our path to return 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders by the March quarter of calendar year 2025.My thanks to our worldwide team for their support, hard work and diligence as we navigated a difficult environment and focus on what we could control so that we are well positioned to thrive in the long term.Taking a look at our December quarter net sales from a product line perspective, our Mixed-Signal Microcontroller net sales were down 22.3% sequentially and down 18.5% on a year-over-year basis. And our Analog net sales were down 30.9% sequentially and down 29% on a year-over-year basis.Now for some color on the December quarter and the general business environment. All regions of the world and most of our end markets were weak. Our business was weaker than we expected as our customers continue to respond to the effects of increasing business uncertainty, slowing economic activity and a resultant increase in their inventory. In addition, many customers implemented extended shutdowns of closures at the end of the December quarter as they manage their operational activities.We continue to receive requests to push out or cancel backlog as customers sought to rebalance their inventory in light of the weaker business conditions and the increased uncertainty that we\'re experiencing. And we were able to push out or cancel backlog to help many customers with these inventory positions.With no major supply constraints, coupled with very short lead times and a weak macro environment, we believe there is inventory destocking underway at multiple levels at our direct customers and distributors who buy from us, our indirect customers who buy through our distributors and in some cases, our customers\' customers.The very strong upcycle of the last 2 to 3-years drove many of our customers to build inventory in order to be able to capitalize on strong business conditions in an uncertain supply environment. The term, ""just in case"", instead of ""just in time,"" was used by customers to express their approach to these conditions. But as the macro environment slowed, many of our customers found their business expectations to be too optimistic and ended up with high levels of inventory. And as a result, they sought to cancel or reschedule backlog.An update on our PSP program. During the early stages of the upcycle, we launched our PSP program requiring non-cancelable backlog in exchange for supply priority in a hyper-constrained supply environment. The program was aimed to discourage speculative demand and achieve mutual commitments between our customers and us for future demand. The program worked extremely well for many customers who participated during all of 2021 and 2022 as well as the early part of 2023, supporting strong growth in their businesses.However, the business challenges, which led to the creation of the PSP program are no longer relevant, and we have, therefore, decided to discontinue the program effective today. If business conditions warranted, we may at some point in the future, initiate a similar program, which will, of course, have to be adapted to whatever that situation requires.Reflecting the slowing macro environment, our distribution inventory grew to 37 days at the end of the December quarter, as compared to 35 days at the end of the September quarter. We are working with our distribution partners to find the right balance of inventory required to serve their customers, manage their cash flow requirements and be positioned for the eventual strengthening of business conditions.Our internal capacity expansion actions remain paused. Given the severity of the down cycle, our factories around the world will be running at lower utilization rates and also taking up to 2 shutdown weeks in each of the March and June quarters in order to help control the growth of inventory. We expect our capital investments in fiscal year \'24 and fiscal year \'25 will be low even as we prepare for the long-term growth of our business.To that end, we reached a preliminary memorandum of terms with the Department of Commerce for $162 million in grants targeted at existing projects for 2 of our U.S. fabs. These grants are subject to diligence by the CHIPS office as well as capacity investments by Microchip over multiple years. We have been driving our lead times down and have reduced average lead times from roughly 52 weeks at the start of 2023 to roughly 8 weeks by the end of 2023 on average.During a period of macro weakness and business uncertainty, we believe short lead times are the best way to help customers navigate the environment successfully and improve the quality of backlog placed with us as it enables our customers and Microchip to engage an uncertain environment with more agility and effectiveness. However, a significant reduction in lead times is also resulting in lower bookings and reduced near-term visibility for our business.We\'re also taking steps to reduce our expenses. In addition to the variable compensation programs, which provide automatic reductions during a down cycle and normal containment of discretionary expenses, we will be implementing broad-based pay reductions. Our team members who are not a part of the factory shutdowns will take a 10% pay-cut. And consistent with our normal practice, the executive team will take the largest reduction with a 20% pay-cut.The shutdowns for manufacturing team members and pay cuts for non-manufacturing team members are consistent with our long-standing culture of shared sacrifices and down cycles and shared rewards and up cycles. That\'s avoiding layoffs, and in the process protecting manufacturing capability as well as high priority projects, which are important for our customers and us to thrive in the long term. We took similar actions in prior periods of business uncertainty such as the COVID pandemic in 2020 and the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, and we believe such actions were quite effective to navigate our business.Now let\'s get into our guidance for the March quarter. As our customers take further actions to adjust to a weakening macro environment and uncertain business conditions, we are continuing to support customers and channel partners with inventory position to push out or cancel their backlog. We recognize that our short lead times and increased flexibility with backlog will result in customers reducing inventory aggressively, and that this could result in some degree of overcorrection. However, in response to these conditions, we are continuing to work with our customers to absorb as much of the inventory correction as we can at this time.Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the March quarter to be between $1.225 billion and $1.425 billion. The guidance range is larger than normal to reflect the macro uncertainty and the resultant low business visibility. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 59% and 61.6% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 26.9% and 30.7% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 28.3% and 34.7% of sales and we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $0.46 and $0.68.To keep things in perspective, while our business results have degraded significantly over the last 2 quarters, as a larger-than-normal inventory correction has played out. Our full fiscal year \'24 revenue decline at the midpoint of the March quarter guidance is expected to be roughly 9.5%, comparing favorably with weakness that other industry players have experienced. Our non-GAAP operating margin for full fiscal year \'24 at the midpoint of our March quarter guidance is expected to be 43.6% and continuing to be among the best results across other companies in our industry. While we don\'t know how and when the inevitable up cycle will play out, we believe the fundamental characteristics of our business remain intact.Finally, notwithstanding any near-term macro weakness, we are confident that our solutions remain the engine of innovation for the applications and end markets we serve. Our focus on total system solutions and key market megatrends continue to fuel strong design win momentum, which we expect will drive above-market long-term growth.With that, let me pass the baton to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?', 'Stephen Sanghi', 'Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to provide you with a further update on our cash return strategy. The Board of Directors announced an increase in the dividend of 25.7% from the year ago quarter to $0.45 per share. During the last quarter, we purchased $114.6 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $237.4 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return was $352 million. This amount was 77.5% of our actual adjusted free cash flow of $454.3 million during the September 2023 quarter. Our net leverage at the end of December 2023 quarter was 1.27x.Ever since we achieved an investment-grade rating for our debt in November 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned $3.6 billion to shareholders through December 31, 2023 by a combination of dividends and share buybacks. During this time, we have bought back approximately 26 million shares of our common stock from the open market, representing approximately 4.5% of our shares outstanding.In the current March quarter, we will use the adjusted free cash flow from the December quarter to target the amount of cash returned to shareholders. The adjusted free cash flow excludes a net $30.4 million that we collected from our customers for long-term supply assurance payments. These payments are refundable when purchase commitments are fulfilled. The adjusted free cash flow for the December quarter was $763.4 million. We plan to return 82.5% or $629.8 million of that amount to our shareholders with the dividend expected to be approximately $243 million and the stock buyback expected to be approximately $386.8 million, which will be a new quarterly record for stock buyback since we initiated our enhanced capital return strategy.Going forward, we plan to continue to increase our adjusted free cash flow returned to shareholders by 500 basis points every quarter until we reach 100% of adjusted free cash flow returned to shareholders. That will take 4 more quarters and we expect that dividends over time will represent approximately 50% of our cash returned.With that, operator, will you please poll for questions?', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.', 'Timothy Michael Arcuri', ""I wanted to ask about how much of a headwind the inventory inside of distribution still is? Shipments into distribution were down about 30%, well, actually more than that. And yet some of your largest [disty's] are still saying that they're having a hard time working down inventory. So can you provide any guidance like does the March guidance assume that shipments into distribution will be down a lot more than what the corporate guidance is, again, just like it was in December?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', 'We are expecting that we will drain inventory in distribution in the March quarter.', 'Timothy Michael Arcuri', ""Okay. Great. And then, Eric, can you talk about utilization rates and the potential for some write-downs? We sort of haven't been at a level yet where you would write things down, but can you talk about that?"", 'James Eric Bjornholt', ""Sure. So we have been kind of working on an employee attrition basis in our 3 large fabs, and through the December quarter, that did not put us in a situation where we were taking under-utilization charges from those 3 fabs. That will change this quarter as we have continued to attrit. And as Ganesh kind of walked through, we've got 2-week shutdowns scheduled in all 3 of those large factories.So we aren't going to break out a utilization percentage but under-utilization is absolutely impacting our business, our gross margins in the current quarter. And on top of that, with the change that we've seen in demand and inventory still being high. We have been taking relatively large charges for inventory reserves based on our accounting policies that we have in place. And all those things are really factored into the margin guidance that we've given to the Street."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.', 'Toshiya Hari', ""My first question is on cancellation rates and what you're seeing from a customer pushout perspective. Are you seeing any signs of stabilization, Ganesh, in terms of cancellation rates or pretty much the same so far in the quarter relative to December and September of last year?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""We don't have a numerical tracking process. We still have customers that have asked for help. We have done a lot of that and built it into what we have into our guidance. I don't know if you have a better view, Eric, on cancellation rates?"", 'James Eric Bjornholt', ""Right. I would say, as we kind of talked about customers and distributors are feeling like they have excess inventory. And with that, if they have backlog in place for those products, they are either not placing backlog. But if they have backlog in place, they're looking to see if there's an ability for them to at least push that out. So we're having those ongoing discussions. And I'd say that they're still at a relatively high rating."", 'Toshiya Hari', ""Got it. And as my follow-up, I was hoping to get your comments on pricing. The headwinds you're seeing today, is it mostly volume driven or are you starting to see price erode as well between your Microcontroller business and Analog business? It seems like at the industry level, you've got more supply coming online over the next couple of quarters, several quarters. So curious how you're -- what you're seeing today and how you're thinking about pricing as we progress through calendar '24."", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""Yes. All the revenue declines are really volume declines, they're not pricing related. Pricing is stable. It is not contributing to the revenue change that is in our guidance. Our business is one which is based on design-ins that are done 1, 2, 3 years before and production that takes place for many, many years. It's not an easy substitution that takes place on short-term price adjustments, et cetera. Clearly, at the point of where new designs are taking place, we will be price competitive to what the new design requires. But today's revenue adjustments downward are not happening because of price, price is stable."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research.', 'Christopher Caso', ""My question is -- and it's a difficult question about sort of where you think aggregate inventory levels are and how much progress with some of these lower revenue shipment rates that we'll make in getting those inventories down over time. I know that's difficult to answer for your end customers, your indirect customers, but perhaps you could address it from the distribution channel where you have a little more visibility and where the target inventory levels are and where you expect to get over time?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""As you said, inventory in some cases is obscure to us. We have to estimate based on where customers are placing orders, what kind of feedback they're giving us. We know we're going to be substantially under-shipping to where consumption is going to be. But it's very hard to put a number on what that is and how much of the inventory has been taken out. And as I said, in some cases, it is multiple layers of inventory and especially as people are getting to that point where they are less willing to carry inventory, perhaps even take it to the low end of what they might historically do because supply is plentiful.Not all of this is just inventory reduction as you would normally expect. But it is going to be at multiple levels to our customers, to their customers. And in some cases, if they have an OEM, that goes to the OEM there as well. So we don't have a good way to put a number on what you're asking for."", 'Christopher Caso', ""Okay. Fair enough. One of the things you've also said in prior downturns is typically, you've seen 3 down quarters before you achieve a bottom, you're kind of at that now, although September quarter was obviously a much smaller magnitude than now. Given where we are right now, do you think that still holds? And perhaps you could characterize this downturn against some of the prior ones that you've been through?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""Well, there's nothing typical about this downturn. And I don't think that is a good comparison to history. You could say in magnitude, it is on the order of what we have seen in the global financial crisis. I think we were down 36% or so at that point in time. We have very limited visibility in today's market conditions. And so it's difficult to say where exactly this is and as I mentioned, we believe we are significantly under-shipping to end demand, but we're unable to provide any kind of forecast or guidance beyond this quarter."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with SIG.', 'Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland', ""So around cycle times and lead times, we have found that some of your products, particularly through distribution, they have lead times that are even below your cycle times. I'm assuming your cycle times are something like 4 weeks or 6 weeks, something like that.I guess my question is, how long would you expect this dynamic to last? I think this is -- if you do have big inventory corrections like we're going through, you see that phenomenon occasionally, but how long might this last? And when are you expecting lead times to maybe expand again? Obviously, we have some -- an inventory dynamic we're going through here. But maybe talk about that lead times versus cycle times and when you think those might actually rise again?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""Chris, let me just define 2 terms and then we'll walk through it. So cycle time is the time it takes from when you begin with raw material and get to finished goods. That cycle time for semiconductors, depending on which product and what process can be anywhere from 3 to 5 months, sometimes longer, depending on the specialty. So that's the typical production cycle time. We have always been able to manage lead times, which we define as from a -- when a customer places an order on us, when can we ship the product to them, to be a lot shorter than that.And historically pre-pandemic. That was 4 to 8 weeks, was not an unusual number for 80%, 90% of our line items. Where we have come back to is where those lead times are on average where a customer places an order, they can get in less than 8 weeks. And in some cases, if we have it in finished goods, they can get it much sooner than that as well. So I don't have a good view of when do lead times go back out. And I'm not sure that's a good thing. I think we have to, obviously, work to manage the supply and demand consistent with where demand is going.But for years, we ran in that 4 to 8 weeks as a reasonably stable lead time outside of any major increases or decreases in demand in the marketplace. And right now, we think we're going to be at low lead times for quite some time. We have inventory that is high, and we'll be growing into the March quarter. And we're going to position that inventory to be able to take advantage of orders that come in with short cycles because visibility is low, and we need to be able to position and take that as quickly as it comes in. So all of our systems are geared towards having shorter lead times and being able to take orders of the -- that are placed with short lead times, as quickly as we can."", 'James Eric Bjornholt', ""Maybe just one thing. I think, Chris, maybe what you were getting at is when we have product that is staged in die bank, so it's through the wafer fab, that in many cases, we can turn that through assembly and test in the 4 to 6 weeks that you're talking about. And so if that's the case, if it's in die bank, that would be the case. But we've got finished goods today, we're staging the products that are high runners in die banks so our lead times are quite short across the board."", 'Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland', ""There were some good stuff there. Eric, while I have you, gross margin, just for kind of simplicity sake, my model is roughly like 300 basis points below for next quarter where I was previously. I don't know if you can kind of walk us through that, what's mix versus under-utilization versus inventory write-down? It sounds like pricing is not an issue here. like-for-like, but would love to know how those kind of various things contribute."", 'James Eric Bjornholt', ""Yes. So I would say the biggest change quarter-to-quarter is going to be in the factory utilization, and that's a combination of the continued attrition and lower production rates on a steady-state weekly basis, and then we're having these 2 weeks shutdown on top of that. And what we're having time off in some of our back-end factories too, which is larger than the previous quarter. So all those things impacted, I'd say, the inventory reserve piece is a part of it, but we had relatively significant charges last quarter on that, and I wouldn't expect those to be significantly more this quarter. They'll probably be larger, but the biggest piece is going to be what we're doing on utilization."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo.', 'Gary Wade Mobley', ""Looking at the March quarter guidance, that's basically a peak to trough in revenue terms of more than 40%, all within the same fiscal year. And so clearly, the rate of the decay has been extreme -- and I'm calling on your experience here, given that you've all been through a lot of cycles in the past and you hinted to in your prepared remarks, maybe some overcorrection on your customer's part in terms of inventory depletion. So calling on your experience, how would you say the slope of the recovery may look given your lead times? Is it a gradual one? Or are we going to see just sharper rebound as we saw in terms of this correction?"", 'James Eric Bjornholt', ""So I'll start and Ganesh or Steve can add to this. I think it is unknown at this point in time, right? We have limited backlog visibility as we look out in time, which you're asking about beyond this quarter, lead times are really short and customers are sitting on a certain level of inventory beyond what they think is necessary for their business today. So until we start getting short-term orders kind of at our lead times and we see that backlog start to build. It's hard for us to really imagine what it's going to do.As Ganesh said before, clearly in this quarter with our revenue guidance, we are shipping below what the end consumption for our products are, and we think that's relatively material. But giving you any guidance in terms of what the slope of the recovery is, I think, it's hard for us to do at this point."", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""I think the recovery has many components to it, right? One is just if you assume business is flat and as the inventory drains, people will, at some point, just have to order enough to get back to flat consumption. Then there is also what does the macro do and what happens in actual consumption over time. And that depends on many things, where is GDP at, what our interest rate is doing, et cetera. And I think those are all variables which you can't, at least we're not able to plug in and say, this is out the next 3, 4 quarters, the shape of the recovery will look. And we don't have the visibility and backlog to give us any insight into that today."", 'Gary Wade Mobley', ""I know I was asking us for a lot there, but I appreciate the color. So it sounds like your OpEx management is more so variable versus structural. And you've obviously done this in the past. In this recent round when you've asked employees to take a 10% pay reduction, what was communicated to them in terms of when that might be recouped based on some sort of revenue or performance metrics?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""I have not been able to speak to the entire Microchip community until I do that on Monday morning. I did write them all a message today after the market closed and before this call to let them know what we were doing. So those are details that I would prefer to first speak to our employees and give them all of that. But this is not new to us. We have done this multiple times. Our culture allows people to understand how shared sacrifice and shared rewards go hand in hand and how that creates excellent outcomes for the company and for the individuals in the process of doing that. And so I'm confident that our team, especially the team that has been through many cycles with us, will see it, will help us with it and pull everybody else along as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.', 'Vivek Arya', ""Ganesh, I appreciate you're not going beyond the quarter, but I still wanted to get some help in getting some directional sense of whether June could be flat, up or down because you do have some shutdowns in June, right? You are already planning for that. So that's not a great data point. But then June tends to also be seasonally up for you historically. So just give us some more color, what is true demand right now? And if you were sitting in our shoes, would you think about June being kind of up, down, flat, even if you don't have an absolute sense of where June might check out?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""I think the shutdowns that we communicated based on the days of inventory that we closed December and what we have indicated are going to be at the end of March are required steps we need to take. Those are not necessarily trying to provide an indication of where the June business is going to be at. In fact, the real answer is I don't know. And I think the world is not falling apart. So we know that consumption is taking place. We know that inventory needs to drain.We're trying to gauge between the environment in the market, the inventory at multiple levels and how all that will drain. We know this business will come back, right? It has -- in every previous cycle, done that. But I think what you're asking for is a level of precision, which we don't have any empirical data to be able to say, yes, this is what's going to happen and when."", 'Vivek Arya', ""And then my bigger question, Ganesh, is that how would you contrast your strategy of maintaining kind of a hybrid manufacturing model, right, where lead times can suddenly get extended, but your CapEx is low, your profitability is high? To say your other U.S. competitor who has high CapEx, they can usually keep lead times very low, and they have managed to avoid, right, these kind of very, very large swings. How would you kind of contrast the 2 strategies? And do you think what you're going through could make you change your strategy about maybe having higher CapEx in the future and always trying to maintain lower lead times?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""Again, there are many people that fit into what you described. I'll describe our strategy, which is we run inside of Microchip, the products that we know how to run cost effectively and consistently within our manufacturing footprint. That includes both our front-end as well as our back-end. We have grown that front-end footprint over time, but also our foundry products have grown over time. And that balance has been roughly 40% plus or minus internal, 60% external. We don't try to guide where that percentage needs to go. The market demand drives is it higher or lower from there.But we know what products and technologies make sense within our footprint and what makes sense to drive with our partners. And that's the way we think about it. And in the aggregate, barring any near-term changes like we've had last quarter and this quarter, it's been a very successful strategy in terms of how gross margins over time have accreted and how over many cycles, we've got higher highs and higher lows. So we're very happy with the strategy we have, and I leave others with their strategy to speak for themselves."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel.', 'Tore Egil Svanberg', ""So my first question is on the PSP program. It was obviously put in place to try and avoid volatility and doesn't look like that happened. Maybe it was just the nature of the pandemic cycle, I don't know. But why do you think the PSP program did not sort of buffer the volatility that we're actually seeing?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""It's a great question. Although the PSP program was aimed at discouraging speculative demand by making orders NCNR and then giving us confidence to make investments on it. I think there was a combination of very strong OEM market demand, our customers and their customers and what they were seeing. They were persistent shortages over a long period of time and very long lead times. And I think when you put all that together, OEM customers ended up placing more backlog because they believe their business was a lot stronger than they thought, and they were trying to place orders for a lot longer than they normally would in that.So that's the way it, in our perspective, played out. How it did phenomenally for them in the 2021, 2022 timeframe where those that were in the program, we were able to keep their business going, take market share away and driving. But at the end of the day, the longer lead times get the further out someone is trying to predict where their business is going to be. And I think that's the issue at some point in time is you don't know what your demand is with any kind of high confidence, 1 year or 18 months out, yet people were placing those orders as noncancelable, thinking that the demand was strong and assuming that the risk was a good risk for them to take."", 'Tore Egil Svanberg', ""No, that's very fair. And then as my follow-up, I recognize that all end markets are going to be weak in the March quarter. But any sort of relative comment on the end markets? Anything holding up a little bit relatively better than others?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""Yes. I would say if you look at our aerospace and defense market, there are strengths in those. The commercial aviation remains strong. The defense remains strong. Space has always been very lumpy in where it's at. Our portion of the data center, which is around AI platforms, those are doing extremely well. It's not big enough to move the Microchip needle overall, but it's certainly a pocket of strength that we see as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi.', 'Christopher Brett Danely', ""I guess just a little clarification on the decline here. Any comments on just your sense of end demand, maybe talk about the end markets that have been the worst? And then also, given your revenue decline is notably more than some of your peers, why do you think it's hitting you more than some of the competition?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', 'Sorry, what was the last part of your question? Why do you think what?', 'Christopher Brett Danely', 'Why is your revenue declining much more than some of your competitors?', 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""Okay. So on your second question, as I said, if you look at it over a year's period of time, you're going to find that the fiscal '24 at the midpoint of our guidance is about 9.5% down from fiscal '23. I don't think that's outside of where the normal is at. Within a 2-quarter period of time, absolutely. We are correcting and correcting at a faster rate than where we were at. But I think we have to look at area under the curve for revenue rather than just peak to trough alone in terms of what you're going to look at.In terms of end markets, we -- sorry, was there a question?"", 'Christopher Brett Danely', 'No, I said thanks.', 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""Okay. In terms of end markets, as I mentioned, it's weak across the board. We don't track at a quarterly level kind of how they're all moving. But we have enough anecdotal data. I think we were among the earliest people as early as 2 or 3 quarters ago saying automotive is starting to weaken and roll over and -- industrial did and data center had been. So we have seen this for some time. And at this point in time, I would say that they're all week. There might be individual customers who are stronger or weaker than what -- on average that we see, but nothing to write home about, other than the 2 exceptions I spoke about, which is Aerospace and Defense is still holding up. And our portion of the AI servers that we provide solutions to."", 'Christopher Brett Danely', 'And then just a quick clarification on the utilization rates. Do you guys anticipate utilization rates declining again in the June quarter from March? Or will they stay flattish from March to June?', 'James Eric Bjornholt', ""We don't know yet. We will have to see how kind of the business evolves over the coming months."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.', 'Vijay Raghavan Rakesh', ""I had a quick question. And I was wondering between the CapEx and the funding that Microchip was getting, how much capacity you would be adding on the front-end or the back-end as you look at calendar '24, I guess?"", 'James Eric Bjornholt', ""So our capital expenditures for fiscal '24, we laid out for you, and that's $300 million to $310 million. We have not given a number for next fiscal year. I expect it to be lower than that. We've actually taken in quite a bit of equipment this year that we have not essentially released and placed in service for production purposes. So we've got capital that's paid for and at our facilities that we can deploy as the market returns to a more normalized level, and we need that capacity, but I expect CapEx to be quite low in our fiscal year 2025."", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""Vijay, here's how I would think about it from a -- how are we positioned for growth from our capacity. Our initial response as this thing changes is going to be utilizing the inventory that we have built and being able to ship using the inventory we have. Our next response will be around getting our factories to more full utilization. We are under-utilizing them at this point in time.Our third response would be taking equipment that we have already ordered and received which we will begin to place into production. And then finally, into adding more equipment or bottleneck equipment as the case might be. So we believe we have plenty of firepower for being able to respond to an upcycle through a combination of those 4 things."", 'Vijay Raghavan Rakesh', 'Got it. And if you were to combine all of that, you mentioned your channel [disty] inventory was at 37 days versus an optimal high 20s, I guess that you mentioned before. And your in-house inventory, DOI probably goes up a little bit as you go into March. Any thoughts on when you actually see that starting to realign or start to stabilize or start to come down? Is that more of a second half? When do you actually see that happening, I guess?', 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""If I had a better picture on the demand environment, I could give you a better answer. So what we're doing is we're taking action on the things we can control, which is our internal capacity, and those are the shutdown days, the lowering of the utilization factors and all that other stuff that we're doing. And that is all in anticipation that at some point, the market will return, and it will reverse cycle at that point in time, first, by us producing less, which we're taking steps for; and second, by the market consuming more, which is what is unknown."", 'Vijay Raghavan Rakesh', 'Got it. And last question on the margin trajectory for March quarter. Did you say that all of it was because of utilization and -- should we expect that under-utilization to continue into June? Or how do you see that? Or do you expect utilization to pick back up again?', 'James Eric Bjornholt', ""So we didn't say it was all of it. There's a large portion of the change that is utilization driven. There's always product mix and inventory reserves and other things that impact that. I think it will be probably difficult for capacity utilization to increase in the June quarter just because we are running on an attrition basis, and that is continuing each week as some people leave, and then it just takes a while to ramp that back up even if the market dynamics are better. And so that's something that we'll watch very closely and make sure that we're making the appropriate investments in people, but it tends to be like moving a battleship down the ocean, it turns relatively slow."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.', 'Joseph Lawrence Moore', ""Great. I guess I wonder if you could address a couple of the bear cases that I hear. One, you've sort of talked about PSP and what it accomplished and what it didn't. Do you think that having more flexibility about customer cancellations when they started to slow down, would that have sort of made the issue less bad now? Is the PSP part of the reason why the hole is a little bit deeper, maybe?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""Perhaps. And I think, again, in retrospect, as a Monday morning quarterback, I know exactly what I would have done. But we were under for many, many, many quarters and even as recently as last March and June quarters, right, there were CEO-level calls that we're pushing and driving for getting more product than we had. If you remember, we would provide the statistic about how much of unsupported, which is what customers wanted and we couldn't ship was there.So in the throes of all of that, where there parts of it where perhaps we should have taken our foot off the accelerator perhaps. But it isn't something that was knowable as we went through it. And if we ever were to do a PSP program again, those are some lessons learned we'll take, and we'll look at how would we adjust the program so that the intended outcomes are available and as many of the unintended outcomes are avoided."", 'Joseph Lawrence Moore', ""Great. And then the other kind of negative question that I get, China obviously building significant amount of trailing edge capacity. Can you talk about what types -- I don't think you see a lot of direct competition from sovereign China today, but can you talk about how much of your business might see competition from that direction over the next few years? I think you've talked about that being single digits, but maybe if you could just update us on your thinking there."", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""Sure. So Mainland China today is about 20-ish percent of our revenue. About half of it, we estimate is designed elsewhere and just happens to be manufactured in Mainland China. And some of that is, frankly, moving out of China as people diversify other things. So it doesn't -- the point of design is outside of China, and we're comfortable with that. So the other 10% of our business that's in China that is designed in China has another half of that, which is very complex designs, and these are not the ones that are easy to dislodge and would have a significant amount of knowledge about systems, the software that goes with it, the hardware and software interaction and all that.So that means about 5% of our business, about 1/4 of the business in Mainland China that is our more broad-based Microcontrollers and Analog and those type of products. And there, fragmentation is our friend. It is a very, very fragmented market. Any one opportunity is a small percentage of revenue, and it is not easy to go to place. But theoretically, you could say if somebody had an identical offering. And by the way, a lot of that business is not just about having silicon. It's about having silicon, having tools, having design guides, having software that we make available. There's a lot of help and self-help that we provide for our customers as well that is there.So yes, there is more going on in China with trailing edge, both technologies and capacity. And we will pay attention, and we will, through our product line and innovation, cost reduction be continuing to work to go head-to-head against that. But it's the portion of the business that you might think about is more broad-based where they would come after that business is less than 5% and is very, very fragmented and difficult to get at. Does that help?"", 'Joseph Lawrence Moore', 'Yes, so much.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen.', 'Joshua Louis Buchalter', ""I wanted to ask about utilization rates and sort of the strategic decisions you're making to shut down the fabs for 2 weeks in March and June and also keep utilization rates lower over those 2 quarters. I guess, why start and stop the fabs but also why not just take the utilization rates much lower in the March quarter then see where things play out and given you're trying to get inventory down, but expectations are that it will still go up in March?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""It's a balanced decision that we had to think through and make. But as inventories climbed, there is a point at which the pain gets high enough. And as we looked at that, we felt on balance and we don't know what other supply-demand dynamics may take place. But on balance, this is a way in which we could navigate to different scenarios that might play themselves out.And in the meanwhile, the inventory is high enough that we're comfortable that if the recovery would accelerate, we're in a good place. And we are -- if the recovery were something different, that were ahead of us and we have options on what we can do in the June quarter. But right now, we need to prepare for where March and June to the best of our ability to call it is going to be, and that includes the running at a lower utilization and taking a 2-week shutdown in the -- in our fabs in each of the 2 quarters."", 'Joshua Louis Buchalter', ""And then as my follow-up, and I know you have a formulaic approach to your capital return program, but you've also in the past talked about opportunistically potentially going above the rates that you've outlined, as we go through this period where you're going through the digestion and free cash flow is depressed versus where it was the last few quarters, any thought to using the balance sheet or returning more than you would have been returned under the formula that you've outlined?"", 'James Eric Bjornholt', ""So maybe I'll start. So I mean, we actually have a very healthy cash return this quarter, right? We increased from 77.5% to 82.5%. The adjusted free cash flow in the December quarter was quite high. And even though the dividend is going up again, we are going to have kind of record share buyback in the quarter based on that formula that you spoke to. So we think it's appropriate. We're glad that we're going to be buying back a bunch of shares this quarter. Stephen can ask and give commentary if the Board would think of doing anything different, but I think that program is kind of in place as it is. And if the market changed and the stock price decline significantly, it would be a discussion with the Board."", 'Stephen Sanghi', ""I think it just came out naturally that our cash flow was extremely healthy last quarter. And with returning 82.5% back to shareholders with dividend increasing, it still creates a record stock buyback in a quarter, record that we have ever done before, $386.8 million. So it's a very, very healthy buyback. If there was not to be the case, where the cash flow wasn't as healthy as last quarter, then the question would be valid, should we do an extraordinary stock buyback this quarter, if the stock were to become weak. But I think we just formulate -- by formula is a very, very healthy amount of cash reserved for stock buyback this quarter."", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""For the last many quarters, we've been steady as she goes. I think having a program that doesn't try to have quarter-to-quarter major variations has been a way in which to establish consistency of the capital return program. And I think Steve and myself and the rest of the Board see that as a way that we should continue with this thing."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham.', 'Nathaniel Quinn Bolton', ""I guess first one is for Eric. You talked about the lower utilization, you're shutting down factories for 2 weeks in both March and June. I'm just kind of wondering if you could walk us through the accounting. How much of that hits you in the current period? How much of those lower utilization charges flow-through inventory? And given how much inventory you have could be something that hits gross margin for a longer period of time as that flows through inventory and then the income statement? Then I've got a quick follow-up."", 'James Eric Bjornholt', ""Yes. So our 3 large wafer fabs will even without the shutdowns, with the attrition that we've had, be running below what we would call normal utilization. And so these 2-week shutdowns will be period costs in the quarter and not capitalized to inventory. Now we are running at lower utilization rates than we were at the peak. So the costs that are being capitalized to inventory on a per unit basis are higher than what they were when we were running at full board. But I think that answers your question. Essentially, the 2-week shutdowns will be an impact to the current period and not capitalized into inventory."", 'Nathaniel Quinn Bolton', ""That's very, very clear. And then I guess just for Ganesh, you mentioned you're ending the PSP program. And so I'm curious, does that just mean you're not signing anyone to new PSP? Does that mean that existing PSPs have now been canceled and folks have greater rights to cancel the existing backlog? Just what happens with the current PSP participants?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""The backlog has been shrinking for some time. And really, what we're telling customers is that no more orders get accepted that are PSP orders -- and customers have seen that lead times are short, capacity is available. As I said, the premise of why we kicked it off no longer exists. And therefore, it will come to a natural end here fairly quickly, and we just stopped taking more orders that anyone may -- if they didn't already understand, replacing as PSP."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of William Stein with Truist.', 'William Stein', 'Great. I was also going to ask about PSP and the mechanics of how it rolls out of backlog. But I think you just answered that but I do have a sort of financial question around it. I believe for many of these orders, you were getting prepaid by customers and you might have been likewise prepaying for capacity at foundry. Can you walk through how those roll off of the financial activity of the company and when you expect them to be sort of in the rearview mirror? Is that done -- think by the end of the March quarter?', 'James Eric Bjornholt', ""Okay. So with PSP, those were not typically customer paying cash in advance for any of that. We have certain long-term supply agreements and those had a cash prepayment element to them. Those are still in place. Those aren't -- there's nothing that's happening with those programs related to the cancellation of PSP. So those programs are still in place, and those tend to be 3- to 5-year agreements, most of them 5-year agreements, and those will just kind of run out over time.In some cases where customers' demand is not as strong as originally anticipated. We work with them to find a mutually workable answer on that, maybe to extend the program longer, they can add something else into the program for their volume commitments. But we're not looking to penalize customers with that program.And then on the supplier side, we have had certain prepayments that are made and contractual obligations that we have. That's the same thing there. It's a negotiation with our suppliers, and they're working with us, and I don't see that there's any significant financial disadvantage to us coming from those. But in some cases, we have taken on more inventory, maybe raw materials than what we would have otherwise."", 'Operator', 'And our next question will come from the line of Janet Ramkissoon with Quadra Capital.', 'Janet Ramkissoon', ""Can you guys give us a sense of what's going on with design activity? I know you've seen this real cutback and you're saying that there is really not much of a shortfall in terms of actual demand. Do you have any visibility, less visibility, the same as before? Could you give us some sense on what's going on to give us a better sense of the long-term outlook beyond the June quarter?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', 'Yes. No, thank you. So design activity, as I said in my prepared remarks, is at very high levels. And I think it is because for a number of reasons, customers were in triage for some time as they were dealing with shortages. And as all that went behind, they went back to focusing on innovation. Our products and technologies are enabling innovation in many new fields. And so by many measures, both what we measure internally in terms of design wins and design funnel and all that and what some of our partners who are more design-in focused particularly, the catalog distributors are a good example where much of the seeding activity that takes place are also seeing very high levels of that.So I think the innovation machine is strong. And the inventory correction will pass and go and ultimately, the long-term growth of the business, as you noted, will come from how this innovation plays out and how the overall role and content that semiconductors will play in that innovation being delivered on end products.', 'Janet Ramkissoon', ""That's very helpful. And just one last one, if I could sneak it in. Is there any particular geography or a particular segment that you saw sort of a faster rate of decline. I noticed that industrial as a percent of total was down just from the supplemental slides. Is there any color that you could give us in terms of geography or end markets where you saw most of the weakness?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""I think they're all weak. I don't have a numerical way to give you. I can tell you that China, for example, has been weak for an extended period of time. So back -- going back all the way to 2022 when they had the shutdowns, and it really hasn't recovered from there. But I think we've seen weakness in all geographies and pretty much all end markets with the exception of the Aerospace and Defense and a bit of the data center that was all AI focused."", 'James Eric Bjornholt', ""And I believe the end market data that was posted on our website still references last full fiscal year, and that hasn't been updated. That's a process that we do once a year. So we'll take a look at the slide to make sure it's not confusing, but that's what I believe to be the case."", 'Janet Ramkissoon', 'Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.', 'Operator', 'There are no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the floor back over to Ganesh Moorthy for closing comments.', 'Ganesh Moorthy', 'Okay. I want to thank everyone for taking the time to be on this call and all of your questions. We look forward to having further discussions during some of the conferences coming up this year. And on that note, we are closing this call.', 'Operator', ""This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.""]"

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, CFO, Mr. Eric Bjornholt. Thank you. You may begin."", 'Eric Bjornholt: Thank you operator. Good afternoon everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC, that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip’s business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip’s President and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip’s Executive Chair; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip’s Head of Investor Relations.', ""I will comment on our third quarter fiscal year 2024 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment, as well as our guidance. And Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release and on this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations' page of our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information in our earnings press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website."", 'I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation, and certain other adjustments as described in our earnings press release and in the reconciliations on our website. Net sales in the December quarter were $1.766 billion, which was down 21.7% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 63.8%, operating expenses were 22.5%, and operating income was 41.2%. Non-GAAP net income was $592.7 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.08.', 'On a GAAP basis, in the December quarter, gross margins were 63.4%. Total operating expenses were $590.6 million and included acquisition and tangible amortization of $151.3 million, special charges of $1.1 million, share-based compensation of $38.8 million, and $1.5 million of other expenses. GAAP net income was $419.2 million, resulting in $0.77 in earnings per diluted share. The GAAP tax rate was favorably impacted from an IRS notice that clarified the treatment of costs incurred by a research provider under contract that we had been accruing for and that accrual was released in the quarter. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 13.2% in the December quarter. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal year 2024 is expected to be just under 14% and which is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years.', ""Our fiscal 2024 cash tax rate is higher than our fiscal 2023 tax rate was for a variety of factors, including lower availability of tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits, lower tax depreciation with our expectation for lower capital expenditures in the U.S. in fiscal 2024, as well as the impact of current tax rules requiring the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes. We are still hopeful that the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&D expenses will be pushed out or repealed. The House actually passed the tax bill last night that would achieve this, and we will see how this progresses through the Senate. If this were to happen, we would anticipate about a 200 basis points favorable adjustment to Microchip's non-GAAP tax rate in future periods."", ""Our inventory balance at December 31, 2023, was $1.31 billion. We had 185 days of inventory at the end of the December quarter, which was up 18 days from the prior quarter's level. Although, we reduced inventory dollars in the quarter, we were not able to make as much progress as we would have liked, as we continue to accommodate requests by customers to push out delivery schedules for products that were very far through the manufacturing process. At the midpoint of our March 2024 quarter guidance, we would expect inventory dollars to be up modestly and days of inventory to be in the range of 225 to 230 days due to the significant reduction in revenue and cost of goods sold. We also continue to invest in building inventory for long-lived, high-margin products whose manufacturing capacity is being end of life by our supply chain partners and these last time buys represented 10 days of inventory at the end of December."", ""Inventory at our distributors in the December quarter were 37 days, which was up two days from the prior quarter's level. Our cash flow from operating activities was $853.3 million in the December quarter. Included in our cash flow from operating activities was $30.4 million of long-term supply assurance receipts from customers. We have adjusted these items out of our free cash flow to determine the adjusted free cash flow that we will return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, as these supply assurance payments will be refundable over time as purchase commitments are fulfilled. Our adjusted free cash flow was $763.4 million in the December quarter. As of December 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $281 million."", 'Our total debt decreased by $392 million in the December quarter, our net debt decreased by $416.4 million in the quarter. Over the last 22 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt to do so, we have paid down $7.1 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our excess cash beyond dividends and stock buyback to bring down this debt. Our adjusted EBITDA in the December quarter was $796.2 million and 45.1% of net sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was $4.26 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.27 times at December 31, 2023, down from 1.56 times at December 31, 2022. Capital expenditures were $59.5 million in the December quarter. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2024 is between $300 million and $310 million, which is down from the $300 million to $325 million we shared with investors last quarter as we are delaying certain capital given the more challenging economic backdrop.', 'We expect that our capital investments will continue to provide us increased control over our production during periods of industry-wide constraints. Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $47.1 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter as well as our guidance for the March quarter. Ganesh?', 'Ganesh Moorthy: Thank you, Eric and good afternoon everyone. Our December quarter results were disappointing and below our expectations with net sales down 21.7% sequentially and down 18.6% from the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP gross and operating margins came in at 63.8% and 41.2%, respectively, down from our recent strong performance, but somewhat resilient despite the significant sequential decline in revenue. Our consolidated non-GAAP diluted EPS came in at $1.08 per share, down 30.8% from the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was 45.1% of net sales in the December quarter, continuing to demonstrate some resiliency. As a result, we had good debt reduction in the December quarter and despite the lower adjusted EBITDA we generated, our net leverage ticked down to 1.27x.', 'However, we expect our net leverage ratio to rise for a few quarters, as trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA drops when replacing stronger prior year quarters with weaker ones. Our capital return to shareholders in the March quarter will increase to 82.5% of our December quarter adjusted free cash flow as we continue on our path to return 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders by the March quarter of calendar year 2025. My thanks to our worldwide team for their support, hard work, and diligence as we navigated a difficult environment and focus on what we could control so that we are well-positioned to thrive in the long-term. Taking a look at our December quarter net sales from a product line perspective, our mixed-signal microcontroller net sales were down 22.3% sequentially and down 18.5% on a year-over-year basis.', ""And our analog net sales were down 30.9% sequentially and down 29% on a year-over-year basis. Now, for some color on the December quarter. and the general business environment. All regions of the world and most of our end markets were weak. Our business was weaker than we expected as our customers continue to respond to the effects of increasing business uncertainty, slowing economic activity and a resultant increase in their inventory. In addition, many customers implemented extended shutdowns of closures at the end of the December quarter as they manage their operational activities. We continue to receive requests to push out or cancel backlog as customers sought to rebalance their inventory in light of the weaker business conditions and the increased uncertainty that we're experiencing."", ""And we were able to push out or cancel backlog to help many customers with these inventory positions. With no major supply constraints, coupled with very short lead-times and a weak macro environment, we believe that is inventory destocking underway at multiple levels at our direct customers and distributors who buy from us, our indirect customers who buy through our distributors, and in some cases, our customers' customers. The very strong up cycle of the last two to three years drove many of our customers to build inventory in order to be able to capitalize on strong business conditions in an uncertain supply environment. The term, just in case, instead of just in time, was used by customers to express their approach to these conditions. But as the macro environment slowed, many of our customers found their business expectations to be too optimistic and ended up with high levels of inventory."", 'And as a result, they sought to cancel or reschedule backlog. An update on our PSP program. During the early stages of the up cycle, we launched our PSP program requiring noncancelable backlog in exchange for supply priority in a hyper constrained supply environment. The program was aimed to discourage speculative demand and achieve mutual commitments between our customers and us for future demand. The program worked extremely well for many customers who participated during all of 2021 and 2022, as well as the early part of 2023, supporting strong growth in their businesses. However, the business challenges, which led to the creation of the PSP program are no longer relevant, and we have, therefore, decided to discontinue the program effective today.', 'If business conditions warranted, we may at some point in the future, initiate a similar program, which will, of course, have to be adapted to whatever that situation requires. Reflecting the slowing macro environment, our distribution inventory grew to 37 days at the end of the December quarter, as compared to 35 days at the end of the September quarter. We are working with our distribution partners to find the right balance of inventory required to serve their customers, manage their cash flow requirements and be positioned for the eventual strengthening of business conditions. Our internal capacity expansion actions remain paused. Given the severity of the down cycle, our factories around the world will be running at lower utilization rates and also taking up to two shutdown weeks in each of the March and June quarters in order to help control the growth of inventory.', ""We expect our capital investments in fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2025 will be low even as we prepare for the long-term growth of our business. To that end, we reached a preliminary memorandum of terms with the Department of Commerce for $162 million in grants targeted at existing projects for two of our U.S. fabs. These grants are subject to diligence by the Chip's office as well as capacity investments by Microchip over multiple years. We have been driving our lead times down and have reduced average lead times from roughly 52 weeks at the start of 2023 to roughly eight weeks by the end of 2023 on average. During a period of macro weakness and business uncertainty, we believe short lead times are the best way to help customers navigate the environment successfully and improve the quality of backlog placed with us as it enables our customers and Microchip to engage an uncertain environment with more agility and effectiveness."", ""However, a significant reduction in lead times is also resulting in lower bookings and reduced near-term visibility for our business. We're also taking steps to reduce our expenses. In addition to the variable compensation programs, which provide automatic reductions during a down cycle and normal containment of discretionary expenses, we will be implementing broad-based paid reductions. Our team members who are not a part of the factory shutdowns will take a 10% pay cut and consistent with our normal practice, the executive team will take the largest reduction with a 20% pay cut. The shutdowns for manufacturing team members and pay cuts for non-manufacturing team members are consistent with our long-standing culture of shared sacrifices and down cycles and shared rewards and up cycles."", ""That's avoiding layoffs, and in the process protecting manufacturing capability, as well as high priority projects, which are important for our customers and us to thrive in the long-term. We took similar actions in prior periods of business uncertainty such as the COVID pandemic in 2020 and the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, and we believe such actions were quite effective to navigate our business. Now, let's get into our guidance for the March quarter. As our customers take further actions to adjust to a weakening macro environment and uncertain business conditions, we are continuing to support customers and channel partners with inventory position to push out or cancel their backlog. We recognize that our short lead times and increased flexibility with backlog will result in customers reducing inventory aggressively, and that this could result in some degree of overcorrection."", 'However, in response to these conditions, we are continuing to work with our customers to absorb as much of the inventory correction as we can at this time. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the March quarter to be between $1.225 billion and $1.425 billion. The guidance range is larger than normal to reflect the macro uncertainty and the resultant low business visibility. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 59% and 61.6% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 26.9% and 30.7% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 28.3% and 34.7% of sales and we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $0.46 and $0.68.', ""To keep things in perspective, while our business results have degraded significantly over the last two quarters, as a larger-than-normal inventory correction has played out. Our full fiscal year 2024 revenue decline at the midpoint of the March quarter guidance is expected to be roughly 9.5% and comparing favorably with weakness that other industry players have experienced. Our non-GAAP operating margin for full fiscal year 2024 at the midpoint of our March quarter guidance is expected to be 43.6% and continuing to be among the best results across other companies in our industry. While we don't know how and when the inevitable up cycle will play out, we believe the fundamental characteristics of our business remain intact. Finally, notwithstanding any near-term macro weakness, we are confident that our solutions remain the engine of innovation for the applications and end markets we serve."", 'Our focus on total system solutions and key market megatrends continue to fuel strong design win momentum, which we expect will drive above-market long-term growth. With that, let me pass the baton to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?', 'Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh and good afternoon everyone. I would like to provide you with a further update on our cash return strategy. The Board of Directors announced an increase in the dividend of 25.7% from the year ago quarter to $0.45 per share. During the last quarter, we purchased $114.6 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out $237.4 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return was $352 million. This amount was 77.5% of our actual adjusted free cash flow of $454.3 million during the September 2023 quarter. Our net leverage at the end of December 2023 quarter was 1.27 times. Ever since we achieved an investment-grade rating for our debt in November 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned $3.6 billion to shareholders through December 31, 2023 by a combination of dividends and share buybacks.', 'During this time, we have bought back approximately 26 million shares of our common stock from the open market, representing approximately 4.5% of our shares outstanding. In the current March quarter, we will use the adjusted free cash flow from the December quarter to target the amount of cash returned to shareholders. The adjusted free cash flow excludes a net $30.4 million that we collected from our customers for long-term supply assurance payments. These payments are refundable when purchase commitments are fulfilled. The adjusted free cash flow for the December quarter was $763.4 million. We plan to return 82.5% or $629.8 million of that amount to our shareholders with the dividend expected to be approximately $243 million and the stock buyback expected to be approximately $386.8 million, which will be a new quarterly record for stock buyback since we initiated our enhanced capital return strategy.', 'Going forward, we plan to continue to increase our adjusted free cash flow returned to shareholders by 500 basis points every quarter until we reach 100% of adjusted free cash flow returned to shareholders. That will take four more quarters and we expect that dividends over time will represent approximately 50% of our cash returned.

(NYSE:MET) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript February 1, 2024', 'MetLife, Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', ""Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note about forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release and to risk factors discussed in MetLife's SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Global Head of Investor Relations."", ""John Hall: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for MetLife's fourth quarter 2023 earnings and near-term outlook call. Before we begin, I'd point you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. On the call this morning are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in the discussion are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides, which addressed the quarter as well as our near-term outlook. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks."", 'An appendix to the slides features outlook sensitivities, disclosures, GAAP reconciliations and other information, which you should similarly review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session, which will end promptly at the top of the hour. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, over to Michel.', ""Michel Khalaf: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As we begin 2023, I shared our conviction that despite the uncertain times, MetLife would exit the year stronger than we entered it. We accomplished this by countering the challenging environment with the actions we've taken to focus, simplify, and differentiate our business. We maintained an accelerated momentum in MetLife's diversified set of market-leading businesses, driving strong results for the year and the quarter. And we illustrated our financial strength and flexibility with sound transactions and well-timed capital management, ending the year with solid capital ratios and robust cash on hand. Clearly, our all-weather strategy stood up again in 2023. We remain steadfastly focused on what matters most in delivering for our customers and shareholders."", 'In 2023, we exited a pandemic and have yet to enter a widely expected U.S. recession. We managed through a bank liquidity crisis and the resulting credit concerns. And we adapted to an inverted yield curve that has persisted longer than any in history. Against this backdrop, the fundamentals of our businesses are as strong as I have ever seen. Our successful 2023 is a testament to the resilience and durability of our business model, a relentless focus on execution, concentrating on the factors we control, our risk management culture and processes, the discipline we apply to managing our assets and liabilities, and the prudence of our investment portfolio. On that last point, the strength and stability of our commercial real estate portfolio, which we detailed a year ago, has borne out, as we said, a modest increase in LTVs and stable debt service coverage ratios, and we expect that to remain true in 2024.', ""For the year, we delivered an adjusted return on equity, excluding notable items, of 13.8%, achieving our target for this all-important metric. We were unwavering in our expense discipline, employing efficiency and agility to post a full year direct expense ratio of 12.2%. We upheld our commitment to responsible growth, directing capital to its highest and best use, with high teen IRRs and mid single-digit payback periods on new business. We returned $4.7 billion to shareholders via common stock dividends and share repurchases, and we continued to generate strong, recurring free cash flow and remain financially flexible with significant liquidity at our holding companies. The resilience of our strategy and the clarity of our purpose remain powerful drivers of MetLife's success."", ""Our diversified portfolio of market-leading businesses is well positioned to perform for years to come. Backed by a strong balance sheet and our demonstrated ability to generate cash flow, I am confident in MetLife's ability to create value for shareholders and other stakeholders, and to deliver financial security to our customers as we have for over a century and a half. Now turning to our fourth quarter 2023 results, last night we reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.83 per share. Excluding notable items, we reported $1.93 per share, up 21% compared to $1.59 per share a year ago. Again, this quarter, our businesses showed strong underlying momentum with excellent underwriting results. Also, our recurring investment income grew on higher balances and higher new money rates."", 'Shifting to the full year 2023, the differentiation and scale across our market-leading businesses were among the factors that helped to fuel our underlying business fundamentals. We generated adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, of $5.6 billion. On the strength of new money yields, our adjusted net investment income grew 9% year-over-year to almost $20 billion, despite variable investment income falling below expectations. Adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers climbed 6%, with healthy growth across most business segments. Group Benefits posted adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, of $1.6 billion, up 22% from the prior year. The scale and breadth of this franchise business continues to drive organic growth and represents a clear point of competitive advantage.', 'Sales gained 9%, while adjusted PFOs, excluding the impact of participating policies, rose roughly at 5%. We believe group PFO growth is sustainable at more than $1 billion per year. Higher interest rates serve as a tailwind to our leading Retirement and Income Solutions business, with new money yields exceeding roll-off rates for the past seven consecutive quarters. Volume growth in RIS away from PRT was very strong, with more than $5 billion of longevity, reinsurance sales and more than $3 billion of structured settlements. Pension risk transfers totaled $5.3 billion for the year, the third largest annual total in MetLife’s history. This followed an all-time record year in 2022, and we have a strong pipeline of new opportunities in 2024 and beyond.', ""Sales growth in Asia remained strong, propelled by market demand in Japan for FX denominated life insurance products and a new cash value life product in Korea. Finally, Latin America continues to be a growing and important region for MetLife. Adjusted earnings on a reported basis in 2023 grew 15% over the prior year, and we've expanded our distribution capabilities as well as our product portfolio. One of the ways we hold ourselves accountable is against the Next Horizon commitments we made in 2019. On that basis, we are ahead of schedule to meet all criteria. In fact, we have even moved the goalpost on ourselves and raised the bar on certain of our Next Horizon commitments. For instance, we initially committed to an adjusted return on equity of 12% to 14%, and last year we chose to push that target even higher, to 13% to 15%."", ""And as you've seen within our outlook disclosure, we've further tightened our expense ratio target from 12.6% to 12.3%. While we have the strongest conviction in our Next Horizon strategy, we do not view it as a ceiling on our aspirations. We constantly look to set higher standards and position MetLife for even greater success. When I spoke of emerging from 2023 stronger our capital and cash is another prime example. During a year marked by periods of financial and geopolitical turmoil, our balance sheet strength enabled us to repurchase $3.1 billion of our common stock and increase our common stock dividend per share, paying out roughly $1.6 billion in common stock dividends. Even still, we enter 2024 with robust levels of cash and higher capital ratios in our key markets."", ""Our capital management has carried into 2024, and we have repurchased roughly $0.5 billion of MET common shares in the month of January. We continue to have capacity for further action with approximately $1.6 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization. There is no doubt MetLife's financial strength and financial flexibility was on full view during 2023, particularly with the execution of our $19 billion risk transfer transaction that closed in November. This will free up more than $3 billion of capital over time and illustrates the disciplined approach we apply to evaluating our portfolio of businesses. We ended the year with $5.2 billion of cash and liquid assets on our balance sheet, which is comfortably above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion."", ""We have consistently said that when responsible growth is attractive and available, we will deploy capital organically or inorganically. If not, we will return capital to our shareholders. I am pleased our Next Horizon strategy continues to prove its metal amid uncertainty. Looking ahead, whether driven by Fed policy and changes to the yield curve, geopolitical events, or the unfolding U.S. election cycle, it is prudent to anticipate more uncertainty in 2024. The supplemental slides we published last night include some near-term targets and elements of guidance. It should be playing to see that we anticipate the underlying momentum building across our businesses to continue. This is evident in our flagship Group Benefits business, where off a large embedded base we've established a strong growth outlook for premiums, fees and other revenues."", ""And of further note, we've also increased our expectations for both group life and non-medical health margins. Importantly, the outlook that we've provided reflects the world as we see it, not as we wish it to be. In that context, we assume a more modest private equity return of high-single digits in the near term, down from the 12% assumption we have used in prior years. Private equity remains an important contributor to our well-tested asset-liability matching program. It is an asset class well suited to defeat long-term liabilities, and our historical track record has been very strong. In closing, when we launched our Next Horizon strategy in 2019, we could not have predicted the many challenges we would face in the markets where we operate."", 'But our unyielding execution against our strategy is serving us and our many stakeholders well, allowing us to positively impact our customers and live our purpose. Our 2023 results reflect our capacity to move ahead with urgency and deliver on our strategy. We saw very good underlying business performance supported by a strong capital base. We will continue to concentrate on controlling what we can control, balance sheet security, responsible growth, expense efficiency and capital deployment among others. In the final year of the Next Horizon strategy time frame, we believe our past progress positions us to reach for new heights not possible four years ago. I am energized for the future of MetLife driven by the continued momentum I see building in our businesses for 2024 and beyond.', ""Now I'll turn it over to John to cover our performance and outlook in detail."", 'John McCallion: Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 4Q 2023 supplemental slides, which provide highlights of our financial performance, an update of our liquidity and capital positions as well as our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. In addition, I will discuss our near-term outlook in more detail. Starting on Page 3, we provide a comparison of net income to adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Market risk benefit or MRB remeasurement losses in the fourth quarter was due to the decline in long-term interest rates. Net derivative gains were only a partial offset as the favorable impact from lower long-term interest rates were mitigated by changes in short-term interest rates and higher equity markets in the quarter.', 'For the full year, the variance between net income and adjusted earnings was mostly attributable to net derivative losses, primarily due to stronger equity markets, changes in foreign currencies and higher interest rates in 2023. In addition, net investment losses were largely the result of normal trading activity on the portfolio in a rising interest rate environment as well as the mark-to-market impact on securities that were transferred as part of the reinsurance transaction with Global Atlantic. Overall, the portfolio remains well positioned with modest levels of credit losses and the hedging program continues to perform as expected. On Page 4, you can see the fourth quarter year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding $76 million after tax, of an unfavorable notable item relating to asbestos litigation reserves in 4Q of 2023 that was accounted for in corporate and other.', 'There were no notable items in the prior year quarter. Regarding the asbestos reserve increase of $76 million, based on our latest review, while we continue to observe a declining claim count, the frequency of severe claims related to asbestos has not declined as expected. The total reserve is $364 million at the end of 2023. Adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items were $1.4 billion, up 14% and 12% on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were strong recurring interest margins, higher variable investment income, or VII, volume growth and favorable underwriting margins. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding total notable items were $1.93, up 21% and 19% on a constant currency basis. Moving to the businesses. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were $466 million, up 19% versus the prior year period.', 'The key drivers were favorable life underwriting margins and solid volume growth. The Group Life mortality ratio was 83.5%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 87.3% and below the bottom end of our 2023 target range of 85% to 90%. Consistent with CDC U.S. mortality data, we saw a much lower number of life claims than typical in the fourth quarter. Regarding non-medical health, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 70.7% in the quarter, and at the low end of its annual target range of 70% to 75%. We expect both the life mortality ratio and the non-medical health ratio to be higher in Q1 given the seasonality of the business. Turning to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs on a full year basis were up 3% year-over-year. Taking participating contracts into account, which dampened growth by roughly 200 basis points.', 'The underlying PFOs were up approximately 5% year-over-year within our 2023 target growth range of 4% to 6%. In addition, Group Benefits 2023 sales were up 9% year-over-year. The continued strong growth is primarily due to solid growth across most products, including continued strong momentum in voluntary. RIS adjusted earnings were $421 million, up 10% year-over-year. The primary drivers were favorable investment margins due to higher recurring interest and variable investment income as well as favorable underwriting margins. RIS investment spreads were 121 basis points. Spreads, excluding VII were 134 basis points, up 10 points versus Q4 of 2022, primarily due to higher interest rates as well as income from in-the-money interest rate caps.', ""RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers were up 75% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong sales of structured settlement products and post-retirement benefits as well as growth in UK longevity reinsurance. With regards to PRT, we added transactions worth approximately $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to roughly $5.3 billion. This marks the third highest PRT sales year for MetLife, and we continue to see an active market. Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were $296 million, up 12% and 11% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher investment margins and lower taxes. For Asia's key growth metrics, general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis were up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and sales were essentially flat versus the prior year quarter."", 'For the full year, Asia’s sales were up 13%, driven by strong growth across the region, exceeding its 2023 guidance range of mid to high-single digits. Latin America adjusted earnings were $207 million, up 13% and 4% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to solid volume growth partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins versus a strong Q4 2022. In addition, LatAm had favorable Chilean encaje returns of 7.9% in 4Q of 2023 versus 6.1% in the prior year quarter. Latin America’s top line continues to perform well as adjusted PFOs were up 29% and 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong sales and solid persistency across the region. For the full year, adjusted PFOs were also up 29% on a reported basis and 19% on a constant currency basis, exceeding LatAm’s 2023 guidance of low-double digit growth.', 'EMEA adjusted earnings were $47 million, down 27% on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily driven by an unfavorable tax charge following a favorable tax benefit in the prior year period, as well as less favorable expense and underwriting margins. This was partially offset by higher recurring interest margins year-over-year. EMEA full year 2023 adjusted earnings of $265 million exceeded our outlook expectations of roughly $55 million per quarter. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 5% on both a reported and constant currency basis and sales were up 18% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong growth across the region. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were $156 million, down 15%, largely driven by foregone earnings as a result of the reinsurance transaction that closed in November.', 'Corporate and other adjusted loss was $156 million, excluding the unfavorable notable item of $76 million after-tax that I referenced earlier. This compares to an adjusted loss of $210 million in the prior year. Higher net investment income and favorable taxes were the primary drivers. The company’s effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 19%, which includes favorable tax benefits primarily related to the true up of the federal tax return to provision. On Page 5, this chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the four quarters and full year of 2023. VII was $63 million in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by positive returns in our corporate and mortgage loan funds. The private equity portfolio and real estate equity funds had a combined return of essentially zero in the quarter.', 'For the full year, VII was $419 million, well below our 2023 target of approximately $2 billion. That said, while mark-to-market returns were below expectation in 2023, the PE portfolio generated approximately $2 billion in cash distributions during the year. On Page 6, we provide VII post tax by segment for the prior four quarters and full year 2023. As reflected in the chart, RIS, Asia and MetLife Holdings continue to hold the largest proportion of VII assets, given their long dated liability profile. Now, turning to Page 7, the chart on the left of the page shows the split of our net investment income between recurring and VII for the past three years, as well as Q4 of 2022 versus Q4 of 2023. While VII has had lower than trend returns over the last couple of years, recurring income, which accounted for most of the net investment income in 2023 was up approximately $2.6 billion year-over-year, reflecting higher interest rates and growth in asset balances.', 'The expansion of recurring income in 2023 more than offset the lower VII year-over-year. Shifting your attention to the right of the page, which shows our new money yield versus roll-off yield since 4Q of 2020, new money yields continue to outpace roll-off yields over the past couple of years, consistent with rising rates. In this quarter, our global new money yield continued its upward trajectory coming in at 6.67%, 142 basis points higher than the roll-off yield. Turning to Page 8. I’ll provide a few updates on our commercial mortgage loans. Overall, the CML portfolio continues to perform consistent with expectations, where we expect higher quality assets to outperform the asset sector broadly. The average LTV on our CML portfolio now stands at 64% as of December 31, up slightly from 63% in the third quarter of 2023, and the average debt service coverage ratio remains steady at 2.3 times.', 'The modest increase in LTVs and stable debt service coverage ratio are further indicators of the disciplined approach we take to investing in this asset class. The quality of our CML portfolio remains strong with only 2.6% of loans having LTVs more than 80% and DSCRs less than one times. With regards to CML loan maturities, we resolved 100% of the loans that were scheduled to mature in 2023. Our expectation going forward remains for modest credit losses on the portfolio. Turning to Page 9. This chart shows a comparison of our direct expense ratio over the prior eight quarters and full year 2022 and 2023. Our direct expense ratio in 4Q of 2023 was up modestly at 12.4%, reflecting the impact from seasonal enrollment costs in group benefits as well as higher employee related costs.', 'That said, as we have highlighted previously, we believe our full year direct expense ratio is the best way to measure performance due to fluctuations in quarterly results. For the full year of 2023, our direct expense ratio was 12.2% below our 2023 target of 12.6%. We believe this result once again demonstrates our consistent execution and focus on an efficiency mindset in a challenging inflationary environment, while continuing to make investments in our businesses. I will now discuss our cash and capital positions on Page 10. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.2 billion at December 31, which is above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The cash at the holding companies reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of roughly $900 million in the fourth quarter, as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows.', 'In addition, we repurchased shares totaling approximately $500 million in January. For the two-year period 2022 and 2023, our average free cash flow ratio, excluding notable items totaled 74% and was within our 65% to 75% target range. In terms of statutory capital, for our U.S. companies, our combined 2023 NAIC, RBC ratio is still preliminary but expected to be approximately 400% and above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary 2023 statutory operating earnings were approximately $4.5 billion, while net income was approximately $3.9 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $1.9 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable underwriting and impacts from the reinsurance transaction. This was partially offset by higher expenses.', ""We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $19.5 billion as of December 31, 2023, up 10% for September 30, 2023, primarily due to operating earnings and the impacts of the reinsurance transaction. This was partially offset by dividends paid. Finally, we expect that Japan solvency margin ratio to be approximately 720% as of December 31, which will be based on statutory statements that will be filed in the next few weeks. Before I shift to our near-term outlook starting on Page 12, a few points on what we included in the appendix. The chart on Page 17 reflects new business value metrics for MetLife's major segments from 2018 through 2022. This is the same chart that we showed as part of our 3Q 2023 supplemental slides, but we feel it's worth including again for the sake of completeness."", ""Also, pages 18 through 21 provide interest rate assumptions and key outlook sensitivities by line of business. Now let's turn to Page 12 for further details on our near-term outlook. Starting with the overview. We expect continued uncertainty to persist around inflation and unemployment in 2024. We expect the U.S. dollar to stabilize around current levels. Based on the 12/31/2023 forward curve, we assume long-term interest rates to be largely unchanged in 2024, and the yield curve will move from inverted to modestly upward sloping as short-term interest rates decline and we assume a 5% annual return for the S&P 500. For our near-term targets, we are maintaining our adjusted ROE range of 13% to 15%. We expect to maintain our two-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings."", ""Also, given continued focus on expense discipline, building capacity to reinvest in growth initiatives, and our overall efficiency mindset, we are lowering our direct expense ratio guidance for 2024 from 12.6% to 12.3%. Specifically, for 2024, VII expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. Our corporate and other adjusted loss target is expected to be $750 million to $850 million after tax in 2024. This represents an approximately $100 million increase from our prior adjusted loss guidance of $650 million to $750 million in 2023. The higher range reflects C&O's current run rate given the impact of a higher rate environment on interest expense and pension costs, as well as the impact of lower expected benefits from VII. We are increasing our expected effective tax rate range by two points to 24% to 26% to reflect our expectation for higher earnings in foreign markets with higher tax rates and lower tax credits in the U.S. At the bottom of the page, you will see certain interest rate sensitivities relative to our base case, reflecting a relatively modest impact on adjusted earnings over the near-term."", ""On Page 13, the chart reflects our VII average asset balances from $18 billion in 2022 to $19.7 billion expected in 2024. Private equity investments will continue to represent the vast majority of our VII asset balances. We are reducing our near-term expected annual returns for private equity to be between 7% to 10% and we are also lowering our expected returns for real estate and other funds to be in the range of 5% to 7% over the near-term. We expect PE and real estate returns will remain pressured in the first quarter of 2024 before trending higher. Finally, as a reminder, we include prepayment fees on fixed maturities and mortgage loans in VII. So now, I will discuss our near-term outlook for our business segments. Let's start with the U.S. on Page 14."", 'For group benefits, excluding the excess premium from participating group life contracts of approximately $300 million in 2023, adjusted PFOs are expected to grow at 4% to 6% annually over the near-term. And for 2024 we expect growth to be in the top half of that range. This reflects the strong momentum in the business, particularly in voluntary products, as well as exceptionally strong persistency in our national accounts. Regarding underwriting, we expect 2024 underwriting margins to be generally consistent with 2023. As such, we are reducing our near-term group life mortality ratio and non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio ranges by 1 percentage point to 84% to 89% and 69% to 74%, respectively. Finally, keep in mind these are annual ratios and both typically skew to the higher end of the ranges in the first quarter given the seasonality of the business.', 'For RAS, we are maintaining our 2% to 4% expected annual growth for total liability exposures across our general account spread and fee-based businesses. Regarding investment spread, full year 2023 was 125 basis points and is expected to be relatively flat for the full year of 2024. This incorporates both the impact of the roll off of our interest rate caps with maturities throughout 2024 and the offsetting benefit of VII re-emerging over the year as a more meaningful contributor. As such, we expect the investment spread range for 2024 is 115 to 140 basis points. We have also provided updated RAS sensitivities for interest rate movements in the appendix. Sensitivities reflect the anticipated impact from interest rate cap maturities throughout 2024.', 'As such, our sensitivity to SOFR declines throughout the year. For MetLife Holdings, we are expecting adjusted PFOs to decline by approximately 13% to 15% in 2024 and then declining 4% to 6% annually thereafter. And we are lowering the adjusted earnings guidance range to $700 million to $900 million in 2024 to reflect the foregone earnings from the reinsurance transaction as well as lower expected PE returns and natural runoff of the business. Now, let’s look at the near-term guidance of our businesses outside the U.S. on Page 15. For Asia, we expect the recent sales momentum to continue and generate mid-single digit growth over the near-term. In addition, we expect general account AUM to maintain mid-single digit growth. We are expecting adjusted earnings to grow roughly 20% in 2024 as we assume VII to have a greater impact throughout the year.', 'We are maintaining mid-single digit adjusted earnings growth expectation over the remainder of the near-term. For Latin America, we expect both adjusted PFOs and adjusted earnings to grow by high single digits over the near-term. Finally, for EMEA, we’re expecting sales to grow mid- to high-single digits and adjusted PFOs to grow mid-single digits over the near-term. The forward curve assumes a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in EMEA. As such, we project EMEA’s adjusted earnings run rate to be roughly $60 million to $65 million per quarter in 2024 and then grow by mid-single digits in 2025 and 2026 based on the forward curve for these currencies. Let me conclude by saying that MetLife delivered a solid quarter to close out another strong year.', 'The underlying strength of our business fundamentals remains on display with strong top line growth coupled with disciplined underwriting and expense management. While VII remains below historical returns, core spreads remain robust and continue to benefit from the higher yield environment. While the current environment remains uncertain, we are excited about the outlook and growth prospects for our businesses over the near-term and beyond. MetLife continues to move forward from a position of strength with a strong balance sheet, recurring free cash flow generation and a diversified set of our market leading businesses. And we are committed to deploying capital to achieve responsible growth and build sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders.', 'And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.', 'See also 14 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks To Invest In and Hedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 10 Tech Stock Picks.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

You probably couldn't live off of the income stream such a yield would generate unless, of course, you own a particularly large nest egg. So, most dividend-focused investors, particularly those in retirement, will probably be looking for stocks with notably higher yields."", ""There are plenty of these high-yield offerings to choose from, but there's a potential problem you need to address before you start making any decisions about which ones to add to your portfolio."", 'Real estate investment trusts (REITs) and utilities are two great places to look for dividend stocks. Financially strong REITs with decades of annual dividend increases under their belts, like Realty Income (NYSE: O), can be bought with a yield over 5%. In the utility sector, you can buy Dividend King Black Hills (NYSE: BKH) with a yield of 4.9%.', ""These aren't anomalies, either; they are just examples of the attractive dividend yields that are often on offer in the REIT and utility sectors. There's another option for finding dividend stocks, though. Sometimes a sector will hit on hard times, and you can pick up some of the strongest companies on the cheap and with historically high yields. During the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, for example, you could have bought integrated energy giants ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) with historically high yields nearing 10%."", ""There's a potential problem here, though, and that's diversification. REITs and utilities are generally filled with high-yield investments most of the time. And industries that have fallen on hard times, by definition, are a concentrated investment opportunity. If all you look at is dividend yield, you may end up with too many stocks from too few industries. You need to cast a wider net, and that may require you to consider lower-yielding investments."", ""As an example, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) has a yield of around 3.1% today. That's not nearly as good as the 5%-plus you could get from Realty Income or its peers, including NNN (NYSE: NNN) and W.P. Carey (NYSE: WPC). However, the chipmaker has increased its dividend annually for decades, and the dividend yield today happens to be near the highest levels in the company's history."", 'Would you be better off owning three companies that do almost the exact same thing or two companies in completely different industries? From a diversification standpoint, spreading your eggs into different baskets is likely to be the safer choice. Technology companies with high yields, like Texas Instruments today, can be tough to find, so when they do show up, you might want to consider adding them to your portfolio to spread your bets around a little more.', 'Gold and silver streamer Franco-Nevada (NYSE: FNV) is another example. It has a 1.2% yield, which is near its highest levels over the past five years. Yes, the yield is modest on an absolute basis, but gold is a hard asset that investors often include in a portfolio specifically for diversification. Franco-Nevada might be worth a deep dive.', ""The thing is, you have to think beyond yield to view Texas Instruments and Franco-Nevada as options for your portfolio. And there are more that could be added to the list, as well. For example, medical device maker Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) has a historically high 3.1% yield. That 3.1% yield isn't as attractive as what you could get from many utilities today, but if all you buy is utilities, you expose yourself to concentration risk. That's a risk that you can easily avoid if you take just a little broader view with your dividend approach and opportunistically add companies in other areas, like healthcare."", ""There isn't one right way to invest, but there are ways that have a history of leading to problems. One big mistake that investors make is focusing so much on yield that they fail to adequately diversify their portfolios. The reason is simple: High-yield stocks are often found in the same sectors. Take a look at your portfolio. If you are highly concentrated in just a few sectors, you might want to widen your investment lens. You may have to lower your yield expectations, but the long-term diversification benefit will likely be well worth it (and it will probably help you sleep better at night, too)."", 'When\xa0our analyst team has an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

What do the oil giants’ growth suggest about the oil sector and overall production (CL=F, BZ=F)? Truist Securities Managing Director Energy Neal Dingmann joins Yahoo Finance Live to weigh in on factors that are contributing to both companies’ success.', '“What it shows is that their [Chevron and Exxon] production is phenomenal,” Dingmann states, who expects impressive shareholder returns. “I don’t know many other sectors where you can find companies this large, and get this kind of shareholder return.”', 'Both Chevron and Exxon do not appear to be as impacted by the geopolitical crises in the Red Sea due to the focus production from the Permian Basis, according to Dingmann.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Eyek Ntekim"", 'SEANA SMITH: All right, Exxon and Chevron reporting better than expected earnings for the most recent quarters as the two oil giants double down on fossil fuels. Well, those recent bets are paying off. When you take a look at those annual numbers, both companies reporting their second highest annual profits in a decade.', ""We want to bring in Neil Dingmann. He's a Truist Securities Managing Director of Energy Research. Neil, it's great to have you here. So your first take at these results that we're getting from both Chevron and Exxon and their ability to do this at a time that hasn't exactly been as bullish for crude prices as what we saw back in 2022."", ""NEIL DINGMANN: Yeah. Thanks for having me, Seana. I think what it shows is their production is phenomenal for both not only in the Permian-- let's just look at Exxon, for instance, that just reported-- or just had their call a minute ago. Permian production and Guyana production continues to set records quarter after quarter. So while some other EMPs are maintaining flat production, these big companies continue to show that even with flattish pricing, maybe a little bit lower pricing, they can continue to generate record production, which is generating record earnings or near-record earnings and record cash flow, resulting in just, to me, phenomenal shareholder return."", 'BRAD SMITH: And so for shareholders right now that are trying to get their best read on the state of oil coming off of both the reports from Exxon as well as from Chevron, how would you kind of encapsulate that right now?', ""NEIL DINGMANN: It's a good question. But I think what I would suggest is anybody holding it, you can expect, one, not only cash flow and earnings to likely go up about another 5% this year, but, along with that, it's interesting-- I mean, look, both these companies are paying out about a 4% dividend, which I think is quite good. And on top of that, both are even buying back more shares on an absolute level than what they even pay out on dividends."", ""So to me, the shareholder return is still the story. I don't know many other sectors where you can find companies this large and get this kind of shareholder return."", 'SEANA SMITH: Neil, when we talk about the disruption in the Red Sea, the implications or the impact that is having on some oil giants around the globe, what does it mean, in particular, here for Chevron and Exxon?', 'NEIL DINGMANN: Well, I think it\'s a good question. I think that\'s why both these companies continue to lean very heavily on the Permian. I think they made the decision a year, maybe even a couple of years ago, to really focus-- you have Exxon now that bought Pioneer. That\'s going to close next quarter. Even I don\'t want to say ""double down,"" but it\'s going to add a tremendous amount of Permian production. So I think it\'s exactly what you\'re saying. I think there\'s going to continue to be geopolitical risk, international, and it\'s why these companies continue to focus predominantly on the lower 48 for growth.', 'BRAD SMITH: And so with that in mind, should we still continue to be concerned more geopolitically, not just about conflict that might break out, but also about production considerations as well and how that flows through to both of these companies?', ""NEIL DINGMANN: It's interesting. I actually asked Darren Woods that this morning on the Q&A. And his comment was-- or his answer was that he's going to continue to do what's best for the company. So while there might be some pushback if US companies start to grow too much, I think still, most importantly, is what these companies are able to throw off in cash flow. And you know, again, the biggest driver is going to continue to be the Permian and Guyana. And I think you're going to see-- continue to see both of those pushed higher."", ""SEANA SMITH: When it comes to lots of questions just about what the price of crude is going to look like-- I'm not asking you to forecast how high or maybe the pressure that we're going to see in crude, but in terms of the ability to navigate, when you take a name like Chevron and stack it up against Exxon, who do you think is better positioned to weather some of those potential challenges here, at least in the short-term?"", ""NEIL DINGMANN: I think both the, I would call it short-term and long-term, I think Exxon. And the simple reason is now, by adding that Pioneer, I think they have the dominant US position, not only above Chevron, but above any other company out there. So I just think they're phenomenally positioned."", ""I don't see anybody else with a better asset position, better inventory depth, all those kind of things. So I just have more confidence that Exxon can continue to ramp their production at this pace for a longer period given the quality of their inventory."", ""BRAD SMITH: Is there one company that is best positioned, from your perspective, to weather some of the political punching bag nature that may assume itself as we get towards the general election and we hear talks of even more and more discussion and debate around clean energy, and where the shifts are actually being made, where companies are not doing their part-- and is there one that's actually kind of taking significant strides well enough in order to insulate themselves from that conversation?"", ""NEIL DINGMANN: I mean, they're both doing it to some degree. It's a good question, Brad. And I think, though, for instance, this morning, a lot of the call today on Exxon was around carbon capture, was around their lithium project that, by 2027, will be enough-- produce enough lithium to support one million electric vehicles."", ""So, look, I think fossil fuels, we know, is going to continue to be the dominant driver for both these companies. So even all those things they're doing outside, I think they're still going to take some heat, especially given the amount of growth that they're both showing on the fossil fuel side."", 'BRAD SMITH: Neil, great to have you on.

Its revenue rose 13% year over year to $86.31 billion, which exceeded analysts' estimates by $1.04 billion. Its adjusted EPS grew 56% to $1.64 and also cleared the consensus forecast by four cents a share."", ""Those headline numbers looked healthy, but a lot of growth had already been priced into Alphabet's shares before the release of its earnings report. Even after its post-earnings pullback, its stock has still rallied about 45% over the past 12 months. So is Alphabet's stock finally due for a breather, or will it head even higher over the next year?"", ""Alphabet generated 76% of its revenue from Google's advertising business -- which houses its search, display, network, and YouTube ads -- in the fourth quarter. Google's subscriptions, platforms, and devices segment brought in 13% of its revenue, while 11% came from its cloud business. All three businesses posted accelerating revenue growth in the fourth quarter."", 'Metric', 'Q4 2022', 'Q1 2023', 'Q2 2023', 'Q3 2023', 'Q4 2023', 'Google Advertising Revenue Growth (YOY)', '(4%)', '0%', '3%', '9%', '11%', 'Google Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices Revenue Growth (YOY)', '8%', '9%', '24%', '21%', '23%', 'Google Cloud Revenue Growth (YOY)', '32%', '28%', '28%', '22%', '26%', 'Total Revenue Growth (YOY)', '1%', '3%', '7%', '11%', '13%', 'Data source: Alphabet. YOY = Year over year.', ""As a result, Alphabet's year-over-year revenue growth accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. Its advertising business grew again as the robust growth of its search and YouTube ads offset the softness of its network ads, while a growing number of YouTube Premium and Music, YouTube TV, and Google One subscriptions drove the expansion of its subscriptions, platforms, and devices division."", ""But more importantly, Google Cloud's growth accelerated again after experiencing a disappointing slowdown in the previous quarter. It attributed that reacceleration to the rollout of new artificial intelligence (AI) tools across its cloud-based services."", 'However, Google Cloud is still growing slower than Microsoft\'s ""Azure and other cloud services"" division, which generated 30% year-over-year growth in its latest quarter while integrating fresh AI features into its ecosystem. That\'s worrisome because Google Cloud still ranks third in the cloud platform race with a 10% share of the market, according to Canalys. Azure holds 25%, while Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads the market with a 31% share.', ""For the full year, Alphabet's revenue rose 9%.

For the full year, its operating margin rose by a percentage point to 27%."", 'That expansion was largely driven by the stabilization of its advertising business, the improving profitability of its cloud business -- which maintained positive operating margins through all four quarters of the year -- and several rounds of layoffs. It also reined in its spending at its ""other bets"" division, which houses its moonshot projects.', 'During the conference call, CFO Ruth Porat said Alphabet would continue to ""durably reengineer"" its cost base to support its ""growth priorities"" -- which include YouTube Shorts, Google Cloud, and its AI services -- and that it would focus on ""removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity.""', ""Analysts expect those strategies to boost Alphabet's operating margin to 29% in 2024 and 30% in 2025.

At 21 times those forward earnings expectations, Alphabet looks a bit cheaper than Microsoft and Amazon, which trade at 36 and 44 times forward earnings, respectively."", ""Alphabet's stock is still reasonably valued, but persistent concerns about its ability to keep pace with Microsoft in the AI race, expand its cloud infrastructure platform, and weather the regulatory threats for its core advertising business could limit its near-term gains. Elevated interest rates could also broadly drive investors away from top tech stocks again."", ""That said, I believe Alphabet's stock will stabilize and gradually head higher through the end of 2024 as more investors appreciate its dominance of the search, advertising, and streaming video markets and the long-term growth potential of its AI and cloud services.

The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 sent countless chip stocks soaring as Wall Street grew bullish over the companies developing the hardware necessary to run and train AI models."", ""With the second-largest market share in graphics processing units (GPUs) and plans to begin shipping a new AI chip this year, AMD has significant potential in the industry over the long term. However, just because a company has a leading position in an industry doesn't necessarily mean it's trading at the right price."", ""AMD's earnings have yet to reflect its heavy investment in the market, which has seen its forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) rise 58% since last January to a pricey 45. Meanwhile, its free cash flow has plunged 47% to just over $1 billion in the same period. As a result, shares in AMD are potentially riskier than AI stocks trading at a better value or in better financial standing."", ""This chart shows AMD has the second-highest forward P/E among some of the most prominent AI firms, indicating its stock offers far less value than companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Consequently, it could be worth considering alternative stocks while you wait for AMD's shares to come down to a more attractive price point."", 'So, forget AMD in 2024. Here are two AI stocks to buy instead.', ""Microsoft emerged as one of the biggest threats in AI last year when heavy investment in OpenAI gave it access to some of the start-up's most advanced AI models. The Windows company has used OpenAI's technology to carve out a lucrative role in the industry, introducing AI features across its product lineup."", 'In 2023, Microsoft added new AI tools to its cloud platform Azure, integrated aspects of ChatGPT into its search engine Bing, and boosted productivity in its Office software suite with the help of AI.', 'Meanwhile, the company is taking early steps to monetize its new offerings, launching an AI assistant called Copilot through its Microsoft 365 subscription service. The company describes the assistant as ""your everyday AI companion."" Some of its generative capabilities include creating a first draft in Word, generating a full PowerPoint presentation based on a simple prompt, and producing data visualizations in seconds in Excel.', 'Copilot has debuted as a $30 per month add-on to a 365 membership, which could lead to significant earnings boosts for Microsoft.', ""Microsoft's AI potential has seen its stock soar 64% year over year, with 8% of that since the start of 2024. Its impressive rise allowed it to overtake Apple's market cap and become the most valuable company in the world. Microsoft has shown no signs of slowing and could be in for a stellar 2024."", 'Moreover, Microsoft hit over $62 billion in free cash flow in 2023, indicating it has the funds to continue investing in AI and stay ahead of the competition. Alongside a significantly lower forward P/E than AMD, Microsoft is a no-brainer to invest in AI this year.', 'Shares in Intel are down nearly 13% since Jan. 25, when it released its fourth quarter of 2023 earnings. The company posted revenue growth of 10% year over year, beating Wall Street estimates by $230 million. During the quarter, Intel enjoyed significant gains from a recovering PC market.', ""However, that wasn't enough to overshadow weak guidance that sent its stock tumbling. Intel expects Q1 2024 earnings to reach $0.13 per share when analysts forecasted $0.42 per share. Meanwhile, the company projects revenue to come in between $12 billion and $13 billion, considerably below the $14 billion that Wall Street expected."", 'A boom in AI has seen a shift in the chip market, with server demand for GPUs soaring as demand for central processing units (CPUs) has faltered. Intel has dominated the CPU market for years, with its weak guidance reflecting this change.', 'The weak guidance demonstrates why keeping a long-term perspective is crucial when investing in tech stocks and budding industries like AI.', 'Intel is heavily investing in the generative technology that could help the company come back strong over the next decade. Last December, Intel unveiled a range of AI chips, including Gaudi3, a GPU designed to challenge similar offerings from Nvidia and AMD. The tech giant also showed off new Core Ultra processors and Xeon server chips, which both include neural processing units for running AI programs more efficiently.', ""The chipmaker's recent challenges make Intel a long-term play. However, its forward P/E of 32 makes it one of the cheapest AI stocks among AMD, Nvidia, and Amazon. The company could offer major gains over the long term as it continues expanding in AI and restructures its business to prioritize GPU production and profit growth. Intel is an exciting option in 2024 and a far better value than AMD."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

One analyst believes that could be the new order of things, with two more stocks poised to hurtle past Apple's valuation in the years to come."", 'Late in 2022, a sudden leap forward in the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) caught many off guard. To be clear, these sophisticated algorithms have been around in one form or another for decades, but 2023 seemed to mark a turning point in interest for the technology.', 'The advent of generative AI took the technology to the next level, with the ability to not only search data for patterns, but create entirely new content from scratch with only minor prompts from the user. Perhaps more importantly, these AI models can automate menial tasks and improve processes, thereby freeing up workers to be more productive.', 'The resulting gold rush to adopt AI has caused a paradigm shift, particularly among those companies that are best positioned to provide AI to the masses.', 'Microsoft was first off the blocks, with a $13 billion stake in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. The company quickly developed AI tools for its own software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings, including Microsoft Office and 365.', ""The headliner is Copilot, the company's AI-fueled digital assistant, which offers more than 150 new features designed to save time and increase productivity. These features include summarizing email messages and drafting potential responses, creating presentations from existing data, and writing and debugging computer code, among many other functions."", 'Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) was also quick off the mark.

Amazon also made a $4 billion investment and announced a strategic collaboration with Open AI competitor Anthropic AI.', 'Savvy investors will note the common thread here: Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are collectively referred to as the ""Big Three"" cloud computing providers.', 'Late last year, Needham analyst Laura Martin reiterated her view that the trio of cloud infrastructure providers -- Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud -- have the most to gain from generative AI as the gatekeepers of the LLMs, suggesting they could capture a percentage of every new generative AI app created. ""Generative AI will redefine the basis of competition for media and internet companies,"" she wrote in a note to clients.', 'Martin thinks AI is a natural fit for the cloud providers:', ""Not only do [Microsoft, AWS, and Google Cloud's] LLMs have the lowest cost structures and first-mover advantages, but their average lifetime value per cloud customer is about to skyrocket, owing to the stickiness of apps built on their LLMs."", ""There's evidence that seems to support her conclusion. By some estimates, 60% of all corporate data lives in the cloud, according to online data provider Statista. The practice is widespread, as an estimated 98% of corporations worldwide store at least some of their data in the cloud, according to cybersecurity solutions provider Check Point.

Much of its growth over the last year can be attributed to a boom in artificial intelligence (AI), which has seen many tech stocks skyrocket. The sector has shown no signs of slowing.', ""Data from Grand View Research shows that the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030, which would see the industry exceed a valuation of $1 trillion before the end of the decade. It's not too late to invest in this budding sector and profit from its long-term development."", 'So, here are two AI stocks I\'m going ""all in"" on in 2024.', 'Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) was slightly overlooked last year as rivals Amazon and Microsoft seemed to progress faster in AI. However, the company was merely taking the time to hone its technology as it prepared to make a big splash in the industry in 2024.', 'Last December, Alphabet unveiled its highly anticipated AI model, Gemini. The new model excels at building generative AI programs with its ability to crunch various forms of data, such as audio, video, and text. The tech giant has said it will release three versions of Gemini, with the most powerful one designed to run data centers and the smallest one able to power smartphones.', ""Gemini could open the door to many growth opportunities in AI for Alphabet, with the technology to create a Google Search experience closer to OpenAI's ChatGPT, add new AI tools to Google Cloud and Android, offer more efficient advertising, and better track viewing trends on YouTube."", ""Alongside Gemini, Alphabet announced a new generation of its custom-built AI chips. The Cloud TPU v5p is a tensor processing unit (TPU) designed to train large AI models. It's nearly three times faster than previous versions."", ""Over the last five years, Alphabet's annual revenue and operating income have risen 75% and 106%. Meanwhile, free cash flow has soared 151% to $77 billion. The company is one of the most reliable tech firms and is only just getting started in AI, which could further boost earnings in the coming years."", 'Moreover, this chart shows that Alphabet is one of the cheapest AI stocks. The company has the lowest forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-free cash flow among some of the most prominent names in AI, indicating that its stock offers the most value.', 'Alphabet has the funds and brand power to go far in AI, making it a screaming buy for me in 2024.', 'Chip stocks captivated Wall Street last year, and for good reason. These companies are developing the hardware necessary to train and run AI models, making them well-positioned to see major gains as demand for chips continues to soar.', 'While Nvidia stole much of the spotlight last year, it is worth considering investing in chipmakers at earlier stages in their AI expansions, as they could have more room to run. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is an exciting option as it gears up to challenge Nvidia in AI in 2024.', ""AMD unveiled its MI300X AI graphics processing unit (GPU) last December, announcing that the chip is on par with Nvidia's H100 GPU for training and that it beats the H100 for inference by 10% to 20%. It's already attracting some of tech's biggest players."", ""In November, Microsoft announced that Azure would become the first cloud platform to use the MI300X to optimize its AI capabilities. Microsoft has a partnership with OpenAI, making the company a powerful partner for AMD. Alongside an agreement with Meta Platforms -- which will see it use the new chips as well -- AMD's future in AI looks bright."", ""This table shows AMD's earnings could hit just over $5 per share by its next fiscal year. That figure, multiplied by the chipmaker's forward P/E of 45, yields a stock price of $239."", ""If projections are correct, AMD's shares would rise 35% by the end of fiscal 2024, outperforming the S&P 500's increase of 20% over the last 12 months. Alongside massive potential in AI, AMD is one of the most exciting investment opportunities this year."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

Microsoft now has a market value of $3 trillion — more than any U.S. publicly traded company, including its longtime rival Apple.', '""Nadella’s had the biggest transformation of a tech company potentially ever,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives. “The only one that would rival it was (Steve) Jobs coming back to Apple and turning it around with the iPhone.”', 'Microsoft has created $2.8 trillion in shareholder wealth in the past decade, meaning an investor who bought a $10,000 stake in Microsoft at the time Nadella took over and did nothing with those shares, would have a stake worth about $113,000 now.', 'HOW IT HAPPENED', '“Our industry does not respect tradition — it only respects innovation,” Nadella told employees in an inaugural memo 10 years ago, an opening salvo that hinted at bigger shifts to come. Microsoft declined requests for an interview.', ""Now a hero to Wall Street, some were at first skeptical that such transformation could come from an insider who’d already spent 22 years at the Redmond, Washington company. He's only the third Microsoft CEO, following Steve Ballmer, who lasted for 14 years, and Bill Gates, who co-founded the company in 1975 and took it public in 1986."", ""Big changes came quickly under Nadella. He marshaled resources to build up the Azure cloud computing platform, a shift in priorities from the company's longtime reliance on its flagship Windows operating system and the royalties it gets for each PC sold with it. And he largely put the brakes on Microsoft's ill-fated attempts to play catch-up in the smartphone market, marked by his predecessor Ballmer’s $7.3 billion acquisition of Nokia’s phone business."", 'But some of the biggest changes were in the company’s culture, a shift away from Microsoft’s brash external reputation and internal bickering to a more collaborative approach that Nadella has modeled in his own collegial personality and engineer’s mindset.', 'LEARN-IT-ALL CULTURE', '“Microsoft is known for rallying the troops with competitive fire,"" Nadella said in his 2017 autobiography. ""The press loves that, but it’s not me.”', 'Much of Nadella’s strength is how he stands out from the typical “very strong ego CEO,"" said Raimo Lenschow, a stock analyst at Barclays who covers 36 tech companies. Instead of making bold pronouncements, Lenschow said Nadella takes a more measured approach to explaining “where he thinks the future is going.""', 'And ""whether it’s the person making food in the cafeteria, an engineer, finance executive, a customer, he treats everyone in the same way, with respect,” said Ives. It\'s not just Wall Street analysts who think so.', 'A tiny startup from Zeeland, Michigan, running a booth at January’s CES gadget show in Las Vegas caught a glimpse of Nadella’s curiosity when he showed up, shook founder Tim Murphy’s hand and asked for a demo. The product, Audio Radar, visualizes the sounds in video games for deaf and hard of hearing players.', '“He’s very down to earth,” said Murphy, who was there with a small crew including his teen son. “I gave him the pitch, played some games, and he was like, ‘It’s wonderful what you’re doing.’ Honestly, I can’t really remember too much of what he said because I was just kind of shocked.”', 'Nadella has long made the accessibility of technology a priority, informed in part by his experience raising a son who was visually impaired, quadriplegic and had cerebral palsy. Zain Nadella died in 2022.', 'AI PUSH', ""What's brought Microsoft to its latest heights is its emergence as an artificial intelligence leader, setting the agenda on how AI tools could get used in work and society. While Nadella has been emphasizing AI for most of his tenure, its role was not guaranteed and happened after years of careful planning that led to a close partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. (OpenAI pays The Associated Press an undisclosed fee to license its archive of news stories)."", '“Historically, if you\'re a cool startup that was doing something amazing, Microsoft wasn’t really your first choice,” Lenschow said. “So the fact that he got OpenAI to commit to Azure was an amazing masterstroke ... it gives him a massive, competitive advantage over Google and Amazon.""', 'That position was put in jeopardy late last year when OpenAI’s board of directors suddenly fired CEO Sam Altman. A weekend of behind-the-scenes maneuvers and a threatened mass exodus of employees championed by Nadella helped bring back Altman and stabilize the startup, assuaging clients and shareholders. “He handled that like he was in the World Series of Poker playing against little kids,” Ives said.', 'ONGOING CHALLENGES', ""Nadella's tenure hasn't been without hiccups, especially given how much of the world relies so heavily on Microsoft products — sometimes to the frustration of people using them."", 'Cybersecurity experts say its tendency is to sacrifice security for convenience, including in its gung-ho rollout of AI large language models. The company’s trademark suite of work tools, Microsoft Office 365, has also been penetrated successfully in recent years in embarrassing high-profile compromises that have seen elite Russian and Chinese cyber operators access the email accounts of senior U.S. officials and members of Microsoft’s senior leadership team.', 'It stepped in to provide cloud hosting to Ukraine just ahead of Russia’s 2022 invasion, but the networks serving NATO allies are constantly peppered by intrusion attempts. That, and the worsening ransomware scourge, have led Nadella to call for a cyber Geneva Convention with Russia and China.', ""And despite Nadella's stated aversion to “competitive fire,” Microsoft is once again drawing the kind of antitrust scrutiny that dogged Gates and Ballmer in earlier years. Nadella's confident testimony at a federal court hearing last summer helped persuade a judge not to block Microsoft's purchase of video game giant Activision Blizzard, but the company is now facing another round of questions on its partnership with OpenAI."", ""None of those challenges are likely to push Nadella, 56, who made $48.5 million in total compensation last year and has also chaired Microsoft's board since 2021, out of his leadership roles anytime soon."", '“From everything I can gather, he’s really enjoying himself,” Lenschow said. “We’re in very, very, very interesting times. I would expect him to stay for a while.”', '—-', 'AP technology reporters Michael Liedtke and Frank Bajak contributed to this report.']"

The latter included the departure of its CEO, CFO, CIO, chief medical officer and chief marketing officer.', 'In June, the retailer said it would close 150 stores in the U.S.\xa0and 300 in the U.K.,\xa0part of a cost-cutting effort that targets at least $800 million in savings in 2024, for an accumulation of $4.1 billion in savings.', 'The company has a ways to go in that plan, however.', '“While Walgreens continues to progress on reducing costs and delivering on our commitments to be the independent healthcare provider of choice, we still have significant cost savings and growth goals to deliver,” the spokesperson said. “To help us achieve these goals we have made the difficult but necessary decision to lay off 145 team members primarily from our corporate workforce.”', 'Last month the retailer slashed its dividend as it reported a fiscal Q1 dragged down by its U.S. stores, where sales fell 6.1%, and comparable retail sales fell 5%.

Aerospace strength was a significant driver of our performance in the quarter.', ""We now expect to achieve $200 million in cumulative synergies in fiscal year ‘24, a $50 million increase to our original guide for this fiscal year. We remain committed to achieving $300 million in synergies by fiscal year ‘26. And our backlog remains resilient at $10.8 billion. We had a strong finish to the first half and as a result our increasing fiscal year ‘24 guidance, Todd will go over this later in the slide deck. Next slide, please. I'd like to spend a few minutes highlighting the power of the entire Parker portfolio. We have a technology powerhouse of interconnected solutions that delivers value for customers in both aerospace and industrial markets. Today two-thirds of our revenue comes from customers who buy four or more of the technologies you see across the top of this page."", 'And two-thirds of our portfolio product solutions that we have today enables clean technologies. Next slide please. Parker has significant content on leading aerospace programs. We have a comprehensive product offering with proprietary design on premier programs. On the upper left hand side of this page is our first half sales mix by application. You see a nice balance of commercial and military, as well as business jets, regional transport and helicopters. This diverse aerospace and defense exposure allows us to have multiple products and technologies on every major aircraft program globally, many of them seen along the bottom of this page. All of this adds up to be a compelling value proposition for all of our aerospace customers. Next slide, please.', ""And equally compelling is our global distribution network, a competitive differentiator for Parker. 50% of our diversified industrial revenue is through distribution, a high margin channel serving aftermarket and small to medium sized OEMs. Our distribution partners integrate Parker technologies that solve customer problems. They are truly an extension of Parker's sales and engineering team. Building on the success of the North American distribution channel, we continue to drive an increasing revenue mix of 100 basis points per year in international markets. This past December, we held our North America National Sales Meeting for the first time since the pandemic. Nearly 100 distribution partners attended the meeting along with Parker divisions and sales teams."", ""It was great to have everyone together again, and despite the destocking we've been talking about for several quarters, the overall sentiment and tone was very positive for the future. Next slide, please. We continue to be very proud of our margin expansion progress. Our people, our business system, the Win Strategy and our portfolio have truly transformed Parker's performance. The progress can be seen in every segment on this page. In addition to our core strategies on lean, pricing and procurement, Win 3.0 initiatives like Simple by Design, our focus on demand forecasting, zero defects and productivity and automation will take us to 25% adjusted operating margin and beyond. Every strategy and tool in the Win Strategy expands margins. I'll now turn it back to, Todd."", ""Todd M. Leombruno: Okay. Thanks, Jenny. I'm going to start on Slide 9, and I'm just going to really quickly go through the FY2024 Q2 financial summary. As Jenny mentioned, the second quarter was an extremely strong quarter for us. It was a great finish to the first half of our fiscal year. And once again, the team set an unbelievable amount of records for the quarter. If you look at this slide, every number in that gold column is the second quarter record. We set new highs for sales, segment operating margin, EBITDA margin, net income and earnings per share. Total sales growth was plus 3% in the quarter, all of that 3% was organic. Just a reminder, this is the first full quarter that we have, Meggitt in both the current and prior year periods."", 'The net impact of divestitures and currency basically offset each other. Divestitures was slightly unfavorable at 0.3%, currency was slightly favorable at 0.5%. When you look at the margins, Jenny already mentioned this, that 24.5% was an increase of 300 basis points versus prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin reached 25.7% that was an increase of 330 basis points versus prior year. If you take a look at net income, we did $802 million on an adjusted basis that is a 16.6% return on sales that was a 30% increase versus prior year. And lastly adjusted earnings per share a record for the quarter $6.15 that was up 29% from prior. Just an exceptional second quarter and again, unbelievable margin expansion and what I really like about it, it was consistent across all of our businesses as Jenny just shared on that last slide.', 'If you go to Slide 10, this is the earnings per share bridge and this chart really shows what a high quality quarter it was for the company. The 29% in adjusted earnings per share that amounted to an additional $1.39 of earnings per share in the quarter, main driver of this continues to be excellent operating performance. If you look at segment operating income dollars that increased by $173 million in the quarter that accounted for just a little over a $1 of that EPS growth and that equated to 74% of the increased earnings per share in the quarter. Clearly, aerospace systems was a major driver of improvement, but what is really impressive is both industrial businesses also contributed to the increase in segment operating income dollars. If you look at tax that was $0.18 favorable versus prior year again just driven by some discrete items, other expense was favorable $0.12 versus prior year.', ""That was mainly the result of currency changes and some favorable pension expense. Interest expense was $0.10 favorable versus prior, that really is a result of our successful efforts to reduce outstanding debt over the last 12 months. I'll talk about that in a little bit later in the deck. Corporate G&A and share count were just both slightly higher than prior year, just a net $0.03. And those are the components of the increase in adjusted earnings per share. Really it's just strong margin performance across the company continue with some great outstanding performance from the Meggitt business. If you go to Slide 11, we'll talk about the segment performance that's detailed on Slide 11. Couldn't be prouder of the broad based margin expansion really driven by the Win Strategy, Jenny mentioned this, but our synergies are ahead of schedule."", 'We did increase that synergy number. Aerospace demand really remains very, very high. So, just a nice consistent execution across our businesses, across all of our global team members. You can see that segment operating margin 24.5% at the bottom of the page, up 300 basis points. Incrementals were stellar at over a 100% and orders remain positive at plus 2% versus prior year and backlog really remains resilient. Total backlog dollars did increase slightly sequentially as well. And Jenny mentioned this, but total backlog remains at near record levels, and aerospace activity remains especially robust. If you look at the North American businesses, sales volume reached $2.1 billion in the quarter. Organic growth was down 1.5% versus prior year.', 'That was driven by continued destocking, some channel rebalancing and really some softness in off highway markets. However, what is impressive out of the North American team is that adjusted operating margins did increase 240 basis points to a second quarter record of 24.2%. That was just really driven by excellent execution, some great efficiency improvements and really some tight cost controls. Orders in North America also remain consistent the prior quarter. They remain at down minus 4%. If you look at the international businesses, sales were $1.4 billion slightly positive versus prior year. Organic growth was essentially flat, which was better than we were forecasting. Organic growth in EMEA was positive at 0.7%, Latin America was positive at 9.2% and Asia Pac did improve, it did come in at negative 2.5% really just being pulled down by the slower than expected recovery in China.', ""But also what's impressive there is adjusted operating margins did expand 110 basis points in these businesses and also finished at a second quarter record of 23%. That international team continues to be focused on productivity improvements, expanding margins and being very resilient across the segment even in a low growth environment, very impressive results. Orders in the international segment did improve. If you remember last quarter, they were minus 8, they did improve to minus 5. And finally on Aerospace Systems, they delivered another standout quarter. Sales reached $1.3 billion a 15% increase from prior year. All of that 15% is organic growth, and volume just continues to be driven by commercial aftermarket growth that was in the quarter up 25%."", ""Operating margins reached a new record increasing by 590 basis points to reach 26.5%. Really the healthy volumes, the favorable aftermarket mix, outstanding performance from the Meggitt business really all contributed to drive these record margins. We are increasing the synergies. Jenny went over that just briefly. Cumulative synergies were increasing from $150 million to $200 [million] (ph) and order rates in aerospace continue to remain plus 21% which is very robust. On the next slide, we'll talk about cash flow. Let's take a look at what we've done there. Year-to-date cash flow from operations is $1.4 billion that's 14% of sales. That is an increase of 26% versus prior year, just fantastic cash flow performance. If you look at free cash flow that was $1.1 billion that's up 11.9% also increasing significantly 29% increase from prior."", ""Our cash flow conversion is year-to-date 86%. We really have the team remaining focused on being great generators and great deployers of cash. You've heard us say that many times. Last week our Board approved a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per share. That is our 295th consecutive quarterly dividend. Just a nice solid testament to our belief that we can be great generators and great deployers of cash. When you look at the full year, we are increasing our expectations for free cash flow, we've increased that range to $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion. That's moving the midpoint up $150 million to approximately $3 billion and of course free cash flow conversion will be over a 100% for the full year. On the next slide, let's take a look at our progress on deleveraging."", ""We did reduce debt another $400 million in the quarter. And just a reminder, since we closed Meggitt just five quarters ago, we have reduced debt by over $2.2 billion now, and we've improved our leverage by 1.4 turns, both of those figures are ahead of what we've originally committed to. If you look at the metrics gross debt to adjusted EBITDA is now 2.4. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 2.3. And we continue to forecast just approximately $2 billion of debt paid out in the fiscal year. And now based on the performance we've got year-to-date, we expect to achieve net leverage of 2.0 times by June of 2024, just great performance across the board. Okay. On guidance, just a few details on guidance, you saw the increase to guidance we are reaffirming our full-year organic growth midpoint and increasing our margin and our earnings per share expectations for the year."", ""Our reported sales growth for the year is forecasted to be in the range of 3% to 5% or roughly 4% at the midpoint and they are modeled 49% first half 51% second half. In respect to organic growth, we are raising the aerospace organic growth midpoint by 200 basis points to 12% for the full year. We are also raising the international organic growth midpoint by 100 basis points to minus 2%. That's slightly better than what we gave you last quarter. Those increases are offset by a decrease in the North American organic growth midpoint by 200 basis points to minus 1.5%. Full year organic growth for the entire company remains the same as last quarter at plus 1.5%. Moving on to margins, adjusted segment operating margin guidance is being raised to 24.3% at the midpoint that's up 70 basis points from prior guidance."", ""And if you look at it on a year-over-year basis that would be 140 basis points of margin expansion versus prior year. Meggitt synergies we talked a lot of that, we're moving that to $200 million. Corporate G&A interest and other are relatively unchanged from our prior guide. Tax raised, tweaked just a little bit. We expect the full year to be 22.5% that's really based on the performance in the first half. We expect the second half to be 23.7% from a tax rate perspective. Full year as reported earnings per share increased to $20.30 and full year adjusted earnings per share has increased to $24.20 both of those are at the midpoint. And finally for FY2024 Q3, adjusted earnings per share we expect that to be $6 even at the midpoint. And as usual, we've included some more specifics in the appendix."", ""So, that's it on the increase to guide. Jenny, I will hand it back to you, and ask everyone to move to Slide 15."", ""Jennifer A. Parmentier: Thank you, Todd. A few key messages to close this out. Q2, as we stated many times, was an exceptional quarter that closed a strong first half. We'll continue to drive positive results and accelerate our performance using the Win Strategy. Our portfolio and strengthened customer value proposition, along with growth from secular trends, will deliver organic growth of 4% to 6% over the cycle. We remain committed to our FY ‘27 targets of approximately $30 earnings per share and greater than $3.5 billion free cash flow. We expect another year of record performance and we have a very promising future ahead of us. We look forward to talking to you about our promising future at our Investor Meeting on May 16, of this year. Back to you, Todd."", ""Todd M. Leombruno: Okay.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So while Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Monster Beverage is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.24 = US$1.9b ÷ (US$9.3b - US$1.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Thus, Monster Beverage has an ROCE of 24%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Beverage industry average of 15%."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Monster Beverage ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for Monster Beverage compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Monster Beverage here  for free."", ""In terms of Monster Beverage's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 30% where it was five years ago. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run."", ""In summary, despite lower returns in the short term, we're encouraged to see that Monster Beverage is reinvesting for growth and has higher sales as a result. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 91% to shareholders over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we would look further into this stock to make sure the other metrics justify the positive view."", ""On a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for Monster Beverage  that we think you should be aware of."", 'High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Roper Technologies reported US$6.2b in revenue, roughly in line with analyst forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$12.89 beat expectations, being 6.2% higher than what the analysts expected. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual.

There are some variant perceptions on Roper Technologies, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$679 and the most bearish at US$454 per share. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure."", ""Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. The analysts are definitely expecting Roper Technologies' growth to accelerate, with the forecast 11% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 2.6% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 12% annually. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Roper Technologies is expected to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry."", ""The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. There was also an upgrade to revenue estimates, although as we saw earlier, forecast growth is only expected to be about the same as the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$586, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets."", ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Roper Technologies going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.."", ""It might also be worth considering whether Roper Technologies' debt load is appropriate, using our debt analysis tools  on the Simply Wall St platform, here."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Revenues were US$20b, approximately in line with whatthe analysts expected, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$10.39, an impressive 29% ahead of estimates. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results."", ' View our latest analysis for Aptiv ', ""Following the latest results, Aptiv's 20 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$21.5b in 2024. This would be an okay 7.2% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are expected to plummet 58% to US$4.31 in the same period. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$21.7b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$4.69 in 2024. The analysts seem to have become a little more negative on the business after the latest results, given the minor downgrade to their earnings per share numbers for next year."", ""It might be a surprise to learn that the consensus price target was broadly unchanged at US$109, with the analysts clearly implying that the forecast decline in earnings is not expected to have much of an impact on valuation. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. There are some variant perceptions on Aptiv, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$155 and the most bearish at US$69.00 per share. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business."", ""Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Aptiv'shistorical trends, as the 7.2% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 is roughly in line with the 7.8% annual growth over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 10% per year.

These solid results supported an annual median return of 10.0%, according to the Northern Trust Canada Universe.', 'The final quarter of 2023 started on a weak note as heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East in early October caused financial markets concern. Notwithstanding the uncertainty created by these conflicts, markets welcomed news from monetary policymakers as many central banks pivoted their policy stance to a pause mode as inflation figures continued to soften relative to the highs witnessed earlier this year. Despite a slow start to the period, positive economic fundamentals combined with the shift in monetary narrative enabled equity markets to close the quarter on solid footing. As stocks finished on a high note, the bond market also reacted favorably to the monetary policy outlook as yields started a descent, allowing bond returns to regain strength and conclude the quarter, and the year in positive territory.', '""This past quarter and year were undoubtedly a period enfolded in a blanket of volatility. Notwithstanding the waves of uncertainty throughout the year, a focus on geopolitical and economic trends has been paramount for pension plans. As financial markets turned their attention to economic data driving their underlying pulse and pace, plan sponsors have increasingly adopted complex asset strategies that enhance portfolio diversification and drive long term sustainability of their investment programs. Understanding and navigating the current and future trends is a key building block to healthy retirement plans,"" said Katie Pries, President and CEO of Northern Trust Canada.', 'The Northern Trust Canada universe tracks the performance of Canadian institutional defined benefit plans that subscribe to performance measurement services as part of Northern Trust’s institutional investor asset servicing solutions.', 'The fourth quarter presented challenges early on as geopolitical tensions rapidly escalated in the Middle East, cascading uncertainty across financial markets. Although these tensions lingered throughout the period, global markets shifted focus to the decelerating trend in inflation and the pausing of interest rate hikes by major central banks. Favorable macro-economic data coupled with a pivot in monetary tone set the stage for robust returns generated by both stocks and bonds for the period.', 'Canadian Equities, as measured by the S&P/TSX Composite Index, advanced 8.1% for the quarter and 11.8% for the year. The Information Technology sector led performance for the quarter and the full year. The Energy sector posted the weakest performance for the quarter, while the Communication Services and Materials sectors were the laggards for the year.', 'U.S. Equities, as measured by the S&P 500 Index, witnessed an 8.9% gain in CAD for the quarter and an impressive 22.9% in CAD for the year. The Real Estate and Information Technology sectors stood out as the strongest performers for the quarter, while Energy was the weakest. Information Technology and Communication Services observed the strongest gains for the year, while the Utilities sector was the most notable laggard for the period.', 'International developed markets, as measured by the MSCI EAFE Index, returned 7.7% in CAD for the quarter and 15.7% in CAD for the year. All sectors generated positive returns for the quarter, except the Energy Sector which posted a decline for the period. The full year witnessed gains across all sectors, with the Information Technology and Industrials sectors being the top performers.', 'The MSCI Emerging Markets Index rose 5.3% in CAD for the quarter and 7.3% return in CAD for the year. Most sectors generated positive returns for both the quarter and the year, led by the Information Technology sector for both periods. The Real Estate sector witnessed the weakest performance for the quarter and the year.', 'The Canadian economy started to feel the effects of tighter monetary policy as noted in a recent GDP figure highlighting a contraction for the third quarter. However, the higher interest rate environment has also eased inflationary pressures as observed by the decline in inflation relative to the prior quarter and year. The unemployment rate concluded the period at 5.8%, up from 5.0% a year ago. Labor market gains witnessed signs of slowing as jobs growth softened in the second half of the year.', 'The U.S. economy continued to show signs of resilience as noted in recent GDP figures. The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) kept the Federal Funds Target Rate at 5.25% - 5.50% through the third quarter. Although the Fed continues to monitor its progress on inflation, in December its broader messaging indicated that policy members expect a pivot to lower rates in 2024.', 'International markets also witnessed a move by central banks to keep interest rates steady during the quarter. The European Central Bank (ECB) moved to a wait and watch mode and the Bank of England (BOE) also kept rates steady at 5.25% despite ongoing inflationary pressures. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) maintained its key short term interest rate of -0.10%, and the 10-year bond yield at around 0%, though removing the 0.5% official cap and maintaining a loose upper band of 1.0%, during the quarter.', 'Emerging Markets witnessed modest returns for the quarter, lagging their developed market counterparts. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) kept interest rates steady for the quarter, with their one-year loan prime rate at 3.45%. The Reserve Bank of India maintained its interest rates for the quarter, meanwhile Brazil cut interest rates in December by 50 basis points to 11.75%.', 'The Bank of Canada (BoC) held interest rates steady at 5.0% during the quarter, marking a 22-year high. The BoC governor agreed the Canadian economy is showing balance in supply and demand and further rate hikes might not be warranted. However, the outlook for inflation still concerns policy makers and they are ""prepared to raise the policy rate further if needed.""', 'The Canadian Fixed Income market, as measured by the FTSE Canada Universe Bond Index, advanced 8.3% for the quarter and 6.7% for the year. Provincial bonds outperformed Corporate and Federal bonds for the quarter, while Corporate bonds were the top performer for the year.

These figures underscore the company's financial resilience and strategic positioning in a competitive industry."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Sign with GE.', ""Robust Diagnostics Segment: Hologic Inc (NASDAQ:HOLX) has capitalized on the increased demand for diagnostics amid the pandemic, with its diagnostics segment accounting for 60% of total sales. This surge is a testament to the company's agility in responding to market needs and its strong portfolio of molecular diagnostic assays and advanced instrumentation systems.

Please go ahead."", ""Ryan Simon: Thank you, Synthia. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer and Essex Mitchell, our Chief Operating Officer. Our first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them as well as an updated corporate presentation. And a replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied."", 'Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also, during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are, one, organic revenue, which we define as revenue excluding the divested businesses and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than one year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued products in Diagnostics; finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted.', ""Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO."", 'Steve MacMillan: Thank you, Ryan. And good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. For the quarter, total revenue was $1.01 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.98. Both revenue and EPS came in above the high end of our guidance. Before diving into our results, it is important to view our Q1 growth performance in proper perspective. Simply put, our first two quarters of fiscal ‘24 face incredibly difficult comps. Despite Q1 ‘24 having four fewer selling days compared to the prior year, and even against a prior year Molecular Diagnostics ex-COVID revenue growth of 24 .5%, and a Surgical revenue growth rate of nearly 15%, we grew total organic revenue, ex-COVID, a solid 5.2%.', ""Even more impressive, when adjusting four fewer selling days, our Q1 results stand taller. On an adjusted basis, we estimate the total company organic revenue growth ex-COVID was in the high single digits for the period. These are incredibly strong results against challenging comps as we continue to perform exceptionally well against our 5% to 7% percent ex-COVID long-term target. We continue to showcase our durability and broad strength across our divisions, both delivering on our short-term guidance and maintaining our long-term targets. Keep in mind that our long-term revenue targets are more impressive today, given we are growing off a much larger base than we originally contemplated. As we've said before, you can count on us to deliver."", ""During our call today, we will focus on building upon our messaging from the JPMorgan conference three weeks ago. During our presentation, we highlighted that we are a new Hologic bigger, faster, stronger, and poised for continued success. As part of our discussion, Essex will share more insights about our high confidence in our future success. He will also shed light on what we view as underappreciated elements of our growth strategy that are helpful to fully recognize the potential of our business. Before then turning the call over to Karleen to discuss our detailed financial results, we will share reflections from our participation at the World Economic Forum in Davos. While we continue to make progress elevating women's health, it is clear we still have a long way to go."", ""Starting with our meetings at JPMorgan, we realize there are two camps of investors. There is one camp that understands our transformation and recognizes the drivers powering our current results and future growth potential. At the same time, there is another camp that, quite frankly, does not. That said, we certainly appreciate the complexity. Over the past three years, there have been many moving pieces clouding the narrative of the force we've become. From revenue still normalizing following the ups and downs of COVID, to moving past semiconductor chip supply challenges, to selling days dynamics, only naming a few, each has contributed to irregular comps that may be difficult to interpret, and also challenging tomorrow. We appreciate that each represents a layer of complexity that must be pulled back to fully appreciate the underlying strength of our business."", ""Looking beyond the quarterly nuances, our steady performance over time really shines. Above all, we are bigger, faster, stronger, and poised for further growth. We are a durable and diversified growth company with disciplined operations, peer group leading margins, an exceptionally strong balance sheet, and above all, a talented and engaged employee workforce. We are poised to continue to drive top-line growth while growing the bottom line even faster. To shed more light on what gives us high confidence in our future, I'll pass it over to Essex."", ""Essex Mitchell: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As we've commented over the past several quarters, we have dramatically transformed our business since 2019 through the challenges of the pandemic. More recently, as we move further away from the peaks of COVID testing and prevalence, we have posted exceptional ex-COVID results. These results back up our claim that we are much more than a COVID story, and without doubt build for the long term. At the same time, as Steve mentioned, there is a lot to unpack to fully understand our business. Many recognize that we are a new Hologic compared to where we were in fiscal 2018. Since then, we've grown our Molecular Diagnostics business approximately 80%, our Breast business nearly 10% and our Surgical business nearly 40%."", ""Yet there are still some on the fence and uncertain of our future growth potential. As some of our peers have also performed well over this time period, it's not easy to see the throughway. The underlying assumption is that winner must be exclusively taking share. In reality, there was much more to it. In addition to competing and taking share, Hologic growth is centered on innovation, and making sure. We then drive this innovation to commercial execution by leveraging our world class sales teams. As we are positioned today, our future growth is much less about hand to hand combat in the trenches of the markets where we operate. Instead, our growth is derived from growing and expanding market through education, awareness, innovative new products, and tapping into under penetrated markets."", 'As an example, our three largest revenue product lines launched in 2019, excluding COVID are BV, CV/TV, Biotheranostics and Fluent. These three lines alone collectively delivered over 300 million in revenue in 2023. That was essentially nonexistent to start 2019. Moreover, each product line falls into one or more of our market creating strategies, and each is still in their earlier stages of growth. Similarly, outside of the top three, we have a number of other product lines and new since 2019 which could each individually represent $100 million revenue opportunities over time. And these lines are also still in their early innings of growth. To highlight a few are respiratory assays, GYN scopes, and laparoscopic surgical portfolio, each delivered to double digit growth rates for fiscal ‘23.', ""On top of our market expansion activity, we continue to drive further growth by leveraging our large installs in user bases of core products in each division. Through the Panther, our gantry and our hysteroscopic surgical portfolio, we have incredibly deep customer relationships in each of our unique channels. Post COVID, our call points around the world are stronger than ever. Customers associate Hologic with industry leading differentiated technologies, ongoing innovation, best-in-class workflow and automation solutions. Moreover, our strong reputation as leaders and champions for Women's Health continues to open doors. Earning this advantage provide us a unique opportunity to supercharge growth from products introduced into our channel. While there are many out there that claim to be winners, even in categories, we continue to lead year-over-year, we are extremely confident in our ability to carve out a great opportunity for growth."", 'Similarly, we are equally confident in our demonstrated ability to gain and maintain market share across our core product lines. With our core businesses, incredibly healthy, and many of our growth driving products still in early innings. All-in, we believe we are well positioned for the future and well positioned to maintain our strong performance for the years to come. Steve?', ""Steve MacMillan: Thank you, Essex. To close out the discussion of our growth prospects. While we continue to make significant progress outside of the US, we still have tremendous opportunity to grow and build a much greater presence internationally. Shifting gears before turning the call over to Karleen, we'd like to share reflections from our time at the World Economic Forum in Davos. For a third year in a row we had the opportunity to participate at the forum, where we presented the results of our third annual Hologic Global Women's Health Index. The Index, which is the largest study of its kind, examining the overall state of women's health and wellbeing continues to generate tremendous support from major organizations dedicated to improving women's health."", ""As we've said before, over time, we believe the Index may be the single greatest contribution to the world that we make at Hologic. This year's results show that we all need to stand behind women more than ever. The harsh reality is that women's health globally has not only stagnated over the past year, but is sadly moving in the wrong direction. The data shows that only 11% of women were screened for cancer and only 10% for STIs. Billions of women are not being screened, this must change. And we have a tremendous opportunity to lead the way with our women's health portfolio. The key takeaway here is that in many ways, our markets are still in the early innings of reaching their potential. As we look ahead, we are even more inspired to live into our purpose, passion, and promise."", ""We continue to believe and we have proven that we can drive results through our unwavering commitment to women's health. Our strong results come from our strong purpose. And finally, in late breaking news, we are incredibly proud to announce that just last night, our new Genius Digital Diagnostic system, with the Genius Cervical AI algorithm received clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration. This accomplishment is only made possible by the creativity, focus and dedication of our outstanding Diagnostics team. Continuing to trailblaze our path. Our system is the first and only FDA cleared digital cytology system that combines deep learning based AI with advanced imaging technology. It can help more accurately detect cervical cancer, improve psychology workflow, and ultimately enhance patient care."", 'We continue to deliver and at a time when women need it most. With that, let me hand the call over to Karleen.', 'Karleen Oberton: Thank you, Steve. And good afternoon, everyone. And congratulations again to our Diagnostics team. In my statements, today, I will provide an overview of our divisional revenue results, and walk down our income statement that highlights the broad based strong performance across our business. I will also touch on a few additional key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal ‘24 in the full year. Jumping right in, we are pleased to share that our first quarter financial performance was strong. We exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom line. Total revenue came in at $1.013 billion, beating the midpoint of our guidance by about $40 million. As Steve mentioned, despite four fewer selling days in the quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth of 5.2% excluding the impact of COVID in line with our long term revenue growth target of 5% to 7%.', 'In addition, non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.98, exceeding the high end of our guidance. Overall, we continue to deliver robust performance on both the top and bottom lines. Before moving to our divisional results, we again want to emphasize that our balance sheet and willingness to deploy capital remain a core strength of our business in a macroenvironment that remains dynamic. As an example, in our first quarter, we initiated a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program, we purchased an additional $150 million of our stock and also pay down $250 million of floating rate debt with a cash balance of $1.9 billion, a leverage ratio well below our target range, and roughly $350 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.', 'We have significant firepower and flexibility to deploy further capital should the opportunity arise. Turning to our divisional results. In Diagnostics, first quarter revenue of $447.8 million declined 20.6%. Excluding COVID assay and related ancillary revenue, Diagnostics revenue declined 0.9%. Yet adjusted for selling days we estimate we grew mid-single digits compared to the prior year. As a reminder, Q1 ‘23 was a very strong quarter for Diagnostics, boasting 15.8% growth ex- COVID and Molecular Diagnostics 24.5% growth ex-COVID. And without a doubt, our Q1 ‘24 results were impacted by four fewer selling days compared to the prior year. Within Diagnostics, our molecular business continues to drive the divisions results, it will bring growth of 1.9% ex-COVID or mid to high single digits when adjusted for the impact of fewer selling days.', ""We continue to see underlying strength and BV, CV/TV which grew more than 20% in the quarter, and it's still in its early innings of adoption by our customers. More than 95% of our BV, CV/TV revenue is derived in the US, representing incredible longer term opportunity internationally. In addition, non-COVID respiratory revenue delivered ahead of our expectations. As we experienced stronger than anticipated demand for our flu, RSV, and 4-Plex assays. Our responding with published CDC data on respiratory virus positivity. Sales ramped up and in the final weeks of the quarter. Finally Biotheranostics remains a positive driver of growth for our molecular business, and delivered accretive revenue performance in the period. Now moving to Breast Health, total first quarter revenue of $377.7 million increased 12.2% showcasing solid double digit growth."", 'Demand for our gantries remains robust and our interventional business also delivered a strong quarter. In our gantry business, we continue to benefit from a strong cadence of orders. And our elevated backlog continues to give us high confidence in the performance of this business going forward. Finally, as a reminder, Q1 ‘23 results were impacted by constrained supply. In interventional, we continue to see strong performance from our Brevera needles, as well as from our 2-Mark markers used for marking biopsy sites in suspicious lesions and pressed tissue. Leveraging strong performance in the quarter, we believe our Breast health franchise remains well positioned to deliver on its financial targets in fiscal ‘24. Continuing next to Surgical, our first quarter revenue of $162.2 million increased 4.6% or high single digits when adjusted for selling days.', ""The divisions growth continues to be fueled by MyoSure and the Related fluid system, with an increasing contribution from our laparoscopic portfolio. As anticipated, NovaSure declined in Q1 as we lapped the selling price contribution from the products V5 extension introduced just before fiscal ‘23. And finally, in our Skeletal business, first quarter revenue of $25.4 million declined 5.6% from lower capital placement and upgrades. Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the first quarter. Gross margin of 60.8% was driven primarily by strong performance in our base business and higher than expected COVID revenues, which carries a favorable impact to our margin. However, as anticipated, our gross margin result remains temporarily depressed due to the ongoing amortization of semiconductor chips purchased at higher costs during the chip supply headwind."", 'As we continue to deploy gantries, we are moving farther away from this high priced inventory. And as a result, we expect margins to continue to benefit from this inventory cycling as we progress through the year. Shifting to operating expenses, total operating expenses of $327.3 million in the first quarter decreased by 3.6%. This decrease in the period was driven by lower marketing spend, lower cost from fewer days and less expense due to the recently divested SSI business. For Q1 ’23, this translates to a 28.5% operating margin in line with our expectations. While we continue to deliver a peer group leading operating margins, we continue to exercise operational discipline and continuously seek to improve where it makes sense for our business.', ""Below operating income, other income net represented a gain in our fiscal first quarter. As expected, we benefited from elevated cash balance and high interest rates, even though we deployed significant cash in the quarter. Finally, our tax rate in Q1 was 19.75% as expected. Moving on from the P&L, cash flow from operations was $220 million in the first quarter. In addition, as previously mentioned, during Q1 we repurchased 2.2 million shares for $150 million. This activity was above and beyond initiating a $500 million ASR showcasing our high confidence in our business and willingness to bet on ourselves, as well as our ongoing strategy to deploy capital. Now let's move on to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal ‘24."", 'For our fiscal Q2 ‘24, we are expecting total revenue in the range of %990 million to $1.01 billion and EPS of $0.95 to $1. For the full year ’24, our guidance assumes revenue of $3.99 billion to $4.065 billion and EPS of $3.97 to $4.12. With respect to foreign exchange, we are assuming an FX tailwind of $2 million for Q2 and $12 million for fiscal ‘24. Much of this tailwind was realized in Q1 and therefore we estimate that foreign exchange will remain neutral to marginally favorable throughout the remainder of the year. Turning to our divisions, we want to reiterate that we expect each business to grow at least 5% to 7% for the full fiscal ‘24, excluding the impact of COVID. Starting with Diagnostics, we expect the business to grow within our 5% to 7% long term framework for the remainder of fiscal ‘24.', 'While performance was below this level on Q1, primarily due to the impact of fewer selling days compared to the prior year period, we expect the division to return to more normal growth in Q2, and for the remainder of our fiscal year. We expect improving utilization and menu expansion on the Panther coupled with ongoing contributions from Biotheranostics to continue to drive molecular growth, losing out on non-COVID Diagnostics, we expect blood revenue of approximately $7 million in Q2, and $30 million for the year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be approximately $20 million in the second quarter of ‘24 and $60 million for the full year. COVID related items are expected to be slightly less than $30 million in the second quarter, and approximately $105 million for the full year fiscal ‘24.', ""Moving to Breast health, we continue to expect fiscal ‘24 to showcase strong demand for our portfolio products and services. While moving on it's important to understand the top dynamics that will impact the Breast business through fiscal ‘24. As previously noted, Q1 ‘23 with a softer comp due to shift supply constraints. As a reminder in Q2 ‘23, we delivered a strong quarter gantry placement to meet pent-up customer demand during these earlier days of chip supply recovery. And deliveries in Q3 and Q4 of ’23 were both lower than Q2. We expect this dynamic to result in a lower Breast health year-over-year growth rate in Q2 that will improve in the back half of fiscal ’24. For the full year, we continue to expect to deliver more gantries in fiscal ‘24 than in ’23 as we move further from the chip supply headwinds, while maintaining excellent demand visibility."", 'Finally, in Surgical, we anticipate our full year fiscal ‘24 revenue growth to be at the high end of our 5% to 7% long term target. Although impacted by fewer selling days, Q1 started the year strong and we expect the business to perform well in Q2 in the remainder of the fiscal year. Moving next to margins, our guidance assumes a cadence of improvement throughout fiscal ’24 for both gross margin and operating margin. For gross margin, we anticipate Q2 levels similar to Q1 exiting the fiscal year in the low 60s. As well, our guidance assumes Q2 operating margins approaching 30% with the Q4 ‘24 exit rate around 31%. Continuing down the P&L, we expect Q2 operating expenses to step down from Q1. As a reminder, Q1 is typically our highest spend quarter seasonally.', 'As we kickoff the fiscal year with our internal global sales meetings, and major trade show events such as RSNA. For the balance of the year, we anticipate quarterly operating expenses to be about $300 million to $310 million. Although operating income, we estimate fiscal ‘24 other income net to be an expense of approximately $10 million in Q2 and an expense between $30 million to $50 million for the full year. Our current guidance assumes an increase in interest income relative to our previous guide, as we expect to have a higher cash balance throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75%. And diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 239 million for the full year.', ""To conclude Q1 was a strong quarter across each of our businesses and sets us up nicely for the rest of the year. As we close Q1, we move forward to Q2 in fiscal ‘24 with good momentum and as always remain focused on advancing women's health around the world while delivering on our promises and commitments to our shareholders, employees, customers and patients around the world. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions."", 'See also 12 Highest Rated Mattresses Under $1000 and 20 Most Consumed Beverages in the World.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

The off-price retailer has big growth plans ahead of it and is benefiting today from financially concerned customers trading down to its stores. But longer term, it's still focusing hard on selling more off-price goods to more customers."", ""Here's what you need to know."", ""Like peers Ross Stores and TJX Companies, Burlington sells low-cost items to a core base of customers looking for deals. More recently, however, the mix of customers for this retailer has shifted somewhat. That's because wealthier consumers worried about the economy have started to cut back on their spending. Going to a Burlington store is one of the ways they're doing that."", ""The evidence comes from the company, which has explained that it's selling more recognizable brands at higher prices. The target for those products is wealthier customers, and it shows that the company's buyers have been able to pivot quickly to address the changes taking shape at the consumer level."", ""This is clearly good, but it pulls the company away from its core operations, which is selling off-price goods. That's what brings in core customers, the ones that will stick around after economic concerns subside."", 'Ross Stores, for example, has had its buyers out looking for ways to offer the most compelling value to its customers across the entire store. TJX, meanwhile, has been touting its experienced buyers and their ability to excite customers with an ever-changing collection of off-price merchandise.', ""The big takeaway here isn't that Burlington is stepping away from the core of its success, but that trade-down customers are potentially a temporary benefit."", ""That's why it is important to note two trends for Burlington.

Although it probably won't be exact, 100 a year or so is what investors should expect."", 'At first, new stores are probably going to be a slight headwind, given that new stores will probably pull some customers away from existing locations. But over time, the company expects that headwind to subside as new stores start drawing in their own set of customers. The goal is to have more modern stores in busier locations.', 'That, however, is going to require living up to a core competence, which is selling a desirable collection of off-price goods at attractive prices. While TJX has touted the experience of its buyers and Ross discusses its great value across its entire store, Burlington has been talking about its efforts to strengthen its merchandising capabilities and increasing flexibility.', ""In fact, the ability to source more well-known brands to sell to trade-down customers is an example of Burlington's ability to adjust quickly. The key will be to see if it can shift quickly again when those customers start trading back up and the retailer needs to refocus on selling off-price to its core customer."", 'The interesting thing on Wall Street is that Burlington shares remain well below recent highs while Ross and TJX are both back at their highs. That suggests there could still be an opportunity for investors to buy Burlington even after its outsize rally at the end of 2023. But the key will be watching how well it executes on its store opening and merchandising plan, with the goal of off-price excellence to attract core customers.', ""Burlington's price-to-sales ratio has gone from roughly in line with TJX and Ross to well below those peers. Given the company's store growth plans, there's a reason to think there's a long-term opportunity here. And that will be more compelling if the company's buyers live up to its off-price focus, as is the goal. If you're looking at off-price retailers, Burlington is probably worth a deep dive even after the big share-price rally."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Burlington Stores right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Burlington Stores, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Burlington Stores wasn't one of them.

What do the oil giants’ growth suggest about the oil sector and overall production (CL=F, BZ=F)? Truist Securities Managing Director Energy Neal Dingmann joins Yahoo Finance Live to weigh in on factors that are contributing to both companies’ success.', '“What it shows is that their [Chevron and Exxon] production is phenomenal,” Dingmann states, who expects impressive shareholder returns. “I don’t know many other sectors where you can find companies this large, and get this kind of shareholder return.”', 'Both Chevron and Exxon do not appear to be as impacted by the geopolitical crises in the Red Sea due to the focus production from the Permian Basis, according to Dingmann.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Eyek Ntekim"", 'SEANA SMITH: All right, Exxon and Chevron reporting better than expected earnings for the most recent quarters as the two oil giants double down on fossil fuels. Well, those recent bets are paying off. When you take a look at those annual numbers, both companies reporting their second highest annual profits in a decade.', ""We want to bring in Neil Dingmann. He's a Truist Securities Managing Director of Energy Research. Neil, it's great to have you here. So your first take at these results that we're getting from both Chevron and Exxon and their ability to do this at a time that hasn't exactly been as bullish for crude prices as what we saw back in 2022."", ""NEIL DINGMANN: Yeah. Thanks for having me, Seana. I think what it shows is their production is phenomenal for both not only in the Permian-- let's just look at Exxon, for instance, that just reported-- or just had their call a minute ago. Permian production and Guyana production continues to set records quarter after quarter. So while some other EMPs are maintaining flat production, these big companies continue to show that even with flattish pricing, maybe a little bit lower pricing, they can continue to generate record production, which is generating record earnings or near-record earnings and record cash flow, resulting in just, to me, phenomenal shareholder return."", 'BRAD SMITH: And so for shareholders right now that are trying to get their best read on the state of oil coming off of both the reports from Exxon as well as from Chevron, how would you kind of encapsulate that right now?', ""NEIL DINGMANN: It's a good question. But I think what I would suggest is anybody holding it, you can expect, one, not only cash flow and earnings to likely go up about another 5% this year, but, along with that, it's interesting-- I mean, look, both these companies are paying out about a 4% dividend, which I think is quite good. And on top of that, both are even buying back more shares on an absolute level than what they even pay out on dividends."", ""So to me, the shareholder return is still the story. I don't know many other sectors where you can find companies this large and get this kind of shareholder return."", 'SEANA SMITH: Neil, when we talk about the disruption in the Red Sea, the implications or the impact that is having on some oil giants around the globe, what does it mean, in particular, here for Chevron and Exxon?', 'NEIL DINGMANN: Well, I think it\'s a good question. I think that\'s why both these companies continue to lean very heavily on the Permian. I think they made the decision a year, maybe even a couple of years ago, to really focus-- you have Exxon now that bought Pioneer. That\'s going to close next quarter. Even I don\'t want to say ""double down,"" but it\'s going to add a tremendous amount of Permian production. So I think it\'s exactly what you\'re saying. I think there\'s going to continue to be geopolitical risk, international, and it\'s why these companies continue to focus predominantly on the lower 48 for growth.', 'BRAD SMITH: And so with that in mind, should we still continue to be concerned more geopolitically, not just about conflict that might break out, but also about production considerations as well and how that flows through to both of these companies?', ""NEIL DINGMANN: It's interesting. I actually asked Darren Woods that this morning on the Q&A. And his comment was-- or his answer was that he's going to continue to do what's best for the company. So while there might be some pushback if US companies start to grow too much, I think still, most importantly, is what these companies are able to throw off in cash flow. And you know, again, the biggest driver is going to continue to be the Permian and Guyana. And I think you're going to see-- continue to see both of those pushed higher."", ""SEANA SMITH: When it comes to lots of questions just about what the price of crude is going to look like-- I'm not asking you to forecast how high or maybe the pressure that we're going to see in crude, but in terms of the ability to navigate, when you take a name like Chevron and stack it up against Exxon, who do you think is better positioned to weather some of those potential challenges here, at least in the short-term?"", ""NEIL DINGMANN: I think both the, I would call it short-term and long-term, I think Exxon. And the simple reason is now, by adding that Pioneer, I think they have the dominant US position, not only above Chevron, but above any other company out there. So I just think they're phenomenally positioned."", ""I don't see anybody else with a better asset position, better inventory depth, all those kind of things. So I just have more confidence that Exxon can continue to ramp their production at this pace for a longer period given the quality of their inventory."", ""BRAD SMITH: Is there one company that is best positioned, from your perspective, to weather some of the political punching bag nature that may assume itself as we get towards the general election and we hear talks of even more and more discussion and debate around clean energy, and where the shifts are actually being made, where companies are not doing their part-- and is there one that's actually kind of taking significant strides well enough in order to insulate themselves from that conversation?"", ""NEIL DINGMANN: I mean, they're both doing it to some degree. It's a good question, Brad. And I think, though, for instance, this morning, a lot of the call today on Exxon was around carbon capture, was around their lithium project that, by 2027, will be enough-- produce enough lithium to support one million electric vehicles."", ""So, look, I think fossil fuels, we know, is going to continue to be the dominant driver for both these companies. So even all those things they're doing outside, I think they're still going to take some heat, especially given the amount of growth that they're both showing on the fossil fuel side."", 'BRAD SMITH: Neil, great to have you on. And thanks for giving us some of the insights from the call this morning. Neil Dingmann, who is the Truist Securities Managing Director of Energy Research. Appreciate it.', 'NEIL DINGMANN: Thank you.']"

To add to the woes, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller indicated that the easing of monetary policy might come slower than anticipated, although the Fed had earlier pledged to cut interest rates several times in 2024 owing to a slowdown in inflation in the later stages of 2023. The recent commentaries that appeared in stark contrast apparently stirred investor nerves.However, the markets recovered sharply on the following day with solid quarterly earnings from blue-chip firms like Apple, Meta and Amazon. The recent GDP data further revealed that the U.S. economy grew at 3.3% in the fourth quarter compared with broad-based expectations of a 2% rise. This portrays continued economic resiliency despite turbulent geopolitical conditions in the Middle East.The December non-farm payrolls report also showed that the jobless rate held steady at 3.7%, while the economy added 216,000 jobs compared with 173,000 revised job additions in November, signifying economic strength. However, the recent Fed commentaries portray that the markets need to brace for intense volatility owing to tempered expectations.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. NRG Energy, Inc. NRG, Suzano S.A. SUZ, Arch Resources, Inc. ARCH, Cboe Global Markets, Inc. CBOE and Jabil Inc. JBL are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.', 'ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.', ""In order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.\xa0 \xa0Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 15 stocks that qualified the screening:NRG Energy: Headquarters in Houston, TX, NRG Energy is engaged in the production, sale and delivery of energy and energy products and services to residential, industrial and commercial consumers in major competitive power markets in the United States.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments."", ""While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns."", 'The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation in Focus', ""Headquartered in New York, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 6.63% so far this year. The company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.42 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.03%. This compares to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.68% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.61%."", ""Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.68 is up 6.3% from last year. Over the last 5 years, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.67%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's payout ratio is 33%, which means it paid out 33% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend."", 'Looking at this fiscal year, BK expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $5.21 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 3.17%.', 'Bottom Line', 'From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.', ""High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, BK presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy)."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Well, those recent bets are paying off. When you take a look at those annual numbers, both companies reporting their second highest annual profits in a decade.', ""We want to bring in Neil Dingmann. He's a Truist Securities Managing Director of Energy Research. Neil, it's great to have you here. So your first take at these results that we're getting from both Chevron and Exxon and their ability to do this at a time that hasn't exactly been as bullish for crude prices as what we saw back in 2022."", ""NEIL DINGMANN: Yeah. Thanks for having me, Seana. I think what it shows is their production is phenomenal for both not only in the Permian-- let's just look at Exxon, for instance, that just reported-- or just had their call a minute ago. Permian production and Guyana production continues to set records quarter after quarter. So while some other EMPs are maintaining flat production, these big companies continue to show that even with flattish pricing, maybe a little bit lower pricing, they can continue to generate record production, which is generating record earnings or near-record earnings and record cash flow, resulting in just, to me, phenomenal shareholder return."", 'BRAD SMITH: And so for shareholders right now that are trying to get their best read on the state of oil coming off of both the reports from Exxon as well as from Chevron, how would you kind of encapsulate that right now?', ""NEIL DINGMANN: It's a good question. But I think what I would suggest is anybody holding it, you can expect, one, not only cash flow and earnings to likely go up about another 5% this year, but, along with that, it's interesting-- I mean, look, both these companies are paying out about a 4% dividend, which I think is quite good. And on top of that, both are even buying back more shares on an absolute level than what they even pay out on dividends."", ""So to me, the shareholder return is still the story. I don't know many other sectors where you can find companies this large and get this kind of shareholder return."", 'SEANA SMITH: Neil, when we talk about the disruption in the Red Sea, the implications or the impact that is having on some oil giants around the globe, what does it mean, in particular, here for Chevron and Exxon?', 'NEIL DINGMANN: Well, I think it\'s a good question. I think that\'s why both these companies continue to lean very heavily on the Permian. I think they made the decision a year, maybe even a couple of years ago, to really focus-- you have Exxon now that bought Pioneer. That\'s going to close next quarter. Even I don\'t want to say ""double down,"" but it\'s going to add a tremendous amount of Permian production. So I think it\'s exactly what you\'re saying. I think there\'s going to continue to be geopolitical risk, international, and it\'s why these companies continue to focus predominantly on the lower 48 for growth.', 'BRAD SMITH: And so with that in mind, should we still continue to be concerned more geopolitically, not just about conflict that might break out, but also about production considerations as well and how that flows through to both of these companies?', ""NEIL DINGMANN: It's interesting. I actually asked Darren Woods that this morning on the Q&A. And his comment was-- or his answer was that he's going to continue to do what's best for the company. So while there might be some pushback if US companies start to grow too much, I think still, most importantly, is what these companies are able to throw off in cash flow. And you know, again, the biggest driver is going to continue to be the Permian and Guyana. And I think you're going to see-- continue to see both of those pushed higher."", ""SEANA SMITH: When it comes to lots of questions just about what the price of crude is going to look like-- I'm not asking you to forecast how high or maybe the pressure that we're going to see in crude, but in terms of the ability to navigate, when you take a name like Chevron and stack it up against Exxon, who do you think is better positioned to weather some of those potential challenges here, at least in the short-term?"", ""NEIL DINGMANN: I think both the, I would call it short-term and long-term, I think Exxon. And the simple reason is now, by adding that Pioneer, I think they have the dominant US position, not only above Chevron, but above any other company out there. So I just think they're phenomenally positioned."", ""I don't see anybody else with a better asset position, better inventory depth, all those kind of things. So I just have more confidence that Exxon can continue to ramp their production at this pace for a longer period given the quality of their inventory."", ""BRAD SMITH: Is there one company that is best positioned, from your perspective, to weather some of the political punching bag nature that may assume itself as we get towards the general election and we hear talks of even more and more discussion and debate around clean energy, and where the shifts are actually being made, where companies are not doing their part-- and is there one that's actually kind of taking significant strides well enough in order to insulate themselves from that conversation?"", ""NEIL DINGMANN: I mean, they're both doing it to some degree. It's a good question, Brad. And I think, though, for instance, this morning, a lot of the call today on Exxon was around carbon capture, was around their lithium project that, by 2027, will be enough-- produce enough lithium to support one million electric vehicles."", ""So, look, I think fossil fuels, we know, is going to continue to be the dominant driver for both these companies. So even all those things they're doing outside, I think they're still going to take some heat, especially given the amount of growth that they're both showing on the fossil fuel side."", 'BRAD SMITH: Neil, great to have you on. And thanks for giving us some of the insights from the call this morning. Neil Dingmann, who is the Truist Securities Managing Director of Energy Research. Appreciate it.', 'NEIL DINGMANN: Thank you.']"

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for calendar year 2023. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive, Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer, and Beth Straka, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Now, as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported full year 2023 adjusted earnings of $4.63 a share. This excludes a one-time noncash charge of $0.41 a share. You may recall that the Illinois Commerce Commission in November disallowed the construction costs for the modern service centers and facilities that we built in Illinois to improve employee safety and productivity."", ""We firmly believe that the investments were necessary and prudent, and at the appropriate time, we will appeal the decision in court. Despite the setback in Illinois, I'm pleased to report that we delivered another year of solid results on virtually every meaningful measure, from customer satisfaction to financial performance to steady execution of our capital plan. Xia Liu will provide you with more detail on our financial metrics for 2023 in just a few moments. Turning to other regulatory matters, the Wisconsin Commission approved our limited reopener filings in December, new rates are now in effect for all of our Wisconsin utilities. And in Illinois a limited rehearing has been scheduled for a portion of our safety modernization program."", ""As a reminder, the Illinois Commerce Commission ordered a pause in that program for at least one year. We've been systematically replacing old leaking cast iron pipes under the streets of Chicago. This long running project is approximately 38% complete today. We had plan to invest approximately $265 million in these safety upgrades during 2024. Given the Commission's order, we will not be carrying out the program as envisioned. We honestly do not believe that stopping the work is in the best interests of our Chicago customers. But we will have another opportunity to make our case in the coming months through this limited rehearing. In addition, the Illinois commission will open a new docket this month to examine the future of gas across the state of Illinois."", ""This review is expected to take at least one year to complete. Switching gears now, let's look at the investment needs of our broader enterprise. We continue to refine our ESG progress plan our roadmap if you will for the period 2024 through 2028. As you'd expect, we're lowering our plan capital investment in Illinois. But the bigger picture is strong and growing. And today we're increasing our five-year plan by $300 million. What was a $23.4 billion plan, the largest in our company's history, is now a five-year plan totaling $23.7 billion. The increase is focused on two categories, electric distribution to support the strong economic growth we're seeing in Wisconsin and WEC Energy's projects that are in our due diligence pipeline. That's our WEC infrastructure projects."", ""In fact, we're in the final stage now of vetting another major project for our infrastructure portfolio, a 300-megawatt solar investment for approximately $460 million. Closing and commercial operation could take place in the second quarter of this year, we'll keep you informed. Overall, the building blocks of our updated capital plan clearly support our long-term growth rate. Growth from our five-year plan on a compound average annual basis remains in the 6.5% to 7% range. As always, we're starting with the midpoint of our 2023 guidance. However, we expect earnings for 2024 to come in at or below the current consensus estimate. The reason is simple. As we redeploy capital, at least temporarily away from Illinois, the majority of the quality projects we're investing in will not be in service for the full year 2024."", 'So for this year, for 2024, we projected earnings to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.90 a share and Xia Liu will provide you with more detail in just a moment or two. One final but important point about our capital plan. As a percentage of the total enterprise, our regulated electric business will be larger five years from now than it is today. Economic development and reliability and decarbonization are driving that growth. We plan to continue our investment in the infrastructure segment as well. But five years from now, we expect the infrastructure segment will be only 6% of our asset base. And now turning to the regional economy, the unemployment rate in Wisconsin stands at 3.3%. That continues a long running trend below the national average.', ""And as we've discussed, we're seeing some really exciting developments here on the state. You've heard about Microsoft's plans in the Wisconsin Innovation Park South of Milwaukee. That investment continues to build. Microsoft has now purchased a total of 1345 acres of property, and construction is already underway on a major data center complex. Of course, Microsoft didn't alone in what we call the I-94 corridor, companies like [indiscernible] and Uline are expanding their footprints as well. For example, Uline just announced plans for a third office building in Pleasant prairie. Uline expects to complete construction by 2025, creating additional space for more than 700 workers. Uline in case you're not familiar with the name is the leading distributor of shipping, industrial and packaging materials to businesses throughout North America."", ""And just last week, West Rock a fortune 200 company that produces sustainable paper and packaging materials, announced plans to build a 587,000 square foot manufacturing facility on the former site of our Pleasant Prairie power plant. These developments highlight the strength and the potential of the Wisconsin economy and underscore the need for the investments we're outlining in our five-year ESG progress plan. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more specifics on our regulatory calendar, our capital plan, and our operational highlights. Scott, all yours."", ""Scott Lauber: Thank you, Gale. I'd like to start with some more updates on the regulatory front. First, let's review where we stand after the Wisconsin Public Service Commission's written orders this past December. The reopener filings address recovery of capital investments for certain projects going into service in 2023 and also this year. These are renewable facilities, raise generation and LNG reliability investments. The return on equity and the equity layer were not up for consideration as part of this proceeding. In the coming months, we plan to file new rate reviews in Wisconsin for test years 2025 and 2026. You heard from Gale on the latest developments in Illinois. The commission has granted us a limited rehearing, focused on our request rescore $134 million of Safety Modernization Program in 2024."", ""This mostly rates to emergency work, work that is in progress, and work driven by public entities like the City of Chicago. We expect the commission to issue an order by June 1. Now turning to our updated capital plan. We have identified $300 million of additional capital investment compared to the initial version of our five-year plan. I'll walk you through the changes, which are summarized for your reference in the slides we provided for today's call. Most notably, we have included several new investments in our energy infrastructure portfolio. We're continuing to take advantage of production tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, while providing solid returns through long-term offtake agreements. We expect these projects to add approximately $800 million to our plant."", ""And we're already on our way. Just last month, we closed on an incremental 10% ownership of the Samson solar farm now in operation in northern Texas, we now own 90% of the farm for a total investment of $280 million. And as Gale mentioned, we have another major solar project in the sights. We also plan to increase investment of Wisconsin by $300 million to better support economic development and reliability in the state. Offsetting these incremental investments, you will see a $800 million decrease in our planned spending on the Illinois gas delivery system over the five-year period. This is driven by the regulatory order we received in November. Meanwhile, we're making good progress on a number of regulated projects in support of affordable, reliable and clean energy."", ""We continue to work toward our ambitious goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At the end of 2023, we achieved a 54% reduction in carbon emissions from electric generation compared to 2005. That puts us well on our way toward an 80% reduction in target by the end of 2030, as we build our portfolio of low and no carbon generation. And the progress continues, the final panels of the Badger Hollow Solar Park are now in service completing the largest solar project in Wisconsin history. As you'll recall our Wisconsin utilities on a total of 200 megawatts of solar capacity at Badger Hollow. The facilities first phase went online in December 2121, and the second phase wrapped up at the end of 2023. In addition, our Bluff Creek LNG storage facility is now in service."", ""Liquefied natural gas provides a solution to meet peak customer demand for heating, as well as gasified needed for power generation. This storage will be necessary during extreme weather events like we experienced in mid-January. I'm also pleased to announce that we have been using renewable natural gas in our distribution system. This replaces a portion of the traditional natural gas we deliver to customers, while contributing to our methane reduction goal. Our latest pilot project with EPRI and CMBlu Energy is also underway. And as you'll recall, this is testing a long duration battery made with environmentally friendly materials. We look forward to sharing the results across the industry later this year. It's a strong start to the year our capital plan is robust, and highly executable."", ""And we continue to focus on the fundamentals of the business. With that I'll turn things back to Gale."", ""Gale Klappa: Scott, thank you very much. Now, as you may have seen, our board at its January meeting, raised the quarterly dividend to $0.835 a share. That's an increase of $0.055 a share or 7%. This will mark the 21st consecutive year that our shareholders will be rewarded with higher dividends. The increase is consistent with our policy of paying out 65% to 70% of our earnings in dividends and underscores our confidence in delivering a bright, sustainable future. One other quick note on our track record of dividend growth. We learned last week that WEC Energy is being added to S&P's high dividend Aristocrat Index. This index is made up exclusively of companies that have raised their dividends for at least 20 consecutive years. Next up Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial results, our financing plan, and our 2024 guidance. Xia?"", ""Xia Liu: Thanks Gale. Turning now to earnings. Excluding the $0.41 per share noncash impairment charge in Illinois, our 2023 adjusted earnings per share were $4.63. Our earnings package includes a year-over-year comparison of results on page 16. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operations, weather had an estimated $0.24 negative impact year-over-year. In fact, January, February and December of 2023 are the warmest on record over the past 133 years. Higher depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense added another $0.33 of negative variance. These unfavorable variances are more than offset during the year. Rate base growth contributed $0.75 of positive variance year-over-year."", ""This includes the base rate increase for our Wisconsin and Minnesota utilities, as well as the rate increase for Peoples Gas that was effective December 1, 2023. Additionally, fuel expense improved our earnings by $0.14. Lower day-to-day O&M resulted in a $0.10 improvement, and taxes and other items benefited earnings by $0.04. Remember, we originally guided our 2023 total company day-to-day O&M to be 3% to 5% higher than 2022. Throughout the year, we were able to manage to a much tighter range. Our actual 2023 total company day-to-day O&M was only six-tenths of 1% higher than 2022. Turning now to sales, you'll see the details on Page 12 of the earnings package. On a weather normal basis, retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin excluding the iron ore mine were down 1% in 2023."", ""The decrease was driven by our large commercial and industrial sales, which were down 3.3%. Meanwhile, residential and small commercial and industrial sales increased two-tenths of 1%, which were ahead of our forecasts. Our sales projections for 2024 can be found on pages 12 and 13 of the earnings package. Overall, we're projecting relatively flat electric sales year-over-year, and eight-tenths of 1% growth in gas sales year-over-year. Regarding our investment in American transmission company, earnings decreased $0.03 compared to 2022. Recall that last year, we recorded a $0.05 pickup from a resolution of MISO ROE appeals. This was partially offset by a $0.02 improvement in earnings related to additional capital investment. Earnings at our energy infrastructure segments improved $0.04 in '23 compared to 2022."", ""This was mainly driven by an increase in production tax credits. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our corporate and other segments decreased $0.29, primarily driven by an increase in interest expense. Overall, we improved our performance by $0.18 per share on an adjusted basis in 2023. Now, Gale and Scott have laid out our refreshed five-year capital plan. In light of the $300 million increase to our capital plan, we have revised our funding plan accordingly. Consistent with our previous message, we're funding this increase with an even split between debt and equity. As you can see on page 21 of the earnings package, we now expect to issue between 1.95 billion and 2.3 5 billion of common equity over the next five years. As you can see on the chart over the next five years, we expect cash from operations to fund about 64% of our cash needs."", ""About 28% of the funding is expected to come from debt and the remaining 8% from issuance of common equity. We have turned on new equity to satisfy the dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans. And we also expect to use aftermarket programs. Our common equity issuance is still projected to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million for 2024. Post 2024, our equity issuances will be tied to our capital plan ratably at approximately $500 million a year. Finally, let's look at our earnings guidance. As Gale stated for the full year 2024, we're providing guidance of $4.80 to $4.90 per share. In developing this guidance range, we took into consideration the expected loss of earnings from lower rebates in Illinois, and timing of several projects under development."", 'Now let me briefly discuss our day-to-day nonfuel O&M expectations. We expect our 2024 O&M to be 6% to 7% higher. Approximately 5% of the increase is driven by assets that were included in recent rate cases, projects in the infrastructure segment and extraordinary storms costs in January. The remaining O&M increase of 1% to 2% is largely driven by inflation offset by operating efficiencies. Looking at the bigger picture, our O&M projection for 2024 is well below our actual O&M expenditures eight years ago in 2016. In terms of first quarter 2024 earnings guidance, we project to earn in the range of $1.96 per share to $2 per share. This forecast takes into account January weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Recall that we earned $1.61 per share in the first quarter last year.', ""There are a couple of main drivers for the quarter. One, weather was unfavorable by $0.10 in Q1 last year. Of course, we're assuming normal weather for the remainder of the quarter this year. Two, with the rate design changes at Peoples Gas under the latest commission order. We now expect base revenues will be concentrated in the first and fourth quarter heating months when natural gas usage is the highest. Correspondingly, we expect lower contributions from Peoples Gas in Q2 and Q3. We'll provide you with more details as the year progresses. As a reminder, however, in Illinois, we have a decoupling mechanism in place that mitigates that weather impact. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale."", ""Gale Klappa: Xia, thank you very much. Operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the call."", 'Operator: Thanks, Gale. And now we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions].

Good morning and thank you for joining today’s call. 2023 was another very strong year for Merck. I am extremely pleased by the progress we have made to develop and deliver transformative therapies and vaccines that will help save and improve lives around the world. We reached more than 500 million people with our medicines last year alone. Over half of which were through donations. We also made substantial investments in research and development in our ongoing effort to discover and bring forward to patients the next generation of impactful innovations, over $30 billion in total, including the cost of certain acquisitions and collaborations.

Guided by our science-led strategy, I am confident that the focused and disciplined business decisions we make and the actions we take will lead to sustainable benefits for the patients we serve and long-term growth and value for our shareholders. Turning to our results and initial outlook for 2024, we delivered excellent underlying growth in 2023, reflecting robust demand for our innovative portfolio.', 'I am pleased to share that we expect continued strong growth in 2024 driven by demand for our key products, which Caroline will speak to momentarily. Turning to the progress we are making in research, we are currently pursuing programs across a more diverse set of therapeutic areas with high unmet need and across more modalities than at any time in recent memory. This year, we will remain keenly focused on advancing our broad and diverse pipeline, which includes two launches that will address critical health needs and have blockbuster commercial opportunity. In cardiometabolic, we are very excited by the anticipated FDA action on our application for sotatercept in the United States, which we believe has the potential to transform the treatment journey for many patients suffering from pulmonary arterial hypertension.', 'Our commercial and manufacturing teams are fully prepared for the strong uptake we expect. Sotatercept is an important component of our growing cardiometabolic pipeline, which we believe has significant long-term potential. In vaccines, the FDA accepted for priority review our filing for V116. If approved, V116 would be the first vaccine specifically designed to address the majority of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults ages 65 and older. Based on its compelling profile, V116 has the potential to become an important new preventative option for adults and we believe it can achieve majority market share in this setting. We look forward to a potential approval in June. And in oncology, we continue to expand into additional tumor types in earlier stages of certain cancers as well as progress our increasingly broad pipeline of novel candidates.', 'We have achieved substantial diversification with a dramatically expanded set of late-stage programs, which Dean will speak to. I am confident that Merck is well positioned to provide important innovation to patients and sustain its leadership in oncology well into the future. I know Dean and his team are energized by our progress and are prepared to build on the success we have had in 2023 to further advance Merck’s pipeline and bring transformative innovation to patients this year and beyond. In summary, our science-led strategy, which keeps the patient at the center of everything we do, is delivering important advancements and helping us build a sustainable growth engine for our company. We have made considerable progress over the past year in advancing and expanding our pipeline, which has resulted in substantially increased long-term commercial opportunities.', 'We have taken meaningful steps to diversify and position ourselves for sustained leadership in oncology while also building one of our deepest and broadest pipelines across discovery and development in our recent history outside of oncology and notably in cardiometabolic and immunology. Further, we also expect to benefit from promising late-stage programs across our vaccines, neurosciences, HIV and animal health pipelines, a robust set of early phase programs and the potential to add exciting innovation through future science-led business development. As a result, we are increasingly confident that we are well positioned to drive patient impact and value creation this year and well into the next decade. I would again like to thank our global teams for their commitment to strong research, commercial and operational execution.', 'With a concerted focus on achieving continued excellence, I am very confident in our ability to deliver short and long-term stakeholder value. I look forward to providing future updates on our progress and impact. With that, I will turn the call over to Caroline.', 'Caroline Litchfield: Thank you, Rob. Good morning. 2023 was another impactful year for our company. We delivered strong revenue growth of 12%, excluding LAGEVRIO and foreign exchange. Growth was driven by robust performance across oncology, vaccines and animal health. We remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver strong results in the near-term while making disciplined investments in innovative science, which will drive long-term value for patients and shareholders. Now turning to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenues were $14.6 billion. Excluding the impact from LAGEVRIO and foreign exchange, the business delivered strong growth of 13%. The following revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis.', 'Our Human Health business sustained its momentum. Excluding LAGEVRIO, growth was 14% driven by Oncology and Vaccines. Sales in our Animal Health business increased 4% driven by companion animal products. Turning to the performance of our key brands. In Oncology, sales of KEYTRUDA grew 22% to $6.6 billion. Global growth was driven by increased uptake in earlier stage cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma, with particularly strong growth in international markets due to the more recent launches of these important indications. Growth was also driven by the strong global need of patients with metastatic disease. We continue to be encouraged by the positive impact our recent approvals are having on certain patients with earlier stage non-small cell lung cancer.', 'In the U.S., we have made considerable progress in helping to improve drug treatment rates and have further increased our leadership position in the adjuvant setting. We also received positive feedback from healthcare providers following the recent launch of KEYNOTE-A39 in advanced urothelial cancer. With this approval, KEYTRUDA in combination with PADCEV is now indicated for first-line advanced urothelial cancer patients regardless of cisplatin eligibility. Based on the outstanding clinical data, we believe this regimen has the potential to transform the standard of care for these patients. Alliance revenue from Lynparza and Lenvima grew 8% and 5% respectively. WELIREG sales grew 78% to $72 million driven by increased uptake in VHL-associated tumors.', 'We are excited by the opportunity to provide a new treatment option for certain patients with previously treated advanced renal cell carcinoma, following the recent approval based on the LITESPARK-005 study. Our Vaccines portfolio delivered excellent growth led by GARDASIL, which increased 27% to $1.9 billion, driven by global demand, particularly in China. In the U.S., GARDASIL sales benefited from CDC purchasing patterns. VAXNEUVANCE sales grew to $176 million driven by ongoing launches in Europe and continued uptake of the pediatric indication in the U.S. As a reminder, fourth quarter 2022 sales in the U.S. benefited from inventory stocking in preparation for the pediatric launch. In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales declined 3%.', 'Increased market share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents in the U.S. was more than offset by the impact of generic entrants in international markets, particularly in Europe. Our Animal Health business delivered another solid quarter, with sales increasing 4%. Companion animal sales grew 12% driven by the BRAVECTO line of products due to strong underlying demand and timing of purchases. Livestock sales were flat, reflecting favorable price actions offset by the timing of ruminant product purchases. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 77.2%, an increase of 1.5 percentage points largely due to favorable product mix, including a benefit from lower sales of LAGEVRIO.', 'Operating expenses increased to $11.6 billion, including a $5.5 billion one-time charge related to our collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. Excluding this charge, operating expenses grew 8%, reflecting disciplined investment in support of our expansive early-and late-phase pipeline and key growth drivers. Other expense was $174 million. Our tax rate was approximately 114%, which reflects the impact of the charge related to Daiichi Sankyo. Excluding this charge, the underlying tax rate was 13.1%. Taken together, earnings per share were $0.03, which includes a $1.69 negative impact from the charge related to Daiichi Sankyo. Now turning to our 2024 non-GAAP guidance. We expect another year of strong growth driven by key marketed products and we will begin to benefit from the anticipated launches of impactful new products, such as sotatercept and V116.', 'We project revenue to be between $62.7 billion and $64.2 billion, representing growth of 4% to 7%. This growth includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% using mid-January rates. The headwind is primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso, which we expect will largely be offset by inflation-related price increases, consistent with market practice. Our gross margin assumption is approximately 80.5%, which includes the benefit from reduced royalties paid on KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL. Operating expenses are assumed to be between $25.1 billion and $26.1 billion, which includes an approximate $650 million one-time charge related to the announced acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics. As a reminder, our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions.', 'Other expense is expected to be approximately $200 million. We assume a full year tax rate between 14.5% and 15.5%. We assume approximately 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $8.44 to $8.59. This range includes an approximate $0.26 per share charge related to the planned acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics, which is not tax-deductible and the negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately $0.25 using mid-January rates, including the impact from Argentina. Now turning to capital allocation, where our strategy remains unchanged. We will prioritize investments in our business to drive near and long-term growth. We are excited by the significant progress our team has made to advance and augment our innovative pipeline in 2023.', 'In 2024, we will increase this investment, including the initiation of more late-stage clinical trials across multiple novel candidates, each of which has significant potential to address important unmet medical needs. We remain committed to our dividend and plan to increase it over time. Business development remains a high priority. We maintain ample capacity given our strong investment-grade credit rating and cash flow to pursue additional science-driven, value-enhancing transactions going forward. We will continue to execute a modest level of share repurchases. To conclude, we enter 2024 with confidence in the outlook for our business in the near and long term. Global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines remain strong, and we are excited about our expansive pipeline.', 'We are in a position of financial and operational strength as a direct result of our longstanding commitment to science in order to improve the lives of the patients we serve. Our continued investment in innovation and excellent execution will enable us to deliver value to patients, customers and shareholders well into the future. With that, I’d now like to turn the call over to Dean.', 'Dean Li: Thank you, Caroline. Good morning. Today, I will provide notable R&D updates since our last earnings call and a brief summary of 2023 accomplishments. Momentum in the pipeline remains strong. Progress is spanning both early- and late-phase programs across multiple therapeutic areas. Starting with Oncology, we are diversifying our portfolio and executing on our strategy, which is broadly based on three strategic pillars: immunooncology, precision molecular targeting and tissue targeting. In immunooncology, we remain committed to the development of KEYTRUDA and further transforming cancer care to address the needs of certain patients. In the fourth quarter, we received approvals from both the FDA and the European Commission in two gastrointestinal indications: one in combination with chemotherapy for the first line treatment of adults with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic HER2-negative gastric or gastroesaphageal junction adenocarcinoma based on KEYNOTE-A59; and another in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for the treatment of patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer based on KEYNOTE-966.', 'As we continue to harness the potential of KEYTRUDA, we have an increased focus on earlier stages of disease, where we believe timely, effective intervention may significantly improve patient outcomes. Last month, we announced FDA approval for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemo radiotherapy for the treatment of fecal Stage 3 through 4A cervical cancer based on the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-A18 trial. This is an important advancement and provides a new option that has potential to become the standard of care. To-date, with all the research conducted with checkpoint inhibitors, the only studies that have demonstrated statistically significant overall survival benefit in earlier stage cancers are KEYTRUDA-based regimens: KEYNOTE-671 as part of a neoadjuvant followed by post-surgery adjuvant treatment regimen for certain patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer and KEYNOTE-564 as a post-surgery adjuvant treatment regimen for certain patients with renal cell carcinoma.', 'Since the approval of a KEYNOTE-671 in October, it is notable that the American Cancer Society released guidance recommending that certain individuals with significant smoking history undergo an annual low-dose CT scan. The guidance also expands the age range for lung cancer screening. We look forward to the opportunity to help impact patients and support the identification of more patients at risk. Additional data from KEYNOTE-564 demonstrating an overall survival benefit were presented at the ASCO GU conference last week. Detailed findings from KEYNOTE-123 evaluating KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of patients with localized, muscle-invasive and locally advanced, resectable urothelial carcinoma demonstrating a disease-free survival benefit versus observation were also presented at ASCO GU.', 'Also in the earlier-stage setting, along with our partner, Moderna, we announced 3-year recurrent-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival data for our individualized neoantigen therapy, V940, in combination with KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of Stage 3 and 4 melanoma following complete resection. We are encouraged by the durability of the responses observed and the potential for this regimen to impact patients earlier in their diagnosis. The Phase 3 trials in the adjuvant setting for certain patients with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer are actively enrolling. Progress continues in precision oncology. The FDA approval for WELIREG, our HIF 2 alpha inhibitor for the treatment of adults with advanced RCC following a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and a VEGF-TKI, marks the first drug approved in a new therapeutic class for eligible patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma in nearly a decade and builds on the 2021 approval for the treatment of adults with certain von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated tumors.', 'Additional Phase 3 pneumococcal studies for WELIREG, in combination with KEYTRUDA and/or lenvatinib for the treatment of certain types of renal cell carcinoma in the advanced and adjuvant settings, are ongoing. Finally, moving to the tissue targeting space. Together with Astellas and Seagen, now Pfizer, we announced the FDA approval for KEYTRUDA in combination with Padcev, a Nectin-4-targeting ADC for the first-line treatment to patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer based on results from KEYNOTE-A39. These results demonstrated a superior overall survival benefit versus gemcitabine plus cisplatin or carboplatin and extend our pioneering work in combining KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy as well as reinforcing the value of an ADC to enable targeted delivery of chemotherapy to the tumor tissue.', 'Following the announcement of our collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo in October, we are pleased to receive priority review from the FDA for MK-1022, or patritumab deruxtecan, our investigation of a fully humanized anti-HER3 ADC for patients with advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with two or more systemic therapies. The agency has set a target action date of June 26. Through our agreements with Kelun and Daiichi Sankyo as well as our own discovery programs, we have established a robust pipeline of tissue-targeting ADCs. And the recently announced acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics provides the opportunity to help complement and strengthen our approach by providing a portfolio of novel T cell engagers, the most significant of which is HPN-328, an investigational delta-like ligand 3 targeting T cell engager being evaluated in small cell lung cancer and neuroendocrine tumors.', 'Our strong diverse portfolio of immuno-oncology precision molecular and tissue-targeting agents positions us well to have a profound impact on even more patients long into the future. Next to our Vaccine pipeline. We are making notable advancements with our population-specific vaccine program for pneumococcal disease. The FDA has accepted for priority review the new biologics license application for V116, our 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, specifically designed for adults supported by results from multiple Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating V116 in both pneumococcal vaccine-naive and vaccine-experienced adult patient population. Results from STRIDE-3 trial were presented at the World Vaccine Congress West Coast in November and additional data from STRIDE-3 as well as STRIDE studies 4, 5 and 6 will be presented at the International Society of Pneumonia and Pneumococcal Disease Congress in March.', 'If approved, as Rob noted, V116 would be the first new pneumococcal-conjugate vaccine specifically designed to address the serotypes responsible for approximately 83% of invasive pneumococcal disease in about 65 years of age and older, according to CDC data from 2018 to 2021. Importantly, V116 includes eight unique serotypes, which account for 30% of disease according to the same CDC data. These serotypes are not covered by currently licensed pneumococcal vaccine options. The FDA has set a target action date of June 17. Turning to programs in the cardiometabolic disease pipeline. We are eager to bring sotatercept to patients as an important treatment option for pulmonary arterial hypertension. The FDA has set a target action date of March 26.', 'Beyond data from the STELLAR trial, we have the Phase 3 ZENITH and HYPERION studies, which are evaluating sotatercept in patients with more advanced disease and those earlier on their disease journey. In addition, the Phase 2 CADENCE trial will evaluate WHO Group 2 pulmonary hypertension focused on a type of blood clot disease. As we close out 2023, it is important to highlight our significant progress and execution across therapeutic areas and modalities as well as multiple business development transactions. In the year, we have more than 25 regulatory approvals in major markets. We also initiated over 20 Phase 3 studies across multiple new classes of assets, including in on oncology with bomedemstat, our LSD1 inhibitor in essential thrombocythemia; nemtabrutinib, our BTK inhibitor in first-line chronic lymphocytic leukemia of small lymphocytic lymphoma; MK-2870, our TROP2 ADC in collaboration with Kelun in non-small cell lung cancer and endometrial carcinoma; MK-5684, our CYP11A1 inhibitor in collaboration with Orion in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer; and V940 in collaboration with Moderna for the adjuvant treatment of certain types of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer; also in immunology, with tulisokibart in ulcerative colitis; finally, in cardiometabolic disease with multiple trials for MK-0616 in hypercholesterolemia.', 'As a result of the increasing depth and breadth of our pipeline, we are planning to initiate an even greater number of Phase 3 trials in 2024. Considerable credit goes to my colleagues across the organization for their hard work and unwavering dedication. We are executing on our science-led strategy and look forward to providing further updates on our progress throughout the year. And now I will turn the call back to Peter.', 'Peter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Dean. Ivy, we’re now ready to take questions.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should."", ""If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing."", ' See our latest analysis for Williams Companies ', ""Williams Companies has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. To the delight of shareholders, Williams Companies' EPS soared from US$1.64 to US$2.30, over the last year. That's a fantastic gain of 40%."", ""It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. We note that while EBIT margins have improved from 25% to 41%, the company has actually reported a fall in revenue by 10%.

You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting."", ""Owing to the size of Williams Companies, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$171m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.4% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves."", ""You can't deny that Williams Companies has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Williams Companies' continuing strength. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. Still, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Williams Companies."", 'While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.', 'Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.', 'Have feedback on this article?

With that, I'll turn the call over to David."", 'David Michael Cordani', ""Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. 2023 was a very strong year for our company with consistent performance and sustained growth. We executed with discipline across our businesses. We delivered for our customers and patients, our employer clients, our health plan partners and the others we serve. And with our expertise and diverse breadth of capabilities, we continue to improve affordability and clinical outcomes as well as continuing our work to expand access and choice. As we look forward, we're carrying momentum into 2024 and we expect another strong year of performance in growth. Now today, I'll focus my comments on key strategic drivers of our performance last year and how we continue to evolve and advance our business to sustain our impact on growth. Brian will then walk through additional details about our performance for 2023 as well as our outlook for 2024. Then we'll take your questions. Now before I go into our results, I want to comment on the announcement we made earlier this week. We reached a definitive agreement to sell our Medicare businesses to HCSC. We expect this transaction to close in early 2025, following customary legal and regulatory approvals. And while we continue to see the seniors market as an attractive growth market, we concluded that our Medicare businesses, well large at about $12 billion in revenue, would require sustained investments and focus and capital as well as dedicated resources that were disproportionate with their size within the Cigna Group's portfolio. Additionally, with Evernorth's broad high-performing service portfolio, we will continue to serve the needs of seniors and grow our business. I would note that as part of our agreement, HCSC will be served by Evernorth for continued services for the customers we are selling. Additionally, we're expanding the reach of Evernorth's portfolio and see significant continued growth opportunities in Government services, including Medicare. Now as we consider the performance of our Medicare Advantage business in 2023, in the fourth quarter, results were in line with our expectations. And for the year, we balanced high-quality and competitive benefits offerings, continued target market expansion and disciplined pricing activity. Now with that, let's move into our 2023 headlines. Broadly for 2023, we exceeded our financial commitments: full year total revenue, we delivered $195.3 billion; full year adjusted earnings per share was $25.09; and cash flow from operations of $11.8 billion. This performance extends our track record of delivering consistent positive results in the face of dynamic market conditions. It speaks to the power of our franchise and the purposeful way we've constructed our company, continuing to build on the strength of Cigna Healthcare while also shaping and expanding our Evernorth Health Services platform to lead the way in addressing evolving needs in the marketplace. As a result of our focus, discipline and sustained execution, over the past decade, we've delivered adjusted EPS growth of more than 13% on an annualized basis. In the 5 years since our acquisition of Express Scripts, we've achieved or surpassed every goal we established for the combined company. Through 2023, we've grown revenue by over $50 billion and met or exceeded our adjusted EPS objectives each year, and we've returned $27 billion to shareholders through share repurchase as well as attractive dividend payments. In 2023, after increasing our outlook for adjusted EPS twice over the course of the year, we had a strong finish and delivered full year adjusted EPS that was better than expectations. In short, we've demonstrated the ability to profitably evolve our business and services that we provide over many years, which enable us to continue to deliver on our commitments and grow. Now I'll discuss our performance in greater detail. I'll start with Evernorth. In our Express Scripts business, we successfully implemented the single largest contract ever in the pharmacy benefits industry. Throughout 2023, thousands of coworkers collaborated and worked with dedication so we'd be ready to begin fulfilling well over 400 million annual prescriptions for 20 million Centene customers starting at the beginning of this year. Additionally, Centene was amongst hundreds of additional clients that we're ready to serve in 2024, and our I'm proud to say we're off to a strong start. The good work of our team has helped us meet the needs of our customers and reinforce the trust that Centene and other clients place in our company. Another Evernorth highlight for 2023 is that we once again advanced industry-leading innovation. Last spring, we launched a series of innovations, including ClearCareRx, to support affordability, additional transparency and broader choice, as well as IndependentRx, to partner and enable more closely with independent pharmacies. Then in November, we went further in expanding choice for clients, funding their pharmacy benefits with Express Scripts ClearNetwork. We were the first to launch a scaled pharmacy network model offering cost-based pricing. In addition, our accelerated growth businesses with Evernorth fueled our momentum as well. Accelerated growth in Accredo Specialty Pharmacy and CuraScript SD businesses and in our care services businesses contributed to Evernorth's strong top and bottom line results. With Accredo and CuraScript SD, we're supporting patients and providers with safe and effective use of the growing volume of high-cost clinically complex specialty drugs. We also continue building out our care service platforms to ensure patients can access care when and how they need it while also remaining connected with physical sense of care. Our MDLIVE virtual platform, for example, is now available to over 60 million individuals as part of their benefits offering and is supporting a growing volume of care, including over 2.2 million virtual visits in 2023. Our results clearly demonstrate that with Evernorth's leading capabilities, we have valued and flexible partner for health plans, employers, governmental organizations and health care providers. In Cigna Healthcare, we drove revenue and customer growth through disciplined pricing and medical cost management. We serve employers and individuals who trust us to guide them through the health care system. Our leading clinical care programs [could] use to support our customers and patients, equipping them with the right information and insights they need to make the best choices for their health and vitality. Our ongoing pricing and continued progress in affordability initiatives in 2023 resulted in a medical care ratio that was better than expectations. Our U.S. Commercial Employer business had an outstanding year with continued strong growth. This was driven by our team's continued success in strengthening our competitive position through improved affordability and leveraging our high-performance networks and digitally enabled services as we expand care access, coordination of care and overall value. Our individual exchange business performed broadly in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter. And with the actions we've taken, we are on track to deliver improved profitability in 2024. And in international health, we achieved another positive top and bottom line results. Our high quality and localized health solutions, supported by our global provider network, continue to resonate very well with the globally mobile population and employees of multinational corporations as well as intergovernmental organizations. Now turning to 2024. We will sustain our growth in high performance by sharply focusing on the greatest opportunities with a well-balanced portfolio of complementary businesses and a clear durable strategic growth framework. First, we will drive continued steady predictable growth from our high-performing foundational growth businesses: pharmacy benefit, U.S. Commercial Employer and our international health business. Our clients depend on our pharmacy services, for example, and our expertise as well as our leadership in lowering cost for prescription drugs and addressing growing needs such as the high demand for the GLP-1 class of drugs for weight loss in diabetes. We have a long history of guiding appropriate access to medications and providing specialized clinical support, and we will continue to build on these efforts with new programs, such as our EnCircleRx program. We're also supporting customers in additional ways, including by offering enhanced digital tools to help them better understand the value of their pharmacy benefits. We've been successful in growing our U.S. Commercial Employer business for more than a decade and continue to view this as a growth market for the Cigna Group. We continue to leverage the strength in coordinating a growing number of point solutions for our clients and improving clinical outcomes for our clients. Additionally, we continue to act as a disruptive innovator for small and middle-sized client needs. Second, we will build on further momentum for our accelerated growth portfolio, our fast-growing scaled Specialty Pharmacy business and our care service businesses. We have tremendous opportunities in these large and expanding markets with our differentiated specialty capabilities, supporting patients with high cost and clinically complex treatments. And within care services, we're advancing our capabilities in behavioral health, virtual and home care as well as coordinated care programs for specific conditions. In summary, for 2024, we will grow our customer and revenue base again and our earnings and operating cash flow at the higher end of our long-term strategic targets. We've increased our expectations for full year 2024 adjusted EPS to at least $20.25. We expect our consolidated adjusted revenues to grow at least 20%, and we expect to generate at least $11 billion of operating cash flow. And we will continue to return capital to our shareholders, including a 14% increase in our quarterly dividend. Now before I wrap it up and turn it over to Brian, I also wanted to mention the announcements we made last month about expanding roles for Brian and Eric. Brian has been our Chief Financial Officer for the past 3 years and will continue in that role. He will also expand his responsibilities as President and CEO of Cigna Healthcare. Eric is expanding his responsibilities as Executive Vice President of Enterprise Strategy for the Cigna Group while also continuing as President and CEO of Evernorth Services. Brian and Eric's expanded positions, as well as other leadership changes we announced, provide further clarity of our priorities and strategy as well as the extent of reach and impact we're [bidding] to have. Importantly, it also reinforces the depth of our management bench. At our Investor Day on March 7 in New York City, you'll hear more from me, Brian and Eric, as well as other key leaders from across our company. We look forward to sharing with you our views of the expanded addressable markets we see and how we've positioned the Cigna Group to advance our next chapters of attractive growth. Now I'll briefly summarize. With the momentum we carried out of 2023, we're raising our guidance for EPS in 2024. We're building on a strong year of disciplined execution, performance and growth across our company. We deliver for our customers and clients and partners. We kept our commitments to our shareholders, including delivering adjusted EPS for 2023 of $25.09, which was above our outlook, and we generated $11.8 billion of cash flow from operations. We've sharpened the focus of our portfolio further to ensure that we're positioned to drive another strong year for our company. We're building on a consistent track record of disciplined execution, innovation and differentiated partnerships. We've increased our outlook for 2024 and now expect EPS of at least $20.25, and we will continue to advance the strategic deployment of capital, including using the majority of our discretionary cash flow for share repurchase in 2024. We'll have another strong year of performance, continue our track record for more than a decade of delivering against our 10% to 13% long-term adjusted EPS growth target while maintaining an attractive dividend. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian."", 'Brian C. Evanko', ""Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review the Cigna Group's fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and provide our outlook for full year 2024. We're proud to deliver another strong year for the Cigna Group, reflecting focused execution and growth across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Looking at full year 2023, some key consolidated financial highlights include revenue of $195.3 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $25.09 and cash flow from operations of $11.8 billion, all well exceeding our initial expectations for the year. Fourth quarter enterprise results were particularly strong with revenue growing 12% to $51.1 billion, after-tax adjusted earnings growing to $2 billion and adjusted earnings per share growing to $6.79. These results reflect broad-based strength across the company, and this momentum positions us well for growth in 2024. Regarding our growth platforms, I'll first comment on Evernorth. 2023 marked another year of sustained growth and profitability in Evernorth as our market-leading clinical capabilities and innovative solutions continue to create differentiated value for our health plan, employer and government, clients and customers. Fourth quarter 2023 Evernorth revenues grew 12% to $40.5 billion and pretax adjusted earnings grew 10% to $1.9 billion, both of which exceeded expectations. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by continued strong performance in our Specialty Pharmacy business, which saw a double-digit year-over-year revenue growth to reach $60 billion in revenues for full year 2023, and our unwavering focus on reducing net costs for our clients as new drug innovations come to market, including GLP-1 agonists, biosimilars, specialty generics and other emerging therapies for clinically complex conditions. The fourth quarter capped a strong 2023 for Evernorth with pretax adjusted earnings growing 5% for the year, above expectations. We achieved this even while incurring meaningful spending related to the implementation of our Centene relationship. Evernorth's favorable revenue and adjusted earnings growth in full year 2023 reflected strong execution and expansion across our foundational business, Express Scripts and our scaled accelerated growth business, Accredo Specialty Pharmacy. Now turning to Cigna Healthcare. We outperformed expectations with full year 2023 pretax adjusted earnings growing 9%, reflecting another year of highly effective execution. Fourth quarter 2023 adjusted revenues were $13 billion and pretax adjusted earnings were $969 million, representing strong year-over-year growth. The medical care ratio was 82.2%, favorable to expectations. Our medical care ratio favorability was primarily driven by our U.S. Commercial Employer business, particularly within our Stop Loss products, which outperformed expectations due to lower cost trends on high dollar claimants. Additionally, we saw lower-than-expected viral costs in the quarter with the combination of flu, COVID and RSV running below projections. As David noted in his comments, we have entered a definitive agreement with HCSC to sell our Medicare businesses. We expect to close this transaction in early 2025 following regulatory approvals, and our full year 2024 outlook assumes full year contributions from our Medicare businesses. For fourth quarter specifically, our Medicare Advantage business generated performance broadly in line with expectations. Across Cigna Healthcare, our full year 2023 medical care ratio was 81.3%, better than expectations, benefiting from our disciplined pricing execution, continued affordability initiatives and the favorability in our Stop Loss products. The full year MCR of 81.3% was 70 basis points better than the midpoint of our initial 2023 guidance and is an improvement of 40 basis points from full year 2022. Moving to Cigna Healthcare medical customers. We ended 2023 with 19.8 million total medical customers, growth of approximately 1.8 million or 10% from year-end 2022, ahead of our initial guidance. This growth was driven by U.S. healthcare, primarily from U.S. Commercial Employer fee-based customers, as well as growth in individual exchange and Medicare Advantage. Cigna Healthcare continues to perform well with strong underlying fundamentals. Our results reflect the strength of our differentiated value proposition and focused execution across the business as well as the stability and consistency of the U.S. Commercial Employer market. Overall, we're very proud of our strong 2023 results in a disruptive market environment, reflecting the intentional design of the company's growth platforms and our ongoing disciplined execution. This provides us with considerable momentum for 2024 and beyond. Now turning to our outlook for full year 2024, specifically. We continue to expect strong underlying growth in Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. We expect full year 2024 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $235 billion, and we expect full year 2024 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $8.025 billion or at least $28.25 per share, an increase from our prior outlook. When considering earnings seasonality, we would expect the adjusted earnings per share pattern to be similar to 2023. Now turning to our 2024 outlook for each of our growth platforms. At Evernorth, we expect full year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $7 billion. We expect adjusted earnings within Evernorth to ramp as we move throughout the year with first quarter adjusted earnings contributing slightly below 20% of full year Evernorth adjusted earnings. The earnings ramp reflects the effect of early year client-specific onboarding spend. These investments are more concentrated in the first half of the year and taper off over the course of the year. For Cigna Healthcare, we expect full year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $4.75 billion. Assumptions in our Cigna Healthcare outlook for 2024 include approximately 19.3 million total medical customers at year-end, and we expect our medical care ratio to be in the range of 81.7% to 82.7% with the first quarter 2024 medical care ratio expected to be below the low end of the full year guidance range to reflect typical seasonal patterns. Additionally, for the enterprise, we project an adjusted SG&A ratio of approximately 6.1% for 2024, reflecting a higher proportion of enterprise revenue from Evernorth, which carries a lower SG&A ratio. And we expect the consolidated adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%. Turning to our 2023 capital management position and 2024 capital outlook. We finished 2023 strong and delivered $11.8 billion of cash flow from operations. In 2023, we repurchased 7.8 million shares of common stock for approximately $2.3 billion, and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders via dividends. Additionally, our debt-to-capital ratio finished the year at 40.1%, an improvement of approximately 100 basis points from year-end 2022. Now framing our 2024 capital outlook. We expect to deliver at least $11 billion of cash flow from operations through our efficient service-based business model. We expect to deploy approximately $1.5 billion to capital expenditures, and we expect to deploy approximately $1.6 billion to shareholder dividends, reflecting our quarterly dividend of $1.40 per share, a 14% increase on a per share basis. In 2024, we intend to use a majority of our discretionary cash flow for share repurchase. As we previously shared, we anticipate to repurchase at least $5 billion within the first half of 2024. Finally, we expect full year weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 282 million to 286 million shares. Now to recap. Our full year 2023 consolidated results exceeded expectations, reflecting continued focused execution and discipline across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. And our 2024 outlook reflects continued strength and momentum across our 2 growth platforms, Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. We are confident in our ability to deliver full year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $28.25 per share. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.', 'Albert J. William Rice', ""Obviously, we have the announcement on your sale of the Medicare Advantage business, and yet you're saying you still view the business as attractive. Obviously, there's been some volatility in some of the performance of some of the other players in this space already announced. Is this the time, in your mind, to sort of step back from the market and give some time for the dust to settle? Or how should we interpret the comments that you still think that segment is attractive? And then also on that, obviously, is there are speculation, at least in the press, about deal discussions. Your stock was quite volatile. I wonder if you could give us a little bit on how you approach large transactions, some of the financial parameters that people should keep in mind that would be hopefully reassuring for them."", 'David Michael Cordani', ""A.J., it's David. You have a lot in that question, and I appreciate it. Let me try to address some of the high points. First and foremost, we are really pleased with the nature of the transaction we're able to structure with HCSC. We see it as a win-win, and it's a clarification to our strategy within our portfolio. As I noted in my prepared remarks, while we view the market as attractive growth market, the required capital investment, resources, focus relative to its size within our portfolio, coupled with the continued elevated regulatory environment, our decision was it was best to enter this transaction. Point two is, very importantly, we've been quite deliberate now for several years, working to expand the service portfolio and the value proposition within Evernorth for health plan partners as it relates to their government services, be it Medicare, be it duals, be it Medicaid, et cetera. And we're demonstrating a very attractive proven track record of growing our government reach but through the services franchise. And we will continue to fuel that on a go-forward basis and see that as an attractive trajectory for us. As it relates to your latter part of your question, I'll reframe our M&A criteria. I want to make sure I put that in the context of our capital deployment criteria. We continue to view, first, capital deployment priorities, investing in our business. Brian referenced the CapEx deployment of about $1.5 billion. Second, we always evaluate M&A for its appropriate attributes, which I'll come back to in a moment. And then third, returning capital to shareholders. And as Brian noted, in 2024, in addition to raising our dividend by 14%, we expect to return the majority of our excess capital to shareholders through share repurchase with at least $5 billion in the first half of the year. Lastly, in your action-packed question, as we think about the criteria for transactions, we think about 3 criteria: first, strategic attraction; second, financial attraction; and then third, overall path to clarity. So is it strategically aligned? Is it financially attractive? And as a final note, when we think about the financial piece of the equation, you evaluate each deal on its own respective merits, but seeking to get high visibility in terms of your value creation for your organization if you're going to enter into a transaction. So to repeat, we're pleased with the decision and the transaction design. We will continue in a long-term service relationship with HCSC that further expands our proven track record within Evernorth. We see the Evernorth service portfolio as an attractive capital-light high visibility way to grow this portfolio. And as we have in the past, we will maintain very strong discipline for capital deployment, and our 2024 capital deployment priorities are quite clear."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.', 'Stephen C. Baxter', ""I just wanted to ask another kind of quick follow-up on the Medicare Advantage. So I would be curious if you'd be willing to share maybe your 5- or 10-year view of the market. So I totally appreciate that it's a small part of your business before the sale, but you are still the eighth largest plan in the country. Do you think market share and concentration is ultimately going to look much more like the commercial market than it does today? Would love any kind of medium-term thoughts you could offer in the market."", 'David Michael Cordani', ""Stephen, it's David. You're asking for a 10-year crystal ball. I think in the dynamism of the marketplace, most people come back to in terms of rolling 3-year views of a given market. But stepping back, first and foremost, the Medicare Advantage offering, broadly speaking, in the marketplace is a very attractive offering for seniors, and it has a long-term proven track record of delivering attractive benefits and, importantly, clinical coordination when you get to the Medicare beneficiaries, typically dealing with a higher level of clinical burden that's necessary for coordination. And the care outcomes, the quality outcomes, the overall value outcomes are positive. So broadly speaking, from a societal standpoint, we see MA as an important asset for the U.S. to continue to be served, supported financially and grow. Secondly, the marketplace will see ebbs and flows in terms of the funding mechanism. We see the early look at the rate letter. That's a moment in time. That's a moment in time, either acceleration or potentially deceleration for that marketplace. Third is, if you look at the senior satisfaction level, NPS broadly -- Net Promoter Score, broadly, is attractive for Medicare Advantage. Therefore, as I noted previously to A.J.'s point, we worked really aggressively to ensure that we have a broad and we'll continue to broaden the portfolio of services in support of health plans and integrated value-based care providers to be in support of value-based care, be it for Medicare Advantage tools or the commercial population. So we see the marketplace as a growth market. Its respective growth will ebb and flow depending on reimbursement, to some level, from the government, lending toward benefit richness. And then ultimately, as you know, the last comment I would make is the primary wave of the baby boomer aging has reached a peak and is slowing. It's still attractive, but that primary wave has reached its peak and is slowing somewhat. Take it as a whole. We see this as an expansion opportunity for Evernorth."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.', 'Lisa Christine Gill', ""I want to focus on Evernorth and maybe just understand some of the key drivers as you think about 2024. So first off, you talked about specialty in '23. Can you talk about what your expectations are about growth in specialty in '24, what you're doing around services? You touched a little bit on GLP-1. But you have a really big contract with CNC coming on board, but you also had an overall good 2024 selling season. So any of the key elements you can help us to understand as to what the drivers are for that strong AOI growth in Evernorth."", 'Eric Paul Palmer', ""Thanks, Lisa. It's Eric. A couple of different pieces in there. But first, let me just talk a bit about the portfolio of services that we're focused on in terms of Evernorth, and I'll transition that into some of the drivers of growth specifically for 2024. David noted in his prepared remarks a couple of highlights on capabilities we're growing. But I would call out, we are seeing significant interest from the market around themes helping to better coordinate individual point solutions and alleviate some of the burden that comes along with the fragmentation of how care is administered and how employers and plans are assembling care. So us working to improve navigation and reduce point solution fatigue is a key item. Second of all, I would note, behavioral care continues to be an area of focus. And there's meaningful opportunity for behavioral care to be better coordinated as there's significant comorbidities with individuals with mental health care needs, along with other care needs. And we're in a position to help with -- address those challenges. The third item that I'd note would be around specialty and, in particular, the opportunity for us to continue to grow as there are more therapies, more choices in the specialty market as well as navigating through biosimilars. Overall, we're positioned really well to continue to drive affordability and choice in biosimilars. And as we've talked about previously, that's an important long-term multiyear tailwind in the economics and the growth of Evernorth overall. And then certainly, the continued growth in therapies like GLP-1s are -- is an area that's a factor in our proposition overall. So you put together that -- I've kind of touched on a number of the different capabilities. When you put together that suite of capabilities, that ends up being a really attractive portfolio, that we've had continued growth in the number of lives we're serving, growth in our clients' lives that enable us to deliver the numbers that we're talking about. Overall, really excited about the momentum we've got going into 2024 and see ourselves as well positioned to deliver there and continue the trajectory beyond."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.', 'George Robert Hill', ""I guess just a couple of clarifying questions for me as it relates to MLR and the guide for '24. You guys have kind of bumped up the medical cost expectations. Can you kind of disaggregate what you're seeing by line of business there? And I just want to confirm that the MA business is still kind of included in the continuing ops in the MLR guidance for '24 because I saw in the footnotes it's kind of being carried as an asset held for sale. So just kind of like a disaggregation of kind of medical cost expectations and trends expectations for '24."", 'Brian C. Evanko', ""George, it's Brian. So let me just take the MA question first, and then I'll get into the MCR. So as noted in my comments earlier, the Medicare Advantage business will continue to be reported through Cigna Healthcare through 2024. So all of our guidance, whether that be the revenue guidance, the customer volume guidance, the earnings guidance, all assumes that the Medicare business will continue to be reported through Cigna Healthcare on an asset held-for-sale basis. So just to clarify that. So all the metrics that you see line up with that basis. Within the MCR specifically, the midpoint of our guide obviously has a slight uptick from where we were in 2023. Now important to step back and thank the 2023 MCR performance was favorable to expectations and the primary driver of the Cigna Healthcare income outperformance. We're just really pleased with the -- both quarter and full year coming in favorable with expectations. And as I mentioned earlier, the 81.3% full year MCR was 70 basis points better than the midpoint of where we had started the guidance early in 2023. So you can think of the primary driver of the slightly higher projected 2024 MCR as being our Stop Loss products within the U.S. Commercial Employer business. As I mentioned earlier, these ran favorable to our target profit margins in 2023 due to lower-than-expected cost trends in high-dollar claimants. For 2024, our planning assumptions are for the Stop Loss products to normalize back into their typical target profit margin range. Secondarily, there's some product mix shift within the Cigna Healthcare portfolio between 2023 and 2024 that will impact the overall Cigna Healthcare MCR, although I would note that we expect the overall Cigna Healthcare profit margin percentage to be higher in 2024 compared to 2023. And we'd expect that to land near the low end of our targeted 9% to 10% range in 2024. And then finally, when you think about our MCR guidance, as always, our guidance does have an appropriate level of prudence to start off the year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.', 'Joshua Richard Raskin', ""I wanted to get back to the Health Care Services Corp. divestiture. Why was the PDP asset included in that sale? I would've thought that, that would have strategic value on the Evernorth side and that you'd have an advantage on the cost structure. And then similarly, including CareAllies as well, was that more a tie-in to the Medicare Advantage business? And what does that mean for broad sort of value-based care network development at Cigna?"", 'David Michael Cordani', ""Josh, it's David. Let me take a portion of your question and then ask Eric to expand. And I'm going to come at the latter piece of it in terms of CareAllies and VBC, et cetera. First, your statement is correct. Think about the CareAllies as specifically focused on the MA portion of value-based care. So therefore, there's alignment there. Stepping back, on value-based care, we have a long history and, again, proven track record of delivering very strong positive results for the benefit of our clients and our customers and patients off of our value-based care orientation for Commercial, for individual exchange, as well as for Medicare Advantage. As you know from our prior conversations, that's been a partner and enabled model as opposed to an owned model, broadly speaking, in terms of owning the care delivery versus partnering enabling. Additionally, I'd ask you to think about the commitment around that continuing. So our collaborative accountable care relationships for our Commercial business and our exchange business continues on. And our investment in and expansion of our Evernorth accountable care capabilities as we support health care delivery system partners around their value-based care, that continues, including our strategic partnership with Village. So on the value-based care side of the equation, no change in strategy for us. This specific subset of our assets was solely aligned to the Medicare Advantage business. I'll ask Eric to talk about the direction relative to PDP and our multidimensional services relationship there. Eric?"", 'Eric Paul Palmer', ""Thanks, David. So 2 things I would note for you, Josh, here. First of all, as David and Brian had in their prepared remarks, we will have a multiyear services relationship between Evernorth and HCSC, building on a relationship that already exists there. So Evernorth will have the opportunity to continue to provide services associated not only with the prescription drug element of this business, but some of the other clinical coordination and related capabilities. So we're excited about that opportunity and working to grow together. Specifically to the employer PDP item, you should think of here Express Scripts continuing to be the face of the employer offerings, and this being seamless with the -- with all of our clients and services with the role that will be played here around the insurance dynamics going to HCSC. But again, this'll be a side of relationships that Express Scripts and Evernorth will continue to manage from a relationship and account management perspective, and we'll be -- continue to be very involved in an area of focus for us. So overall, I'm very excited about the opportunity to continue to grow with another partner here."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens.', 'Scott J. Fidel', ""Interested just now, with the sale of the MA business, how your priorities for investment and for growth in Cigna Healthcare may change from that. And obviously, you talked about how you've invested a lot in Medicare, so that should free up capital to invest in other businesses. So curious in terms of how you're thinking about where you can increase investment for growth in Cigna Healthcare. But also just how you're thinking about the exchange business now against the exit from MA just around your overall risk business in Cigna Healthcare will now be probably more weighted towards techs, which is a pretty volatile business. So curious just on your thinking about the exchange business and sort of how you -- how now you're going to sort of view that business post the sale of the MA."", 'David Michael Cordani', ""Scott, it's David. I think your umbrella tenant is right. So as I noted in my prepared remarks, right, the decision allows for sharpening of focus as we lean into our portfolio going forward. As you think about the investments, though, we have a long track record of making multiyear investments within our portfolio. So think about investments in a digital-first orientation and data-led capabilities, continuing to invest in development of new programs and capabilities, be it what we talked about before with ClearCare or Pathwell capabilities; expanding the infrastructure and scale for a broader addressable market expansion; and our proven CuraScript SD expansion as we face off and support a broadening array of health care professionals and integrated delivery systems; and I mentioned to Josh, the Evernorth accountable care capability. So think about, broadly speaking, our investment strategy continuing to fuel a variety of items. And finally, sustained affordability, be it on the medical class pharmacy cost or administrative leverage that we get out of machine learning and AI through that lens. As it relates to the question around exchange or otherwise, we've always viewed the exchange business as sitting between Commercial as well as the Government. Obviously, the Government influences a meaningful portion of that through the benefit design and otherwise, yet we are able to successfully leverage our collaborative accountable care relationships. And as we've demonstrated now for about a decade, with the exchange business, by taking a very targeted focus within that market from its inception in 2014 to today, we continue to see that as a complementary aspects to our business. We will take very targeted positions, market by market, so long as we have the right collaborative accountable care relationships in place and have it be a complementary part of our portfolio. So I don't see the exchange posture is changing as a result of this. And broadly speaking, I don't think the investment strategy and the corporation changes as a result of it. It does create more capacity though, as you articulated, to accelerate some of the categories I made reference to. Hope that helps, Scott."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.', 'Kevin Mark Fischbeck', ""was wondering if you could just give a little more color about the membership guidance for 2024 by product. I know you're repricing exchanges. How is commercial going within Commercial, the subsegments? And then a little more color on the Medicare Advantage volume expectations as I guess that's in the guidance as well."", 'Brian C. Evanko', ""Kevin, it's Brian. So as it relates to the net decline we've projected in the 2024 Cigna Healthcare customers, you can think of the primary driver of this being the individual exchange business. As we discussed late last year, we took some needed pricing actions in certain geographies in the individual exchange portfolio, and this will result in net customer declines for this business in 2024. Within the U.S. Commercial Employer business, we expect customer volumes to be up modestly. But you should think of this by subsegment being split a bit. So we expect to see a net decline in our National Accounts business, but this will be more than offset by the continued strong growth within our Select segment. And as a reminder, we continue to see opportunities for above-market growth in the Select segment, where our market share is still just 7%. When you think about the MA customer volume specifically, as we approach the 2024 bid cycle, as we always do, we apply local-market, county-level approach relative to how we price and set benefits. And so for most geographies, this resulted in stable benefits. A few areas, we had some targeted pullbacks, just in light of the funding environment 2024. And what we saw was in some of our local geographies, there was some very aggressive competitor behavior, which resulted in less net growth than what we had originally expected for the Medicare Advantage business. So taken all together, we would expect to see net customer volumes down slightly for year-end 2024 in comparison to year-end 2023 within the Medicare Advantage space, specifically. But when you put all these pieces together, we're pleased with the overall balance in the Cigna Healthcare business right now as we expect to see profit margins expand year-over-year, as I mentioned earlier, while we're serving a meaningful volume of customers that's grown markedly over the last 2 years."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.', 'Erin Elizabeth Wilson Wright', 'On Evernorth, how are you thinking about the implications of cost-plus models and what that means at the PBM level and how does that influence your discussions with customers or just around your pharmacy network relationships? And just more broadly, just around transparency. And obviously, you talked about that in your prepared remarks in more transparent offerings at the PBM level. And how do you think those offerings are gaining or not gaining traction across your customer base?', 'Eric Paul Palmer', ""Erin, it's Eric. First of all, just -- we would note fundamentally, we start with the portfolio and approach that's equipped to offer choice and flexibility in how we work to support our clients, and so that's the lens I ground back to. We're always open to looking at new ways and approaches and such that drive increased affordability and meets the needs of our buyers. And I'm really proud of the range of different financing solutions we offer and the number of innovations that we've delivered in 2023 and already in 2024 in terms of the types of options that we bring to our clients. And in fact, as David mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we launched our ClearNetwork solution, which was a first of its kind. It's comprehensive and simple solution to providing a cost index-based pharmacy network. That solution is unique in that it provides access to all the drugs in pricing that's based off of independent externally created cost on disease, kind of a simple margin that's shared between us and the dispensing pharmacy. So use that as an example. We had a lot of good conversations about that as a program and as an offering, but would note that the selling seasons for these types of things tend to be long in time. There's a long lead time in terms of implementation of such. So some good conversation with our clients on solutions like that. Looking at other changes in the ecosystem. Overall, we'd note, our clients are demanding more for their health care dollars and are looking for ways to improve affordability overall and broadly are not interested in paying more for the same services that they receive today. We've got a wide variety of networks and solutions that exist already in the market and the flexibility to adapt and adjust the configuration of our networks to trade-off costs relative to the value and access profiles that exist. So overall, we've got good flexibility, good capabilities and modularity to be able to approach and line up our capabilities best with what our clients need."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.', 'Justin Lake', ""Wanted to ask a broader strategic question beyond MA. Most of your peers have set up their business models over the last 5 to 10 years to manage a significant amount of their internal healthcare spend, right, and drive additional profitability and revenue from those services businesses. So with the sale of MA, you're repricing your exchanges, which makes sense, but you risk membership and the amount of medical costs you control, right, and are able to run through your services business just declines. How do you think about the value there, those individual synergies of controlling medical costs and being able to provide services there, the natural growth it provides each and every year versus having to go out into the market and win each and every piece of business of growth, which obviously you've done pretty well over the last few years but just the stability of kind of having that internal membership? And how should investors expect this to impact your capital deployment strategy going forward?"", 'David Michael Cordani', ""Justin, it's David. There's a lot in your questions. Let me try to frame our thought process today and as we go forward. First, to date, we have a very clear proven track record of delivering a total cost, total quality, including clinical quality and service quality solution, that resonates really well in the marketplace, whether it's in the benefit side of the equation or on the services side of the equation. And our results reinforce that. Point two is we've successfully executed an approach that is, on the delivery and fulfillment, a mix of partner and owned. We continue to evolve our portfolio. But philosophically, we do not believe, have not, do not and continue to not believe that you have to own everything to be able to fulfill. As you might recall, if you reflect back on prior conversations within our portfolio at Investor Days, we framed actually the amount of services that Evernorth, for example, was fulfilling at a point in time for the Cigna Healthcare portfolio. And we frame the expansion opportunity, to the point of your question, that existed in front of us, and we continue to expand those services. Our model though is also importantly not predicated on only having economic alignment for guaranteed cost. We're able to do it successfully for self-funded or shared-funding mechanism as well. So point two is we see the ability to continue to grow that over time with our Evernorth services portfolio. Point three is as it relates to services to continue to invest in, we've been very clear that certain services, we see additional step function opportunities to invest in and continue to grow. Most importantly, our proven scaled Specialty capabilities, the rate of spending growth and clinical complexity around that is off the charts. We have a leadership position there that will continue to grow, and we will continue to be the market leader in that space through our assets. Secondly, the need statements around behavioral health in the most comprehensive way, the market expects now much more coordination of behavioral and physical health, and we will continue to expand services that we have within our leading capabilities. And third, just to stop at 3 for illustration, is the breadth of virtual services, the ability to connect and coordinate and expand services as we go forward. So we agree with your point, I'll end with agreement with your point, of continuing to invest in our services capabilities to be able to support right services, but we do not believe you have to own all aspects of the care delivery equation to be able to deliver that on a go-forward basis. So hopefully, that gives you a framing. As you might expect, we'll spend time on this at our Investor Day on the seventh because it's an important part of our strategy today and important part of our growth strategy going forward."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.', 'Lance Arthur Wilkes', ""Could you talk a little bit about, over in the Cigna Healthcare side of the business employer, how penetration rates are going with the Specialty products in self-insured and if there are any interesting trends as you go into '24 here as you look at the selling season in '25 with respect to that? And then as you've gone through the selling season, any changes in employer priorities? And then also just a quick clarification on, if you could just explain, there's a little drop in fees in the PBM. So that was just clarification. The other one's a real question."", 'Brian C. Evanko', ""Lance, it's Brian. I'll take the majority of your question. I think there's a number of different pieces in there. As it relates to the Specialty products and the attachment, if you will, to the medical in the Cigna Healthcare book of business, as you know, it's been a long-standing part of the company's strategy because we see the value of clinical integration being much greater when we have multiple components of relationship with an employer. So that's been, for many years, part of the company strategy. And important to bifurcate that by subsegment, certainly in the down market, we call the Select segment under 500. Most of those employers tend to buy the entirety of our offerings at once. So we have very high, to use your word, penetration rates in the under 500 and then comparatively lower when you get to the National Account space, where there tends to be a little bit more a la carte purchasing of the different services. So broadly speaking, I would say those patterns haven't changed too much over the last few years. On your question on the selling season, in particular, and some of the employer preferences, the 2024 selling season is largely over with the exception of the Select segment. As I mentioned earlier, that's an area for us that continues to grow at above market rates and we're really pleased with. As we look forward to the '25 selling season, we do have some National Account RFPs in-house for both some existing clients and new business prospects. And directionally, RFP volumes are up a bit from prior years. Now each of these large clients, as you can appreciate, tend to have unique needs. That said, there are a few areas that I would highlight for purposes of kind of themes. So one would be some of our larger employers are seeking to consolidate vendors or point solutions with those who can supply more integrated offerings. So we tend to call that point solution fatigue, you may hear Eric or I talk about. Secondly, a theme that's been around mental health and substance abuse benefits as these programs have become more and more important to employers from the standpoint of managing productivity, absences and overall health of their employee base. And thirdly, many of the larger employers are interested in digitally enabled care navigation capabilities to further power things like site of care optimization and consumer empowerment at the time that, that care is delivered. So we continue to see interest in those areas as well as various provider network configurations that may optimize cost quality and/or incentive alignment between the provider and the financier. So our Cigna Healthcare offerings are really well positioned to address these themes and the demands from large employers while simultaneously continue to grow share in the under 500 Select segment. I think David wants to add a few comments here."", 'David Michael Cordani', ""Sure. Lance, just to amplify and add one point. The amplification is that point solution fatigue, that plays through in terms of opportunities for our Evernorth team as well as our Cigna Healthcare team. So the -- around that, think about the ability to leverage solutions to get more value, better service, better clinical outcomes, overall value and affordability. Secondly, I just wanted to reinforce a critical point. When we think about penetration or cross-selling, sometimes it's thought through -- and you didn't state this, but sometimes it's thought through under the notion of you're just cross-selling products. The integration of the products to deliver more value to the clients and customers is mission-critical. So that shows up in better service quality, better clinical quality, improved affordability. And I would highlight that our sustained differentiated MLR performance is, in many cases, aided by our proven ability to integrate certain services. They come together, would benefit the clients -- that enables us to generate a high level of cross-selling and a high level of penetration. Thanks, Lance."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with TD Cowen.', 'Gary Paul Taylor', ""David, I was hoping to ask an action-packed question like A.J. did, but I'm afraid I'm going to be to in the weeds for that. I just want to go back to Stop Loss because it looks like a pretty substantial benefit to the 4Q and headwind. When I just look at how much your fourth quarter MLR outperformed your typical seasonal pattern, particularly in a quarter where there was broad trend acceleration, and then I try to square how much AC enrollment and margin improvement should drive a tailwind, such that '24 MLRs should actually decline year-over-year, but you're guiding it up. I mean, it gets me to hundreds and hundreds of basis points of variance around Stop Loss. So could you quantify how much that helped 4Q and how much a headwind that is for '24? And then the second part would just be walk us through again why you had such favorable performance in that line."", 'Brian C. Evanko', ""Gary, it's Brian. So as it relates to the Stop Loss book, as you know, this is a really important part of the Cigna Healthcare portfolio. And we finished 2023 with $6 billion of premium in that product line, which, to the earlier question Lance asked, attaches itself to our self-funded offerings in many instances. This book will naturally have some variability to it. So I wouldn't get overly fixated on one quarter's performance. There tends to be a little bit more settlement activity that transpires in the fourth quarter. So we had a little bit more of the favorability work its way through in the quarter. Whereas if you smooth out over the course of the year, you don't have quite the same dynamic which is one of the reasons why when you do the bridge from '23 to '24, you shouldn't run rate the fourth quarter experience from that standpoint. So I mentioned earlier some of the moving pieces in the year-over-year MCR reconciliation, the 90 basis points increase from where we landed at the end of '23 to the midpoint of the '24 guide. A key component of that 90 basis points is an uptick that were anticipated in the Stop Loss product MCRs, which, to the point earlier, is a function of our assumption that, that will normalize back to more traditional levels of profitability on the Stop Loss products. So I think that's broadly the way I would encourage you to think about the dynamics at play here with that product line."", 'Operator', 'Our last question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.', 'David Howard Windley', ""The premise of my question here is that your Evernorth profit guidance for '24 looks pretty highly visible to us. So my questions underneath that are, one, that you had guided '23 to include a ramping contribution from biosimilar. How should we expect that to continue? Should that continue to ramp in magnitude? And then the second part was the significant onboarding costs for the Centene contract in '23. Are you fully past those? Are those completely gone? Brian, you mentioned some Evernorth onboarding -- maybe unrelated, but Evernorth onboarding in your remarks. I just wanted to kind of understand the relative size of those. So those 2 things, please."", 'David Michael Cordani', ""It's David. Let me ask Brian to give you a framing in terms of -- because you have a question relative to the trajectory in the year-over-year and then ask Brian to hand it across to Eric to give you a little bit more color of your question, the onboarding costs that were really intense during 2023 and then some of what we're calling onboarding costs that bleeds into the early part of 2024, give you a little color of what those services look like. But I'll ask Brian to frame the financials first."", 'Brian C. Evanko', ""Yes. Thanks, David. Dave, so overall, our AOI growth in Evernorth is expected to be about 9%, as implied by the $7 billion or more of income that we expect in the year. And you can think of that as having the benefit of Centene-related costs now essentially normalizing back to a point where the profitability of that relationship will be in the range of breakeven. And then on top of that, we will have income performance. That's more in line with our traditional algorithm of 5% to 7% average annual income growth. And that reflects the benefit of all the multiyear trends that Eric talked about earlier, whether those be biosimilars, GLP-1 drugs, specialty generics, et cetera. So we certainly are seeing continued benefit from the biosimilar wave in 2024. But as I mentioned earlier, there's a bit of a specific and unique effect of the large amount of additional volume we're getting with the new client relationships in 2024. So Eric, maybe you can expand on that dynamic a bit."", 'Kevin Mark Fischbeck', ""Great. Thanks, Brian. So with Centene, first, I would just start by actually noting how proud I am of how our team has delivered here and how we worked collaboratively across and with the Centene team. It's really been a great effort and one that's come together really nicely for the benefit of our now shared customers. Implementation has gone really well, and our first month has been quite successful. Now consistent with what we've said before, as Brian just noted, in 2023, we had meaningful implementation spending and no associated revenue generated loss 2024. We have results that will be approximately breakeven in 2025. We'd expect to achieve our run rate margin for this contract, which will be lower than the overall book of business. With respect to the in-year 2024 timing that Brian alluded to before, you should just think about this, there's a lot more activity that has to happen at the beginning of a contract like this. There's more client outreach. There's work to get individuals into their therapies, et cetera. So there's normal effect here of just additional work and activity that has to take place in the first part of the year, and our expenses will reflect that. So that's a bit of that in-year shaping, but it's all consistent with what we had shared before. The final thing I'd note is, consistent with our kind of normal practice now that Centene is a live client of ours, we won't be commenting going forward on specific profitability of a specific client or things along those lines, but know that the trajectory here start -- is off to the same start we expected and consistent with what we had talked about previously."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.', 'David Michael Cordani', ""Thanks. Just a couple of messages to reiterate. First and foremost, 2023 was clearly a strong year of performance across our company as we executed quite well. And it's reinforced by more than a decade where we've executed consistently as we've evolved our company and continue to grow our business portfolio and those we serve. We have confidence that we're going to sustain that momentum and leverage our well-balanced portfolio across our franchise and continue to deliver within our 10% to 13% long-term EPS growth range as well as pay an attractive dividend. Finally, I want to thank my coworkers around the world for their continued disciplined execution, their passion, importantly, in their caring orientation as well as dedication for those we serve. It shows up in our results. I'm really pleased and proud of what we delivered in 2023. And importantly, I'm even more excited for our expansion of our reach and impact in 2024. As a final note for you all, we look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day, which is a month away. So in early March, we look forward to seeing you in New York City, and our team will be excited to talk about the market expansion we see in front of us, our capabilities and our opportunity to create additional value on a go-forward basis.

Brian will then walk through additional details about our performance for 2023 as well as our outlook for 2024, then we'll take your questions. Now, before I go into our results, I want to comment on the announcement we made earlier this week."", ""We reached a definitive agreement to sell our Medicare businesses to HCSC. We expect this transaction to close in early 2025 following customary legal and regulatory approvals. And while we continue to see the seniors market as an attractive growth market, we concluded that our Medicare businesses, while large at about $12 billion in revenue, would require sustained investments and focus and capital, as well as dedicated resources that were disproportionate with their size within The Cigna Group's portfolio. Additionally, with Evernorth broad high-performing service portfolio, we will continue to serve the needs of seniors and grow our business. I would note that as part of our agreement, HCSC will be served by Evernorth for continued services for the customers we are selling. Additionally, we are expanding the reach of Evernorth portfolio and see significant continued growth opportunities in government services including Medicare. Now, as we consider the performance of our Medicare Advantage business in 2023, in the fourth quarter, results were in line with our expectations."", ""And for the year, we balanced high-quality and competitive benefits offerings, continued target market expansion and disciplined pricing activity. Now, with that, let's move into our 2023 headlines. Broadly for 2023, we exceeded our financial commitments. Full-year total revenue, we delivered $195.3 billion. Full-year adjusted earnings per share was $25.09 and cash flow from operations of $11.8 billion."", ""This performance extends our track record of delivering consistent and positive results in the face of dynamic market conditions. It speaks to the power of our franchise and the purposeful way we've constructed our company, continuing to build on the strength of Cigna Healthcare, while also shaping and expanding our health services platform to lead the way in addressing evolving needs in the marketplace. As a result of our focus, discipline, and sustained execution, over the past decade, we've delivered adjusted EPS growth of more than 13% on an annualized basis. In the five years since our acquisition of Express Scripts, we've achieved or surpassed every goal we established for the combined company. Through 2023, we've grown revenue by over $50 billion and met or exceeded our adjusted EPS objectives each year. And we've returned $27 billion to shareholders through share repurchase as well as attractive dividend payments."", ""In 2023, after increasing our outlook for adjusted EPS twice over the course of the year, we had a strong finish and delivered full-year adjusted EPS that was better than expectations. In short, we've demonstrated the ability to properly -- profitably evolve our business and services that we provide over many years, which enable us to continue to deliver on our commitments and grow. Now, I'll discuss our performance in greater detail. I'll start with Evernorth. In our Express Scripts business, we successfully implemented the single largest contract ever in the pharmacy benefits industry."", ""Throughout 2023, thousands of coworkers collaborated and worked with dedication so we'd be ready to begin fulfilling well over 400 million annual prescriptions for 20 million Centene customers starting at the beginning of this year. Additionally, Centene was among hundreds of additional clients that we're ready to serve in 2024, and I'm proud to say we're off to a strong start. The good work of our team has helped us meet the needs of our customers and reinforce the trust that Centene and other clients place in our company. Another highlight for 2023 is that we once again advance industry-leading innovation. Last spring, we launched a series of innovations including ClearCareRx to support affordability, additional transparency, and broader choice; as well as IndependentRx to partner and enable more closely with independent pharmacies. Then in November, we went further in expanding choice for clients, funding their pharmacy benefits with Express Scripts ClearNetwork. We were the first to launch a scaled pharmacy network model offering cost-based pricing."", ""In addition, our accelerated growth businesses within Evernorth fueled our momentum as well. Accelerated growth in accretive specialty pharmacy and CuraScript SD businesses and in our care services businesses contributed to Evernorth strong top and bottom-line results. At Accredo and CuraScript SD, we are supporting patients and providers with safe and effective use of a growing volume of high-cost, clinically complex, specialty drugs. We also continue building on our care service platforms to ensure patients can access care when and how they need it while also remaining connected with physical sites of care. Our MDLIVE virtual platform, for example, is now available to over 60 million individuals as part of their benefits offering and is supporting a growing volume of care, including over 2.2 million virtual visits in 2023. Our results clearly demonstrate that with Evernorth's leading capabilities, we are valued and flexible partner for health plans, employers, governmental organizations, and healthcare providers. It's in healthcare we drove revenue and customer growth through disciplined pricing and medical cost management."", 'We serve employers and individuals who trust us to guide them through the healthcare system. Our leading clinical care programs continue to support our customers and patients, equipping them with the right information and insights they need to make the best choices for their health and vitality. Our ongoing pricing and continued progress in affordability initiatives in 2023 resulted in a medical care ratio that was better than expectations. Our U.S. commercial employer business had an outstanding year with continued strong growth.', ""This was driven by our team's continued success in strengthening our competitive position through improved affordability and leveraging our high-performance networks and digitally enabled services as we expand care access, coordination of care, and overall value. Our individual exchange business performed broadly in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter. And with the actions we've taken, we are on track to deliver improved profitability in 2024. And in international health, we achieved another positive top- and bottom-line result. Our high-quality and localized health solutions supported by our global provider network continue to resonate very well with the globally mobile population and employees of multinational corporations as well as inter-governmental organizations. Now, turning to 2024."", 'We will sustain our growth in high performance by sharply focusing on the greatest opportunities with a well-balanced portfolio of complementary businesses and a clear, durable, strategic growth framework. First, we will drive continued, steady predictable growth from our high-performing foundational growth businesses: pharmacy benefit, U.S. commercial employer, and our international health business. Our clients depend on pharmacy services, for example, and our expertise, as well as our leadership in lowering costs for prescription drugs and addressing growing needs such as the high demand for the GLP-1 class of drugs for weight loss and diabetes. We have a long history of guiding appropriate access to medications and providing specialized clinical support, and we will continue to build on these efforts with new programs such as our EncircleRX program.', ""We're also supporting customers in additional ways, including by offering enhanced digital tools to help them better understand the value of their pharmacy benefits. We've been successful in growing our U.S. commercial employer business for more than a decade and continue to view this as a growth market for The Cigna Group. We continue to leverage the strength in coordinating a growing number of point solutions for our clients and improving clinical outcomes for our clients. Additionally, we continue to act as a disruptive innovator for small and middle-sized client needs. Secondly, we will build on further momentum for our accelerated growth portfolio, our fast-growing scaled specialty pharmacy business, and our care service businesses."", ""We have tremendous opportunities in these large and expanding markets with our differentiated specialty capabilities supporting patients with high-cost and clinically complex treatments. And within care services, we are advancing our capabilities in behavior health, virtual, and home care, as well as coordinated care programs for specific conditions. In summary, for 2024, we will grow our customer and revenue base again and our earnings and operating cash flow at the higher end of our long-term strategic targets. We've increased our expectations for full-year 2024 adjusted EPS to at least $28.25. We expect our consolidated adjusted revenues to grow at least 20%, and we expect to generate at least $11 billion of operating cash flow. And we will continue to return capital to our shareholders, including a 14% increase in our quarterly dividend. Now, before I wrap it up and turn it over to Brian, I also wanted to mention the announcements we made last month about expanding roles for Brian and Eric."", ""Brian's been a financial officer for the past three years and will continue in that role. He will also expand his responsibilities as president and CEO of Cigna Healthcare. Eric is expanding his responsibilities as executive vice president of enterprise strategy for The Cigna Group while also continuing as president and CEO of Evernorth Services.

Today, I'll review The Cigna Group's fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results and provide our outlook for full-year 2024. We're proud to deliver another strong year for The Cigna Group, reflecting focused execution and growth across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare."", ""Looking at full-year 2023, some key consolidated financial highlights include revenue of $195.3 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $25.09, and cash flow from operations of $11.8 billion, all well exceeding our initial expectations for the year. Fourth-quarter enterprise results were particularly strong with revenue growing 12% to $51.1 billion, after-tax adjusted earnings growing to $2 billion, and adjusted earnings per share growing to $6.79. These results reflect broad-based strength across the company, and this momentum positions us well for growth in 2024. Regarding our growth platforms, I'll first comment on Evernorth."", ""2023 marked another year of sustained growth and profitability in Evernorth, as our market-leading clinical capabilities and innovative solutions continue to create differentiated value for our health plan, employer, and government clients and customers. Fourth-quarter 2023 Evernorth revenues grew 12% to $40.5 billion, and pre-tax adjusted earnings grew 10% to $1.9 billion, both of which exceeded expectations. Evernorth results in the quarter were driven by continued strong performance in our specialty pharmacy business, which saw double-digit year-over-year revenue growth to reach $60 billion in revenues for full-year 2023, and our unwavering focus on reducing net costs for our clients as new Drug innovations come to market including GLP-1 agonists, biosimilars, specialty generics, and other emerging therapies for clinically complex conditions. The fourth quarter capped a strong 2023 for Evernorth with pre-tax adjusted earnings growing 5% for the year, above expectations. We achieved this even while incurring meaningful spending related to the implementation of our Centene relationship. Evernorth's favorable revenue and adjusted earnings growth in full-year 2023 reflected strong execution and expansion across our foundational business, Express Scripts, and our scaled accelerated growth business, Accredo Specialty Pharmacy. Now, turning to Cigna Healthcare."", 'We outperformed expectations with full-year 2023 pre-tax adjusted earnings growing 9%, reflecting another year of highly effective execution. Fourth-quarter 2023 adjusted revenues were $13 billion, and pre-tax adjusted earnings were $969 million, representing strong year-over-year growth. The medical care ratio is 82.2%, favorable to expectations. Our medical care ratio favorability was primarily driven by our U.S. commercial employer business, particularly within our stop loss products which outperformed expectations due to lower cost trends on high-dollar claimants.', 'Additionally, we saw lower-than-expected viral costs in the quarter with the combination of flu, COVID, and RSV running below projections. As David noted in his comments, we have entered a definitive agreement with HCSC to sell our Medicare businesses. We expect to close this transaction in early 2025 following regulatory approvals, and our full-year 2024 outlook assumes full-year contributions from our Medicare businesses. For fourth quarter specifically, our Medicare Advantage business generated performance broadly in line with expectations. Across Cigna Healthcare, our full-year 2023 medical care ratio was 81.3%, better than expectations, benefiting from our disciplined pricing execution, continued affordability initiatives, and the favorability in our stop loss products. The full-year MCR of 81.3% was 70 basis points better than the midpoint of our initial 2023 guidance and is an improvement of 40 basis points from full-year 2022.', 'Moving to Cigna Healthcare medical customers. We ended 2023 with 19.8 million total medical customers, growth of approximately 1.8 million, or 10%, from year-end 2022, ahead of our initial guidance. This growth was driven by U.S. healthcare primarily from U.S.', ""commercial employer fee-based customers, as well as growth in individual exchange and Medicare Advantage. Cigna Healthcare continues to perform well with strong underlying fundamentals. Our results reflect the strength of our differentiated value proposition and focused execution across the business, as well as the stability and consistency of the U.S. commercial employer market. Overall, we're very proud of our strong 2023 results in a disrupted market environment, reflecting the intentional design of the company's growth platforms and our ongoing disciplined execution. This provides us with considerable momentum for 2024 and beyond."", 'Now, turning to our -- our outlook for full-year 2024 specifically. We continue to expect strong underlying growth in Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. We expect full-year 2024 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $235 billion, and we expect full-year 2024 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $8.025 billion, or at least $28.25 per share, an increase from our prior outlook. When considering earnings seasonality, we would expect the adjusted earnings per share pattern to be similar to 2023. Now, turning to our 2024 outlook for each of our growth platforms.', 'In Evernorth, we expect full-year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $7 billion. We expect adjusted earnings within Evernorth to ramp as we move throughout the year with first-quarter adjusted earnings contributing slightly below 20% of full-year Evernorth adjusted earnings. The earnings ramp reflects the effect of early year client-specific onboarding spend. These investments are more concentrated in the first half of the year and taper off over the course of the year. For Cigna Healthcare, we expect full-year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $4.75 billion.', 'Assumptions in our Cigna Healthcare outlook for 2024 include approximately 19.3 million total medical customers at year-end. And we expect our medical care ratio to be in the range of 81.7% to 82.7% with the first quarter of 2024 medical care ratio expected to be below the low end of the full-year guidance range to reflect typical seasonal patterns. Additionally, for the enterprise, we project an adjusted SG&A ratio of approximately 6.1% for 2024, reflecting a higher proportion of enterprise revenue from Evernorth, which carries a lower SG&A ratio. And we expect the consolidated adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%. Turning to our 2023 capital management position and 2024 capital outlook. We finished 2023 strong and delivered $11.8 billion of cash flow from operations.', 'In 2023, we repurchased 7.8 million shares of common stock for approximately $2.3 billion, and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders via dividends. Additionally, our debt-to-capital ratio finished the year at 40.1%, an improvement of approximately 100 basis points from year-end 2022. Now, framing our 2024 capital outlook. We expect to deliver at least $11 billion of cash flow from operations through our efficient service-based business model. We expect to deploy approximately $1.5 billion to capital expenditures, and we expect to deploy approximately $1.6 billion to shareholder dividends, reflecting our quarterly dividend of $1.40 per share, a 14% increase on a per-share basis. In 2024, we intend to use a majority of our discretionary cash flow for share repurchase.', ""As we've previously shared, we anticipate to repurchase at least $5 billion within the first half of 2024. Finally, we expect full-year weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 282 million to 286 million shares. Now, to recap. Our full-year 2023 consolidated results exceeded expectations, reflecting continued focused execution and discipline across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. And our 2024 outlook reflects continued strength and momentum across our two growth platforms, Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare."", ""We are confident in our ability to deliver full-year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $28.25 per share. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."", '', 'Operator', '[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. You may ask your question.', 'A.J. Rice -- UBS -- Analyst', ""Hi, everybody, and thanks for the question. Obviously, we have the announcement on your sale of the Medicare Advantage business, and yet, you're saying you still view the business as attractive. Obviously, there's been some volatility in some of the performance of some of the other players in this space already announced. Is this a time in your mind to sort of step back from the market and give some time for the dust to settle? Or how should we interpret the comments that you still think the -- that segment is -- is attractive? And then, also on that, obviously, is there a speculation, at least in the press, about deal discussions? Your stock was quite volatile. I wonder if you could give us a little bit on how you approach large transactions, some of the financial parameters that people should keep in mind that would be hopefully reassuring for them."", 'David Cordani -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""A.J., good morning, it's David. You have a lot in that question and I appreciate it. Let me try to address some of the high points. But first and foremost, we are really pleased with the -- of the nature of the transaction we were able to structure with HCSC."", ""We see it as a win-win and it's a clarification to our strategy within our portfolio. As I noted in my prepared remarks, while we view the market as a attractive growth market, the required capital investment resources focus relative to its size within our portfolio, coupled with the continued elevated regulatory environment, our decision was it was best to enter this transaction. Two is, very importantly, we've been quite deliberate now for several years working to expand the service portfolio and the value proposition within Evernorth for our health plan partners as it relates to their government services, be it Medicare, be it duals, be it Medicaid, etc, and we're demonstrating a very attractive, proven track record of growing our government reach but through the services franchise. And we will continue to fuel that on a go-forward basis and see that as an attractive trajectory for us. As it relates to your -- latter part of your question, I'll reframe our M&A criteria. I want to make sure I put that in the context of our capital deployment criteria. We continue to view, first, capital deployment priorities investing in our business. Brian referenced the capex deployment of about $1.5 billion."", ""Second, we always evaluate M&A for its appropriate attributes, which I'll come back to in a moment. And then, third, returning capital to shareholders. And as Brian noted, in 2024, in addition to raising our dividend by 14%, we expect to return the majority of our excess capital to shareholders through share repurchase with at least $5 billion in the first half of the year. Lastly, in your action-packed question, as we think about the criteria for transactions, we think about three criteria: first, strategic attraction; second, financial attraction; and then third, overall path to clarity, so is it strategically aligned, is it financially attractive."", ""And as a final note, when we think about the -- the financial piece of the equation, you evaluate each deal on its own respective merits but seeking to get high visibility in terms of your value creation for your organization if you're going to enter into a transaction. So, to repeat, we're pleased with the decision and the transaction design. We will continue in a long-term service relationship with HCSC that further expands our proven track record within Evernorth. We see the Evernorth service portfolio as an attractive, capital-light, high-visibility way to grow this portfolio. And as we have in the past, we will maintain very strong discipline for capital deployment, and our 2024 capital deployment priorities are quite clear. Thanks."", 'A.J. Rice -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.', 'Stephen Baxter -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""Yeah, hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask another kind of quick follow-up on the Medicare Advantage. So, I would be curious if you'd be willing to share maybe your five- or 10-year view of the market. So, totally appreciate that, you know, it's a small part of your business before the sale, but you are still the eighth-largest plan in the country. Do you think market share and concentration is ultimately going to look much more like the commercial market than it does today? We'd love any kind of medium-term thoughts you could offer on the market."", 'Thanks.', 'David Cordani -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Stephen, good morning, it's David. You're asking for a 10-year crystal ball. I think in the dynamism of the marketplace most people come back to in terms of rolling three-year views of a given market. But -- but stepping back, first and foremost, the Medicare Advantage offering, broadly speaking, in the marketplace is a very attractive offering for seniors."", ""And it has a long-term proven track record of delivering attractive benefits and, importantly, clinical coordination when you get to the Medicare beneficiaries typically dealing with a higher level of clinical burden that's necessary for coordination. And the care outcomes, the quality outcomes, the overall value outcomes are positive. So, broadly speaking, from a societal standpoint, we see MA as an important asset for the U.S. to continue to -- continue to be served, supported financially, and grow. Secondly, the marketplace will see ebbs and flows in terms of the funding mechanism."", ""We see the early look at the rate letter. That's a moment in time -- that's a moment in time, either acceleration or potentially deceleration for that marketplace. Third is if you look at the senior satisfaction level, NPS broadly, Net Promoter Score, broadly, is attractive for Medicare Advantage. Therefore, as I noted previously to A.J.'s point, we've worked really aggressively to ensure that we have a broad and we will continue to broaden the portfolio of services in support of health plans and integrated value-based care providers to be in support of value-based care, be it for Medicare Advantage tools or the commercial population. So, we see the marketplace as a growth market. Its respective growth will ebb and flow depending on reimbursement, to some level from the government, lending toward benefit richness."", ""And then, ultimately, as you know, the last comment I would make is the -- the primary wave of the baby boomer aging has reached a peak and is slowing. It's still attractive, but that primary wave has reached its peak and is slowing somewhat. Taken as a whole, we see this as an expansion opportunity for Evernorth."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan. You may ask your question.', 'Lisa Gill -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Hi, thanks very much, and good morning. I want to focus on Evernorth and really just understand some of the key drivers as we think about 2024. So, first off, you talked about specialty in '23. Can you talk about what your expectations are around growth in specialty in '24, what you're doing around services? You touched a little bit on GLP-1, but you know, you have a really big contract with PNC coming on board, but you also had an overall good 2024 selling season."", 'So, any of the key elements you can help us to understand as to what the drivers are for that strong AOI growth in Evernorth?', 'Eric Palmer -- President and Chief Executive Officer, EverNorth Health Services', ""Thanks, Lisa. Good morning. It's Eric. A couple of different pieces in there, but first let me just talk a bit about the portfolio of services that we're focused on in terms of Evernorth, and then I'll transition that into some of the drivers of growth specifically for -- for 2024."", ""David noted in his prepared remarks a couple of highlights on capabilities we're growing, but I would -- I would call out we are seeing significant interest from the market around teams, helping to better coordinate individual point solutions and the -- and alleviate some of the burden that comes along with the fragmentation of how care is administered and how employers and plans are assembling care. So, us working to improve navigation and reduce point solution fatigue is a key item. Second of all, I would note behavioral care continues to be an area of focus, and there's meaningful opportunity for behavioral care to be better coordinated as there are significant co-morbidities with individuals with mental healthcare needs along with other care needs. And we're in a position to help with address -- address those challenges."", ""The third item that I note would be around specialty and, in particular, the opportunity for us to continue to grow as there are more therapies, more choices in the specialty market, as well as navigating through biosimilars. Overall, we're positioned really well to continue to drive affordability and choice in biosimilars. And as we've talked about previously, that's an important long-term multiyear tailwind in the economics and the growth of -- of Evernorth overall. And then, certainly the continued growth in therapies like GLP-1 is our -- as a -- is an area -- that's a factor in our proposition overall. So, when you put together that kind of -- I touched on a number of the different capabilities, you put together that suite of capabilities, that ends up being a really attractive portfolio that we've had, continued growth in the number of lines we're serving, growth in our clients' lines that enable us to -- to deliver the -- the numbers that we're -- we're talking about. Overall, really excited about the momentum we've got going into 2024 and see ourselves as well positioned to -- to deliver there and continue the trajectory beyond."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. You may ask your question.', 'George Hill -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', ""Yeah, good morning, guys. I guess just a couple of clarifying questions for me as it relates to MLR and the guide for '24. You guys have kind of bumped up the medical cost expectations. Can you kind of disaggregate what you're seeing by line of business there? And I just want to confirm that the MA business is still kind of included in the continuing ops in the MLR guidance for '24 because I saw in the footnotes it's kind of being carried as an asset held for sale."", ""So, just kind of, like, a disaggregation of kind of medical cost expectations and trends expectations for '24."", 'Brian Evanko -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Morning, George, it's Brian. So, let me just take the -- the MA question first, then I'll get into the MCR. So, as noted in my comments earlier, the Medicare Advantage business will continue to be reported through Cigna Healthcare through 2024. All of our guidance, whether that be the revenue guidance, the customer volume guidance, the earnings guidance, all assumes that the Medicare business will continue to be reported through Cigna Healthcare on an asset-held-for-sale basis. So, just to -- to clarify that, so all the metrics that you see line up with that -- that basis."", ""Within the MCR, specifically, the midpoint of our guide obviously has a slight uptick from where we were in 2023. Now, important to step back and think the 2023 MCR performance was favorable to the expectations and the primary driver of the Cigna Healthcare income outperformance. We're just really pleased with the -- both quarter and full year coming in favorable expectations. And as I mentioned earlier, the 81.3% full-year MCR was 70 basis points better than the midpoint of where we had started the guidance early in 2023."", 'So, you can think of the primary driver of the slightly higher projected 2024 MCR as being our stop loss products within the U.S. commercial employer business. As I mentioned earlier, these ran favorable to our target profit margins in 2023 due to lower-than-expected cost trends and high-dollar claimants. For 2024, our planning assumptions are for the stop loss products to normalize back into their typical target profit margin range.', ""Secondarily, there is some product mix shift within the Cigna Healthcare portfolio between 2023 and 2024 that will impact the overall Cigna Healthcare MCR. Although I would note that we expect the overall Cigna Healthcare profit margin percentage to be higher in 2024 compared to 2023. And we'd expect that to land near the low end of our targeted 9% to 10% range in 2024. And then, finally, when you think about our MCR guidance, as always, our guidance does have an appropriate level of prudence to start off the year."", 'George Hill -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question.', 'Josh Raskin -- Nephron Research -- Analyst', 'Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to get back to the Healthcare Services Corp. divestiture.', ""Why was the PDP asset included in that sale? I would have thought that that would have had strategic value on the Evernorth side and that you'd have an advantage on the cost structure. And then, similarly, including care allies as well, was that more a tie-in to the Medicare Advantage business? And what does that mean for broad sort of value-based care network development at Cigna?"", 'David Cordani -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Good morning, Josh. It's David. Let me take a portion of your question and then ask Eric to expand, and I'm going to add the latter piece of it. In terms of care allies and VBC, etc."", ""First, your statement is correct. Think about the care allies as specifically focused on the MA portion of value-based care. So, therefore, there's alignment there. Stepping back on value-based care, we have a long history and a proven track record of delivering very strong positive results for the benefit of our clients and our customers and patients off of our value-based care orientation for commercial, for individual exchange, as well as for Medicare Advantage. As you know from our prior conversations, that's been a partner and enabled model as opposed to an owned model, broadly speaking, in terms of owning the care delivery versus partnering enabling. Additionally, I'd ask you to think about the -- the commitment around that continuing."", 'So, our collaborative accountable care relationships for our commercial business and our exchange business continues on. And our investment in and expansion of our Evernorth accountable care of capabilities as we support healthcare delivery system partners around their value-based care, that continues, including our strategic partnership with Village. So, on the value-based care side of the equation, no change in strategy for us. This specific subset of our assets was solely aligned to the Medicare Advantage business.', ""I'll ask Eric to talk about the direction relative to PDP and our multi-dimensional services relationship there. Eric?"", 'Eric Palmer -- President and Chief Executive Officer, EverNorth Health Services', 'Thanks, David. Good morning, Josh. So, two things I would note for you, Josh, here. First of all, as I think David and Brian had in their prepared remarks, we will have a multiyear services relationship between Evernorth and HCSC building on a relationship that already exists there.', ""So -- so, Evernorth will have the opportunity to continue to provide services associated, not only with the prescription drug element of this business, but some of the other clinical coordination and related capabilities. So, we're excited about that opportunity and working to grow together. Specifically to the employer PDP item, you should think of here as Express Scripts continuing to be the face of the employer offerings and this being seamless with the -- with all of our clients and services with the -- the role that will be played here around the insurance dynamics going to HCSC. But -- but again, this will be a set of relationships that Express Scripts and Evernorth will continue to manage from a relationship and account management perspective. And we'll be -- continue to be very involved and an area of focus for us."", 'So, overall, very excited about the opportunity to continue to grow with another partner here.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. You may ask your question.', 'Scott Fidel -- Stephens, Inc. -- Analyst', ""All right, thanks. Good morning. I'm interested just now, with the sale of the MA business, how your priorities for investment and for growth in Cigna Healthcare may change from that. And, you know, obviously you talked about how you've invested, you know, a lot in Medicare, so that should free up capital to invest in other businesses."", ""So, curious in terms of how you're thinking about where you can increase investment for growth in Cigna Healthcare. But also, just you know, how -- how you're thinking about the exchange business now against the -- the exit from MA just around your overall, you know, risk business and Cigna Healthcare will now be probably more weighted toward ex, which is a pretty volatile business. So, you know, curious just on your thinking about, you know, the exchange business and sort of how you -- how now you're going to sort of view that business post the sell of MA."", 'David Cordani -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Scott, good morning. It's David. I think your umbrella tenet is -- is right. So, as I noted in my prepared remarks, the -- the decision allows for sharpening of focus as we -- as we lean into our portfolio going forward."", ""As you think about the investments, though, we've had -- we have a long track record of -- of making multiyear investments within our portfolio. So, think about investments in a digital-first orientation and data-led capabilities, continuing to invest in development of new programs and capabilities, be it what we talked about before with ClearCare or possible capabilities expanding the infrastructure and scale for broader addressable market expansion, and our proven CuraScript SD expansion as we face off and support a broadening array of healthcare professionals and integrated delivery systems. And I mentioned to Josh the Evernorth accountable care capability. So, think about, broadly speaking, our investment strategy continuing to fuel a variety of items, and finally, sustained affordability, be it on the medical cost, pharmacy cost, or administrative leverage that we get out of machine learning and AI through that lens. As it relates to the question around exchange or otherwise, we've always viewed the exchange business as sitting between commercial as well as the government. Obviously, the government influences a meaningful portion of that through the -- the benefit design and otherwise."", ""Yet, we are able to successfully leverage our collaborative accountable care relationships. And as we've demonstrated now for about a decade, with the exchange business, by taking a very targeted focus within that market from its inception in 2014 to today, we continue to see that as a complementary aspect to our business. We will take very targeted positions market by market as long as we have the right collaborative accountable care relationships in place and have it be a complementary part of our portfolio. So, I don't see the exchange posture is changing as a result of this. And broadly speaking, I don't think the investment strategy in the corporation changes is a result of it. It does create more capacity, though, as you articulated, to accelerate some of the categories I made reference to."", 'Hope that helps.', 'Scott Fidel -- Stephens, Inc. -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question.', 'Kevin Fischbeck -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Great, thanks. I was wondering if you could just give a little bit more color about the membership guidance for 2024 by product. I know repricing exchanges. How is commercial going within commercial the subsegments? And then -- and then, a little more color on the Medicare Advantage volume expectations as I guess that's in the guidance as well? Thanks."", 'Brian Evanko -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Morning, Kevin. It's Brian. So, as it relates to the net decline we have projected in the 2024 Cigna Healthcare customers, you can think of the primary driver of this being the individual exchange business. So, as we discussed late last year, we took some needed pricing actions in certain geographies in the individual exchange portfolio, and this will result in net customer declines for this business in 2024."", 'Within the U.S. commercial employer business, we expect customer volumes to be up modestly, but you should think of this by subsegment being split a bit. So, we expect to see a net decline in our national accounts business, but this will be more than offset by the continued strong growth within our select segment. And as a reminder, we continue to see opportunities for above market growth in the select segment where our market share is still just 7%. When you think about the MA customer volume specifically, as we approach the 2024 bid cycle, as we always do, we apply a local market county-level approach relative to how we price and set benefits. And so, for most geographies, this resulted in stable benefits.', ""A few areas, we had some targeted pullbacks just in light of the funding environment in 2024. And what we saw was in some of our local geographies, there was some very aggressive competitor behavior, which resulted in less net growth than what we had originally expected for the Medicare Advantage business. So, taken altogether, we would expect to see net customer volumes down slightly for year-end 2024 in comparison to year-end 2023 within the Medicare Advantage space specifically. But when you put all these pieces together, we're pleased with the overall balance in the Cigna Healthcare business right now as we expect to see profit margins expand year over year. As I mentioned earlier, while we're serving a meaningful volume of customers, that's grown markedly over the last two years."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.', 'Erin Wright -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', 'Great, thanks. On -- on Evernorth, how are you thinking about the implications of cost-plus models, and what that means at the PBM level, and how does that influence your discussions with customers, or -- or just around your pharmacy network relationships? And -- and just more broadly just around transparency, and obviously, you talked about that in your prepared remarks and more transparent offerings at the PBM level. And how do you think those offerings are gaining or not gaining traction across your -- your customer base? Thanks.', 'Eric Palmer -- President and Chief Executive Officer, EverNorth Health Services', ""Hi, Erin, it's Eric. First of all, you know, fundamentally, we start with a portfolio and an approach that's equipped to offer a choice and flexibility in how we work to support our clients. And so, that's the -- the lens I ground back to. We're always open to looking at new ways and approaches and such that drive increased affordability and meets the needs of our buyers. And I'm really proud of the range of different financing solutions we offer and the number of innovations that we've delivered in 2023 and already in 2024 in terms of the -- the types of options that we bring to -- to our clients."", ""And in fact, you know, as David mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we launched our ClearNetwork solution which was its first of its kind. It's a comprehensive and simple solution to providing a cost-index-based pharmacy network. Our solution is unique in that it provides access to all the drugs and pricing is based on independent, externally created cost indices, got a simple margin that's shared between us and the dispensing pharmacy. So, use that as an example. We had a lot of good conversations about that as a -- as a program and as an offering, but would note that the selling seasons for these -- these types of things tend to be long in time. There's a long lead time in terms of -- in terms of implementation and such."", ""So, some good conversation with our clients on solutions like that. Looking at other changes in the -- the -- the ecosystem, overall would note, our clients are demanding more for their healthcare dollars and are looking for ways to improve affordability overall and, broadly, are not interested in paying more for the same services that -- that they receive today. We've got a wide variety of networks and solutions that exist already in the market and the flexibility to adapt and adjust the configuration of our networks to trade off costs relative to, you know, the value and access profiles that exist. So, overall, we've got good flexibility, good capabilities, and modularity to be able to approach and line up our capabilities best with what our clients need."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.', 'Justin Lake -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', ""Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask a broader strategic question beyond MA. Most of your peers have set up their business models over the last, you know, five to 10 years to manage a significant amount of their internal healthcare spend, right, and drive additional profitability and revenue from those services businesses. So, with the sale of MA, you're repricing your exchanges, which makes sense, but your risk membership and the amount of medical costs you control, right, and are able to run through your services business just declines."", ""How do you think about the value there, those individual synergies of controlling medical costs and being able to provide services there and the natural growth that provides each and every year, versus having to go out into the market and win each and every piece of business approach, which obviously you've done pretty well over the last few years, but just you know, the -- the stability of kind of having that internal membership? And how should investors expect this to impact your capital deployment strategy going forward? Thanks."", 'David Cordani -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Justin, good morning. It's David. There's a lot in your question. Let me try to frame our thought process today and as we go forward."", ""First, to date, we have a very clear proven track record of delivering a total cost, total quality, including clinical quality and service quality solution that resonates really well in the marketplace, whether it's on the benefit side of the equation or in the services side of the equation. And our results reinforce that. Point two is we've successfully executed an approach that is on the delivery and fulfillment, a mix of partnered and owned. And we continue to evolve our portfolio. But philosophically, we do not believe -- have not, do not, and continue to -- to not believe that you have to own everything to be able to fulfill. As you might recall, if you reflect back on prior conversations within our portfolio at investor days, we framed actually the amount of services that Evernorth, for example, was fulfilling at a point in time for the Cigna Healthcare portfolio."", ""And we framed the expansion opportunity, to the point of your -- of your question, that existed in front of us. And we continue to expand those services. Our model, though, is also, importantly, not predicated on only having economic alignment for guaranteed cost. We're able to do it successfully for self-funded or shared funding mechanisms as well. So, point two is we see the ability to continue to grow that over time with our Evernorth services portfolio."", ""Point three is, as it relates to services to continue to invest in, we've been very clear that certain services we see additional step function opportunities to invest in and continue to grow. Most importantly, our proven scaled specialty capabilities, the rate of spending growth in clinical complexity around that is off the charts. We have a leadership position there that will continue to grow, and we will continue to be the market leader in that space through our assets. Secondly, we need statements around behavioral health in the most comprehensive way. The market expects now much more coordination of behavioral and physical health, and we will continue to expand services that we have within our leading capabilities."", ""And third, just to stop at three, for illustration, is the breadth of virtual services, the ability to connect and coordinate and expand services as we go forward. So, we agree with your point -- I'll end with agreement with your point of continuing to invest in our services capabilities to be able to support the right services, but we do not believe you have to own all aspects of the care delivery equation to be able to deliver that on a go-forward basis. So, hopefully, that gives you a framing. As you might expect, we'll spend time on this at our Investor Day on the seventh because it's an important part of our strategy today and an important part of our growth strategy going forward."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. You may ask your question.', 'Lance Wilkes -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', ""Great. Thanks a lot. Could you talk a little bit about over in the Cigna Healthcare Center, the business employer, how penetration rates are going with specialty products, in self-insured, and if there are any interesting trends as you go into '24 here or as you look at the selling season in '25 with respect to that? And then, as you've gone through the selling season, any changes in employer priorities? And then, also just a quick clarification on -- if you could just explain, there's a little drop in fees in the PBM. So, that one's just clarification."", ""The other one's the real question. Thanks."", 'Brian Evanko -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Morning, Lance. It's Brian. So, I'll take the majority of your question. I think there's a number of bits and pieces in there."", ""As it relates to the specialty products and the attachment, if you will, to the medical in the Cigna Healthcare book of business, as you know, has been a long-standing part of the company's strategy because we see the value of clinical integration being much greater when we have multiple components of a relationship with an employer. So, that's been, for many years, part of the company's strategy, and important to bifurcate that by subsegment, certainly in the down market, we call that flex segment under 500. Most of those employers tend to buy the entirety of our offerings at once. So, we have very high penetration rates in the under 500 and then comparatively lower when you get to the national account space where there tends to be a little bit more a la carte purchasing of the different services. So, broadly speaking, I would say those patterns haven't changed too much over the last few years."", ""And your question on the selling season, in particular, and some of the employer preferences, the 2024 selling season, you know, is largely over with the exception of the select segment. As I mentioned earlier, that's an area for us that continues to grow at above market rates, and we're really pleased with -- as we look forward to the '25 selling season, we do have some national account RFPs in-house for both some existing clients and new business prospects. And directionally, RFP volumes are up a bit from prior years. Now, each of these large clients, as you can appreciate, tend to have unique needs. That said, there are a few areas that I would highlight for purposes of kind of themes. So, one would be some of our larger employers are seeking to consolidate vendors or point solutions with those who can supply more integrated offerings. So, we tend to call that point solution fatigue, you may hear Eric or I talk about."", 'Secondly, a theme has been around mental health and substance abuse benefits as these programs have become more and more important to employers from the standpoint of managing productivity, absences, and overall health of their employee base. And thirdly, many of the larger employers are interested in digitally enabled care navigation capabilities to further power things like site of care optimization and consumer empowerment at the time that -- that care is delivered. So, we continue to see interest in those areas as well as various provider network configurations that may optimize cost quality and/or incentive alignment between the provider and the financier. So, our Cigna Healthcare offerings are really well positioned to address these themes and the demands from large employers while both simultaneously continue to grow share in the under-500 select segment. I think David wants to add a few comments here.', 'David Cordani -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Sure. Lance, good morning. Just to amplify and add one point, the amplification is that -- that point solution fatigue, that plays through in terms of opportunities for our Evernorth team as well as our Cigna Healthcare team. So, the -- around that, think about the ability to leverage solutions to get more value, better service, better clinical outcomes, overall value and affordability. Second, I just want to reinforce a critical point.', ""When we think about penetration or cross-selling, sometimes it's thought through -- and you didn't state this, but sometimes it's thought through under the notion of you're just cross-selling products. The integration of the products to deliver more value to the clients and customers is mission critical. So, that shows up in better service quality, better clinical quality, improved affordability. And I would -- I would highlight that our sustained differentiated MLR performance is, in many cases, aided by our proven ability to integrate certain services.

Thanks, Lance."", 'Lance Wilkes -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', 'Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with TD Cowen. You may ask your question.', 'Gary Taylor -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', ""Hi, good morning. David, I was hoping to ask an action-packed question like A.J. did, but I'm afraid I'm going to be too in the weeds for that. I just want to go back to stop loss because it looks like a pretty substantial benefit to the 4Q and headwind."", ""When I just look at how much your fourth-quarter MLR outperformed your typical seasonal pattern, particularly in a quarter where there was broad trend acceleration, and then I try to square how much A C enrollment and margin improvement should drive a tailwind, such that '24 MLR should actually decline year over year but you're guiding it up, I mean it gets me to hundreds and hundreds of basis points, you know, variance around stop loss. So, could you quantify how much that helps 4Q and how much of a headwind that is for '24? And then, the second part would just be walk us through again why you had such favorable performance in that line."", 'Brian Evanko -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Morning, Gary, it's Brian. So, as it relates to the stop loss book, as you know, this is a really important part of the Cigna Healthcare portfolio. And we finished 2023 with $6 billion of premium in that -- in that product line, which to the earlier question that Lance asked, attaches itself to our self-funded offerings in -- in many -- in many instances. This book will naturally have some variability to it."", ""So, I wouldn't get overly fixated on on one quarter's performance. There tends to be a little bit more settlement activity that transpires in the fourth quarter. So, we had a little bit more of the favorability work its way through in the quarter. Whereas if you smooth that over the course of the year, you don't have quite the same dynamic, which is one of the reasons why when you do the bridge from '23 to 24, you shouldn't run rate the fourth-quarter experience from -- from that standpoint. So, I mentioned earlier some of the moving pieces in the year-over-year MCR reconciliation, the 90 basis points increase from where we landed at the end of '23 to the midpoint of the '24 guide."", ""A key component of that 90 basis points is an uptick that was anticipated in the stop loss product MCRs which, to the point earlier, is a function of our assumption that that will normalize back to more traditional levels of profitability on the -- on the stop loss products. So, I think that's broadly the way I would encourage you to think about the -- the dynamics at play here with that product line."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our last question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question.', 'Dave Windley -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""Hi, thanks for seeing me and I appreciate that. The premise of my question here is that your Evernorth profit guidance for '24 looks pretty highly visible to us. So, my question is underneath that are, one, that you had guided '23 to include a ramping contribution from biosimilar. How should we expect that to continue? Should that continue to ramp in magnitude? And then, the second part was the significant onboarding costs for the Centene contract in '23."", 'Are you -- are you fully past those, or are those completely gone? Brian, you mentioned some Evernorth onboarding, maybe unrelated, but Evernorth onboarding in your -- your remarks. I just wanted to kind of understand the relative size of those. So, those two things, please.', 'David Cordani -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Good morning. It's David. Let me ask Brian to give you a framing in terms of -- because you have a question relative to the -- the trajectory and the year over year. And then, ask Brian to hand it across to Eric to give you a little bit more color of your question."", ""The onboarding costs, that were really intense during 2023. And then, some of what we're calling onboarding costs, that bleeds into the early part of 2024. I'll give you a little color of what those services look like, but I'll ask Brian to frame the financials first."", 'Brian Evanko -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, thanks, David. Good morning, Dave. So, overall, our AOI growth in Evernorth is expected to be about 9% as implied by the $7 billion or more of income that we expect in the year. And you can think of that as having the benefit of Centene-related costs now essentially normalizing back to a point where the profitability of that relationship will be in the range of breakeven. And then, on top of that, we will have income performance that's more in line with our traditional algorithm of 5% to 7% average annual income growth."", ""And that reflects the benefit of all the multiyear trends that Eric talked about earlier, whether those be biosimilars, GLP-1 drugs, specialty generics, etc. So, we certainly are seeing continued benefit from the biosimilar wave in 2024. But as I mentioned earlier, there's a bit of a specific and unique effect of the large amount of additional volume we're getting with the new client relationships in 2024. So, maybe, Eric, you can expand on that dynamic a bit."", 'Eric Palmer -- President and Chief Executive Officer, EverNorth Health Services', ""Great. Thanks, Brian. Good morning, Dave. So, with Centene, first, I would just start by actually noting how proud I am of how our team has delivered here and how we've worked collaboratively across and with the Centene team."", ""It's really been a great effort and one that's come together really nicely for the benefit of -- of our now-shared customers. Implementation has gone really well, and that first month has been quite -- quite successful. Now, consistent -- so, consistent with what we've said before and as Brian just noted, in 2023 we had meaningful implementation spending, no associated revenue, generated a loss. 2024, we have results that will be approximately breakeven. In 2025, we'd expect to achieve our run rate margin for this contract, which will be lower than the overall book of business."", ""With respect to the year -- in-year 2024 timing that Brian alluded to before, you should just think about this. There's a lot more activity that has to happen at the beginning of a contract like this. There's more client outreach. There's work to get individuals into their therapies etc. So, there's a normal effect here of just additional work, an activity that has to take place in the first part of the year, and our expenses will reflect that. So, that's -- that's a bit of that in-year shaping, but it's all consistent with what we had shared before."", ""The final thing I'd note is, consistent with our kind of normal practice now that Centene is a live client of ours, we won't be commenting going forward on specific profitability of a specific client or things along those lines. But know that the trajectory here start is -- is off to -- off to the same start we expected and consistent with what we had talked about previously."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.', 'David Cordani -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks. Just a couple messages to reiterate. First and foremost, 2023 was clearly a strong year of performance across our company as we executed quite well. And it's reinforced by more than a decade where we've executed consistently as we've evolved our company and continue to grow our business portfolio and those we serve."", ""We have confidence that we're going to sustain that momentum and leverage our well-balanced portfolio across our franchise and continue to deliver within our 10% to 13% long-term EPS growth range, as well as pay an attractive dividend. Finally, I want to thank my coworkers around the world for their continued disciplined execution, their passion, importantly, and their caring orientation, as well as dedication for those we serve. It shows up in our results. I'm really pleased and proud of what we delivered in 2023 and, importantly, even more excited for our expansion of our reach and impact in 2024."", ""As a final note for you all, we look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day which is a month away. So, in early March, we'll look forward to seeing you in New York City, and our team will be excited to talk about the market expansion we see in front of us, our capabilities, and our opportunity to create additional value on a go-forward basis.

Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Is TGT Worth Investing In?', 'In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Target, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.3% over the past month to $8.34.', ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Target.

All participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael McCarthy, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.', ""Michael McCarthy: Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Jason Liberty, our Chief Executive Officer; Naftali Holtz, our Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Bailey, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International. Before we get started, I’d like to note that we will be making forward-looking statements during this call. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release issued this morning as well as our filings with the SEC for a description of these factors."", 'We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as circumstances change. Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP items can be found on our Investor Relations website and in our earnings release. Unless we state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant currency adjusted basis. Jason will begin the call by providing a strategic overview and update on the business. Naftali will follow with a recap of our fourth quarter, the full year 2023, an update on the current booking environment and our outlook for 2024. We will then open the call for your questions. With that, I’m pleased to turn the call over to Jason.', ""Jason Liberty: Thank you, Michael, and good morning everyone. Before getting into the details, I would like to take a moment to reflect on last week's monumental launch of our new ship Icon of the Seas. Every once in a while a revolutionary product comes along that resonates so strongly and makes such a widespread impact, that it forever changes the status quo. For the vacation industry, that product, Icon of the Seas, debuted last week to incredible fanfare. Our mission at the Royal Caribbean Group is to deliver the best vacation experiences responsibly and Icon is going to deliver the best family vacation on the planet with her incredible experiences and amazing crew. I am absolutely thrilled that after years of planning and anticipation, Icon finally welcomed her first revenue guests on board this past weekend."", ""With a phenomenal guest engagement and word of mouth from this ship, along with our landmark sports partnership with Inter Miami and football GOAT, Lionel Messi, we look forward to making millions of vacation memories for our guests in the years ahead. A big thank you to our incredible team, who worked relentlessly over seven years dreaming, innovating and flawlessly delivering Icon of the Seas. So now let's talk about 2023 and 2024. 2023 was an exceptional year fueled by unmatched demand for our brands as you see on Slide 5. Net yields were up 13.5% compared to 2019, more than 3.5 times our January expectations, and we delivered margins that were back to record 2019 levels. Our net income exceeded our January expectations by about $1 billion, resulting in adjusted earnings per share more than double our January guidance."", ""We continued our focus on reshaping the cost structure across the operating platform, leading the durable margin expansion, which is expected to continue to provide operating leverage as we grow the business. Innovation is core to our company's DNA, and in 2023 we continue to direct that innovative spirit not only to our new ships and destinations, but also to an amazing guest experience at all points in the vacation journey. We received exceptionally high guest satisfaction scores and attracted a record number of both new and loyal guests who are rebooking at twice the rate we were seeing in 2019. The robust performance in 2023 significantly accelerated our trajectory towards our Trifecta goals, with EBITDA per APCD and ROIC on the cusp of our targets."", ""We also continued to invest in the future while making significant progress in strengthening the balance sheet towards our targets of investment grade metrics. The year ended on an incredible note, with revenue yields up nearly 18% in the fourth quarter, and 2024 is in the strongest book position in the company's history from both a pricing and volume standpoint. I am incredibly thankful and proud of everyone at the Royal Caribbean Group for executing so well and doing so while achieving strong financial results and propelling our future growth. Momentum continues in 2024 with a record breaking start to the Wave season. Bookings have consistently outpaced last year across all key products at much higher rates. In fact, the five highest booking weeks in our company's history all occurred since the last earnings call."", ""As a result, our capacity is up 8.5% year-over-year. We have less inventory available to book in 2024 than we did a year ago for 2023 and half as many staterooms left in Q1. Our commercial apparatus is full speed ahead and all channels are delivering quality demand above 2023 levels. Our direct-to-consumer channels continue to perform exceptionally well as consumer preferences for digital engagement and our ongoing investment in enhanced capabilities is supporting record breaking bookings. Our travel partners are also delivering meaningfully more bookings than last year and beating our elevated expectations. We continue to see particularly healthy demand from North America where about 80% of our guests will be sourced this year. Our brand's global appeal and nimble sourcing model allows us to attract the highest yielding guests by positioning our ships in multiple markets across the world."", 'Our brands lead in their respective segments and are very successful at capturing quality demand across sectors and sourcing from new consumer bases. As we think about consumer demand for 2024 and beyond, we look to both macro trends and data points for millions of daily interactions with our customers. We continue to see a very positive sentiment from our customers, bolstered by strong labor markets, high wages, surplus savings and elevated wealth levels. Year-over-year growth in spend on experiences is double that of spend on goods, and cruising remains an exceptional value proposition with lower penetration, higher consumer consideration and high purchase intent. We see an exceptionally engaged consumer base across markets, brands and products.', 'People are looking to book their dream vacation with us and continue to spend at elevated levels. Consumers are engaging in booking their vacations earlier. 70% book at least one of their onboard activities, pre-cruise at higher APDs and onboard spend continues at record levels and at higher rates. This positions us very well to outperform the broader travel industry and narrow the pricing gap to land based vacations. We continue to attract new customers into our vacation ecosystem and deliver the best vacation experiences, so that our guests are highly satisfied and continue to rebook and return to our brands and our products. 2024 is shaping up to be a record breaking year with 40% earnings growth as our progress continues on an accelerated path towards achieving our Trifecta goals.', 'As you can see in our release today, we expect to achieve several Trifecta targets in 2024, a full year earlier than previously anticipated. As I said in the past, Trifecta creates the pathway back to what we internally describe as base camp and while an important milestone, it is not our final destination as our ambitions go well beyond it. As highlighted on Slide 6, in 2024 we expect to grow capacity by 8.5% with the introduction of Utopia of the Seas and Silver Ray and the first full year of service of the three incredible ships that joined our fleet during 2023, Icon of the Seas, Celebrity Ascent and Silver Nova. New ships not only elevate our vacation experiences and draw new customers to our brands, but they also provide yield tailwinds and enhance overall profitability.', 'In 2024, we expect yields to grow 5.25% to 7.25%, driven by the performance of our entire fleet, new and existing ships, combined with our leading private destinations and strong commercial apparatus. Load factors and rate growth, together with continued focus on margins and disciplined capital allocation, are expected to drive record earnings that grow 40% year-over-year, getting us very close to our Trifecta targets. Our proven formula for success remains unchanged. Moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost controls lead to enhanced margins, profitability and superior financial performance. Our operating platform is bigger and stronger than ever. We have the leading brands in their respective segments, the best people and the best and most innovative fleet and destinations.', 'We remain intensely focused on delivering a lifetime of vacations for our guests and a long-term value for our shareholders. We are leading the vacation industry and creating exciting new products and experiences, which in 2024 include game-changing ships and the expansion of our highly rated destination, Perfect Day at CocoCay. Our new ships are performing exceptionally well and while we always expect to see strong trends when we introduce new ships, Icon of the Seas is definitely living up to her name and has taken things to a whole new level in every way. Demand and pricing for Icon has been incredibly strong. This year we are also thrilled to take delivery of the sixth Oasis class ship Utopia of the Seas, which will set the stage for the ultimate weekend getaway.', 'Lastly, we will take delivery of Silver Ray, the second ship in the evolution class, redefining ultra-luxury cruising. Silver Ray will debut in the Mediterranean this summer before transitioning to winter season in South America. New ships and their incredible innovative experiences further accelerate our efforts to steal market share from land based vacations. We completed the expansion of Hideaway Beach at Perfect Day at CocoCay just in time to welcome Icon of the Seas, upsizing the benefit of this strategic asset. Hideaway Beach is our newest adult-only ultimate beachfront paradise at Perfect Day at CocoCay, which expands our capacity on the island to over 3 million guests annually. About two thirds of Royal Caribbean International Caribbean guests will visit Perfect Day at CocoCay this year, allowing us to deliver high satisfaction scores and higher margins across the fleet.', 'Our journey to deepen the relationship with the customer continues this year. We will further enhance our commercial capabilities to optimize our distribution channels, build even more customer loyalty and lower our acquisition costs. The outsized increase in our onboard revenue over the past couple of years has been fueled by new capabilities introduced to make it easier for guests to pre book onboard experiences. We will continue to enhance those capabilities in 2024. About a third of onboard purchases are now coming through the mobile app and we already have about 40% more pre-cruise revenue booked in 2024 as compared to 2023. As a reminder, customers who purchase onboard experiences before their cruise, spend about two and a half times more than those who do not buy pre-cruise.', 'We will remove friction by investing in a modern digital travel platform, making it easier than ever for guests to book their dream vacations while allowing us to expand wallet share. We will also continue driving business excellence to increase yields and capture efficiencies across our platform. Our teams are committed to controlling costs and enhancing profitability while focusing on delivering the best guest experiences and doing so in a responsible way. Our sustainability ambitions help inform our strategic and financial decisions daily, ensuring that we always act responsibly while achieving our long-term profitability goals. We are making progress on our ""see the future commitment"" to sustain the planet, energize communities and accelerate innovation.', 'We wrapped the year on track to achieve our carbon intensity reduction targets and we are entering 2024 well beyond the halfway mark.', ""Celebrity Xcel: To wrap up, the future of the Royal Caribbean Group is exceptionally bright. With our strong operating platform and proven strategies, we are creating a lifetime of vacation experiences for our customers, while also delivering long-term shareholder value that allows us to reach new financial records. We are well positioned for continued growth in 2024 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it over to Naftali. Naf?"", 'Naftali Holtz: Thank you, Jason and good morning everyone. Let me start by reviewing the fourth quarter results. Our teams delivered yet another strong performance with adjusted earnings per share of $1.25 about 15% higher than the midpoint of our October guidance. All key products exceeded expectations, delivering double digit yield growth in the fourth quarter. Net yields were up almost 18% compared to 2019, and that would have been 20% if not for the 200 basis point drag from eliminating the reporting lag related to Silver Sea. Load factors were at 105% and rates were up approximately 19% with significant growth for both ticket and onboard revenue. Net cruise costs excluding fuel, increased 6.7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.', 'Since our last earnings call, the stock price appreciated over 50% and added 250 basis points to stock based compensation expense versus our prior guidance. Excluding the increase in stock based compensation, our costs came in in line with expectations. Our focus on enhancing profitability allowed us to deliver 30% adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter ahead of 2019 levels. We also utilized excess cash flow to pay down debt and lower interest expense consistent with our Trifecta goals.', 'NCCx: Now, switching to our 2024 outlook, I will start by taking you through capacity and deployment for the year. For the full year, our capacity is expected to be up 8.5% compared to 2023. This year we have almost twice as many drydock days compared to 2023, reducing APCD growth by 1% and resulting in a more pronounced capacity growth in the first and third quarter. APCDs are expected to grow around 10% in the first and third quarter, 5% in the second quarter and 8% in the fourth quarter. 2024 has consistently been in a strong booked position and as Jason mentioned, the year is off to a very strong start with a record Wave. As a result, both rates and volume are currently booked significantly ahead of same time last year. All key products, including the Caribbean, Europe, Alaska and Australia are booked nicely ahead of last year.', ""The Caribbean represents just over 55% of our deployment this year following a 13% increase in capacity year-over-year. The growth is due to the additions of Icon of the seas and Utopia of the Seas combined with Celebrity's upsized summer program. Supporting this increase in capacity is the addition of Hideaway Beach at Perfect Day at CocoCay. Our Caribbean programs are booked nicely ahead of last year in both rate and volume. While bookings and pricing for Icon can only be described as iconic and Utopia is demanding significant price premiums in the short Caribbean market, we are also very pleased with the trends we are seeing on existing hardware. Europe accounts for around 15% of our capacity following a 7% reduction year-over-year. At the time of our last earnings call, we were in the process of altering itineraries for European Mediterranean sailings that were previously expected to visit Israel, and we have since redeployed all ships with calls to Israel."", 'Regarding the situation in the Red Sea, the safety of our guests and crew is of top priority and we are constantly monitoring the situation. We only have a handful of repositioning cruises scheduled in the region this year and have already rerouted one of our Silver Sea ships and have contingency plans for a couple others in the spring. Regarding demand for Europe product more broadly, bookings were softer for the impacted itineraries for a few weeks last October, but rebounded relatively quickly and are now significantly higher than same time last year. As a result, our European sailings are booked nicely ahead of last year. We are also very pleased with the trends we are seeing on other North American itineraries. Alaska has been performing particularly well from both a rate and volume standpoint.', ""Alaska accounts for 6% of full year capacity and 15% in the all-important summer season. While our capacity for Alaska is only up slightly this year, we have made some exciting changes to our Alaska deployment. For the first time, Celebrity will offer incredible Alaska vacations on an edge class ship, Celebrity Edge and Silver Sea's newest ship, Silver Nova will also sail in Alaska. Asia-Pacific will account for 10% of our capacity. We are seeing strong pricing and demand trends for both Asia and China as we return to China with Spectrum of the Seas in the second quarter. Taking all this into account, if you turn to Slide 7, you will see our guidance for 2024. This will be the second full year on our path towards our Trifecta goals and our results remain ahead of track."", ""Net yields are expected to be up 5.25% to 7.25%, and that's following an exceptional 2023 that saw double digit yield growth that only accelerated as the year progressed. While the 2023 comparable set a high bar, full year yield growth is being fueled by our incredible new hardware, higher load factors, higher pricing, the expansion of Perfect Day at CocoCay and further advancements in our commercial capabilities. Now moving to costs, our focus remains to enhance margins as we continue to grow the business. Full year net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up 3.75% to 4.25% and that includes approximately 315 basis points impact from increased drydock days and the operations of Hideaway Beach. The majority of our drydocks are in late first quarter and early second quarter, which will mostly weigh on our first half costs."", ""The remaining drydocks will be in the fourth quarter. We anticipate a fuel expense of $1.16 billion for the year and we are 61% hedged at below market rates. This year we'll also see the introduction of the EU emission tax scheme which will apply to 40% of our European itineraries related emissions and we do not expect this to significantly weigh on earnings. Based on current fuel prices, currency exchange rates and interest expense, we expect record adjusted earnings per share between $9.50 and $9.70. Turning to first quarter guidance as summarized on Slide 8, in the first quarter, about 73% of our capacity will be in the Caribbean, 18% in Asia-Pacific, and the remaining capacity is spread across a number of other itineraries, including South America and expedition cruises."", 'Booked load factors and rates are at record levels and are both up significantly versus same time last year. As you can see from our guidance, we expect significant yield growth for the first quarter, driven by full load factor recovery and the annualization of the strong pricing trends which begin at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Net yields are expected to be up approximately 15% for the first quarter, with both Caribbean and Australian itineraries driving the growth in yield. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up in the range of 7.1% to 7.6% and include 380 basis points impact from increased drydocks and costs related to operating Hideaway Beach. We also have approximately 200 basis points of costs in the first quarter related to the startup of Icon as well as higher load factors as compared to Q1 2023.', 'Taking all this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the quarter to be $1.10 to $1.20. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in liquidity. During the fourth quarter, we refinanced our revolving credit facilities and term loan and repaid the remaining $500 million of our 11.5 senior secured notes. We settled our 2.875% convertible notes in November by utilizing $225 million of cash and issuing just under 147,000 shares. We made significant progress during 2023, strengthening the balance sheet towards our Trifecta goal of investment grade metrics. Better performance and disciplined capital allocation allowed us to accelerate reduction in leverage to around 4 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA at yearend when excluding the impact of new ships that were delivered midyear.', 'We will continue to proactively pay down debt and pursue opportunistic refinancings and expect to further reduce leverage to close to mid-3 times by the end of 2024. Our priorities to address debt remained unchanged, managing debt maturities, reducing interest expense and removing remaining restriction on capital allocation, and towards a fully unsecured balance sheet. In closing, we remain committed and focused on executing our strategy and delivering on our mission while achieving our Trifecta goals. Trifecta creates the pathway back to basecamp and while an important milestone is not our final destination, as our ambitions go well beyond it. The combination of our strong book position and an accelerating demand environment is certainly pointing to another strong year of yield growth and a step change in earnings growth.', 'With that, I will ask our operator to open the call for a question-and-answer session.', 'See also 30 Highest Paying Part Time Jobs for 16 Year Olds and 12 Best Foreign Dividend Stocks To Invest In.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 6.7% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $133.77 in the previous session.

In its last earnings report on February 1, 2024, Royal Caribbean reported EPS of $1.25 versus consensus estimate of $1.13 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 1.34%."", 'For the current fiscal year, Royal Caribbean is expected to post earnings of $9.15 per share on $15.92 billion in revenues. This represents a 35.16% change in EPS on a 14.54% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $10.85 per share on $17.36 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 18.57% and 9.06%, respectively.', 'Valuation Metrics', 'Royal Caribbean may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.', 'On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.', ""Royal Caribbean has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A."", ""In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 13.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 16.7X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 9.6X versus its peer group's average of 8.7X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective."", 'Zacks Rank', 'We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Royal Caribbean currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.', 'Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Royal Caribbean fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Royal Caribbean shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.', 'How Does RCL Stack Up to the Competition?', 'Shares of RCL have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is OneSpaWorld Holdings Limited (OSW). OSW has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of D.', 'Earnings were strong last quarter. OneSpaWorld Holdings Limited beat our consensus estimate by 29.41%, and for the current fiscal year, OSW is expected to post earnings of $0.76 per share on revenue of $796.96 million.', 'Shares of OneSpaWorld Holdings Limited have gained 0.5% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 18.45X and a P/CF of 34.98X.', 'The Leisure and Recreation Services industry is in the top 41% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for RCL and OSW, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We will then open the call for your questions.With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Jason."", 'Jason T. Liberty', ""Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Before getting into the details, I would like to take a moment to reflect on last week's monumental launch of our new ship, Icon of the Seas. Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that resonates so strongly and makes such a widespread impact that if forever changes the status quo. For the vacation industry, that product, Icon of the Seas debuted last week to incredible fanfare.Our mission at the Royal Caribbean Group is to deliver the best vacation experiences responsibly and Icon is going to deliver the best family vacation on the planet with her incredible experiences and amazing crew. I'm absolutely thrilled that after years of planning and anticipation, Icon finally welcomed her first revenue guests on board this past weekend.With the phenomenal guest engagement and word of mouth from this ship, along with our landmark sports partnership with Inter Miami and football GOAT Lionel Messi, we look forward to making millions of vacation memories for our guests in the years ahead. A big thank you to our incredible team who worked relentlessly over 7 years, dreaming, innovating and flawlessly delivering, Icon of the Seas.So now let's talk about 2023 and 2024. 2023 was an exceptional year fueled by unmatched demand for our brands, as you see on Slide 5. Net yields were up 13.5% compared to 2019, more than 3.5x our January expectations, and we delivered margins that were back to record 2019 levels. Our net income exceeded our January expectations by about $1 billion, resulting in adjusted earnings per share more than double our January guidance. We continued our focus on reshaping the cost structure across the operating platform, leading the durable margin expansion, which is expected to continue to provide operating leverage as we grow the business.Innovation is core to our company's DNA. And in 2023, we continue to direct that Innovate Spirit, not only to our new ships and destinations, but also to an amazing guest experience at all points in the vacation journey. We received exceptionally high guest satisfaction scores and attracted a record number of both new and loyal guests who are rebooking at twice the rate we were seeing in 2019. The robust performance in 2023 significantly accelerated our trajectory towards our Trifecta goals with EBITDA per APCD and ROIC on the cusp of our targets. We also continued to invest in the future while making significant progress in strengthening the balance sheet towards our targets of investment-grade metrics.The year ended on an incredible note with revenue yield of nearly 18% in the fourth quarter and 2024 is in the strongest book position in the company's history, from both a pricing and volume standpoint. I'm incredibly thankful and proud of everyone at the Royal Caribbean Group for executing so well and doing so while achieving strong financial results and propelling our future of growth.Momentum continues in 2024 with a record-breaking start to the wave season. Bookings have consistently outpaced last year across all key products at much higher rates. In fact, the 5 highest booking weeks in our company's history all occurred since the last earnings call. As a result, while our capacity is up 8.5% year-over-year, we have less inventory available to book in 2024 than we did a year ago for 2023 and half as many state rooms left in Q1.Our commercial apparatus is full speed ahead, and all channels are delivering quality demand above 2023 levels. Our direct-to-consumer channels continue to perform exceptionally well as consumer preferences for digital engagement and our ongoing investment and enhanced capabilities is supporting record-breaking bookings. Our travel partners are also delivering meaningfully more bookings than last year and beating our elevated expectations. We continue to see particularly healthy demand from North America where about 80% of our guests will be sourced this year. Our brands, global appeal and nimble sourcing model allows us to attract the highest-yielding guests by positioning our ships in multiple markets across the world. Our brands lead in their respective segments and are very successful at capturing quality demand across sectors and sourcing from new consumer bases.If you think about consumer demand for 2024 and beyond, we look to both macro trends and data points for millions of daily interactions with our customers. We continue to see a very positive sentiment from our customers bolstered by strong labor markets, high wages, surplus savings and elevated wealth levels. Year-over-year growth in spend on experiences is double that of spend on goods and cruising remains an exceptional value proposition with lower penetration, higher consumer consideration and high purchase intent. We see an exceptionally engaged consumer base across markets, brands and products. People are looking to book their dream vacation with us and continue to spend at elevated levels.Consumers are engaging and booking their vacations earlier, 70% book at least one of their onboard activities pre-cruise at higher APDs and onboard spend continues at record levels and at higher rates. This positions us very well to outperform the broader travel industry and now were the pricing gap to land-based vacation. We continue to attract new customers into our vacation ecosystem and deliver the best vacation experiences so that our guests are highly satisfied and continue to rebook and return to our brands and our products.2024 is shaping up to be a record-breaking year with 40% earnings growth as our progress continues on an accelerated path towards achieving our Trifecta goals. As you can see in our release today, we expect to achieve several Trifecta targets in 2024, a full year earlier than previously anticipated. As I said in the past, Trifecta creates the pathway back to what we internally describe as base camp. And while an important milestone, it is not our final destination as our ambitions go well beyond it.As highlighted on Slide 6, in 2024, we expect to grow capacity by 8.5% with the introduction of Utopia of the Seas and Silver Ray and the first full year of service of the 3 incredible ships that joined our fleet during 2023. Icon of the Seas, Celebrity Ascent and Silver Nova. New ships not only elevate our vacation experiences and draw new customers to our brands, but they also provide yield tailwinds and enhance overall profitability.In 2024, we expect yields to grow 5.25% to 7.25%, driven by the performance of our entire fleet, new and existing ships combined with our leading private destinations and strong commercial apparatus. Load factors and rate growth, together with continued focus on margins, and disciplined capital allocation are expected to drive record earnings that grow 40% year-over-year, getting us very close to our Trifecta targets.Our proven formula for success remains unchanged. Moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost controls lead to enhanced margins, profitability and superior financial performance.Our operating platform is bigger and stronger than ever. We have the leading brands in their respective segments, the best people and the best and most innovative fleet and destinations. We remain intensely focused on delivering a lifetime of vacations for our guests and a long-term value for our shareholders. We are leading the vacation industry and creating exciting new products and experiences which in 2024 include game-changing ships and the expansion of our highly rated destination, Perfect Day at CocoCay. Our new ships are performing exceptionally well. And while we always expect to see strong trends when we introduce new ships. Icon of the Seas is definitely living up to her name and has taken things to a whole new level in every way.Demand and pricing for Icon has been incredibly strong. This year we are also thrilled to take delivery of the sixth Oasis-class ship, Utopia of the Seas, which will set the stage for the ultimate weekend getaway. Lastly, we will take delivery of Silver Ray, the second ship in the evolution class, redefining ultra-luxury cruising. Silver Ray will debut in the Mediterranean this summer before transitioning to winter season in South America. New ships and their incredible innovative experiences further accelerate our efforts to steal market share from land-based vacations.We completed the expansion of Hideaway Beach at Perfect Day at CocoCay, just in time to welcome Icon of the Seas, upsizing the benefit of this strategic asset. Hideaway Beach is our newest adult-only ultimate beachfront paradise at Perfect Day at CocoCay, which expands our capacity on the Island to over 3 million guests annually. About 2/3 of World Caribbean International Caribbean guests will visit Perfect Day at CocoCay this year, allowing us to deliver high satisfaction scores and higher margins across the fleet. Our journey to deepen the relationship with the customer continues this year. We will further enhance our commercial capabilities to optimize our distribution channels build even more customer loyalty and lower acquisition costs. The outsized increase in our onboard revenue over the past couple of years has been fueled by new capabilities introduced to make it easier for guests to pre-book onboard experiences. We will continue to enhance those capabilities in 2024.About 1/3 of onboard purchases are now coming through the mobile app, and we already have about 40% more pre-cruise revenue booked in 2024 as compared to 2023. As a reminder, customers who purchase onboard experiences before their cruise spend about 2.5x more than those who do not buy pre-cruise. We will remove friction by investing in a modern digital travel platform, making it easier than ever for guests to book their dream vacations by allowing us to expand wallet share. We will also continue driving business excellence to increase yields and capture efficiencies across our platform. Our teams are committed to controlling costs and enhancing profitability while focusing on delivering the best guest experiences and doing so in a responsible way.Our sustainability ambitions helping to form our strategic and financial decisions daily, ensuring that we always act responsibly while achieving our long-term profitability goals. We're making progress on our see the future commitment to sustain the planet, energize communities and accelerate innovation. We wrapped the year on track to achieve our carbon intensity reduction targets, and we are entering 2024 well beyond the halfway mark. To make this possible, we continue to accelerate innovations like the first methanol capable tri-fuel engine that we expect to debut on the Celebrity Xcel in 2025.Every new ship represents an advancement in our energy transition efforts. The game-changing Icon of the Seas exceeds industry standards for energy efficiency by 24%. Icon and the recently launched Silver Nova also allow us to take advantage of new technologies such as innovative waste-to-energy systems on board. By consistently using our latest ships to pilot new technologies, we can validate the decisions we are making now to help position us to achieve our Destination net-zero targets by 2050.To wrap up, the future of the Royal Caribbean Group is exceptionally bright. With our strong operating platform and proven strategies, we are creating a lifetime of vacation experiences for our customers while also deliver long-term shareholder value that allows us to reach new financial records. We are well positioned for continued growth in 2024 and beyond.And with that, I'll turn it over to Naftali. Naf?"", 'Naftali Holtz', ""Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by reviewing fourth quarter results. Our teams delivered yet another strong performance with adjusted earnings per share of $1.25, about 15% higher than the midpoint of our October guidance. All key products exceeded expectations, delivering double-digit yield growth in the fourth quarter. Net yields were up almost 18% compared to 2019, and that would have been 20%, if not for the 200 basis point drag from eliminating the reporting lag related to Silversea. Load factors were at 105% and rates were up approximately 19% with significant growth for both ticket and onboard revenue.Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, increased 6.7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Since our last earnings call, the stock price appreciated over 50% and added 250 basis points to stock-based compensation expense versus our prior guidance. Excluding the increase in stock-based compensation, our costs came in, in line with expectations. Our focus on enhancing profitability allowed us to deliver 30% adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter ahead of '19 levels. We also utilized excess cash flow to pay down debt and lower interest expense, consistent with our Trifecta goals.2023 was an exceptional year, as you can see on Slide 5. We generated almost $14 billion of total revenue, $4.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA and [$4.4 billion] of operating cash flow. Net cruise costs excluding fuel, increased 7.9% compared to '19. NCCx also included approximately 65 basis points higher costs related to increase in stock-based compensation versus our prior guidance. Our cost performance reflects the continued and durable benefit from all the actions we have taken over the last several years to support enhanced margins. Our proven formula for success also drove $6.77 in adjusted earnings per share that were more than twice our initial expectations in January.Now switching to our 2024 outlook. I will start by taking you through capacity and deployment for the year. For the full year, our capacity is expected to be up 8.5% compared to 2023. This year, we have almost twice as many dry dock days compared to '23, reducing APCD growth by 1% and resulting in a more pronounced capacity growth in the first and third quarter. APCDs are expected to grow around 10% in the first and third quarter, 5% in the second quarter and 8% in the fourth quarter.2024 has consistently been in a strong booked position. And as Jason mentioned, the year is off to a very strong start with a record wave. As a result, both rates and volume are currently booked significantly ahead of the same time last year. All key products, including the Caribbean, Europe, Alaska and Australia, are booked nicely ahead of last year. The Caribbean represents just over 55% of our deployment this year, following a 13% increase in capacity year-over-year. The growth is due to the additions of Icon of the Seas and Utopia of the Seas combined with celebrities upsized summer program.Supporting this increase in capacity is the addition of Hideaway Beach at Perfect Day at CocoCay. Our Caribbean programs are booked nicely ahead of last year in both rate and volume. While bookings and pricing for Icon can only be described as iconic and Utopia is demanding significant price premiums in the short Caribbean market. We are also very pleased with the trends we are seeing on existing hardware.Europe accounts for around 15% of our capacity following a 7% reduction year-over-year. At the time of our last earnings call, we were in the process of altering itineraries for European Mediterranean sailings that were previously expected to visit Israel, and we have since redeployed all ships with coals to Israel. Regarding the situation in the Red Sea, the safety of our guests and crew is of top priority, and we are constantly monitoring the situation. We only have a handful of repositioning cruises scheduled in the region this year and have already rerouted one of our Silversea ships and have contingency plans for a couple of others in the spring.Regarding demand for Europe product more broadly, bookings were softer for the impacted itineraries for a few weeks last October, but rebounded relatively quickly and are now significantly higher than same time last year. As a result, our European sailings are booked nicely ahead of last year.We are also very pleased with the trends we are seeing on other North American itineraries. Alaska has been performing particularly well from both a rate and volume standpoint. Alaska accounts for 6% of full year capacity and 15% in the all-important summer season. While our capacity for Alaska is only up slightly this year, we have made some exciting changes to our Alaska deployment. For the first time, Celebrity will offer incredible Alaska vacations on an edge-class ship, Celebrity Edge, and Silversea's new ship, Silver Nova will also sail in Alaska.Asia Pacific will account for 10% of our capacity. We are seeing strong pricing and demand trends for both Asia and China as we return to China with Spectrum of the Seas in the second quarter. Taking all this into account, if you turn to Slide 7, you will see our guidance for 2024. This will be the second full year on our path towards our Trifecta goals, and our results remain ahead of track. Net yields are expected to be up 5.25% to 7.25%, and that's following an exceptional 2023 that saw double-digit yield growth that only accelerated as the year progressed. While the 2023 comparable set a high bar, full year yield growth is being fueled by our incredible new hardware, higher load factors, higher pricing, the expansion of Perfect Day at CocoCay and further advancements in our commercial capabilities.Now moving to costs. Our focus remains to enhance margins as we continue to grow the business. Full year net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up 3.75% to 4.25% and that includes approximately 315 basis points impact from increased dry dock days and the operations of Hideaway Beach. The majority of our dry docks are in late first quarter and early second quarter, which will mostly weigh on our first half costs. The remaining dry docks will be in the fourth quarter.We anticipate a fuel expense of $1.16 billion for the year, and we are 61% hedged at below market rates. This year, we'll also see introduction of the EU emission tax scheme, which will apply to 40% of our European itineraries related emissions, and we do not expect this to significantly weigh on earnings. Based on current fuel prices, currency exchange rates and interest expense, we expect a record adjusted earnings per share of $9.50 and $9.70. Turning first quarter guidance as summarized on Slide 8. In the first quarter, about 73% of our capacity will be in the Caribbean, 18% in Asia Pacific, and the remaining capacity is spread across a number of other itineraries, including South America and Expedition Cruises. Book load factors and rates are at record levels and are both up significantly versus same time last year.As you can see from our guidance, we expect significant yield growth for the first quarter, driven by full load factor recovery and the annualization of the strong pricing trends, which began at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Net yields are expected to be up approximately 15% for the first quarter with both Caribbean and Australian itineraries driving the growth in yield.Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, expected to be up in the range of 7.1% to 7.6%, and include 380 basis points impact from increased dry docks and costs related to operating Hideaway Beach. We also have approximately 200 basis points of cost in the first quarter related to the start-up of Icon as well as higher load factors as compared to Q1 2023. Taking all this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the quarter to be $1.10 to $1.20.Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in liquidity. During the fourth quarter, we refinanced our revolving credit facilities and term loan and repaid the remaining $500 million of our 11.5% senior secured notes. We settled our 2.875% convertible notes in November by utilizing $225 million of cash and issuing just under 147,000 shares. We made significant progress during 2023, strengthening the balance sheet towards our Trifecta goal of investment-grade metrics. Better performance and disciplined capital allocation allowed us to accelerate reduction in leverage to around 4x total debt to adjusted EBITDA at year-end when excluding the impact of new ships that were delivered mid-year.We will continue to proactively pay down debt and pursue opportunistic refinancings and expect to further reduce leverage to close to mid-3x by the end of 2024. Our priorities to address debt remained unchanged, managing debt maturities, reducing interest expense and removing remaining restriction on capital allocation and towards a fully unsecured balance sheet.In closing, we remain committed and focused on executing our strategy and delivering on our mission while achieving our Trifecta goals. Trifecta creates a pathway back to base camp. And while an important milestone is not our final destination as our ambitions go well beyond it. The combination of our strong book position and an accelerating demand environment is certainly pointing to another strong year of yield growth and a step change in earnings growth.With that, I will ask our operator to open the call for a question-and-answer session."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions)Our first question comes from the line of Steven Wieczynski with Stifel.', 'Steven Moyer Wieczynski', ""Congratulations on a strong 2023 and the launch of Icon. So as we think about your guidance for this year, specifically thinking about yields, just wondering if you could break down that yield guidance a little bit for us. Essentially, just trying to figure out what you guys have included in the terms of things like core pricing, your occupancy ramp, obviously, you've got new hardware in CocoCay as well. And then maybe how you're thinking about onboard yields this year? And then finally there, maybe help us think about the cadence of yield for this year as this guide might make some believe there's a potential for slowing in the back half of the year, but I would assume that's just more lack of visibility and tougher comps with load factors."", 'Jason T. Liberty', ""Well, thanks, Steven, and good morning, everybody. I think you pointed to a lot of things there. So first, obviously, 2023 was an incredibly strong year on both a ticket and onboard standpoint. Q1, the strong yield, as Naf commented, is driven by having a kind of full period with the pricing that we saw in the ramp-up starting in the middle of the first quarter of last year and then the recovery of the load factor. There is nothing that we see in the booking environment or onboard spend that doesn't point towards acceleration. And so -- our formula for success, which is moderate yield growth and good cost control is very much how we see Q2 forward. And -- but when we look at things, whether it's the new hardware, whether it's like-for-like, whether it's onboard spend, all those things are pointing north on a positive basis in terms of what we're seeing in the booking environment. And I think that's -- there shouldn't be any concern at this point in terms of when we see that there's any slowdown occurring in our business Q2 forward."", 'Steven Moyer Wieczynski', ""Okay. Got you. That makes sense. And then Jason, as we think about your Trifecta goals, you're essentially knocking off 2 of those goals this year with a strong possibility that you're third Trifecta goal getting north of $10 a share in earnings is probably a very high probability based on what we're seeing right now based on what you're seeing right now. So Jason, I know you talked about Trifecta being what you call base camp. But I guess the question is, really where do you guys go from here? I mean if Trifecta goals R&D base camp, do you start to think about introducing at some point, something that moves you well beyond base camp? And then maybe help us think about the return to investment grade and how you and your agency partners are thinking about that timeline as well?"", 'Jason T. Liberty', ""Sure. Well, I'll let Naf take the investment-grade question. We are an organization I think that does really well with kind of 2-, 3-year targets. And we can see that obviously here when we consider Trifecta, getting the hearts and minds of our organization. It really focusing on delivering strong returns for our shareholders. And also an incredible guest experience while also lightening our impact on the planet all these things are so heavily in the consideration of what we do each and every day. As we get closer to achieving Trifecta, we will evaluate what's the next program -- financial performance program that we're going to put out there that we think is important not just to make sure management is focused on what it is we're looking to achieve, but also to make sure everybody understands where we're navigating to.But if you just run the math on moderate yield growth, good cost control while we moderately grow our business while continuing to invest in destinations and so forth. That math will tell you that we're in a -- we will be in a very strong financial performance on an earnings basis, ROIC basis as well as a margin basis. And all those things, I think, are really important as we consider how disciplined we have been on capital and also will be in the consideration set as we think about returning capital to shareholders as we 0 in on getting to investment-grade metrics. But I'll hold here for Naf to talk about investment grade."", 'Naftali Holtz', ""Thanks, Jason. Steve, so on the balance sheet, part of Trifecta is getting back to investment-grade metrics, and we're really focused on that. And as you could see in our -- and we've announced for the results last -- in 2023, we made significant progress in that direction. We lowered our cost of capital. We repaid roughly $4 billion of debt with excess cash flow because as we saw the performance accelerate our formula of just being disciplined around capital allocation allowed us to pay down debt faster than we thought. And we'll continue to do that this year. And in my remarks, I said that we'll be very close to the leverage levels that we have in the targets.In addition to that, we also want to unsecure the balance sheet, and that will come as some of the notes that we had to issue, either secured or guaranteed, have the opportunity to refinance those or pay them down. With regards to the rating agencies, we're very close contact with the rating agencies. We were very pleased with the credit upgrades that the rating upgrades that we had last year. We are focused on making sure that we have the balance sheet, we are comfortable operating under, and that's really where the goals are. And then we'll continue to be in close contact with the agencies as we make progress on that, but we're not focused necessarily on the ratings really and the metrics there."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.', 'Robin Margaret Farley', ""I wanted to ask, you alluded to potential changes with some of the itineraries in the Red Sea. Is it fair to say that your guidance stay your EPS guidance for '24, already includes what you think you may have to do in terms of rerouting anything that would be transiting there? I wonder if you can help us quantify what kind of -- if there's downside that's really baked into your EPS guidance for that? And then I do have a follow-up, but I'll start with that one."", 'Jason T. Liberty', ""Yes. Well, thanks for the question, Robin. And I think just as we talk about how we guide, our guidance does not plan for perfection. And so when we consider things like the Red Sea and there are things that come up from time to time within the course of the year -- we very much kind of take those kind of things into account. And so I don't think we think the handful of sailings that will sail through -- we're expecting the sail through the Suez is something that's going to impact our guidance at this point in time. And I think that's how we just generally set up our guidance to not plan for perfection."", 'Robin Margaret Farley', ""Okay. Perfect. And then I don't know if you have any initial thoughts on potential tax changes in the global minimum tax and how that might impact you given your incorporation and your itineraries and kind of anything that you may be able to do to mitigate that?"", 'Naftali Holtz', ""Robin, so yes, the global minimum tax is obviously out there and it's been there for quite some time. If we -- so we continue to evaluate it and if we do nothing, that doesn't really impact us until 2026, so that's important. And of course, we believe that we can do with some mitigations -- mitigate a majority of that impact. So that's kind of on that."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Brandt Montour with Barclays.', 'Brandt Antoine Montour', ""Congrats on the results this morning. So the first one is given the European slowdown in bookings that you saw in sort of November, which is great to hear that, that came back. But taking into account the seasonality of Europe and thinking about yields for the back half or sort of for the balance of this year that's baked into your full year guide. Is it fair to assume that the yield growth cadence for the balance of the year will sort of correlate with the quarters that are strongest in the Caribbean, right, given you have Hideaway Beach and Icon on sailing there. Just anything else you can help us to think about how that cadence will progress."", 'Jason T. Liberty', ""Well, one, we're very happy that the demand for Europe came back and we saw this acceleration soon after our last call. I really don't think anybody should be reading into any concern around Q2 going forward in terms of any kind of slowdown. We're seeing an acceleration in pricing and volumes from all of our key markets for all of our key deployments. And obviously, the first quarter is higher because of what I talked about with load factor, the normalization of rate. So I would just leave it that. We expect Q2 forward, continue to be strong and our yields to grow across like-for-like new hardware onboard, et cetera. Of course, we are lapping, as you commented, Brandt, on some very high comps year-over-year. And I think that's an important line to appreciate."", 'Brandt Antoine Montour', ""Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then my second question is on the book position. Record book, the commentary, obviously upbeat in your release in your prepared remarks. Are you willing to sort of give us a sense for how much of the first half or the full year is booked at this time and how much different that is year-over-year? And to the extent that you don't want to answer that, I would also just be curious if you want to refresh your sort of philosophy on the optimal curve, right? And if you're at that point where you wouldn't want to become any more booked unless you leave money on the table or how you're thinking about that revenue management strategy?"", 'Jason T. Liberty', ""Well, I'll start off with the latter. I mean, I think on an optimal curve, the answer is we always get it wrong. It's -- there are always estimates. We do not give out the percent booked that we're in, but it is meaningfully higher, obviously, than last year for sure and also versus our highs in 2019. We have installed very sophisticated yield management systems, those yield management systems have -- we've obviously seen them perform exceptionally well in 2023 and what we're now seeing here in 2024 through WAVE, and they continue to allow us to get more and more share of the wallet. And also taking those practices in which we also saw this last year and feeding them into our onboard activities, our pre-cruise sales activities is also something why -- I think as we look at the 2023 results and what we're seeing in the 2024 estimates on the top line is what's causing just, I think, continued outperformance."", 'Naftali Holtz', ""Yes. Just one other comment, not just on the volume, but also the pricing. Obviously, we are on more booked versus last year on the volume but also on the pricing level as well. So we're very encouraged where we are."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.', 'Matthew Robert Boss', ""Congrats on another great quarter. So 2-part question. Jason, when you talked about taking things to a whole new level, could you size up where you stand today versus the larger total addressable market share opportunity? And maybe you see beyond cruise and just the multigenerational customer base that you're attracting? And then for Naftali, maybe just how best to think about the breakdown of the 4% cost guide this year and multiyear what you see as the right run rate for costs going forward?"", 'Jason T. Liberty', ""Yes. Well, I'll start off, Matt, by -- I think it's important to understand what our orientation is. Our orientation is experiences. We keep trying to advance experiences that our customers are not only do they desire, but they're also willing to pay for. And so when you have an experienced mine focus, obviously, there are a lot of things that we're adding on to our ships. I think Icon is an incredible example of the dreaming and the delivery of endless experiences for multigenerational travel. But you also see those, for example, in Silver Nova and what that does for the ultra luxury space in terms of the dreaming and innovating to deliver those experiences that our guests seek and are willing to pay for. You see that also extend into the destination and what we're doing in the private island space, whether it's with Hideaway that we just announced, we had the Royal Beach Club, into the Bahamas. And we continue to think about and dream about other opportunities that are there.Our goal is to keep our customers and our ecosystem. And we're building, as I mentioned in my notes, a travel platform on a technology basis that make sure that our guests through loyalty as well as experiences stay within that ecosystem. That all kind of comes into continuing to grow what we believe are the best brands in each of the segments and invest in those experiences for us to deliver each and every day."", 'Michael W. Bayley', ""Matthew, it's Michael. Just to add some comments to Jason. There's quite a big difference, and we've had these conversations before between the addressable market for traditional cruise and the addressable market for land-based vacations when you consider Orlando, Las Vegas and all of those different land-based options. We really believe that with ships like Icon and Perfect Day, Hideaway Beach, the coming of Royal Beach Club in '25. Utopia coming straight into the short product market, to Perfect Day. We are really kind of transcending and moving particularly the Royal brand from that traditional cruise space where the addressable market is big, but smaller than the land based.And we feel that now we're beginning to really attract a lot of demand from those land-based options with better quality product, more exciting products and great price points. So I think we feel there's a big opportunity with the addressable market, particularly as it relates to what we've done with kind of repositioning the brand and becoming acutely focused on the multi-generational family and particularly with the kind of new products that we're introducing now. And I think Icon really is a great example of that. We've never seen such incredible demand reaction and pricing power that we've seen with a new product that we've introduced. It's really been phenomenally successful."", 'Naftali Holtz', ""Matt, so on your question on cost, so this year, we gave the guidance of 3.75% to 4.25% cost growth. And I think it's just important, obviously, I mentioned it in my remarks that there's 300 basis points throughout the year impact from both increased dry dock days and also the operations of Hideaway Beach that while it is very accretive to margin, just does not have APCD. So -- so that's the reason. But I think if you put that into context of all the things that we have done over the last couple of years and our really relentless focus on enhancing margins and controlling cost is really coming into play as we continue to grow the business.For the cadence of the year, we have more cost in the first half of the year because we have most of our dry docks really in the last -- latter part of the first quarter and early in the second quarter, and that will weigh on cost. Also, I mentioned in the first quarter, we have specifically for that quarter more impact from starting Icon as well as just catching up in the load factor, but obviously, it normalizes throughout the year. And the second half will benefit from those lower dry dock days and also the addition of Utopia, which will add APCDs to the half part of the year. But all in, we're very pleased with how we've really in a durable way enhancing margins that will help us as we continue to grow the business and create operating leverage. For the long term, our formula really remains unchanged. Moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth, strong cost control really leads to enhanced financial returns. And the formula is basically we got to grow yields, faster than we grow our cost and that will enhance margins, more cash flow and more earnings."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.', 'Conor T. Cunningham', ""Just keeping with the theme on cruisers land. In the context of moderate yield growth. There seems to be an argument that you can make that actually should be a little bit higher given you're going to close the gap to land based. Can you just level set on where you sit on the discount versus land-based right now? And then how we get back to kind of the pre-COVID levels, I think that's been like 15% historically. So if you could just talk about that, that would be great."", 'Jason T. Liberty', ""So obviously, last year, we talked around having a 40% to 45% gap to land-based vacation. Our yields in 2023 rose 13.5%. Our APDs were up, I think, 16%. So we've obviously made a dent into that. And this year, we expect obviously to make a further dent into that. We are obsessed about really not -- it's much less about what's happening in the cruise space. It's more about how do we close that gap. How do we compete with land-based vacation. And we can see in the consideration how much cruise has moved into the average consumer's consideration for travel. So our focus is on that, how do we close that gap. And really how do we make sure going back to the ecosystem, which I think land-base does very well, is how do we make sure that focus on a vacation of a lifetime evolves into a lifetime of vacation.And I think the commentary about the return, what we're getting from our customers that repeat rate has now doubled, shows that what we're doing in delivering the best vacations in the world. What we're doing to incentivize through loyalty to keep our customers and our ecosystem. I mean really leveraging our house of brands, that are the best in each one of their segments is really starting to create another wave of demand. And we think land-base does this really well. We're focused on doing this obviously exceptionally well.And when you think about what we're doing on the destination side with -- perfect Day as an example, when you look at Icon, you can see in that how it's an extremely competitive product. We would probably argue even a better product to what's happening on land. And that's by us continuing to dream and innovate and deliver on that, that's going to chip away further and further into that value gap to land-based vacation."", 'Conor T. Cunningham', ""Super helpful. And then you mentioned the digital investments and increased direct bookings. Can you just talk about how that's evolved over the past few years? And how we continue to kind of increase the direct booking channel going forward?"", 'Jason T. Liberty', ""Yes. Well, it's less about the shift from direct or through our travel partners. We are really channel agnostic. What we want to do is whether it's -- we want to show up on how our guests want to shop and book of cruise. And we want to take as much friction out of that experience as we possibly can. Sometimes that leads them through our digital channels like the web or our app. Sometimes it has them call our call centers. And of course, that very much takes them to our travel partners who do an exceptional job, helping guests identify and have the experiences that they want to do.So we're very agnostic about that. But we also recognize that the customer expects very little friction in their shopping experience. So we spent a lot of time figuring out not only how to be easier to do business with, but also how to use technology like AI and so forth to curate and put those experiences in front of the guests and the way in which they want to consume them. I think we're getting better and better at that every day. But I would -- it's a journey. When I feel we're heading to the fourth or fifth inning, I find now we're back in the first inning as the consumer continues to evolve and just the technology that's available to do it so thoughtfully is growing stronger and stronger every day."", 'Naftali Holtz', ""Yes. And just one other thing to add is also it allows us to make sure that the customer gets the vacations they want. So some of the meaningful progress we've seen and we also noted in the last couple of earnings calls, just the ability to buy and design your vacation ahead of time through pre-cruise. And as Jason mentioned also in the remarks, it also leads to great financial success as people are booking their vacations, and they get on board and they spend 2.5x more than those that have in pre-cruise."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research.', 'Vince Charles Ciepiel', ""I wanted to dig a little bit more into the Icon. You keep talking about how taking things on a new level. Curious kind of how it compares to what you saw with a new class? You think about Oasis 15 years ago, Quantum 10 years ago. How does this launch compare in terms of reception to the customer, the travel agent community, the national coverage that you've been getting, your approach to marketing? And do you think that, that's sustainable as you move into Utopia and Star in the next 12 to 18 months?"", 'Michael W. Bayley', ""Vince, thank you very much for that question. I've been waiting for about 20 minutes to talk about Icon. I mean first of all, Icon is a product in terms of the design and the focus on multigenerational family and the evolution from Oasis-class. I think what we've created really is a game-changing hit. I mean it really is working with customer demographic and it's really working with our target market. I think if you've got an exceptional product that people really are impressed with, then you kind of -- you're almost there. And we feel like we've really achieve that with Icon. It's Epic. And you combine that with Perfect Day in the opening of Hideaway Beach. We have a product and a vacation experience for a multigenerational family that truly is the best in the world, and we've made that statement. It's the best family vacation in the world.So you've got to have that foundation. But I would say that in comparison to previous first-in-class launches, Icon has knocked this just out of the park. We've never seen the response that we've seen with Icon. It's been genuinely unbelievable from every single metric that you would want to look at. The bookings have been phenomenally strong. The rate has been unbelievable. The appreciation of the product has been high. The interest from the trade partners, from the consumer, from destinations. We've never seen the kind of response that we've seen with Icon of the Seas. The employee response, the crew response when we opened up and we had our first shakedown cruises has been unbelievable. We really feel as if this product is absolutely right on the mark and the response has been phenomenal.When we look at the metrics and we have all of these metrics where we compare first-in-class, Icon has doubled or tripled the response. So volume was x percent with the first-in-class with Oasis. With Icon, it's been 3x better than Oasis was. Rate has been really high. But when you compare rate with Icon versus first-in-class in our previous launches, it's double or triple. It's been phenomenal in terms of the overall performance. And the same seems to be true with the onboard product itself. We do feel that Icon with Perfect Day stands shoulder to shoulder with Orlando and Las Vegas, except that we've got both. We've got the gaming and we've got everything that the kids would want to do to have a great vacation.So we feel like we've got it perfectly right. And I think when you look at the lineup that we have for Royal, particularly with the opening of the Royal Beach Club in Nassau in '25, the introduction of Utopia in the 3- and 4-day market out of (inaudible) to Perfect Day, we see exactly the same kind of response with Utopia in terms of volume and rate performance versus traditional first-in-class 3- and 4-day products.We feel like we -- going back to my earlier comments, we feel like we've started this transition from being a traditional cruise vacation to being a world-class multigenerational family option that stands shoulder to shoulder with Orlando and Las Vegas and any land-based destination experience that you could mention. We feel like we're right there, with Icon, with Utopia, with Perfect Day. And of course, it's a journey that we're on in terms of introducing these new exciting products year-over-year. And thank you for asking that question. It's very much appreciated."", 'Vince Charles Ciepiel', ""Absolutely. So when you layer in this, it sounds like new hardware is kind of firing at a cylinder that you haven't seen before. You have the discount to land based, and then you have kind of a multiyear stretch of pretty muted industry supply. Is there any reason to think that yield growth couldn't be at more elevated levels on a multiyear stress than what you've seen historically?"", 'Michael W. Bayley', ""Well, I'm the brand guy. So I've got to tell you, yes, we live in a very optimistic world, and we are extremely excited with the product and the brand that Royal Caribbean International has now become yes, I see plenty of upside. Naf and Jason, they have a slightly different perspective, but I can tell you, we're very excited with the lineup that we've got coming, and we feel unbelievably proud of the performance of Icon to date. So yes, I see a lot of upside."", 'Jason T. Liberty', ""Yes. And I just -- I mean, I think we're all extremely optimistic on the very strong quality demand that we continue to see. And I wouldn't want to leave the call with anybody thinking that we are not very optimistic about Q2 and beyond. I know Q1 is very high in terms of the overall performance. But the bookings, the level of onboard spend activity is exceptionally strong. And so I know that there's -- I can just talk about the questions, there's some focus on that. But that it should only be focused on the opportunity that's ahead of us."", 'Operator', 'Our final question comes from the line of Jamie Rollo with Morgan Stanley.', 'Jamie David William Rollo', 'Just one sort of follow-up really on Icon, Michael, I wish you like, I guess. Just given the figures you gave then, how has that changed the way you think about ordering new ships (technical difficulty) new ships and also some of the older ships in the fleet? I mean, is this an opportunity to really press your foot down and accelerate this sort of new class ship? Or are you going to sort of carry on perhaps to see as you were before?', 'Michael W. Bayley', ""Yes. We see the huge opportunity with the direction that we've taken in terms of this combination of phenomenal land-based curated destination experiences like Perfect Day, the Royal Beach Club in Nassau and Icon class. So I think our direction, our mindset is very much focused on the future and further development of that kind of product experience that we know absolutely resonates with the customer."", 'Jason T. Liberty', ""Yes. And Jamie, I think just to add, we are very purposeful in our actions. We're very purposeful in the segments in which we are operating in. We think we operate in segments where the level of quality demand significantly outpaces the current supply. There's obviously constraints inside the yards in terms of the ability for anyone to grow at a fast pace. But we expect in the future to continue to invest in our business. We expect to continue to invest, as Michael said, in destinations and also in the growth of our fleet. But it's going to stick generally to that formula of moderate yield growth, good cost control and moderate capacity growth over time."", 'Jamie David William Rollo', ""I'm just surprised you've given what you've seen, which sounds much better than expectations are not changing anything even for the existing ships? Is there nothing you might be doing with some of the vision or Radiant class ships or maybe putting some of the successful features of Icon on some of the sort of maybe quantum or (inaudible) class anything there?"", 'Jason T. Liberty', ""Yes, we're always modernizing. We have a lot coming up and the actions we took on Oasis. Some of the learnings on Icon is going to be in the modernization of a law of the Seas. We're always updating our ships to make sure those ships stay relevant. It doesn't move like the CapEx number potentially or maybe it's not as exciting today as we're talking about Icon and Hideaway, et cetera. But we're always investing and bringing a lot of the learnings. Boy, not just on an experience standpoint, but also on a sustainability standpoint so that our fleet stays relevant and competitive."", 'Operator', ""I'll now turn the call back to Naftali Holtz, CFO, for any closing remarks."", 'Naftali Holtz', 'Thank you, operator.

The off-price retailer has big growth plans ahead of it and is benefiting today from financially concerned customers trading down to its stores. But longer term, it's still focusing hard on selling more off-price goods to more customers."", ""Here's what you need to know."", ""Like peers Ross Stores and TJX Companies, Burlington sells low-cost items to a core base of customers looking for deals. More recently, however, the mix of customers for this retailer has shifted somewhat. That's because wealthier consumers worried about the economy have started to cut back on their spending. Going to a Burlington store is one of the ways they're doing that."", ""The evidence comes from the company, which has explained that it's selling more recognizable brands at higher prices. The target for those products is wealthier customers, and it shows that the company's buyers have been able to pivot quickly to address the changes taking shape at the consumer level."", ""This is clearly good, but it pulls the company away from its core operations, which is selling off-price goods. That's what brings in core customers, the ones that will stick around after economic concerns subside."", 'Ross Stores, for example, has had its buyers out looking for ways to offer the most compelling value to its customers across the entire store. TJX, meanwhile, has been touting its experienced buyers and their ability to excite customers with an ever-changing collection of off-price merchandise.', ""The big takeaway here isn't that Burlington is stepping away from the core of its success, but that trade-down customers are potentially a temporary benefit."", ""That's why it is important to note two trends for Burlington. The first is going to be store growth. The plan is to open around 500 new stores over the next five years. Although it probably won't be exact, 100 a year or so is what investors should expect."", 'At first, new stores are probably going to be a slight headwind, given that new stores will probably pull some customers away from existing locations. But over time, the company expects that headwind to subside as new stores start drawing in their own set of customers. The goal is to have more modern stores in busier locations.', 'That, however, is going to require living up to a core competence, which is selling a desirable collection of off-price goods at attractive prices. While TJX has touted the experience of its buyers and Ross discusses its great value across its entire store, Burlington has been talking about its efforts to strengthen its merchandising capabilities and increasing flexibility.', ""In fact, the ability to source more well-known brands to sell to trade-down customers is an example of Burlington's ability to adjust quickly. The key will be to see if it can shift quickly again when those customers start trading back up and the retailer needs to refocus on selling off-price to its core customer."", 'The interesting thing on Wall Street is that Burlington shares remain well below recent highs while Ross and TJX are both back at their highs. That suggests there could still be an opportunity for investors to buy Burlington even after its outsize rally at the end of 2023. But the key will be watching how well it executes on its store opening and merchandising plan, with the goal of off-price excellence to attract core customers.', ""Burlington's price-to-sales ratio has gone from roughly in line with TJX and Ross to well below those peers. Given the company's store growth plans, there's a reason to think there's a long-term opportunity here. And that will be more compelling if the company's buyers live up to its off-price focus, as is the goal.

A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up."", ""If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it."", ' View our latest analysis for Analog Devices ', ""The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Impressively, Analog Devices has grown EPS by 27% per year, compound, in the last three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about."", ""Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$338m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.4% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves."", ""If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Analog Devices' strong EPS growth. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Analog Devices' continuing strength.

Despite the index being at an all-time high, here are two stocks I'll be adding to my retirement account regardless. Each company has long-term growth potential and stability that I don't have to second-guess."", 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is now the only company in the coveted $3 trillion market cap club, after Apple dropped below the mark (as of Jan. 29).', ""Arguably, no other tech company has done as impressive a job as Microsoft when it comes to building a well-diversified ecosystem of products and services. Unlike Apple (which relies heavily on the iPhone), Alphabet (which relies heavily on Google advertising), or Amazon (which relies heavily on e-commerce), Microsoft's businesses span a broad range, with each holding its own weight."", ""Microsoft's diversified business model has worked wonders for its financials. In the past five years, its revenue and net income have jumped, but the pace at which its net income has grown shows the efficiency of its operations."", ""What I appreciate more than just the impressive financials -- and why I trust the company for the long haul -- is where this money comes from: other corporations. Microsoft has done a great job intertwining itself in the global business work, to the point where many businesses wouldn't function as efficiently without Microsoft's products and services."", ""Consider how many corporations rely on Microsoft Office for Excel, Azure for cloud services, LinkedIn for recruiting, and Windows for their operating system.

As Microsoft continues to innovate and attract corporate customers, I trust its position as a key part of the global business world will remain strong."", ""A vital characteristic I want in a company that I'm adding to my retirement portfolio is an economic moat. In Visa's (NYSE: V) case, its economic moat is its global reach. With over 130 million merchant locations and 4.3 billion cards in circulation, Visa is the payment processing industry leader -- and it's not even close.\xa0"", ""In the payment processing industry, Visa's reach is important because the network effect allows it to grow organically. If you're a potential cardholder or merchant, you're more incentivized to go with Visa because it's the most accepted and used card. This network effect has helped the company expand globally at an impressive pace.

Both companies have high stock price growth opportunities, so the dividend is a bonus."", ""By no means are their dividend yields eye-popping, but any little bit can add up over time -- especially with the companies increasing the payouts annually.

Based on this tally, Visa, which processed 266 billion transactions in 2023, would have a 20% global market share.', 'The significant growth still ahead for noncash payments gives Visa a long and durable growth runway.

The chart below sums up how Visa stock has outpaced the S&P 500 index by a nearly 2-to-1 ratio for the past decade. First, Visa has maintained double-digit revenue growth, averaging 11% annually. As a payment network, it's a toll-booth business model, charging a fee for every network transaction."", ""Next, the company is very profitable, turning 57% of that revenue into free cash flow, which management has used to pay a dividend and repurchase its stock. That supports earnings growth because Visa's profits are spread across fewer shares. More revenue, more cash flow, more repurchases. It's a simple but powerful recipe that few businesses can pull off."", ""There are growing companies, and there are very profitable companies. But doing both at Visa's level? That makes it an exceptional business."", ""Today, at a $550 billion market cap, Visa is over halfway to becoming a trillion-dollar company. A stock's valuation comes from its earnings and what the market will pay for them. Sometimes, stocks get so expensive that they can stagnate for years while the underlying business grows and catches up to the stock."", ""It doesn't look like that's likely for Visa and its shareholders. Yes, the stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 28, and analysts have lowered their long-term growth forecast over the past year as consumers struggle (household debt is at all-time highs)."", 'However, without a recession tanking consumer spending, low-double-digit earnings growth seems doable because Visa has consistently grown revenue at a low-double-digit rate, and its share repurchases help drive earnings per share (EPS) upward.', ""Its PEG ratio is hovering around 2, making the stock a tad expensive for its estimated earnings growth. However, I wouldn't split hairs with high-quality companies like Visa. Remember, growth estimates were 3 percentage points higher not even a year ago, so it may not be worth waiting for some perfect entry point that never comes."", ""Visa can hit a trillion-dollar market cap from here by doubling its EPS and the stock maintaining its current valuation. Visa essentially has to keep doing what it's been doing for years. Using analysts' 13% earnings growth rate, Visa's EPS would double within six years. Again, that could come sooner or later than six years, but given Visa's record of consistency, I don't think that time frame is too far off the mark."", ""Since the S&P 500 returns a historical average of 9% to 10% annually, Visa is poised to become a trillion-dollar stock and continue its market-beating ways.

Truist Securities Managing Director Energy Neal Dingmann joins Yahoo Finance Live to weigh in on factors that are contributing to both companies’ success.', '“What it shows is that their [Chevron and Exxon] production is phenomenal,” Dingmann states, who expects impressive shareholder returns. “I don’t know many other sectors where you can find companies this large, and get this kind of shareholder return.”', 'Both Chevron and Exxon do not appear to be as impacted by the geopolitical crises in the Red Sea due to the focus production from the Permian Basis, according to Dingmann.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Eyek Ntekim"", 'SEANA SMITH: All right, Exxon and Chevron reporting better than expected earnings for the most recent quarters as the two oil giants double down on fossil fuels. Well, those recent bets are paying off. When you take a look at those annual numbers, both companies reporting their second highest annual profits in a decade.', ""We want to bring in Neil Dingmann. He's a Truist Securities Managing Director of Energy Research. Neil, it's great to have you here. So your first take at these results that we're getting from both Chevron and Exxon and their ability to do this at a time that hasn't exactly been as bullish for crude prices as what we saw back in 2022."", ""NEIL DINGMANN: Yeah. Thanks for having me, Seana. I think what it shows is their production is phenomenal for both not only in the Permian-- let's just look at Exxon, for instance, that just reported-- or just had their call a minute ago. Permian production and Guyana production continues to set records quarter after quarter. So while some other EMPs are maintaining flat production, these big companies continue to show that even with flattish pricing, maybe a little bit lower pricing, they can continue to generate record production, which is generating record earnings or near-record earnings and record cash flow, resulting in just, to me, phenomenal shareholder return."", 'BRAD SMITH: And so for shareholders right now that are trying to get their best read on the state of oil coming off of both the reports from Exxon as well as from Chevron, how would you kind of encapsulate that right now?', ""NEIL DINGMANN: It's a good question. But I think what I would suggest is anybody holding it, you can expect, one, not only cash flow and earnings to likely go up about another 5% this year, but, along with that, it's interesting-- I mean, look, both these companies are paying out about a 4% dividend, which I think is quite good. And on top of that, both are even buying back more shares on an absolute level than what they even pay out on dividends."", ""So to me, the shareholder return is still the story. I don't know many other sectors where you can find companies this large and get this kind of shareholder return."", 'SEANA SMITH: Neil, when we talk about the disruption in the Red Sea, the implications or the impact that is having on some oil giants around the globe, what does it mean, in particular, here for Chevron and Exxon?', 'NEIL DINGMANN: Well, I think it\'s a good question. I think that\'s why both these companies continue to lean very heavily on the Permian. I think they made the decision a year, maybe even a couple of years ago, to really focus-- you have Exxon now that bought Pioneer. That\'s going to close next quarter. Even I don\'t want to say ""double down,"" but it\'s going to add a tremendous amount of Permian production. So I think it\'s exactly what you\'re saying. I think there\'s going to continue to be geopolitical risk, international, and it\'s why these companies continue to focus predominantly on the lower 48 for growth.', 'BRAD SMITH: And so with that in mind, should we still continue to be concerned more geopolitically, not just about conflict that might break out, but also about production considerations as well and how that flows through to both of these companies?', ""NEIL DINGMANN: It's interesting. I actually asked Darren Woods that this morning on the Q&A. And his comment was-- or his answer was that he's going to continue to do what's best for the company. So while there might be some pushback if US companies start to grow too much, I think still, most importantly, is what these companies are able to throw off in cash flow. And you know, again, the biggest driver is going to continue to be the Permian and Guyana. And I think you're going to see-- continue to see both of those pushed higher."", ""SEANA SMITH: When it comes to lots of questions just about what the price of crude is going to look like-- I'm not asking you to forecast how high or maybe the pressure that we're going to see in crude, but in terms of the ability to navigate, when you take a name like Chevron and stack it up against Exxon, who do you think is better positioned to weather some of those potential challenges here, at least in the short-term?"", ""NEIL DINGMANN: I think both the, I would call it short-term and long-term, I think Exxon. And the simple reason is now, by adding that Pioneer, I think they have the dominant US position, not only above Chevron, but above any other company out there. So I just think they're phenomenally positioned."", ""I don't see anybody else with a better asset position, better inventory depth, all those kind of things. So I just have more confidence that Exxon can continue to ramp their production at this pace for a longer period given the quality of their inventory."", ""BRAD SMITH: Is there one company that is best positioned, from your perspective, to weather some of the political punching bag nature that may assume itself as we get towards the general election and we hear talks of even more and more discussion and debate around clean energy, and where the shifts are actually being made, where companies are not doing their part-- and is there one that's actually kind of taking significant strides well enough in order to insulate themselves from that conversation?"", ""NEIL DINGMANN: I mean, they're both doing it to some degree. It's a good question, Brad. And I think, though, for instance, this morning, a lot of the call today on Exxon was around carbon capture, was around their lithium project that, by 2027, will be enough-- produce enough lithium to support one million electric vehicles."", ""So, look, I think fossil fuels, we know, is going to continue to be the dominant driver for both these companies. So even all those things they're doing outside, I think they're still going to take some heat, especially given the amount of growth that they're both showing on the fossil fuel side."", 'BRAD SMITH: Neil, great to have you on. And thanks for giving us some of the insights from the call this morning. Neil Dingmann, who is the Truist Securities Managing Director of Energy Research. Appreciate it.', 'NEIL DINGMANN: Thank you.']"

Stanley Black & Decker's performance in 2023 reflects our relentless focus on the execution of our strategic business transformation, which resulted in us building a strong foundation for improved profitability in 2024. Stanley Black & Decker today is a more streamlined business, built on the strength of our people and culture, with an intensified focus on our core market leadership positions in Tools & Outdoor and Industrial. Despite a challenging market backdrop, that pressured volumes during the year, adjusted gross margin improved in each quarter and we generated over $850 million of free cash flow. These results demonstrate significant progress against two of our most important areas of focus during 2023."", 'Here are just a few additional examples of our accomplishments from the past year. We improved the health of our cost structure as a result of the momentum from our supply chain transformation. We achieved our 2023 target and delivered over $1 billion of savings program to-date. We remain on track for the expected $2 billion of savings targeted by the end of 2025. Our fourth quarter adjusted gross margin approached 30%. This result outperformed the plan, as our teams accelerated efforts to deliver profit and cash in response to the soft volume environment. Our strong free cash flow generation was primarily the result of $1.1 billion of inventory reduction, as we successfully executed our supply chain initiatives. We continue to actively manage our portfolio of businesses.', 'In December, we announced the agreement to sell our Infrastructure business, and currently expect that transaction to close at the end of the first quarter. This aligns with our simplification efforts and focus on shareholder value creation, while advancing our capital allocation priorities. We strengthened our leadership team with the addition of three new highly-capable seasoned and respected leaders in Chris Nelson, Pat Hallinan and John Lucas, each of whom brings a fresh and exciting set of perspectives. Stepping back, over the past year-and-a-half, we have transformed Stanley Black & Decker into a different company, refocused and reenergized. Together, our talented and motivated leadership team, along with our diverse and high-performing associates across the globe, are executing our transformation strategy with urgency and diligence to ensure we continue to achieve our goals.', 'Our performance to-date is encouraging and reinforces our confidence in making investments to pursue the compelling long-term growth opportunities in the markets that we serve. Shifting now to our fourth quarter performance. Revenue was $3.7 billion, which was down mid-single digits versus the prior year, primarily due to lower outdoor and DIY volume as well as infrastructure customer destocking. Our profitability exceeded our plan as we recorded adjusted gross margin of 29.8% in the quarter. Adjusted gross margin was up over 10 points versus the prior year and improved 220 basis points versus the third quarter. As a result of our focused efforts, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that we delivered sequential adjusted gross margin improvement.', 'We also reduced inventory by $240 million this quarter, which brings our total inventory reduction to $1.9 billion since mid-2022 when we began this journey. 2024 will be the next chapter of transformation, an opportunity to demonstrate our ability to further improve profitability and cash flow, as we plant the seeds for future growth and success for Stanley Black & Decker. While it will be a transitional year, we are continuing to strengthen our foundation to create greater future earnings power. We will remain focused on delivering differentiated product innovation through our portfolio of world-class brands, implementing cost efficiency measures within our control, and driving share gain in our core markets, all aimed to improve margin, earnings and cash flow.', 'Turning to the markets we serve, our view is that these markets will remain dynamic in 2024. Overall, we expect relative strength and demand from professional tools and portions of our industrial markets. However, we believe the consumer and outdoor demand trends will continue to be weak. Together, this results in a modestly negative outlook in aggregate for all of our markets. Our global trade weighted GDP estimates are slightly positive, with US Real GDP growth projected to slow, but remain positive in 2024. Global commercial construction is expected to moderate, and industrial tool markets are expected to remain supportive. The global industrial fastener end categories will be led by aerospace, while automotive and industrial production markets will be relatively flat.', ""There are a few key macroeconomic indicators that more directly impact our larger markets in North America, which are somewhat mixed. Examples of this mix North American Tools & Outdoor market are as follows. New residential builds are forecasted to improve from current levels, yet remain modestly negative year-over-year. Residential repair and remodel is currently expected to retract. And the outdoor power equipment industry continues to show signs of customer destocking, and we don't expect to pivot to growth during 2024. In summary, we're focused on the pro user and the healthiest market segments to generate share gains. We are prepared for weak consumer and outdoor demand trends to persist. The midpoint of our 2024 plan represents a continuation of the current demand environment, which in aggregate is slightly negative for all markets."", 'We will remain agile and ready to serve incremental demand if it accelerates in the second half. We believe that with our powerful brands and strong innovation machine, we have the opportunity to capture new wins with our customers and outperform the market. Our plan for the year is underpinned by the continued supply chain cost improvements that are broadly in our control. We expect to deliver gross margin accretion, earnings growth and strong free cash flow. Pat will discuss this in more detail in just a few moments. 2024 will be a year of focus, excitement and purpose. And it is fitting that we are celebrating the 100 year anniversary of DEWALT, a noteworthy milestone and a reminder that we have been revolutionizing jobsites for a century.', ""We will always relentlessly innovate for our pros and all our end users, allowing them to achieve better, safer and faster results. I want to thank our 50,000-plus employees around the world for their persistence and commitment to our mission in 2023. They each have contributed to the progress we've made on our transformation journey. Now, stepping into the business segment results. I will discuss our Industrial business performance, and then pass it to Chris Nelson to review the Tools & Outdoor results. Fourth quarter Industrial revenue declined 4% versus last year. Price realization was more than offset by lower volume, which was driven by the continuation of customer destocking in Infrastructure. Within this segment, engineered fastening fourth quarter organic revenues were up 7%."", 'This includes aerospace growth of 27% and auto growth of 10%, as we benefit from recoveries in those markets. This growth was partially muted by market softness in general industrial fastening. The fourth quarter Industrial adjusted segment margin was 11.1%, down 40 basis points versus prior year, as lower volume more than offset price realization and cost control. For the year, we are very pleased with the performance of our Industrial segment. While organic revenue growth was flat, engineered fastening, which is our focus moving forward within this segment, was up 6% organically, behind the strength in automotive and aerospace. The team delivered full year adjusted segment margin of 11.8%, up 210 basis points versus 2022. This expansion was driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity throughout the year.', ""I want to thank the Industrial business team for their strong execution in 2023. And I'd like to especially thank the Infrastructure team for their valuable contribution to Stanley Black & Decker. I am confident that the business is positioned for a future of innovation and growth with Epiroc. I will now turn the call over to Chris to review our Tools & Outdoor performance."", 'Chris Nelson: Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Now, turning to the Tools & Outdoor fourth quarter operating performance. Fourth quarter revenue was approximately $3.2 billion, down 8% organically versus prior year as a result of lower volumes primarily from soft consumer outdoor and DIY market demand, while price remained flat. We made substantial progress improving profitability through the year, driving adjusted segment margin to 10% in the fourth quarter. This was a sequential step-up of 70 basis points versus the third quarter and 900 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2022. We achieved this by realizing lower inventory destocking costs, delivering supply chain transformation savings and capturing the benefits of shipping cost deflation, which were partially offset by lower volume.', 'Now, turning to the product lines. Organic revenue for hand tools declined 6%, while power tools was up 1 point organically, as pro-driven momentum offset pressures in DIY demand. Outdoor was significantly challenged as customers right-sized their inventory levels. We expect that trend to continue into the start of the 2024 selling season. In tools, we finished the year with a relatively stable market backdrop, supported by pro demand. For example, power tools organic performance improved each quarter in 2023 and exited in a growth position. This demonstrates the demand for our iconic pro-centric DEWALT brand and the best-in-class products that we are bringing to the market. As the outdoor market achieves post-COVID normalization, we are focused on improving our cost structure while prioritizing investments to capture targeted share gain opportunities with customers and accelerating innovation in handheld electrification, which is a growing and highly-profitable category.', 'Now, turning to fourth quarter performance by region. North America was down 10% organically, with the tools product line down low-single digits. The commercial and industrial channel, which has a heavy professional user base, grew low-single digits organically. Fourth quarter US retail point-of-sale demand remained negative versus the prior year, but above 2019 levels, supported by price increases and strength in professional tools. European organic revenue was down 1%, with outperformance in the Nordics and Italy, which generated double-digit organic growth as we continue to invest in expanding our professional product offerings and activating new battery-powered innovations within the region. Emerging markets grew mid-single digits organically, excluding the impact from the Russia business exit.', ""Including this impact, organic sales declined 1%. Solid emerging market performance was led by high-teens organic growth in Brazil, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth in the country. I want to thank the Tools & Outdoor team for their focused efforts throughout the year, which has positioned us well as we continue to focus on winning with our customers and capturing long-term profitable growth and market share. Now, turning to the next slide, I would like to now introduce our new groundbreaking equipment system, DEWALT POWERSHIFT. We are proud to bring this to market later this year as it demonstrates the company's commitment to innovation and electrification for the pros. The DEWALT POWERSHIFT system was unveiled at the World of Concrete trade show last week, and is designed to meet the critical needs of concrete professionals."", 'The electrified line will allow the pro to transition away from gas-powered equipment without compromising efficiency and performance. Each of the six concrete tools in the system uses the DEWALT POWERSHIFT 554 watt-hour battery and high-speed charger to streamline efficiency. The battery can deliver up to 5,000 watts of continuous power, that is equivalent to 6.5 horsepower and is designed to withstand the toughest jobsite conditions. The POWERSHIFT battery leverages pouch cell technology, which DEWALT first brought to the industry in October of 2021. Pouch technology enables the cordless jobsite of the future, bringing more power, runtime and efficiency. Take, for example, the POWERSHIFT vibrator, used for concrete placement. It is 85% more efficient than gas vibrators in the market today.', ""POWERSHIFT vibrators deliver 60 continuous minutes of non-stop work, which gives the user about 30% more runtime than a tank of gas. There are electrified vibrators in the market today that can only deliver 15 minutes of runtime. Adding to the extended runtime, this tool is 5 pounds lighter than a gas unit and is 10 pounds lighter than any other electrified unit available. DEWALT POWERSHIFT represents the next addition to the 100-year legacy of the DEWALT Innovation Mission to deliver comprehensive end-to-end workflow solutions. Raymond DeWalt's founding principles of innovation, safety and productivity remain the core ethos of our company today. DEWALT's future remains strong, and we will lead the way in empowering trades people to succeed while defining the next era of industry innovation and minimizing environmental impact."", ""Thank you. And with that, I'll pass the call over to Pat Hallinan."", 'Pat Hallinan: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Turning to the next slide, I would like to highlight the progress we have achieved streamlining the business and transforming our operations. We are on track to deliver our $2 billion pre-tax run rate cost savings target by the end of 2025. We achieved approximately $160 million pre-tax run rate cost savings in the fourth quarter, bringing our aggregate savings to over $1 billion since program inception. This performance is slightly ahead of plan as our teams accelerated savings efforts to offset macroeconomic volume headwinds that were greater than expected throughout the year, including during the fourth quarter. Strategic sourcing initiatives remain the largest contributor to our supply chain transformation to-date.', 'In addition to the program, freight rate and demurrage savings also contributed to margin improvement starting early in 2023 and holding throughout the year. Consistent with expectations set at transformation inception, we expect strategic sourcing to be the leading contributor to savings and we expect this to be the case in 2024. Our operations excellence program continues to leverage lean manufacturing principles to improve productivity across both business segments. This workstream will expand in scope during 2024 and drive further cost efficiency in our manufacturing base. The footprint related projects are progressing on schedule and production transfers into centers of excellence are in the various stages of qualification, testing and execution.', 'Similarly, logistics network optimization programs are also on track with regional distribution center redesigns underway. Concerning complexity reduction, our teams have identified approximately 85,000 SKUs for discontinuation and are assisting customers as they transition to replacement products. We have successfully eliminated over 45,000 SKUs as of the end of 2023 with more expected in 2024. These actions are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024, supporting the funding of additional growth investments in our core business. As we move into the next phase of our transformation, footprint and product changes, such as those from platforming, will become more important and results in a lumpier cost savings trajectory as you would expect.', 'We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater. Moving to the next slide, two of our primary areas of focus during 2023 were free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We reduced inventory by approximately $240 million in the fourth quarter, inclusive of approximately $100 million attributable to the Infrastructure business held for sale accounting. This brings our inventory reduction to approximately $1.1 billion in 2023 and $1.9 billion since the middle of 2022. Our disciplined inventory reduction efforts throughout the year supported $853 million of free cash flow generation, which we used to fund our dividend and reduce debt by approximately $280 million versus the prior year.', 'We remain focused on working capital optimization in addition to improving profitability to generate significant free cash flow. In 2024, we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million, as we continue to prioritize working capital efficiency. CapEx is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million, increasing versus 2023, predominantly in support of the footprint-related transformation initiatives planned for 2024. These items, in combination with organic cash generation, underpin our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million. As a reminder, we expect a typical profile for our working capital as we build inventory for the 2024 Tools & Outdoor spring selling season, resulting in the typical first quarter operating cash outflow.', 'Our priority for capital deployment remains consistent, making transformation investments, funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividend, and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29.8% in the fourth quarter was up 10.3 points versus the prior year, driven by lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs, which more than offset the impact from lower volume. Adjusted gross margin finished ahead of plan as we intentionally accelerated supply chain transformation actions in 2023 while navigating weak consumer and outdoor demand and channel inventory conservatism to meet our profitability and cash flow objectives.', ""Additionally, pricing was 0.5 point better than our expectation due to lower promotional mix in the quarter. We will continue our measured and disciplined approach to cost management to moderately improve on our second-half 2023 adjusted gross margin gain into the first half of 2024 while managing the margin pressures that accompany the outdoor selling season. This is notable given that we're able to deliver second-half 2023 adjusted gross margin 1 point above the high end of our initial '23 guidance, demonstrating the transformation is on our targeted trajectory. We are planning for adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year of 2024 and expect to exit the year in the low 30%s, consistent with prior expectations. We are leveraging our $0.5 billion of cost reductions from the supply chain transformation and working hard to navigate another year without a macroeconomic tailwind."", ""We made significant progress throughout 2023 on our journey to restore our historical 35%-plus adjusted gross margin and our efforts are enabling incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth. Now, let's turn to our 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. To reiterate, we are planning for 2024 to be another year where we prioritize cash flow generation and gross margin improvement. We are initiating a full year free cash flow guidance range of $600 million to $800 million, GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85, and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50. We expect relative strength in demand for professional tools in some of our industrial markets. Conversely, we are prepared for weak consumer and outdoor demand trends to persist."", 'Together, these dynamics result in a modestly negative outlook in aggregate for our markets. We are planning for organic revenue to be relatively flat at the midpoint, supported by targeted share gains in our businesses. Our EPS range contemplates plus or minus 2 points of volume growth, with the variation representing the market demand scenarios in the plan. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat at the midpoint, behind our focus to win with the pro through industry-leading innovation, investments in field resources and consumer share gains, leveraging our strong portfolio of brands. The Industrial segment revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive organically, primarily driven by aerospace market recovery, as well as leveraging our core business model and electrification to deliver share gains.', 'Industrial growth in 2024 is expected to be moderated by Infrastructure destocking in Q1 before the closure of the signed divestiture and expected softness in general industrial fastening markets. We will continue to invest for long-term organic growth and share gain throughout 2024 and plan to invest an incremental $100 million to accelerate innovation, market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN and STANLEY brands. Our planning expectation is that SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2024 remains consistent with our recent fourth quarter, around 21%, which includes investments. Turning to profitability, we expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to improve to approximately 10% for the full year, supported by the benefits of the transformation program.', ""Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year, also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to up slightly versus prior year, as operating improvement in engineered fastening is offset by the dilution from the previously announced divestiture of the Infrastructure business. For additional context around Infrastructure, our guidance assumes approximately $100 million of first quarter sales, with the divestiture closing at the end of the quarter. Thereafter, we have excluded the profit and assume the proceeds will be used to reduce our commercial paper debt balance. With these assumptions, we've established a $1 adjusted EPS range, with the largest contributor being market demand variability."", 'We will work to optimize adjusted gross margin through our transformation program, we will manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year, given the macro uncertainty, but we will be working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth. Turning to the other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million, largely related to the supply chain transformation program, with approximately 25% of these expenses being non-cash footprint rationalization costs. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to step-up in 2024 to 10% with the first three quarters generally in the mid-20%s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and we currently expect these to occur in the fourth quarter.', ""Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 13% of the full year at the midpoint. The EPS for the first quarter is impacted by the tax profile I discussed earlier and a heavier contribution from interest expense associated with the expected first quarter commercial paper debt balance. Adjusted first quarter EBITDA as a percentage of the full year is expected to be over 20%, consistent with pre-pandemic history. First quarter total company organic sales growth is expected to be down low-single digits, primarily due to the same factors driving fourth quarter '23 softness. Adjusted EBITDA margins are planned to be strongly versus prior year, leveraging the carryover benefits of the program and comping the destocking period."", ""In summary, 2024 represents another step along our transformation journey with a continued focus on gross margin and cash while targeting share gains in a stable, but tough macro environment. We believe our actions continue to position the company for long-term growth and shareholder return. With that, I'll now pass the call back to Don."", ""Don Allan: Thank you, Pat. We embarked on a bold transformation in the middle of 2022 to set Stanley Black & Decker on a path to drive strong, long-term shareholder returns through sustainable growth, profitability and cash flow improvement. As we report another quarter of progress, our consistent execution against our plan gives us the confidence to increase investments, supporting the acceleration of organic growth behind our most powerful brands, particularly DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN, STANLEY. In the face of dynamic markets, we're focused on delivering best-in-class product innovation, implementing cost efficiency measures within our control, and driving share gain in our core markets. I am confident that we are creating a stronger and more focused company, capable of gaining market share consistently over the long term, with the best people, the most iconic brands and the highest quality innovation engine in the industry. With that, we are now ready for Q&A, Dennis."", 'Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start the Q&A, please.

As of Jan. 31, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the fifth-largest U.S. company (sixth-largest globally) with a $1.5 trillion market cap.', 'So, for Nvidia to reach a $2 trillion valuation in 2024, it would need to grow 33% from its current stock price. Is this out of the question? Or could Nvidia become the third company to obtain a $2 trillion market cap?', ""Nvidia's primary business is graphics processing units (GPUs). Although this hardware was originally slated to be used by individuals who wanted better graphics than their processors could create while gaming, the uses quickly expanded. Now, GPUs are used to power gaming rigs, mine cryptocurrency, process engineering simulations, and create artificial intelligence (AI) models."", ""The latter example is why Nvidia's stock has been a powerhouse over the past year, as AI demand has dramatically improved Nvidia's financial situation. In the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2024 (ended July 30 and October 29, respectively), Nvidia posted year-over-year revenue growth of 101% and 206%. This strength is expected to continue into the fourth quarter and beyond, as management guided for $20 billion in revenue, indicating 231% growth year over year."", 'Clearly, AI is having a massive effect on Nvidia, and with the purpose-built AI supercomputer infrastructure buildout not yet complete, it has a ways to go.

Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms are just a few of the tech leaders that have become MI300 customers.', ""While AMD is admittedly chasing Nvidia in the data center segment, AMD has a 90% market share in AI-enabled personal computers. Its Ryzen 7000 series -- otherwise known as Ryzen AI -- CPUs for computers are designed to handle AI workloads on-device, meaning the user won't have to rely on a cloud or external data center to run advanced generative AI applications, which leads to a faster, more seamless experience."", ""To date, millions of personal computers have shipped with Ryzen AI chips, but AMD is about to launch a new processor that could be more than three times faster. That will likely extend the company's advantage in this space even further."", ""Investors were slightly disappointed with AMD's latest financial report. The company's fourth-quarter revenue came in at $6.17 billion, which beat expectations, but it forecast $5.4 billion in revenue for the upcoming first quarter of 2024, which fell short of the $5.7 billion Wall Street predicted. AMD stock dropped 7% following the report, but I think that's an opportunity for investors to swoop in and buy."", ""That's because the fourth quarter revealed a significant growth acceleration in some of AMD's core segments. Its data center revenue came in at a record-high $2.3 billion, a 38% increase year over year. The same line item was flat in the third quarter (ended Sept. 30). The acceleration was attributed in part to significant growth in demand for data center GPUs -- in other words, AI."", ""But it gets better. AMD had previously forecast that the new MI300 series GPUs would contribute $2 billion to the company's total data center revenue in 2024, but it just revised that guidance significantly higher, to $3.5 billion. A strong customer pool with expanding engagements was the reason, and given the feverish demand for AI processing power, I wouldn't be surprised if that number was revised higher again during 2024."", ""Furthermore, AMD's Client segment (home to the Ryzen AI series of chips) delivered $1.5 billion in revenue, a 62% year-over-year increase. The company expects the strength in that segment to continue following the launch of its next generation of hardware this year."", ""AI is offsetting some of the weakness in other parts of AMD's business. The company saw a drop in its gaming revenue during the fourth quarter, for example, mainly because we have moved past the launch phase of flagship consoles like Sony's PlayStation 5, which means sales will gradually continue to slow."", ""AMD went through a challenging period during 2022 as inflation and interest rates soared, leading to a slowdown in demand from consumers for big-ticket electronics. It caused a supply glut for the chip sector, which also carried into 2023, and heavily affected AMD's bottom line."", 'The company delivered $2.65 in adjusted earnings per share for the year, down 24% compared to 2022. That places AMD stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 63.3.', 'For context, the iShares Semiconductor ETF trades at a P/E of just 31.9, which means AMD stock is almost twice as expensive as its industry peers.', ""However, Wall Street's consensus estimate suggests AMD will return to growth in 2024 and deliver $3.67 in earnings per share, which would shrink its P/E to 45.5. Then, looking out to 2025, AMD could deliver $5.50 in earnings, which would shrink its P/E to just 30.3 (assuming its stock price remained constant). The high estimate for that year is $9.05, which would result in a P/E of just 18.5."", ""The point I'm making is that AMD stock looks cheaper the further into the future you look, and the company might even obliterate Wall Street's estimates with the help of AI. Investors need only examine Nvidia's performance lately: That company is wrapping up its fiscal 2024 year right now, and its revenue and earnings are expected to have soared by 118% and 368%, respectively."", ""I'm not suggesting AMD will replicate Nvidia's remarkable results (particularly the tripling of its stock price last year), but the strength in demand for AI is unmistakable, and many of Nvidia's top clients are already exploring AMD's MI300 series. Plus, AMD appears to have most of the AI-enabled personal computing market to itself right now."", ""Regardless of AMD's currently elevated valuation, I think investors would do well to buy the stock as long as they can hold for three years or more.

With that in mind, read on for a look at two top stocks I've purchased in 2024 and plan to hold for the long haul."", ""StoneCo (NASDAQ: STNE) is a Brazil-based financial technologies company that provides leading payment-processing solutions and other services for small and medium-sized businesses.

Revenue increased 25% year over year in the third quarter, and the company's adjusted net income more than quadrupled in the period."", ""While the big earnings growth in Q3 was partially attributable to starting from a relatively small amount of profit in last year's term, it looks like strong momentum will continue for the business. The company's forward guidance points to big upside return potential."", ""From 2024 through 2027, StoneCo expects that it will grow its adjusted net income at an average annual rate of 31%. Even if the company were to only grow its profits at half that rate across the stretch, its shares would be significantly undervalued based on a price-to-earnings-growth analysis.

Even more impressive, it's the most profitable entertainment product ever released."", ""Now Take-Two is gearing up to release Grand Theft Auto VI. The title is forecast to be released in next year's first quarter, and it's set to supercharge the game maker's financial performance."", ""For the company's current fiscal year, which ends March 31, Take-Two's midpoint guidance calls for bookings of roughly $5.5 billion and unrestricted adjusted operating cash flow of $1 billion. Jump ahead to next fiscal year, which will likely play host to GTA VI's release, and Take-Two expects to record over $8 billion in bookings and more than $1 billion in unrestricted adjusted operating cash flow."", ""Crucially, Grand Theft Auto VI won't be a one-time performance driver. GTA V first released in 2013 and has been a strong seller for more than a decade. With its sequel on the horizon, Take-Two looks poised for a new growth phase."", ""Currently, Take-Two stock is trading at roughly 23 times the midpoint analyst target for next year's expected earnings.

In particular, megacap enterprises such as the ""Magnificent Seven"" produced outsize gains and helped push the Nasdaq Composite over 40%. Indeed, AI tailwinds seem to have carried over into 2024 and are one of the core reasons the S&P 500 is trading at record high levels.', ""Underneath the AI umbrella, one of the biggest themes surrounding the technology is semiconductors. In particular, Nvidia's leading position among chip manufacturers helped fuel the stock over 200% last year."", ""However, savvy investors understand that there are other opportunities alongside semiconductor businesses. With a market cap of just $28 billion, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) may not be on your radar yet. The company designs server and storage solutions and notably leverages Nvidia's and Advanced Micro Devices' GPU systems."", ""As investors continue to pour into semiconductor stocks, a thorough analysis of Super Micro's business may shed light on tangential opportunities in the space."", 'Super Micro manufactures IT architecture such as server rack solutions and storage clusters. As applications for generative AI continue to grow, demand for high end compute and storage solutions should also rise.', 'On the surface, this trend seems to be beneficial for chip businesses. However, companies like Super Micro are also a beneficiary given their role in design solutions. This is why George Tsilis of TD Ameritrade referred to Super Micro as a ""stealth Nvidia"" opportunity. While the company does not directly compete with chip makers, its relationship with the industry\'s leading players has served as a bellwether for business.', 'Over the last year, Super Micro has witnessed more pronounced growth as demand for AI solutions increased. In fact, in mid-January the company revised guidance for its second quarter of fiscal 2024, ended Dec. 31.', ""Initially, management guided for sales between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion for the quarter and earnings per share (EPS) between $3.75 and $4.24. However, the company's new guidance called for revenue of $3.6 billion and earnings of nearly $5 per share."", 'Jus this week Super Micro reported results for its second fiscal quarter, exceeding its own expectations. The company reported revenue of $3.7 billion, representing 103% growth year over year and 73% growth quarter over quarter. On the profitability side, EPS grew 62% annually to $5.10.', ""While the financial profile is impressive and the company's growth prospects appear robust, a close analysis of Super Micro's valuation would be prudent before pouring into the stock."", ""In a way, Super Micro trades in tandem with its chip manufacturing cohorts. In other words, when Nvidia, AMD, and others tout the song of AI, Super Micro stock enjoys some increased buying activity as well. While this can make some sense, investors should realize that Super Micro stock is up almost 600% since January 2023. Moreover, a closer look at some valuation multiples below may shed some light on the company's position relative to its actual competition."", ""Super Micro competes with other integrated systems providers such as IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Dell, and Lenovo. At a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.9, Super Micro stock is the most expensive among its cohorts based on this metric -- and it's not even close. Furthermore, the chart above clearly illustrates the more pronounced uptick in its P/S multiple since the start of the year."", ""Super Micro could represent a unique opportunity for investors looking to diversify their AI holdings. However, while the stock's premium valuation seems warranted, it could also be argued that it is overbought right now. Investors should keep in mind that Super Micro's competitors are diversified businesses with strong capital positions. So even though the company has done a respectable job navigating the competitive landscape, it is still a relatively nascent business operating among much larger tech behemoths."", ""Given Super Micro's stellar growth and its close ties to leading chip manufacturers, I am bullish on its long-term prospects but would caution investors from potentially getting caught up in a momentum play. Moreover, should Super Micro continue to differentiate among its larger competitors, the company may be worth a position for your portfolio.

The sluggishness in the building & construction market and the destocking in consumer electronics are the key concerns. In North America, uncertainties surrounding the U.S. housing market are weighing on building & construction. The housing market is bearing the brunt of interest rate hikes. Softer demand in industrial and consumer durables is hurting chemical volumes. Weaker global economic activities have led to a higher level of uncertainties, which may affect chemical volumes over the near term.Slowdown in Europe and China a Concern: A slower recovery in economic activities in China following the lifting of the restrictions related to the resurgence in COVID-19 infections is hurting chemical demand in that country. Global industrial activities have been affected by a weaker demand recovery in China. The slowdown in Europe, resulting from the war in Ukraine and weaker consumer spending due to high levels of inflation and rising interest rates, has also led to softer demand in that region. The energy and feedstock inflation has resulted in reduced industrial production and consumer spending in Europe. The ongoing weakness in these key regions is likely to impact demand for chemicals over the short haul.Strategic Actions to Aid Results: The companies in this space are taking a host of strategic measures, including cost-cutting and productivity improvement, operational efficiency improvement and actions to strengthen the balance sheet and boost cash flows. In particular, the industry participants are aggressively implementing actions to bring down costs. These include the reduction of discretionary spending. The industry players are also raising selling prices to counter cost inflation.

It enters a market crowded with lower-cost rivals from Meta Platforms, HTC and others that have mostly been confined to the video game market and failed to find a mass audience.', ""Apple has had mixed results courting developers. Netflix, one of the most popular consumer video apps, said late Friday it is not making a new app for the Vision Pro, though consumers can watch movies and series on the device's web browser."", ""YouTube, which could not immediately be reached for comment, said in a Bloomberg report that it is not planning to launch a new app for the device but consumers can instead use the Safari web browser. The music streaming service, Spotify, also has not developed an app for the product's launch, according to a person familiar with the matter."", 'The pricey device comes with custom computing chips and difficult-to-manufacture displays that rivals lack. Analysts who have tried the headset say these features could make the device a threat to almost every large two-dimensional screen at home or work.', ""Walt Disney has quietly worked with Apple for years on an app for the Vision Pro's launch, the latest in a history of collaboration between the two companies."", ""“When we saw this, it became evident it was a new canvas for how we can tell stories in a way that hasn't been done before,” said Aaron LaBerge, chief technology officer of Disney Entertainment. “And so it became pretty obvious that we wanted to do something here just as a way to stretch ourselves.”"", 'The Disney+ app envelops movie viewers in one of four environments, so they can watch “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” from the seat of a fictional X-34 landspeeder craft on the planet of Tatooine, like a futuristic drive-in movie theater, or catch “Avengers: Endgame” from inside Avengers Tower in midtown Manhattan. Viewers can also watch 42 Disney films in 3D, including box office hits “Avatar: The Way of Water,” “Black Panther” and “Inside Out.”', 'Jamie Voris, chief technology officer at Walt Disney Studios, said filmmakers such as “The Lion King” director Jon Favreau and James Cameron of ""Avatar"" are interested in telling stories in new ways. Disney will soon introduce an experience it teased in a clip screened at Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference last June, in which consumers interact with its Marvel Studios animated anthology series, “What If?”', 'The device also opens new ways to experience live sporting events or theme park rides, LaBerge said.', '“It speaks really well to what we do best, which is bring our characters and stories into the real world and bring you closer to the people that you care about,” said Voris.', 'It’s not clear that a mixed-reality device was what late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs had in mind when he confided to biographer Walter Isaacson that, in developing a next-generation television, “I finally cracked it.” But to analysts like Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies, the Vision Pro seemed like it fulfilled that long-ago promise.', '""I don\'t know if this is what Jobs meant when he said \'I cracked TV,\'"" said Bajarin. ""But the platform element is what makes it more interesting than if they launched a TV. It can be productivity. It can be social. ... It could become a much bigger deal and a much bigger opportunity than if it were just a TV.""', 'To be sure, the pricey Vision Pro will not be a quick best-seller. In a note to investors, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple has told its supply chain to expect to build only 1 million units - and even that might be Apple preparing excess capacity ahead of consumer demand.', 'Apple’s approach “suggests a lack of confidence that consumers will feel compelled to buy immediately without needing to be convinced by in-store demos,” Sacconaghi wrote.', 'But the high price presents less of a barrier to business purchasers.', 'Jay Wright, chief executive of Campfire, a startup that makes software for using headsets to collaborate remotely on three-dimensional files such as engine designs, noted that the original Mac computer in 1984 cost the equivalent of nearly $7,500 today. But small businesses flocked to the Mac for its ability to create and print documents and brochures.', ""“It's important to recognize this is not a consumer accessory device, like Apple Watch. This is a whole new computing platform,” Wright said. “I'm of the opinion that this is more like what comes after the Mac than what comes after the iPhone.”"", '(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Peter Henderson, Lisa Shumaker and Diane Craft)']"

Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""It is quite clear that Walt Disney's ROE is rather low. Not just that, even compared to the industry average of 16%, the company's ROE is entirely unremarkable. Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 35% seen by Walt Disney over the last five years is not surprising. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. For instance, the company has a very high payout ratio, or is faced with competitive pressures."", ""That being said, we compared Walt Disney's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 18% in the same 5-year period."", ""The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth.

Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Under Armour?', ""For Under Armour, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +6.62%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.', 'So, this combination indicates that Under Armour will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Under Armour would post earnings of $0.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.24, delivering a surprise of +14.29%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower.

Crude oil prices cooled off from their war-driven spike in 2022. Lower oil prices weren't what most industry watchers expected when the year started."", ""Last year's unexpected oil market shows just how hard it can be to predict what will happen next in the oil patch. However, that isn't going to stop a few Fool.com contributors from trying. Here's a look at their bold predictions for Helmerich & Payne (NYSE: HP), Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN), and Chevron (NYSE: CVX), as well as the larger oil market."", 'Tyler Crowe (Helmerich & Payne): U.S. shale may be a victim of its success. Over the past several years, shale drilling has gone from a novel, high-cost technological development to a lower-cost production source. Shale drilling has launched U.S. production from a meager 6.7 million barrels per day of crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2008 to almost 20 million barrels per day of the same products today.', 'What is equally impressive is that many of the companies drilling for the stuff are doing so profitably today. Integrated companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron, as well as independent producers such as Devon Energy and Occidental Petroleum, tout that onshore shale production remains solidly profitable, with prices as low as $50 a barrel or even lower.', 'This is all great news for U.S. producers and has made them cash-gushing assets. There is a trade-off, though. With production solidly profitable, there is little reason to scale back growth. That, in turn, will likely provide ample supply to the market and prevent prices from rising too much.', 'What is important, though, is that low-cost production should keep drilling activity high. Rig owners and service crews should remain busy and generate good returns. One such example is Helmerich & Payne. The land rig owner is posting per share results comparable to the height of shale drilling mania, but its stock trades for 8.1 times earnings, and it has a 5.5% dividend yield.', ""Barring some unforeseen market changes (increased global conflict, global recession, etc.), the oil market probably won't change much in 2024, but the current market is lucrative for equipment and services companies for investors willing to dig into the less covered parts of the oil market."", 'Matt DiLallo (Devon Energy): A consolidation wave has swept across the oil patch over the past year. Exxon really got the ball rolling by agreeing to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources in a more than $60 billion deal. Chevron followed that up by sealing a deal to buy Hess for about $60 billion. ', ""To forecast the wave will continue isn't very bold, since we've already had a couple of multibillion-dollar deals struck this year. However, I will go out on a limb and predict a deal I think could occur this year: I believe a merger between Devon Energy and Marathon Oil makes so much strategic sense that they could strike a deal. "", ""A common thread running through the current consolidation wave is that the deals will increase the combined company's scale, reducing costs. A tie-up between Devon and Marathon would certainly do that because they have a lot of overlap. Devon operates across five U.S. basins (Williston, Powder River, Anadarko, Delaware, and Eagle Ford). It's particularly strong in the Delaware side of the Permian, where it has a world-class resource position. "", 'In many ways, Marathon would fit Devon like a glove. It has operations in the Williston, Anadarko, Delaware, and Eagle Ford basins (along with international operations in Equatorial Guinea). ', 'Combining the two companies would enable them to increase their scale across those four overlapping U.S. resource basins. The greater scale would enable the combined company to develop those resources more effectively, reducing costs and increasing returns. That would help Devon to produce more free cash flow to support its capital return strategy.', "" In a lot of ways, a deal between Devon and Marathon would mirror Devon's 2021 merger-of-equals transaction with WPX Energy that created the Devon of today. At the right price, a merger with Marathon could create a lot of value for shareholders (Devon has delivered a more than 170% total return since closing its WPX Energy merger). "", ""Jason Hall (Chevron): Tyler and Matt both make some compelling arguments. I especially like Matt's prediction with Devon; whether it's Marathon or another bigger oil company that makes the move, I wouldn't be surprised to see something happen. I also think that a stand-alone Devon could also be a profitable investment if Matt misses the mark."", 'But I\'m going to go in a different direction than both of my colleagues and make the case for Chevron. The oil market is in a bit of a weird place right now. And by weird, I mean completely normal and healthy, something that hasn\'t really felt normal in recent years, with oil prices falling to ""everyone\'s gonna go bankrupt"" lows to ""you\'re gonna make money, and you\'re gonna make money! Everyone\'s gonna make money!"" highs.', ""The interesting thing is, the downturn separated the wheat from the chaff, and the lack of easy capital when oil moved back above $100 for a while kept the industry disciplined and healthy. It shouldn't be a bold prediction, but after the past decade, it feels pretty bold to say that even with continued volatility in oil prices, I expect the industry will remain very profitable."", ""However, it also led to a lot of the typically staid, steady oil stocks like Chevron get bid up to too-pricey valuations. Well, that's changed a bit over the past six quarters, with shares down 20% from the highs. And while not cheap per se, Chevron is now back in the range of good value that makes it a compelling buy."", ""At recent prices, you can buy shares for around 11 times both last year's and expected 2024 earnings, and earn a dividend yield above 4%. And with exposure to the entire oil and gas value chain, Chevron's cash flows are relatively stable, and the dividend is very safe. If you're looking for a more steady investment in the oil patch, Chevron is back on the buy list."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Devon Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Devon Energy, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Devon Energy wasn't one of them.

Although macro challenges are leading to some moderation in activity, we think the space still has fuel left in the tank, especially for the operators that target growth opportunities and operating efficiency initiatives. We advise investors to focus on Valaris Limited VAL, Helmerich & Payne HP and Seadrill Limited SDRL.', 'Industry Overview', ""The Zacks Oil and Gas - Drilling industry consists of companies that provide rigs (or specialized vehicles) on a contractual basis to explore and develop oil and gas. These operators offer drilling rigs (both land-based/onshore and offshore), equipment, services and manpower to exploration and production companies worldwide. Drilling for hydrocarbons is costly and technically difficult, and its future primarily depends on contracting activity and the total number of available rigs at a given time rather than the price of oil or gas. Within the industry, it's interesting to note that the volatility associated with offshore drilling companies is much higher than their onshore counterparts, and their share prices are more correlated to the price of oil. Overall, drilling stocks are among the most volatile in the entire equity market."", ""4 Trends Defining the Oil and Gas - Drilling Industry's Future"", ""Capital Investment Tightness: Despite the improvement in oil prices, for most upstream operators, the focus is still on sustaining the lower spending levels, further trimming breakeven costs and maintaining financial health. Agreed, costs have been slashed and completion activity is looking up, too, but overcapacity and pricing pressure would restrict the positive impact. With customers drilling fewer wells, the demand for oilfield service work has taken a hit. As a supplier of drilling rigs and equipment to the E&P sector, the sentiment toward the industry remains rather uncertain and opaque.Concerns About Cost Escalation: Most energy companies (including the drilling operators) have been experiencing rising costs in the form of increased expenses related to maintenance and inventory. Despite moderating from record levels, U.S. inflation is still running above the Fed's target. This, together with supply-chain tightness, is not only pushing costs higher but also affecting their capital programs. Apart from being hard to ignore, escalation in expenses is also drowning out the benefits of any commodity price increase. In our view, the inflation-associated headwinds will continue to challenge growth and margin numbers with little chance of a quick resolution. This may lead to a rough road for oil/gas equities engaged in drilling.Low Reserve Replenishment a Silver Lining: One of the key positive arguments for drillers is the focus on the reserve replacement rate. Over the past few years, the supermajors have struggled to replace all of the oil and gas they churn out, raising concerns about future production. In this context, Chevron’s 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100% indicates the inability to add proved reserves to the amount of oil and gas produced. This clearly calls for a calibrated approach to meeting reserve shortfalls in the long run. Consequently, a gradual improvement in drilling activity looks likely.Wind-Down of Legacy, High-Margin Contracts: For most operators, order levels have remained depressed, and day rates are trending just above cash costs despite the strong rebound in commodity prices. This has put increased pressure on their revenue-generating capacity. Further, as the companies’ legacy, high-margin contracts wind down slowly, drillers are faced with the prospect of a drop in backlog (and consequently, revenues), which is likely to accelerate over the next few quarters. This also leaves drillers vulnerable to addressing their massive debt maturities and investment in newbuilds."", 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish Outlook', 'The Zacks Oil and Gas - Drilling industry is a 12-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector.

It had earlier expected selling and administrative expenses to be 16% of sales.Clorox anticipates advertising and sales promotion spending to be 11% of sales.

The company’s open-access, shared infrastructure approach ensures a robust and scalable fiber network that multiple operators can utilize. Oladepo also highlighted the significance of collaboration with stakeholders, including customers and government agencies, in achieving rapid infrastructure rollout.IHS Holding's strategic efforts align with the digital economy objectives of the federal government. The accomplishment of this milestone within three years underscores the potential for accelerated critical infrastructure development when key stakeholders unite to achieve shared objectives.

Today, everything - from working remotely and doing homework, to earning a degree or certificate, learning digital skills, applying for jobs, and communicating with your doctor - happens on the Internet.', 'The impact is tremendous, and today more than 22 million Americans are online with the support of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). Unfortunately, funding for the ACP may run out as soon as April - putting so much progress at risk.', 'We agree with the bipartisan group of 174 mayors - representing cities from Scranton, PA and Jackson, MS to Beaverton, OR and Oakland, CA - who wrote to Congress this week highlighting the impact of the ACP and the urgent need to renew funding for the program.', ""A new study by the Benenson Strategy Group illustrates how impactful the ACP has been for participating individuals and families. The study (supported by Comcast) found that the program benefitted millions of households and may be the greatest advance in connecting lower-income families since our own Internet Essentials program was launched more than ten years ago. There's a lot more work to do to enroll others, but as the Benenson research establishes, it's well worth the investment."", 'Without the program, we run the risk of reversing advancements made to attach so many ""at risk"" citizens as tightly as we can to the modern world. The study confirms what I have seen firsthand - the ACP is benefitting Americans from all walks of life and across the nation. In fact, nearly 50% of ACP enrollees are military families, nearly 41% live in the South, and nearly 26% live in rural areas.', 'According to ACP participants, if they are unable to continue participating in the program:', '71% worry they will miss out on job opportunities that would help them get ahead financially.', '65% worry they will lose their job - a number that is even higher for Americans in rural zip codes.', '81% of ACP parents worry their children will fall behind in school.', '75% worry about losing access to important healthcare services, like online appointments or online prescription refills.', ""I've had the opportunity to cross this great nation to raise awareness about the critical role access to the Internet plays in our daily lives. Affordability has certainly been a significant barrier for many lower income households, and I have been able to point to the ACP and our own Internet Essentials (IE) program as substantial efforts to remove cost as a barrier. There are other barriers. I've met many who are simply unaware that they are eligible for these programs. And I've met others whose life experiences sadly make them distrust solutions like the ACP, as we have found in our research examining Internet Essentials. But along the way, I've met many inspiring Americans who are overcoming these barriers and whose lives have been transformed by the ACP and IE."", ""I'm especially proud of the outreach we've done in the military community - reaching veterans and military families through organizations like the Maryland Center for Veterans Education and Training (MCVET). Last year, I visited MCVET in Baltimore where they helped a veteran named Michael learn about the ACP and connect to the Internet for the first time through Comcast. He is now using the Internet to access his hard-earned military benefits and set up job interviews to jumpstart a career in a new field."", ""There's Mayra - a single mother of two in Philadelphia, PA. Without Internet access, her children struggled to the keep up with their schoolwork. But once she got her home connected with the help of the ACP (by enrolling in Comcast's IE program), her children were able to stay on track in their own home. Today, one of her daughters is enrolled in a four-year university. She's working to become one of the first in her family to graduate from college and to pursue her ultimate dream of becoming a lawyer."", 'I also met Gina- a mother of three from St. Paul, MN. When her kids faced a range of urgent and chronic health issues, she relied on ACP to help pay for home Internet so she could access digital healthcare and wellness services for her children.', ""At Comcast, we've been committed to closing the digital divide for more than a decade. For ACP participants concerned that the government will fail to extend the program, we have your back with options to keep you and your family connected. For example, we will continue to offer a variety of reliable, low-cost Internet services, like Internet Essentials, for as low as $9.95/month, the exact same price as when the service was introduced in 2011."", ""We're also committed to reaching more Americans with our powerful network through expansions happening in every corner of the country. Every time Comcast flips the switch on a new residential block or bustling main street, we bring not only our world-class suite of services, but a commitment to supporting the community. In rural Biola, CA for example, we have invested in local organizations and since day one have shared broadband affordability resources like the ACP with residents."", ""Comcast also offers unlimited access to the nation's largest network of WiFi hotspots through WiFi Pass, for $20/month. We'll also continue to offer a range of speeds and service tiers to meet the needs of every household. In addition to our Internet products, we'll leverage our expansive Digital Navigator network and our free, WiFi-connected Lift Zones in neighborhood community centers to ensure families have more ways to get online."", ""Connectivity has reinvented how we work and live. If we fail, in this historic moment, to reach the tens of millions of more Americans who don't yet use the Internet at home, then our collective future is at risk. That's why closing the digital divide must remain at the top of our country's priority list. Comcast will continue to do its part, but the private sector can't do it alone. Congress and the White House must make extending the ACP an immediate, bipartisan priority so that tens of millions of American households, including Michael's, Mayra's, and Gina's get and stay connected to this critical resource."", 'Broderick D.

I'll review both of these areas, starting with our fourth quarter business results.In the quarter, total assets increased to $1.4 trillion, as continued solid organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. Regarding organic growth, fourth quarter organic net new assets were $25 billion, representing 8% annualized growth. This contributed to organic net new assets for the year of $100 billion, representing approximately 9%.In the fourth quarter, recruited assets were $17 billion bringing our total for the full year to $80 billion. Prior to large enterprises, recruited assets for the full year were $67 billion, an increase of nearly 50% year-over-year and a new annual record. This outcome was driven by the ongoing enhancements to our model as well as our expanded addressable markets.Looking at same-store sales, our advisors remain focused on taking care of the clients and delivering a differentiated experience. As a result, our advisors are both winning new clients and expanding wallet share with existing clients, a combination that drove solid same-store sales in Q4.At the same time, we continue to enhance the advisor experience through the delivery of new capabilities and technology and the evolution of our service and operations functions. As a result, asset retention for the full year was approximately 99%. Our fourth quarter business results led to solid financial outcomes with adjusted EPS of $3.51, which brought our full-year total to $15.72, an increase of 36% year-over-year.Let's now turn to the progress we made on our strategic plan. Now as a reminder, our long-term vision is to become the leader across the advisor-centered marketplace. To do that, our strategy is to invest back into the platform to provide unprecedented flexibility in how advisors can affiliate with us and to deliver capabilities and services to help maximize advisors' success throughout the life cycle of their businesses.Doing this well gives us a sustainable path to industry leadership across the advisor experience, organic growth and market share.Now to execute on our strategy, we organize our work into two strategic categories: Horizontal expansion, where we look to expand the ways that advisors and enterprises can affiliate with us, such that we compete for all 300,000 advisors in the marketplace; and vertical integration where we focus on delivering capabilities, technology and services that help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace and be great operators of the business.Now with that as context, let's start with our efforts around horizontal expansion. Over the fourth quarter, we saw strong recruiting in our traditional independent market, adding approximately $14 billion in assets. As a result of the ongoing appeal of our model and the evolution of our go-to-market approach, we maintained our industry-leading win rates while also expanding the breadth and depth of our pipeline.With respect to our new affiliation models, Strategic Wealth, Employee and our enhanced RIA offering, we delivered our strongest year-to-date, recruiting roughly $15 billion in assets, nearly double the total of the prior year. As we look ahead, we expect that the increasing awareness of these models in the marketplace and our ongoing enhancements to their capabilities will help drive sustained increase in their growth.Next, the traditional bank and credit union space continues to be a consistent contributor to organic growth, as we added approximately $1 billion of recruited assets in Q4. In addition, large enterprises remained a meaningful source of recruiting in 2023 with the addition of Bank of the West and Commerce Bank. For 2024, we continue to prepare to onboard the retail wealth management business of Prudential Financial.Now, as a part of that process, our team has been on the road, meeting with Prudential advisors to provide them a preliminary orientation to our platform, and the early feedback has been positive. Looking ahead, we are confident that the appeal of our value proposition for enterprises, matched with our track record of successful execution, positions us well to help solve the needs of a broad spectrum of institutions.Now within our vertical integration efforts, we are focused on investing back into the model in order to deliver a comprehensive platform of capabilities, services and technology that help our advisors differentiate and win in the marketplace and run thriving businesses.As part of this effort, over the past quarter, we continued to make progress on our aspiration of delivering an industry-leading services. This work includes continuing to make our service model more flexible and efficient through a multichannel approach. The purposes of which is to offer a broad spectrum of service options, including human-centric support, digital capabilities and artificial intelligence, such that we can provide advisors the information they need in the channel that works best for them.In that spirit, over the last year, we have continued to expand our digital capabilities, including our digital hubs, which provides advisors always-on support in a centralized and intuitive format. Our investments in this area enabled us to expand from 2 digital hubs to 11 over the last year, with the newest being our Tax Hub, which helps advisors process tax business in a streamlined and highly efficient way.While we are still in the early innings of the adoption of this capability set, the percentage of advisors interactions that go through digital channels has roughly doubled over the last year, from 10% to 20%. And as we continue to refine these capabilities, we believe that digital solutions can ultimately serve as much as 50% of our service interactions.Now as an additional part of our vertical integration strategy, we continue to expand and enhance our services portfolio and are encouraged by the evolving appeal of our value proposition and the seasoning of our capabilities. And as a result of solid demand, the number of advisors utilizing our portfolio of 14 available services continues to increase, and we ended the year with nearly 3,900 active users, up 27% from a year ago.Looking ahead, we remain focused on addressing the needs of a broader set of advisors and are innovating on new services that will directionally double the size of our services portfolio over the next 2 years. And one of the latest innovations in our services portfolio was inspired by our broader efforts to tackle the advisor transition process, which has historically been an industry-wide pain point, given the friction and complexity of changing firms.That said, rather than seeing the transition process as a headwind, we view it as an important strategic opportunity, as the easier we can make it for advisors to change firms, the more it will drive up advisor movement in the industry, where we are well positioned to benefit as the market leader in recruiting.To help solve for that opportunity, we have developed several new transition capabilities and solutions, including live testing environment for advisors to familiarize themselves with our platform before transitioning, fully automated stages of the onboarding process and the suite of transition services that includes short-term admin, branding and bookkeeping support, which helps simplify the transition and onboarding journey, ultimately accelerate advisors readiness and growth.Early feedback on these transition services has been positive, and they are proving to be a catalyst for additional subscriptions, as 40% of advisors who use these solutions end up subscribing to one or more of our other ongoing services.And as we move forward, we will continue to challenge ourselves to solve for advisors' needs at every stage of their practice in order to help them build the perfect business for themselves and ultimately maximize their success.In summary, in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we continued to invest in the value proposition for advisors and their [clients] while driving growth and increasing our market leadership. As we look ahead, we remain focused on executing on our strategy to help our advisors further differentiate and win in the marketplace and as a result, drive long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."", 'Matthew Jon Audette', ""All right. Thank you, Dan, and I'm glad to speak with everyone on today's call. Before I review our fourth quarter results, I would like to highlight our progress during 2023.Against an evolving market backdrop, we maintained our focus on supporting our advisors and their clients while executing on our strategic priorities. We continued to grow assets organically in both our traditional and new markets, successfully onboarded new enterprise clients and continue to make progress with our Liquidity & Succession solution.So as we enter 2024, we remain excited about the opportunities we have to serve and support our more than 22,000 advisors, while continuing to invest in our industry-leading value proposition and drive organic growth.Now let's turn to our fourth quarter business results. Total advisory and brokerage assets were $1.4 trillion, up 9% from Q3, as continued organic growth was complemented by higher equity markets. Total organic net new assets were $25 billion or approximately an 8% annualized growth rate.Our Q4 recruited assets were $17 billion, which brought our total for the year to $80 billion. Looking ahead to Q1, our momentum continues, and we are on pace to deliver another strong quarter of recruiting.As for our Q4 financial results, the combination of organic growth and expense discipline led to adjusted EPS of $3.51. Gross profit was $1.7 billion, down $3 million sequentially. Our payout rate was 87.6%, up 30 basis points from Q3 due to the seasonal build in the production bonus. Looking ahead to Q1, we anticipate our payout rate will decline to approximately 86.5% as the production bonus resets at the beginning of each year.With respect to client cash revenue, it was $374 million, down $4 million from Q3, as average client cash balances declined slightly during the quarter. Client cash balances ended the quarter at $48 billion, up $1 billion sequentially, marking the first quarterly increase since the second quarter of 2022.Within our ICA portfolio, the mix of fixed rate balances ended the quarter at roughly 60%, within our target range of 50% to 75%. As a reminder, during Q4, there were roughly $2.5 billion of fixed rate contracts that matured. We placed $2 billion of these maturing balances into new 5-year contracts, yielding approximately 415 basis points, which is roughly 85 basis points higher than their prior yield. Looking more closely at our ICA yield, it was 317 basis points in Q4, down 1 basis point from Q3. As for Q1, based on where client cash balances and interest rates are today, as well as the yields on our new fixed rate contracts, we expect our ICA yield to increase by approximately 5 basis points.As for service and fee revenue, it was $131 million in Q4, down $5 million from Q3. This decline was primarily driven by lower conference revenue, following our largest advisor conference of the year in Q3, as well as seasonally lower higher IRA fees. Looking ahead to Q1, we expect service and fee revenue to decrease by approximately $5 million sequentially on lower conference.Moving on to Q4 transaction revenue. It was $54 million, up $4 million sequentially due to increased trading volume. As we look ahead to Q1, based on what we have seen to date, we would expect transaction revenue to increase by a couple of million sequentially.Now let's turn to expenses starting with core G&A. It was $364 million in Q4, bringing our full-year core G&A to $1.369 billion. This was within our outlook range and for the full year, represents approximately 15% growth. As a reminder, this included an opportunistic 5% of incremental spend, focused on accelerating our capabilities, as we took advantage of the favorable macro environment.Now, as we look ahead to 2024, we plan to return to more normalized levels of spend, concentrating on investments that enable organic growth and drive operating leverage in our business. In addition, our ongoing investments to scale our business are driving greater efficiencies.Pulling this together, we expect our 2024 core G&A growth rate to be roughly half the rate we saw in 2023. More specifically, we intend to grow 2024 core G&A in a range of 6.25% to 8.75%. As for Q1, we expect core G&A to be in the range of $360 million to $370 million.Note that this core G&A spend is prior to expenses associated with Prudential. As we move closer to onboarding them towards the end of this year, we'll provide an update on 2024 core G&A. I would just emphasize that we expect only a small amount of spend in 2024, as the majority of these costs will be incurred in 2025.Moving on to Q4 promotional expense. It was $138 million, down $2 million sequentially, as lower conference spend was partially offset by higher Prudential-related onboarding and integration costs. Looking ahead to Q1, we expect promotional expense to be roughly flat, as we have one of our largest advisor conferences during the quarter, which will be offset by seasonal declines in marketing spend.As for regulatory expense, it was $9 million in Q4. Looking forward, given the increased size and scale of our business, we would expect regulatory expense to be roughly $10 million per quarter.Looking at share-based compensation expense. It was $16 million in Q4, flat compared to Q3. As we look ahead, we anticipate this expense will increase by approximately $6 million sequentially, as Q1 tends to be our highest quarter of the year, given the timing of our annual stock awards.Regarding capital management, our balance sheet remained strong in Q4 with corporate cash of $184 million. I would note that during the quarter, we completed our first investment-grade debt offer, issuing $750 million of senior notes. With that, our leverage ratio increased to 1.6x and is within our target leverage range of 1.5 to 2.5x.Turning to how we deploy that capital, our framework remains focused on allocating capital aligned with the returns we generate, investing in organic growth first and foremost, pursuing M&A where appropriate and returning excess capital to shareholders.In Q4, we deployed capital across our entire framework, as we continue to invest to drive and support organic growth, allocated capital to M&A within our Liquidity & Succession solution and return capital to our shareholders, repurchasing $225 million of shares. As we look ahead to Q1, we plan to repurchase $200 million of our shares, keeping us on track to execute our $2 billion authorization over 2 years.Turning now to interest expense, it was $54 million in Q4, up $6 million sequentially. Looking ahead to Q1, given current debt balances and interest rates, we expect interest expense to increase by approximately $7 million from Q4.In closing, we delivered another quarter of strong business and financial results. As we look forward, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to continue investing to serve our advisors, grow our business and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open the call for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.', 'Steven Joseph Chubak', ""Maybe just to start off with a question on core G&A and organic growth. The double-digit organic growth you've achieved these past 3 years, it's really been bolstered, at least in part, by significant investments in the platform, and core G&A has also grown at a double-digit clip as well.So the updated core G&A guide for '24 certainly surprised positively. It does imply a significant moderation, as you noted, Matt, in expense growth. But should we expect a slower G&A growth to drive a commensurate slowdown in organic? Or do you feel the NNA momentum can be sustained even with the moderation in G&A spend?"", 'Matthew Jon Audette', ""Yes, Steven, I'll give you some color here, but the answer is going to be the latter. I think the investments are moderated and our confidence and conviction around continuing to drive organic growth is just the same.Now, the details below that, just building a little bit on what I shared in the prepared remarks, the cost strategy or investment strategy remains driving -- investments prioritizing to drive organic growth, as well as driving productivity and efficiency, and I think what's probably most relevant in this conversation is also adapting as the environment evolves.So if you look at, to your point, on 2023 and growing 15%, you kind of break that into -- that 15% into 3 equal categories of about 5% each. The first was really about serving and supporting the core business growth.The second was about continuing to make investments to really improve our value prop through and establish ourselves in the new models and addressable market to scale our services, things of that nature. And that third category, that third 5% was really just being opportunistic about the market really accelerating investments. And I think when you look at the guidance for 2024, our plans for 2024, it's really pulling back in that third category.So we're continuing to make the investment growth. We're continuing to make the investments to improve our value proposition and capabilities. In just those two things, and this may get really to the core of your question, that would typically lead to core G&A growth in the 8% to 10% range.But then you put on top of that, the investments we're making for productivity and efficiency, which do create capacity to invest each and every year, are getting even better. And it's that final point that brings us down to the 6.25% to 8.75%. So hopefully, the color helped there, but I think the headline point is our conviction on continuing to deliver organic growth in this high single digits remains."", 'Steven Joseph Chubak', ""That's great to hear. And for my follow-up, Matt, I was hoping you could just provide an update on January trends. I know it's a seasonally weaker month, typically, for both M&A and cash. And just with cash trends also stabilizing over the last 6 months, just speak to your confidence level that some of these sorting headwinds, which have gotten a lot of their play, are largely in the rear view."", 'Matthew Jon Audette', ""Yes. I think I'll start on cash. I mean the headline is we really saw a cash start to stabilize back in July. So really, if you look at the second half of the year, even by the month, we ended the year at a pretty similar level of where we ended July. So I think what we're seeing in January is really a continuation of that stability.So just a reminder, the seasonal factor that does hit in January is advisory fees, typically hit primarily in the first month of the quarter. So we -- so those do reduce cash balances. It's around $1.2 billion. Outside of that though, we've continued to see stability, so the amount of cash balance moving from customer activity was actually a slight increase in January.So you put that together, and cash balances overall for the month are down $1.2 billion, but it's primarily driven by those fees, and the activity is actually a slight increase. So I think headline is continuing to see stability on the cash sweep side.On the organic growth side, and maybe just -- I'll give a little bit of context and perspective on the overall quarter as well as the month of January, to your point on your first question, when you look at the last 3, 4 years of really driving and delivering that high single-digit organic growth, given the nature of Q1, the first quarter is usually a little bit lower.So in those years, it was typically in the 6% to 7% zone. So if we look at what we're seeing for Q1 '24, is really delivering something in a similar place, that's 6% to 7%.The only thing I would highlight and the reason for this color is we would expect January to actually be a little bit lower than normal, in the 1% to 2% zone, and then February and March actually to be higher than typical, really at those high single digits, really coming together at a 6% to 7% for the quarter.And really, the reason for that is that the seasonal factors that we just talked about on the cash sweep side, meaning advisory fees hitting in the first month of the quarter as well as you have on the NNA front that normal slowdown in the first half of January because of the [tender] closing in the second half of December as well as advisors taking time off, you have those normal factors that come through in January.Two things I would highlight, though, for this January. First is recruiting. Our recruiting continues to be strong. You may recall, Q1 of last year, we set a new record in recruiting prior to large enterprises at around $13 billion. We're on track to exceed that in the first quarter this year. So continued strength there. Just the timing is a little shifted more towards February and March, so you got a little bit of weakness in January.And then on the attrition side, a little bit of the opposite, and that attrition is going to be a little bit heavier in January versus February and March as we had two practices that were acquired to part during the month. And that's normal. It happens from time to time. We just happen to have two in a single month in January. Outside of that, our retention remains consistently high with the levels we've seen.So lots of color there, but I would headline it in, we're looking at Q1 and continuing in that 6% to 7% zone. And you're just going to have a little bit of a different shape to the quarter with January in that 1% to 2% zone."", 'Steven Joseph Chubak', 'Lots to unpack there, but thanks so much for the detail, Matt.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs.', 'Alexander Blostein', ""Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the question as well. Dan, I was hoping we could talk a little bit about the large enterprise channel for you guys. It's been an area of significant success over the last couple of years.So maybe talk a little bit about deal activity expectations for 2024. And in particular, curious about the level of engagement you guys are seeing from insurance company clients on the back of the Pru deal."", 'Dan Hogan Arnold', ""Yes. Thanks, Alex. So look, with respect to our large enterprise channel, we opened this market up back in 2020 with a novel outsourcing solution. And initially, we targeted larger banks and have seen some success up to this point, capturing about $85 billion of assets to our platform. If you look at the total market for banks and outsourcing of wealth management -- for wealth management, it's roughly in and around $1 trillion.We believe our experience, reputation and capability set, it's a compelling solution that helps continue to strengthen that pipeline and offer up an interesting durable growth opportunity as we move forward.That said, at the same time, we took our solution that was targeted to banks, and we made some additional investments and capabilities and personalized options, which enabled us to extend the appeal of that model to, as you said, the insurance companies or product manufacturers that operate wealth management solutions. And now that market represents an additional $1.5 trillion of opportunity.And with the Prudential announcement, it was a catalyst for additional inquiries, exploring the question, so why aren't they outsourcing? and we continue to progress in these discussions and explore others. They're still in the early stages, but we do believe this part of the pipeline will continue to evolve as well.So if I summarize it, as we move forward, we believe our market leadership capability set and a real deep IP for this enterprise channel creates a really unique growth opportunity for us. We're excited about it."", 'Alexander Blostein', ""Great. And a quick follow-up for you, Matt. So nice to see you guys moving forward with reinvestments of the [6 ICA] maturities, the $2 billion that you mentioned. How is demand holding up in the ICA channel for additional fixed maturities as we kind of think about the $6.5 billion tranche that's coming out this year?And is there a way to sort of accelerate some of that reinvestment? I know you provided a schedule, kind of how that shakes out over the course of the year. But any opportunity to move a little faster in case rates to start moving lower to lock in wider spreads?"", 'Matthew Jon Audette', ""Yes, Alex, I think on the demand, the demand is strong. Like if you look at the $2 billion that we did place into new contracts towards the end of the quarter, we're able to place them in 5-year contracts. So that's kind of the longest duration that the market typically offers, which is where we prefer to be right now. And we're able to place them at a 30 basis point spread above, where the curve is.And I think we've talked about, for a long time in this marketplace, there really were no spreads to the curve. And sometimes, they're even discounts. So I think that's probably the most empirical data that the demand is out there, is strong. And you see similar demand on the floating rate side as well.On The second part of your question, the opportunities to accelerate really aren't there. It's kind of the nature of a fixed rate contract, right, for the same reason on both sides of the equation, from a bank liquidity standpoint, where they get it on their side. It's not a very common thing. So I wouldn't expect any opportunities to accelerate it.But as you noted, we have -- when you look at the year, we've got $6.5 billion coming up. And if you look at the marketplace right now, we'd be able to place them in even higher rates. And if that 5-year point is available, we'll be excited to do it there as well. So market is good, but acceleration opportunity is probably not there."", 'Operator', 'One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.', 'Kyle Kenneth Voigt', ""Maybe just a question on the Prudential expenses. First, I just wanted to confirm that the $125 million of the integration and onboarding expenses in the promotional line are onetime and still expected to entirely roll off by the start of 2025.And then can you just help frame the size of the incremental G&A growth we should think about in '25, either on a percentage basis year-on-year or framing relative to the size of the Pru expenses in promo that will be rolling off in '24?"", 'Matthew Jon Audette', ""Yes. Sure, Kyle. I mean I think on the $125 million, yes, they are definitely onetime and specific to bringing Prudential onboard. I think the majority of them will be in 2024. So if you look at what we spent so far in '23, it's in the $25 million, $26 million range. Of that remaining $100 million, that will primarily be in '24. But just depending on the timing of when they come onboard, some of that could flow over into 2025.Now the total amount wouldn't change. It's just a -- it would still be $125 million. It could -- some of it could just go into 2025, but the majority would be in 2024.On the core G&A front, I think the headline I would give you and kind of emphasized in the prepared remarks that the amount we expect in 2024 is relatively small, and it's all about the timing of when they come onboard.I think to your question of how to dimension it, I think I'd just go back to the estimated EBITDA when it's fully ramped, which is around $60 million. And maybe just look at overall margins in our business around 50%, that should give you a sense of the overall expenses. That would go along with it. So I think if you did something like that, you'd be directionally correct. I'd just emphasize that it's -- from a cost standpoint, it's likely to be primarily in 2025, just given the timing of when they're going to come onboard. It's towards the end of ['24]."", 'Kyle Kenneth Voigt', ""Understood. And then just on the follow-up, if you just ask on the M&A environment, we're seeing a macro backdrop now that I expect to be more favorable for M&A in the sector. Markets are at all-time highs. We're starting to see some clarity on interest rates, at least relative to the past year or 2.So just wondering if you could speak to the opportunities you're seeing in the market, whether bid-ask spread between sellers and buyers maybe narrowing? And the number of -- or types of deals that you're seeing come across your desk now versus maybe this time last year."", 'Dan Hogan Arnold', ""Let me take a stab at that one. It's Dan. And hopefully, I'll get all your questions inside of there. So I think, as you know, M&A remains a core part of our strategy as a complement to our organic growth opportunities. And to your question, we focus on three primary categories of opportunities: One is -- first, to grow in our market. So potential acquisitions might include both broker-dealers and RIAs.Examples of that are our (inaudible), [Acquisition 101, Reed acquisition] and then [Fram Capital], which we're closing earlier this year. So those are good examples of how we might look across the marketplace for those opportunities. And look, as the industry continues to consolidate, we would expect to be a participant in that consolidation.The second type of transactions that we will look at is to add capabilities, and these are capabilities where we would ultimately evaluate, allocate -- and should we allocate capital to build, buy or partner. And to the extent this accelerates our desire to create that vertically integrated, feature-rich platform, then this is where we would look to an opportunity like that, as capability transactions would include AdvisoryWorld and Blaze.And to remind you, Blaze a trading platform that we're turning in to what we think will be a really industry-leading trading and rebalancing tool that we're making available to our entire client base in -- early in the Spring. So excited about that type of transaction and what we can do with it.The third type of category or example of a transaction would be deploying capital against this newest capability of liquidity [in succession]. Certainly gives us -- put our capital work in a way that both meets our disciplined return thresholds and then helps both internal and external advisors solve a really important question around this succession needs and requirements that we've talked a lot about over the next 10 years.And again, I think in doing that, it positions us well to not only do that for internal advisors, but also to potentially create that solution for those that aren't part of our enterprise today.So if you just summarize all of that, we consider M&A opportunities a core part of our strategy. But we will remain disciplined to make sure that the framework with which we assess them as they benefit strategically, financially, culturally and operationally. And we'll do it with good discipline around each of these. I hope that helps."", 'Operator', 'One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.', 'Devin Patrick Ryan', ""Okay. Great. A question for Dan. I was interested by the comments you made about some of the new service innovations and really to encourage advisors to move -- and, I guess, move to LPL. And I guess I took that more as LPL looking to win more advisors in motion. But if I look at industry churn, it's been pretty anchored at 5% to 6% in recent history.So I'm just curious, based on what you just talked about, whether it's some of the innovations in the services portfolio or just that you're seeing more broadly occurring in the industry that could really change that 5% to 6% rate, and it would seem like it would be a pretty big deal, if you can? So just love to get a sense of kind of what those innovations actually mean. And then can that rate move for either LPL reasons or industry reasons?"", 'Dan Hogan Arnold', ""Yes, good question. So I think if we just sort of start with the first question around churn or that movement in the marketplace, and we continue to see advisor movement remain flat. Think about that in the range of 5%, 5.5% over the other part of the last couple of years, which is -- you know is below historical norms.Now there has been some mix shift in that turnover and where it's coming from. In fact, in the last year, you've seen movement in the traditional independent market move up, where there's been a slowdown, as an example, from the wires.That said, notwithstanding all of that, I think we, first and foremost, look at our overall win rate, what is moving across all of our different affiliation models as a way to continue to understand their absolute appeal well as their hopefully growing appeal as we invest more into the platform or the model.And as we said earlier, despite this lower movement in advisors, if you look at the relative market share we're picking up in our win rates, you've seen those increase over the past 3 years with that investment back into the model.And I think look, for the newer models, not only do we have higher opportunities to enhance the capability set there as they're on a -- just a fresher journey, if you will, in terms of our investment capabilities there, also their seasoning, the growing awareness and credibility they have in the marketplace can also be a catalyst for higher win rates there. So it's not just even the investment. It's that it's growing seasoning around our right to win, if you will, with those new models.And then finally, to your point, I think one of the things that we look at is if we can't completely control the movement of advisors in the marketplace, what could we do to contribute to it in this notion of concept, making it easier to help an advisor move from one practice to another, given that being what we believe is one of the big hurdles for advisors moving.Boy, if you could solve that or begin to break that down and imagine that in different ways and thus create a much different rubric, if you will, for the change management effort sort of associated to moving the A to B that, that could be a real catalyst to increase that movement in the industry.And so that's the question I think we're trying to explore and that I alluded to in my remarks, and we're using our services portfolio and some of the ways that which we've learned how to add value to advisors and helping them operate, fund their practices and realize that we tweak them a bit and offered them while someone is going through a conversion, that actually could be a catalyst to making it easier to go through that change in management.And thus, it's successful at doing that more structurally. But then you could see the knock-on effect, if you will, of potentially accelerating the movement and with our ability to recruit and our positioning of our models in the marketplace, certainly, that's a strategic opportunity for us. So that's how we pulled that together. I hope that color added some little..."", 'Devin Patrick Ryan', ""Yes. Thanks, Dan. That's great color. And I guess my follow-up is just it's interrelated to that. So your terrific momentum in recruited assets in 2023 and really the new affiliation models are clearly resonating in the market. And I believe you said $15 billion from those new channels in 2023, so that would seem to imply -- I mean the legacy channels would be around $50 billion to get to the $67 billion total, if I'm correct there.So on the new affiliation channels, the contribution continues to scale, and those mature. Should that look like something similar to, call it, the $50 billion from the legacy channels? Or -- I'm just trying to size because they're growing so quickly, kind of what they look like at maybe maturity or something that's more mature like?Or maybe it's well above 50, but just want to get some thoughts on kind of where we're coming from to where we're going just because there has been such a tremendous growth there, especially when you split it out separately."", 'Dan Hogan Arnold', ""Yes. It's a great question. And I think as we think about those longer terms and what is that possibility, I think we start with the size of each of those markets. And that we've broken down in the employee base market is the largest one of all in that $11 trillion to $12 trillion range, our RIA in the second. And then the sort of Swiss model that we have is a subset, if you will, typically those coming out of an employee-based model.And so, if you think about the opportunities that associated with those, I think you would start with that broader market, and then you begin to then drill down on what's our right to win, what's our ability to win, what are the capabilities necessary to continue to grow our win rates inside those markets.And then if you do that, it's reason to believe, given the size of those markets relative to the traditional independent, that even if we achieve half of the win rate or the success rate we do in our traditional independent channel that those begin to make sizable contributions that, as you were estimating, look more like the contribution on the independent side.So what I'm not suggesting is we'll get there, what I am suggesting is that's an opportunity that is worthy of continuing to work into, invest into and challenge ourselves to achieve the type of win rates we have on the independent side in these large markets. I hope that helps."", 'Operator', 'One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.', 'Daniel Thomas Fannon', 'This quarter saw the biggest kind of quarter-over-quarter increase in sales-based commissions, looks to be somewhat driven by annuities. So curious about your outlook for that. And in the context of what the DOL has proposed, how you think that might change behavior or not, going forward?', 'Dan Hogan Arnold', ""Yes. Let me take that one. Thanks for the question. We have seen some momentum, frankly, since rates have gone up, but you've seen the interesting growth in the utilization and probably predictable growth in the utilization of fixed annuities. And then when the equity markets move and have volatility in them, and variable annuities can also be interesting opportunity to deploy capital.And so I think it's been a nice tailwind for annuities for the better part of the year -- last year plus. And you're exactly right, fourth quarter just reinforced that. I think as we go forward, the question around the DOL is a good one relative to brokerage and advisory.And I think as we think about that, we go back to our playbook we used in '15 and '16 time frame, where -- as from a principal standpoint, we believe that maintaining choice for advisors' clients is in their best interest and our interest in making sure that we do the things necessary to preserve the choice for advisors between brokerage and advisory and our ability to ensure that we can help them adequately do that as the rules change relative to Reg BI.And then again, if the DOL rule ultimately goes through and in changes that slightly -- making sure that we're prepared to help them pivot, where they can successfully continue to do that business, where it's in the best interest of the clients. And I think hard to argue with making sure that you provide people choice and then ultimately enable those advisors to serve them or offering a way when they need to for [clients].That said, I do believe that in many cases, annuities will continue to be used where they're needed, where they make sense as a rollover option or where they make sense in helping someone, as we talked about earlier. With downside protection, it's still participating in the upside for the equity markets, there's good places to use them.I think that what we will see though is in other areas, you'll probably see a bigger shift to the utilization of advisory. It's just tougher to do brokerage business. There may be some places, small accounts, there may be other scenarios where given the two options, the advisor ultimately utilizes the [advisor] solution, which is still in the best interest of the client, but also just in the spirit of making sure the business can be better and efficient.So we do believe that's a trend. Hence, the investments in our advisory platforms, vertical integration we have around our advisory offering, again, lines up well with structural [change] as well.So put a capstone on it. We will make sure that we're positioned to enable brokers to continue to be used. I do think that the DOL rule would create some headwind on the percentage of brokerage business that we see. But it won't be a complete change. You'll still see it utilized for [some]. Hope that helped."", 'Daniel Thomas Fannon', 'Understood. And then just as a follow-up, I think, Dan, you mentioned 99% retention in 2023. And then Matt, you called out January a couple of departures. So just curious if we can get some context around maybe what happens in January and if you think retention might be slightly different, given the environment as we think about 2024 more broadly?', 'Dan Hogan Arnold', ""Yes. No, our sense of it is look, we got to make sure we execute on our strategy. We've got to invest in our capabilities, and we've got to deliver -- attempt to deliver an extraordinary experience on a daily basis. We have solid trends there, strengthening NPS scores, evolving capability.We expect that retention rate in that 98.5% range to 99% range to be a good way to think about or good centering point, if you will, on retention for this year outside of the example of what Matt used, where someone sells the practice to potentially solve for succession solution.And look, that was the exact trigger that we launched our liquidity and succession program a year ago, gave us a great opportunity to go solve that really important question that many advisors had. Those two examples, maybe we didn't launch ours in time enough to get a swing at those.And though we won't win them all, we do believe we've got a really a few innovative and differentiated solution that will position us well, not only help serve our clients who are already on our platform, we'll actually use it as a way to attract new assets to the platform because not only do we have a rich value proposition that we serve and support the daily needs, we also can help them with their succession needs. So that's how we're [seeing it]."", 'Operator', 'One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Budish with Barclays.', 'Benjamin Elliot Budish', 'I think most of mine have already kind of been covered, but maybe just one for Matt on the core G&A growth. Can you just talk a little bit about what gets you to the high or low end of the range. It sounds like the Prudential ramp is going to be not too impactful for this year. So what are the sort of factors that could drive that up or down? And at what point in the year do you start to get a better sense of where that shakes out?', 'Matthew Jon Audette', ""Yes. I think what typically drives us within the range is the costs associated with supporting the growth that happens during the year. I think if you look at Q4 of 23 of this quarter is a good example, where we came in within our range but at the high end of the range. And that was really about the variable costs associated with growing, whether it's variable compensation associated with that growth or the direct cost to ramp up. So that's typically the driver within that range, those things."", 'Operator', 'Our next question. And our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.', 'Michael J. Cyprys', ""I just wanted to come back to, Dan, some of your comments earlier just around the movement of advisors across the industry that you alluded to. Curious, what's driving that change that? What might change at the industry level?I hear you on some of the services portfolio innovations that can help move it in your favor for you guys, but just at the macro backdrop for the broader industry, just curious, what might lead that churn to pick up here versus slowdown even further? And then how do you see the sort of backdrop evolving if interest rates are cut?"", 'Dan Hogan Arnold', 'Yes, yes, good questions. Look, I do think you\'ve got a number of different things that might create a slight headwind on movement than at the aggregate had brought it down from I don\'t know, historically, 7% kind of range for movement. And we would expect things to return and normalize over a period of time. These little headwinds that I referenced, some of it is still a bit of a hangover from COVID and just some of the change in complexity that was created as people work through that, I think, is one.I think a second one is you just got -- you\'ve had a volatile market with a lot of geopolitical uncertainty that surrounds it. And advisors avoid sometimes making big strategic moves or pivots or adjustments in periods of time where they\'ve really got to be focused on the clients, and they don\'t want to create more change in the midst of uncertainty. And I think that\'s been something that we\'ve seen over the last couple of years that have created some uncertainty.And I also think you see advisors also pivoting in a new world of post-pandemic, what did they learn from that? What pressure does it put on their practices? The growing complexity of regulations may drive up costs, the whole digitalization of their businesses and their offices, and what does that mean? And how do they think about what is the best partner for them, going forward? What are the types of services that are new to them that can transform their practice?I think just trying to assess what those options and alternatives are in a world that\'s flipped on the side and now you throw AI on top of that, which in the short run, creates lots of noise and exuberance, unfortunately, it\'s also a shiny penny that sometimes doesn\'t always lead to good productive outcomes.And so I think as we get further down the road of assimilating some order to the house being flipped on its side in some cases and helping them really see where they can use technology really wisely to drive productivity with again, either leverage tools or outsource risk management to lower their costs associated with a world that\'s getting tougher and tougher from a regulatory standpoint, where they really do think about ""Hey, how do I drive growth? And what do I need in my value proposition to do that? How do I leverage folks that?"" I think those are some of the interesting questions that is they\'re able to solve those. It enables them to move forward in a little more informed way and thus at a faster pace.So those are some of the little , I think, skirmishes, if you will, that we\'re trying -- we\'re overcoming as we go forward in time that will help return maybe movement back to a more normal [7%].', 'Michael J. Cyprys', ""Great. And just as a follow-up question for Matt on promotional expense, if I adjust for the large enterprise one-timers over the past couple of years, it looks like the underlying promo expense has been in the mid- to high teens. Does that sound about right to you? And arguably, that's in the context of high singles organic growth.So another question there. If we expect that sort of organic growth to persist in the high singles, should we expect a similar mid- to high teens pace of underlying promotional expense, going forward, excluding the large one-timers?"", 'Matthew Jon Audette', ""Well, I think the -- probably the best way to think about it is just to hone in on the key drivers of the growth. And I'd put it in three categories, which could have different trends. I think the first is organic growth overall. That's typically the biggest driver. And the TA associated with bringing recruiting on board is a driver of that.So the amount of recruiting that we do is really the driver there. TA rates really have not -- have been fairly stable, haven't changed recently. So I think where recruiting goes is where that would go.The second is conference spend. And conference spend more kind of trends with the overall number of advisors that we have at LPL, right? They're really important part of how we engage with them, how they engage with each other. So as the firm scales, you could expect that spend to scale.And then lastly, as you highlighted, it's really the onboarding expenses associated with those large enterprises. So that really can be a little bit hard to predict because it depends on the firms that come on board. Prudential is a great example. We've got good insight into spending in '24 and good insight into spending overall to bring that on board. It just depends on what happens on the other side of it.So I'd really put it into those three categories. They kind of trend differently, each. It just depends on how those three things play out."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Michael Cho with JPMorgan.', 'Michael Cho', ""I just want to touch on enterprise quickly again. And I have just a quick two-parter here. You talked about a healthy pipeline and sort of an uptick in conversations since the Prudential announcement. But in terms of kind of looking ahead, I mean, does the Prudential onboarding limit your bandwidth at all to do more Prudential-type deals?And then second, just longer term, looking beyond Prudential, I mean how should we think about framing the potential benefits to LPL's operating scale and leverage as you continue to gain critical mass within the enterprise opportunity set?"", 'Dan Hogan Arnold', ""So look, on the first one, I think we see an interesting pipeline on both sides of that enterprise channel, as I said before, banks and on the insurance/manufacturer-related market space. And with that portfolio comes the continued opportunity, right, to continue to explore and learn both how we're doing the existing programs and how that drives innovation to create more appeal.And the second is every time you bring one on, how do you create a more automated (inaudible) have a better playbook to be more efficient at doing that, so you can do that better and faster and more economically at a lower cost.And so I would tell you we're much better than we were 3 years ago when we brought our first larger enterprises on, and we continue to automate more and more of that kind of changed management of onboarding effort process. And as you rightfully said, to the [access] that you're able to do that, not only are you going to create more interesting economic outcomes by lowering the amount of investment upfront in these opportunities, you also can bring them on at a faster pace.And so I think we're working our way into being able to be very thoughtful about how we bring these on and in an orderly fashion, assuring that first and foremost, we get the experience right, that you continue to operate your existing platform at the level that you want to. And then if you -- as you, again, get better and better at that, I think we can line those up and bring those in a faster and faster pace.And that's what we're challenging ourselves to do without being overly precise and exactly how that would look or what that looks like. I think we begin to challenge ourselves with pragmatic opportunities to think how do you shorten that onboarding and change management network. So that's the problem [we're trying to solve]. Matt, you want to..."", 'Matthew Jon Audette', ""Yes. Yes. I think the answer is a resounding yes are there benefits to scale. I think when you look at just starting high level with the overall value proposition of this channel and the things that we're building, you're bringing on clients, where they're -- once they're on their platform, a big part of the attraction is getting access to our capabilities and allowing them to grow that channel faster on our platform. So you get a place where you're increasing your levels of organic growth.I think maybe to the core of your question, on the cost side, in each of these instances, now you're typically building out capabilities or technology that's really important to that particular enterprise, but they're usually applicable to others as well, right?So you're not only making sure that you have the ability to serve and support this particular client that you're bringing on, but you're usually enhancing those capabilities for things that the rest of LPL or the rest of this channel would like.And I think Pru is a very good example of that, where we're not only bringing on capabilities specific to Prudential, we're building out a platform that can actually open up a much larger channel for us and to recruit more on it. So a headline point there's certainly scaled benefits. And hopefully, those examples are helpful."", 'Operator', ""And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Dan Arnold for closing remarks."", 'Dan Hogan Arnold', 'Hey, I just want to thank everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.

Crude oil prices cooled off from their war-driven spike in 2022. Lower oil prices weren't what most industry watchers expected when the year started."", ""Last year's unexpected oil market shows just how hard it can be to predict what will happen next in the oil patch. However, that isn't going to stop a few Fool.com contributors from trying. Here's a look at their bold predictions for Helmerich & Payne (NYSE: HP), Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN), and Chevron (NYSE: CVX), as well as the larger oil market."", 'Tyler Crowe (Helmerich & Payne): U.S. shale may be a victim of its success. Over the past several years, shale drilling has gone from a novel, high-cost technological development to a lower-cost production source. Shale drilling has launched U.S. production from a meager 6.7 million barrels per day of crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2008 to almost 20 million barrels per day of the same products today.', 'What is equally impressive is that many of the companies drilling for the stuff are doing so profitably today. Integrated companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron, as well as independent producers such as Devon Energy and Occidental Petroleum, tout that onshore shale production remains solidly profitable, with prices as low as $50 a barrel or even lower.', 'This is all great news for U.S. producers and has made them cash-gushing assets. There is a trade-off, though. With production solidly profitable, there is little reason to scale back growth. That, in turn, will likely provide ample supply to the market and prevent prices from rising too much.', 'What is important, though, is that low-cost production should keep drilling activity high. Rig owners and service crews should remain busy and generate good returns. One such example is Helmerich & Payne. The land rig owner is posting per share results comparable to the height of shale drilling mania, but its stock trades for 8.1 times earnings, and it has a 5.5% dividend yield.', ""Barring some unforeseen market changes (increased global conflict, global recession, etc.), the oil market probably won't change much in 2024, but the current market is lucrative for equipment and services companies for investors willing to dig into the less covered parts of the oil market."", 'Matt DiLallo (Devon Energy): A consolidation wave has swept across the oil patch over the past year. Exxon really got the ball rolling by agreeing to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources in a more than $60 billion deal. Chevron followed that up by sealing a deal to buy Hess for about $60 billion. ', ""To forecast the wave will continue isn't very bold, since we've already had a couple of multibillion-dollar deals struck this year. However, I will go out on a limb and predict a deal I think could occur this year: I believe a merger between Devon Energy and Marathon Oil makes so much strategic sense that they could strike a deal. "", ""A common thread running through the current consolidation wave is that the deals will increase the combined company's scale, reducing costs. A tie-up between Devon and Marathon would certainly do that because they have a lot of overlap. Devon operates across five U.S. basins (Williston, Powder River, Anadarko, Delaware, and Eagle Ford). It's particularly strong in the Delaware side of the Permian, where it has a world-class resource position. "", 'In many ways, Marathon would fit Devon like a glove. It has operations in the Williston, Anadarko, Delaware, and Eagle Ford basins (along with international operations in Equatorial Guinea). ', 'Combining the two companies would enable them to increase their scale across those four overlapping U.S. resource basins. The greater scale would enable the combined company to develop those resources more effectively, reducing costs and increasing returns. That would help Devon to produce more free cash flow to support its capital return strategy.', "" In a lot of ways, a deal between Devon and Marathon would mirror Devon's 2021 merger-of-equals transaction with WPX Energy that created the Devon of today. At the right price, a merger with Marathon could create a lot of value for shareholders (Devon has delivered a more than 170% total return since closing its WPX Energy merger). "", ""Jason Hall (Chevron): Tyler and Matt both make some compelling arguments. I especially like Matt's prediction with Devon; whether it's Marathon or another bigger oil company that makes the move, I wouldn't be surprised to see something happen. I also think that a stand-alone Devon could also be a profitable investment if Matt misses the mark."", 'But I\'m going to go in a different direction than both of my colleagues and make the case for Chevron. The oil market is in a bit of a weird place right now. And by weird, I mean completely normal and healthy, something that hasn\'t really felt normal in recent years, with oil prices falling to ""everyone\'s gonna go bankrupt"" lows to ""you\'re gonna make money, and you\'re gonna make money! Everyone\'s gonna make money!"" highs.', ""The interesting thing is, the downturn separated the wheat from the chaff, and the lack of easy capital when oil moved back above $100 for a while kept the industry disciplined and healthy. It shouldn't be a bold prediction, but after the past decade, it feels pretty bold to say that even with continued volatility in oil prices, I expect the industry will remain very profitable."", ""However, it also led to a lot of the typically staid, steady oil stocks like Chevron get bid up to too-pricey valuations. Well, that's changed a bit over the past six quarters, with shares down 20% from the highs. And while not cheap per se, Chevron is now back in the range of good value that makes it a compelling buy."", ""At recent prices, you can buy shares for around 11 times both last year's and expected 2024 earnings, and earn a dividend yield above 4%. And with exposure to the entire oil and gas value chain, Chevron's cash flows are relatively stable, and the dividend is very safe. If you're looking for a more steady investment in the oil patch, Chevron is back on the buy list."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Devon Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Devon Energy, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Devon Energy wasn't one of them.

Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness.

That isn't surprising, given that the chipmaker has struggled on account of an oversupply in the memory market, which led to a decline in its revenue and earnings in recent years."", ""However, a closer look at Micron stock indicates that it has regained its mojo. The stock is up 65% since hitting a 52-week low in March of last year. But can Micron sustain this rally and head higher over the next three years as well? Let's find out."", ""When Micron reported fiscal 2024 first-quarter results (for the three months ended Nov. 30, 2023) in December last year, the company reported a 16% year-over-year increase in revenue to $4.73 billion. That was a big improvement over the company's fiscal 2023 performance when its revenue fell 49% to $15.5 billion."", ""Micron also reported an adjusted loss of $4.45 per share in fiscal 2023 as compared to a profit of $8.35 per share in the preceding year, driven by a massive collapse in memory prices. Poor demand from the smartphone and personal computer (PC) markets led to an oversupply and sent Micron's top and bottom lines packing."", ""However, the company's performance in the previous quarter suggests that it is in turnaround mode. What's more, Micron's guidance for the current quarter points toward an acceleration in its growth."", ""The company anticipates $5.3 billion in revenue in fiscal Q2, which would translate into a solid year-over-year jump of 43%. This terrific turnaround in Micron's fortunes is being driven by the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), as this technology is positively impacting multiple markets that the chipmaker serves."", 'For example, Micron\'s Compute and Networking Business Unit, which includes sales of memory chips used in data centers and PCs, witnessed a 45% sequential increase in revenue. Management said that ""AI-related shipments increased in the data center market,"" driven by the increasing demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which is needed in AI servers to enable faster performance, reduce power consumption, and provide higher capacity.', 'Micron believes that the production ramp of its latest generation of HBM could help it generate ""several hundred"" million dollars in revenue in the current fiscal year, followed by further growth in 2025. More importantly, HBM could turn out to be a strong growth driver for Micron in the long run, as the demand for these chips is predicted to increase at an impressive annual rate of 82% through 2027, according to memory manufacturer SK Hynix.', ""Beyond data centers, the integration of AI-enabled features in smartphones and PCs will be another tailwind for Micron. Market research firm Counterpoint Research estimates that a total of 1 billion smartphones equipped with generative AI features could be shipped from 2024 to 2027. Considering Micron's estimate that each AI-enabled smartphone could require an additional 4GB (gigabytes) to 8GB of additional dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), the company could witness a huge jump in its addressable market because of AI adoption in this space."", 'Meanwhile, Micron is also predicting an identical increase of 4GB to 8GB of DRAM in each AI-enabled PC. This is likely to unlock another lucrative opportunity for Micron as a total of 170 million AI PCs are expected to be shipped in 2027, accounting for 60% of the overall market. That would be a nice jump from this year, when 19% of PCs are predicted to be AI-capable.', ""In all, it is evident that Micron's addressable market is set to grow over the next three years, and this could translate into solid gains for the company."", ""Analysts are anticipating Micron's top line will increase by 46% in fiscal 2024 and 41% in fiscal 2025. Even better, Micron's loss is expected to shrink substantially this year, followed by healthy profit jumps in the fiscal years 2025 and 2026."", ""Assuming Micron does achieve $7.34 per share in earnings in fiscal 2026 and trades at 29 times forward earnings at that time, equivalent to the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks), the company's stock price could hit $213 in the next three years. That points toward 140% gains from current levels, indicating that this semiconductor stock may be able to sustain its recent momentum over the next three years and deliver more gains to investors."", ""That's why investors looking to capitalize on fast-growing trends such as AI should consider buying Micron stock before it jumps higher."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Micron Technology wasn't one of them.

Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. We want to start with a very sincere thank you to our Aon colleagues around the world for all they've done in 2023, deliver for our clients and support each other.As we reflect on 2023, we observed that the client demand driving our Aon United journey, trends around increasing volatility and interconnected risk have accelerated. Specifically, we see 4 broad areas of focus that increase the relevance of our core business and create opportunity to deliver more value to clients. These 4 megatrends revolve around trade and the consequence of sustained geopolitical uncertainty, technology, particularly the rise of AI, weather reflecting the rate of natural catastrophes and workforce where the pandemic has fundamentally impacted talent.These profound transitions described in our Global Risk Management Survey and Human Capital Trends report, require clients to both deliver against today's expectations and evolve to make better decisions on new risk and people challenges. Against that backdrop, we've taken significant steps to accelerate our Aon United strategy in ways that drove performance in 2023 and set the stage to build momentum and deliver stronger performance in 2024.Most notably, we're executing our 3x3 plan to leverage our Risk Capital and Human Capital structuring capability, embed the Aon Client Leadership model across the firm and utilize Aon Business Services to set a new standard of innovation and client service. We then doubled down on this plan by announcing a $900 million investment into our business to accelerate Aon Business Services as a catalyst for the 3x3 plan and to complete workforce strategy efforts to reflect our simplified and more connected go-to-market strategy.We closed the year with strong operating momentum and also took action to build upon our ABS driven capability to deliver innovative and accretive new products into the middle market by announcing our intent to acquire NFP. NFP under the leadership of Doug Hammond and an exceptional team is the premier operating platform in the middle market segment with tremendous client relationships and distribution. And together, we can bring stronger analytics and innovation to this space. And not just capability but content that can serve the middle market, like Aon Cyber Quotient Evaluation or CyQu, a proprietary platform that helps clients identify, measure and manage cyber risk.NFP's operating platform will enable quick and efficient connections [payout] as a services content, driving meaningful growth in the middle market, and we're incredibly excited about the top and bottom line growth potential for NFP given our complementary businesses and expected synergies and the value that we'll create.For Aon overall, and barely one month into 2024, we already feel the momentum from these actions thus demonstrated through the client benefits of our integrated Risk Capital and Human Capital capabilities. On the Risk Capital side, our recent weather climate catastrophe report highlights the growing frequency and severity of events around the world as clients look to manage volatility, enhance resilience and unlock opportunity.To do this, organizations must have more actionable analytics, exactly the insight we bring with Risk Capital, through the combined power of reinsurance and commercial risk analytics and expertise for our clients. We recently saw this in action at our Annual Property Symposium with over 1,000 clients and insurance markets in the room, where we demonstrated a new suite of advanced analytic tools that bring together content and capability across Reinsurance and Commercial Risk.One example is our Property Risk Analyzer, giving clients better understanding of the risk profile in real time which allows us to work more closely together to provide better insight into the risk mitigation options and enables them to make better decisions. From the overwhelming feedback of engagement, it's clear our clients are demanding better solutions and greater support. And because of the steps we've taken and progress we've made with Aon Business Services on products and platforms, we can develop and roll these tools out more quickly for our largest clients and the clients of all sizes delivered efficiently at scale.Equally compelling for Human Capital. Our Human Capital trends report highlights the rising importance of clients of having a unique and differentiated value proposition for employees. We see clients facing significant rising health care cost and lower overall population health, but at a time when the need to provide broad health and well-being offerings is greater than ever. We also saw attracting and retaining top talent as the fourth rank risk in our Global Risk Management Survey. Our clients realize it's more important than ever to have a compelling strategy across health, wealth and talent needs. That's delivered in an efficient way to maximize the benefit towards offering.Together, this creates significant opportunity to work with clients to design and optimize their programs, including core offerings to improve colleague health, how operations drive workers' compensation costs, choosing optimal partners in their health model and supporting top talent through a strong employee value proposition to ultimately maximize return on investment of their people spend.All these are examples of our 3x3 plan in action. It's Human Capital and Risk Capital. Delivered through our Aon Client Leadership model and enabled by Aon Business Services. These 3 pillars reinforce and accelerate our Aon United strategy, which has driven the financial performance and gives us great confidence in our outlook.On financial performance, we delivered strong results in the quarter but contribute to full year progress against our key financial metrics. Organic revenue growth was 7% in the quarter and 7% for the full year, was highlighted by full year double-digit growth in Reinsurance Solutions and Health Solutions. And we've maintained strong overall growth throughout the year on top of 6% organic in the prior year.In the fourth quarter, Commercial Risk grew 4% organically with strength in property, casualty and construction, even against the headwind communicated in prior quarters of ongoing pressure from trends in the M&A and IPO markets. Wealth Solutions, organic growth of 5% in Q4 reflects strong growth in retirement, which includes growth from ongoing pension risk transfer projects and work to help clients address changing regulatory requirements.Reinsurance Solutions organic growth was 14%, contributing to a full year organic growth of 10%, as our team closed the year strong while also helping clients prepare for and execute an early 1/1 renewal. Health Solutions delivered 11% organic growth, reflecting strength around the world in the core, driven by net new business and retention as well as strong growth in the U.S. Consumer Benefit Solutions. This performance gives us confidence in our ability to drive ongoing growth across the portfolio, fully reflecting the strength of Aon United.For the full year, 7% organic growth and ongoing operational improvement have contributed to 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 10% adjusted operating income growth. These strong results demonstrate our progress and momentum as well as the power of our Aon United strategy and Aon Business Services platform. This performance builds on our long-term track record of results.Over the past 12 years, we've strengthened and accelerated organic revenue growth in mid-single digits or greater. Delivered over 1,200 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and growing EPS and free cash flow at 11% compounded annual rate, ending 2023 with nearly $3.2 billion in free cash flow.The steps we've taken to accelerate Aon United with our 3x3 plan reinforce and strengthen our long-term financial guidance for the firm, including mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth in 2024 and over the long term, adjusted operating margin expansion over the long term and long-term double-digit free cash flow growth. As we've communicated, initiatives like our restructuring program and expected acquisition of NFP impact this guidance in the near term, and over time, we believe these initiatives will contribute to significant ongoing shareholder value creation.More important, we view the opportunity as higher over the next 5 years than at any time in our history. And in closing, we're pleased to report another strong year of progress against our Aon United strategy, which we're accelerating with our 3x3 plan deliver Risk Capital and Human Capital at scale, fully reinforce through Aon Business Services.Looking back on the year, we delivered accelerating growth across 3 of 4 solution lines and built momentum across the firm, including 7% full year organic revenue growth, 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, 10% adjusted operating income growth and nearly $3.2 billion of free cash flow. Equally important, we took a series of major actions that position Aon for stronger performance in 2024 and over the coming years.Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial results and long-term outlook. Christa?"", 'Christa Davies', ""Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered strong operating results in the fourth quarter to finish the year strong. In the quarter, we translated 7% organic revenue growth into 60 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, and 10% adjusted operating income growth.For the full year 2023, we delivered 7% organic revenue growth, 80 basis points of margin expansion, 6% EPS growth and generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow. In the quarter, we announced our definitive agreement to acquire leading broker NFP enabling us to unlock the fast-growing mid-market with Aon Business Services-enabled enhanced distribution and further accelerate our Aon United strategy.The steps that we've taken around Aon Business Services now enable us to address this attractive market in a compelling way that delivers Risk Capital and Human Capital at scale to clients of all sizes. The expected acquisition of NFP builds on our long-term proven track record of strategically allocating capital at scale to high return opportunities to create long-term value for clients, colleagues and shareholders. And as Greg mentioned, we see the expected acquisition and our restructuring program, reinforcing our Aon United strategy and our 3x3 plan. We are extremely well positioned to build on this momentum as we head into 2024.As I reflect on our results, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 7% in Q4 and for the full year, highlighted by double-digit organic revenue growth in Reinsurance Solutions and Health Solutions. I would note that reported revenue growth of 8% in Q4 includes a favorable impact from changes in FX of 2%, and there's no net impact from changes in FX to full year reported revenue.I'd also highlight fiduciary investment income, which is not included in organic revenue growth, was $78 million in Q4 and $274 million for the full year. If you were to include fiduciary investment income, organic revenue growth would have been 8% in both Q4 and the full year. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2024 and over the long term.Moving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement in Q4 with adjusted operating margins of 33.8%, an increase of 60 basis points, driven by revenue growth, efficiencies from Aon Business Services, overcoming expense growth, including investment in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth. For the full year, adjusted operating margins of 31.6% reflects margin expansion of 80 basis points. As previously communicated, there was no impact on margin from restructuring savings.Looking forward, we expect to deliver margin expansion in 2024 and over the long term as we continue our track record of cost discipline and managing investments in long-term growth on an ROIC basis. We expect restructuring savings will fall to the bottom line and contribute to full year adjusted operating margin expansion. Restructuring actions completed in 2023 are expected to generate $70 million of run rate savings in 2024. At this time, we continue to expect $100 million of run rate savings in 2024 as we continue to execute against our plans for Aon Business Services and our business.As we've previously communicated, we've conservatively modeled the expected acquisition of NFP to close midyear 2025. While the combined adjusted operating margin will initially be lower than Aon stand-alone, we expect over time to continue to improve Aon's overall margins through operational improvement and the impact from previously communicated cost synergies.Turning to EPS. Adjusted EPS was flat in Q4. Operating income grew 10%, but was offset by a headwind from a higher tax rate in the quarter and nonoperating expense. For the full year, organic revenue growth and margin expansion translated into adjusted EPS growth of 6%, overcoming a headwind from nonoperating expense.I'd note the change in other nonoperating expense had a $0.15 per share or 4% unfavorable impact in Q4 and $0.98 per share or 7% unfavorable impact for the full year. This reflects an unfavorable impact from balance sheet FX remeasurement in the current period, an increase in noncash net periodic pension expense as well as a gain on sale of businesses in the prior year period. Also, as noted in our earnings materials, FX translation had a favorable impact of approximately $0.03 per share in Q4 and an unfavorable impact of $0.17 per share for the full year. If currency remain stable at today's rates, we would expect no material net translation impact to results for the full year 2024.Additionally, in 2024, we expect noncash pension expense in OIE to be $43 million, spread evenly across quarters compared to $71 million in 2023. And as we've previously communicated, based on a mid-2025 close, the expected acquisition of NFP is expected to be dilutive in 2025, breakeven to adjusted 2026 EPS, and accretive in 2027 and beyond. At this time, there are no further updates on the regulatory process or deal time line for NFP.Turning to free cash flow. We generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow in 2023. For the full year, cash from operations increased $216 million year-over-year or 7%, reflecting double-digit operating income growth and overall working capital optimization partially offset by higher cash tax payments. I'd note the negative impact to working capital caused by temporary inversing delays associated with the new system implementation which we communicated last quarter persisted in Q4 and impacted our overall continued progress on working capital.Free cash flow increased 5% as cash flow from operations was offset in part by a $56 million or 29% increase in CapEx. CapEx was $252 million in 2023 as we executed technology projects to drive long-term growth. Going forward, we expect CapEx to grow in line with the business, managed on a disciplined ROIC basis.Looking forward, free cash flow will be impacted in the near term by restructuring, higher interest expense, and the expected NFP deal and integration costs. We expect to return to our trajectory of double-digit free cash flow growth over the long term, driven by operating income growth and a $500 million opportunity in working capital. As we contemplate the expected acquisition of NFP, the transaction strengthens our long-term free cash flow outlook. We expect the transaction to add over $300 million of free cash flow in 2026 and $600 million of free cash flow in 2027.Now let me provide an update on our accelerating Aon United program, which is enabling Aon Business Services and our 3x3 plan. As Greg highlighted, 3x3 part is accelerating our Aon United strategy. We see particular opportunity around Aon Business Services as a catalyst. We are investing to standardize platforms and operations, drive data analytics-based product innovation and deliver at scale to create better tools better experiences and greater relevance for clients and colleagues.In the fourth quarter, we incurred $129 million of restructuring-related charges, with a cash outflow of $13 million. We're pleased with the progress we've made in the quarter, and we've incurred 12% of total expected cash restructuring charges. The actions we've taken in 2023 are expected to generate $70 million of run rate savings in 2024, contributing to the $100 million of cumulative savings we expect for the full year 2024. As mentioned, program savings were not material in 2023.As we said previously, we look at the opportunity in Aon Business Services and across our client vetting capabilities. We know delivering our strategy will result in long-term progress against our key financial metrics and will drive more value for clients, colleagues and shareholders.Turning now to capital allocation. We allocate capital based on return on capital and long-term value creation. And note, over time, we've driven value creation through core business results, share buyback and acquisitions. As you look historically, we have a successful track record balancing acquisitions and dispositions of all sizes and share buyback. Given our strong outlook for free cash flow over the long term, we expect share repurchase to continue remain our highest return on capital opportunity for meaningful ongoing capital allocation. We believe we are significantly undervalued in the market today, highlighted by the $2.7 billion of share repurchase in 2023.We expect to continue to invest organically in content and capabilities we can scale across the firm, and we'll continue to assess priority areas for inorganic investment, noting our M&A pipeline continues to be focused on our global priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to our clients growing and evolving challenges.We will continue to assess all capital allocation decisions on an ROIC basis. Noting we ended 2023 with an ROIC of 33.1%, an increase of nearly 2,100 basis points over the last 12 years, reflecting our track record of balancing growth and returns to create long-term value. I'd note, ROIC will initially be negatively impacted after the expected acquisition of NFP. We expect it to improve over time as we execute our Aon United strategy to drive long-term value creation.Our expected acquisition of NFP is consistent with our proven capital allocation framework. It enables us to put capital to work at scale and strengthen our free cash flow profile in the long term, which will continue to allocate to drive shareholder value creation. Between now and the expected close of the deal, we expect discretionary capital allocation will continue to be much more weighted towards share buyback given the commitments we've made around NFP.Following the expected close of NFP, free cash flow will be impacted in the near term by deal and integration costs and higher interest expense for transaction-related debt, and as we take steps to delever our balance sheet, and return metrics to levels consistent with our current credit ratings profile.Turning now to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. We remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. We expect to continue adding debt supported by EBITDA growth until we complete the expected acquisition of NFP and expect to maintain our current ratings.As we've previously communicated, we expect to fund the cash portion of the purchase with approximately $7 billion of new debt, with $2 billion [borrowed to close] and $5 billion raised in 2024, across a range of maturities subject to market conditions. Following the transaction-related debt issuance in 2024, we expect to incur approximately $12.5 million of negative interest carry expense per quarter until deal close.As we previously communicated, the financing and capital management plan contemplated in the transaction is consistent with maintaining our current investment-grade credit profile. We expect our credit ratios to be elevated over the 12 to 18 months post-close, and we expect to bring our leverage ratios back in line with levels consistent with our credit profile, driven by substantial free cash flow generation and incremental debt capacity from EBITDA growth, noting our track record of effectively managing leverage within current ratings.In summary, in 2023, we delivered strong operational performance, contributing to continued progress against our Aon United strategy. Our strong financial results and discipline in capital management enable us to return $3.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The steps we've taken around our 3x3 plan are accelerating our Aon United strategy catalyzed by Aon Business Services and reinforced by the restructuring program and our expected acquisition of NFP. We remain incredibly excited about the opportunity to continue to drive top and bottom line results to drive value for clients, colleagues and shareholders and look forward to building on this momentum in 2024.With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And our first question today will be coming from the line of Andrew Kligerman with TD Cowen.', 'Andrew Scott Kligerman', 'Kind of interested in the robust growth in both the Reinsurance business and the Health Solutions business and the sustainability there. On Reinsurance, with 14% organic growth, was it largely driven by the capital markets and advisory, and how sustainable do you think that can be? And then on the Consumer Benefit Solutions inside of health, what actually drove the Consumer Benefits Solutions strength?', 'Gregory Clarence Case', ""Well, Andrew, let me start, and Eric can chime in here as well. So overall, we're really pleased with how we closed the year on the growth story overall, when you think about 7% across the firm really strong momentum as we build into 2024. But you're right, our Reinsurance and Health, absolutely phenomenal, teams were absolutely terrific. And I would highlight the quarter but also highlight the year. When you think about Reinsurance across the year at 10% and Health Solutions at 10% double digit, it really is a story amplified by forward really across the year, and has been highly consistent when you think about the description around the 3x3 plan and Risk Capital and Human Capital. Both of these approaches contributed to growth sort of in the context of Health and Reinsurance and give us great momentum as we go into 2024, but maybe Eric, a little texture on both pieces for the year and the quarter."", 'Eric Andersen', ""Sure, Greg. It's a great question. And just to reaffirm, just a fantastic team operating at really on fire. I would say in Q4, to go to your question, there was record cat bond issuance for the quarter, but we also had very strong growth in treaty and fac. So across the board, good.And I would say that the trends that we have been seeing over the last couple of years, I think, have an opportunity to continue. Certainly, whether it's climate change, whether it's casualty uptick in terms of loss costs, whether it's opportunities from a profitability standpoint that our insurers are dealing with from their own books of business. The need for data analytics, the need for capital support as they position their primary businesses are all still there, and it's a global answer. So we're seeing it in Europe and Asia Pacific as well as strength in North America and the U.K. So we're really optimistic about the business and feel like it's really well positioned.And then maybe on the health side, just to comment on the health side. Listen, I think same thing, right? We had great wins in the core health and benefit business. And as you mentioned, the consumer business across the globe, whether led by EMEA, U.K., U.S., and it really was new logos for us on core health and benefits. I think on the consumer side, the ability to offer unique products to the consumer part of our corporate clients is really a strength of the firm, and those products evolve, and I think they're meeting the needs of the individual consumer, and we also see that as an opportunity to continue to grow."", 'Andrew Scott Kligerman', ""Excellent. And then just lastly on M&A, I guess, in the slides, you talked about potentially growing organically and inorganically there. Do you think M&As are a real possibility in the next year or 2 as you kind of await a conclusion on the NFP acquisition? And if you are interested in M&A, what would be some of those targeted businesses where you'd like to be?"", 'Gregory Clarence Case', ""So Andrew, just an overall, as Christa described, we continue to look as we think about deployment of capital. Obviously, buyback it's top of the list given how undervalued we are, but we're looking across the board, even as we think about sort of the closure on the NFP front. And again, return on invested capital base, content based in every way, shape or form, but we see opportunities around the world. And our pipeline continues to be very strong. But what else could you add from a capital allocation standpoint."", 'Christa Davies', 'I mean reinforcing exactly what you said, Greg. We allocate capital based on return on capital. We definitely -- based on the free cash flow outlook in 2024 in the long term, see we are significantly undervalued, and we will disproportionately allocate that free cash flow to buyback in 2024. But we do have a great M&A pipeline, Andrew, to your question. In areas like data analytics, if you think about the acquisition of Tyche, a fantastic acquisition in the data analytics space in areas like health, as Eric highlighted. And so there are a number of areas that are front and set up for clients in terms of meeting their emerging challenges.', 'Andrew Scott Kligerman', ""And if you see the right opportunity, you wouldn't hesitate to go after it, correct?"", 'Christa Davies', ""And Andrew, the thing I would say is it's all about return on capital. And so given how undervalued we are, buyback is the top of the list. And for us to invest in M&A, it's got to be buyback. And so we'll continue to look at everything, and there's certainly some terrific opportunities out there. But we'll continue to be very disciplined on return on capital."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Jack Matten', 'This is Jack on for Mike. A question on organic growth. In your footnotes, it says that organic growth benefited by 1% from a held-for-sale business. Which segment did that impact? And will that have a similar impact until the business is sold?', 'Christa Davies', 'So thanks so much for the question, Jack. We do continue to manage the portfolio actively. These are businesses that we are divesting. And so we think about this as just a better representation of our revenue and business going forward. It is in commercial risk, and we communicated the 1% impact in Q4 and for the full year.', 'Jack Matten', ""Got it. And then second question. You called out again this quarter decline in global M&A activity as being a source of organic growth deceleration from prior periods. Would you be able to offer any color on what percentage of Aon's revenues touch M&A spend? Is it a big enough driver to impact -- to continue negatively impacting growth given that M&A volumes are still falling by double-digit levels?"", 'Gregory Clarence Case', ""Mike, if you step back, it's been the continuation of what we talked about throughout the overall year in terms of sort of where we are. And we would observe, by the way, we (inaudible), if you think about Q4 '23 versus Q4 '22, stayed on 4% and 4%. So it's sort of same year-over-year. Even against this headwind. And we haven't disclosed sort of the detail on sort of the impact that is substantial. We've got an amazing group of colleagues who serve this marketplace.And as Eric has mentioned before on prior calls, we have doubled down in this capability. We fully anticipate this is going to come back in absolute full force. The amount of dry powder out there, as you know well, is extensive. [We'll] remind you, it shows up in our organic when the deal is complete and we see lots of things in the pipeline as sort of things are coming to pass. And we fully expect over the course of 2024 to see a return. But this is meaningful for us, and we've been able to work it very, very strongly and maintain growth across the board, even the face of the segment. But Eric, what else would you add to that?"", 'Eric Andersen', ""Greg, I think you described it perfectly. Just maybe one little bit of color. This week, for example, we held a conference where we had 400 members of the private equity community, the corporate M&A, corp debt teams, the insurance markets, the reps and warranties, tax indemnity type and we essentially were going through the marketplace. Just from a growth standpoint, but also from a product innovation standpoint, recognizing that as the deals return and they will, we want to make sure we're well situated with the clients, with the markets, making sure the products are fit for purpose and are evolving to meet the needs. Not just here in the U.S., but in Europe and other places where -- when it returns, we have made that commitment. We want to hold the team so that we're ready in front and center when the deals start to happen."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.', 'Jamminder Singh Bhullar', ""So first, just following up on the whole M&A discussion. It seems like capital markets activity is beginning to pick up and the investment banks are seeing that across the board. So wondering if you're seeing any signs of that in your business as well? Or is it more your hope that things will pick up in 2024, but you haven't seen any of it?"", 'Gregory Clarence Case', ""Jimmy, we're seeing exactly the same thing you're seeing and you're hearing about. And listen, you can imagine, this is a market we're highly connected to with clients. And with all the banks and everyone else involved in the process. And I would say there's high expectations everywhere. You need only listen to the investment bank quarterly calls to sort of understand that. And so we certainly see lots of potential, and as Eric described, the amount of capital on the sidelines ready to return is high, and we're incredibly well positioned to do that. But I would say, as I mentioned before, it shows up in organic for us as the deals are completed. And so as you see that move, you can expect it's going to be fully reflected in our performance."", 'Jamminder Singh Bhullar', ""Okay. And then on commercial brokerage, the organic growth of 4%, I think you mentioned double-digit growth in Asia Pacific, which is obviously good, but it also suggests that the U.S. is very weak and maybe close to flat which seems a little odd given GDP growth, pricing and also just trends that other brokers have reported. So what's really going on in the U.S. that's pressuring the growth to being flat despite some of the tailwinds in the economy overall?"", 'Gregory Clarence Case', ""Yes. I would start overall, your overall assertion, I can see where you're getting to, but really doesn't reflect what's going on in reality. Obviously, the businesses are very, very different sizes. So one doesn't really offset the other in any way, shape or form. We would come back to the overall commercial risk story is exactly what we described before, which is, listen, we are exactly where we were in Q4 of last year with it was an emerging headwind and became a substantial headwind. We overcame that, and a lot of this is not just commercial risk, but the connection of commercial risk and Reinsurance and Risk Capital and we closed the year. We observed some others in the market seems to be retreating. We're not retreating at all. It's 4% versus 4% of last year and we're going into '24 with a lot of momentum. So we're very excited about the overall prospect as we move into 2024. And maybe Eric can talk a little bit about the risk capital implications of all this is coming together and the potential around it."", 'Eric Andersen', ""Yes. Sure, Greg. I think certainly, strong retention, strong new business, both in North America and around the world, and that Commercial Risk business is important. But maybe I'll use it as an opportunity to show the connectivity between sort of the risk capital framework. And maybe I'll talk about the cat bonds that I know we wanted to get some airtime on.We did the first ever cyber cat bond in the quarter which was a great opportunity for our team working with one of our insurance company clients to take the systemic cyber risk and get it into the capital markets which does 2 things. It actually allows the insurer to open up the amount of limit they provide to clients, which was something that our clients were looking for. And it also appropriately values and places that type of systemic risk into the right capital source.But the point of it is we were then able to take that ILS structure using the data and analytics that we did to build it and used it to do an ILS structure for one of the largest corporates in Europe who was looking for a traditional sort of cyber program, but wasn't able to get the limit they wanted. So taking something that we did for an insurer, using the data and analytics and structuring, bringing it to a large corporate.And maybe finishing it because Greg, I know you mentioned NFP in your opening comments and just to tie it through, able to take the same data and analytics that we use to build the cat bond and then the corporate structure to actually power the CyQu product that is built for the middle market, which then attaches a risk transfer product to it. So again, using data and analytics on one topic, just cyber, actually to drive growth in Reinsurance, in commercial risk and ultimately in the middle market part of the commercial risk segment. So that's what's driving the retention. That's what's driving the strong -- the new business. And I think those opportunities exist for us across multiple areas."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley.', 'Jian Huang', ""First question is about the Vesttoo legal settlement. Can you talk about how much of the $197 million is likely to be the full extent of the impact? In other words, in the press release, you obviously mentioned there is a potential of some of that being sent back to you. What's the progress of that? Can you maybe give a little bit more detail of how confident you are that some of the $197 million will be paid back to Aon?"", 'Eric Andersen', ""Listen, I was just open by saying that we strategically wanted to draw a line under the issue for our market partners and for ourselves, so that we were able to move forward together as partners. And so the effort was made to come to an agreement with each of the affected parties, so that we could then continue to both one trade forward, but then also begin to work on recoveries together. And so we see an opportunity for recoveries that will happen over time as the bankruptcy process runs its way through. And we're confident that we'll be able to recover a meaningful amount."", 'Jian Huang', ""Okay. Second question is on cash flow. I understand that you kind of mentioned this a little bit, is that on your slides, you remove the double-digit growth for the near term, but reiterated the long-term guidance for free cash flow. I'm assuming that it's fair to say this is mainly due to the NFP acquisition over the next 2 years. Is it safe to assume that -- like is that the reason? And can you maybe give a little bit more context in terms of how you're thinking about free cash flow guidance going forward?"", 'Christa Davies', ""Yes. Thanks so much for the question. So firstly, I'd reiterate your point, which is we are incredibly confident in the long-term free cash flow growth of double digits and extremely excited about how NFP accelerates the long-term free cash flow growth of Aon. Adding $300 million in free cash flow in 2026 and $600 million of free cash flow in 2027.And look, as we think about free cash flow in 2024, we haven't given specific guidance, but here's how I think about it. We expect to grow free cash flow driven by operating income growth and improvements in working capital. We do expect ongoing cash tax headwind. We've communicated the restructuring program, though we haven't given specific guidance around the timing of the cash impact. And we've talked about the impact of NFP. We don't expect to incur material costs before close. And we've said we will expect to incur $12.5 million of negative interest carry expense per quarter until deal close following the transaction-related debt issuance. We've said CapEx will grow in line with the business from $252 million in 2023. We've communicated legal settlements. And as Eric just said, expect those to flow through over the next several years, note -- will be meaningful recoveries.Ultimately, we expect to deliver underlying free cash flow growth, and we're targeting double digits as we move past the negative impacts of restructuring and NFP. Very excited about the long-term double-digit free cash flow trajectory of Aon. And lastly in 2024, we do expect a disproportionate majority of the free cash flow to be allocated to buyback, given we're operating on a return on capital basis, and we are substantially undervalued today."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs.', 'Robert Cox', 'Maybe just the first question on one of the higher growth areas of insurance and thinking about the higher growth areas, one of those is currently the E&S space. And I was just curious on how Aon thinks internally about the feasibility of owning a wholesale broker. And is there any reason to think that could potentially be a good fit?', 'Eric Andersen', ""Maybe I'll take a stab at that one. Thanks for the question. Listen, there's been explosive growth in the wholesale market over the last -- or the E&S market over the last 5 to 7 years on the magnitude of tenfold. And there's a lot that's driving it, right? Whether it's the lawsuit that you see in the property market, whether it's regulatory pressure on pricing in forms and there's a lot to it. We have consolidated our wholesale relationships so that we're actually working in partnership to get access to those -- to that capital when we need it for our clients.And some of our competitors do own wholesalers, and that's the way they chose to enter into the marketplace. So it's something we always look at, but we like where we are today, and we like the relationships that we have with our major partner as to date, as we needed. That marketplace tends to flex up and down with different market cycles. And so I would say right now, it is based on the challenging market conditions, especially in the property area, it's significant growth, but it will ebb and flow over time."", 'Robert Cox', ""Got it. Appreciate that. And maybe just a follow-up on pricing. I think some of the other brokers have talked about expectations for fairly stable P&C pricing in 2024. I'm curious if Aon shares that view, if there's any other color you would want to add on the pricing trajectory?"", 'Eric Andersen', ""Listen, I think a number of people have commented on it during this earnings season. I would say that we're probably heading towards a market where it's more of a series of markets where you see price competitiveness in certain areas where new capital has drawn in, D&O, for example, would be one that's been called out. You also see challenges still in certain parts of property and people are a little worried about casualty as social inflation, some nuclear verdicts have kind of hit the wires and they're worried about prior year reserves.So I think rather than just a rising market for all, what we're going to see over '24 and '25 and it's going to be very product specific and very risk specific, which is something that I think plays well to us because it allows to use our teams and our analytics to be able to help them think through how they either want to trade or manage the risk. And so -- but I think that's where we see the market going in '24, '25."", 'Gregory Clarence Case', ""I maybe just add, Rob, as well. As you think about impact as it relates to our overall performance, bringing it back to Aon, we talked about mid-single-digit or greater. We don't see anything changing that view. Again, pricing is one aspect. We talked about market impact, which includes insured values and a number of other pieces that fit into the equation. Our ability to work with clients in any type of marketplace and our advantage in doing so. And so our view is market will be where it will be. A series of markets, as Eric just described, but our ability to deliver mid-single-digit or greater, we feel like we're going into '24 with a lot of momentum behind."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.', 'Elyse Beth Greenspan', ""I wanted to come back to commercial risk. You guys said, I guess there was a 1% impact of business that you put out in dispositions in the quarter overall, right? So that would imply if it impacted commercial risk, that was 2% of the segment, which would bring your organic to 2% before that adjustment. And I know you've highlighted the M&A and the SPAC and the IPO slowdown. And I think, Greg, in response to an earlier question, you pointed that the U.S. probably would not have been flat, right? That there's -- we couldn't really back into that, but what is actually impacting commercial risk away from the M&A and SPAC business that aside from this disposition, the growth would have been 2%?"", 'Gregory Clarence Case', 'Christa, you might be on mute.', 'Christa Davies', ""Sorry. So Elyse, one of the things I wanted to clarify was on the held-for-sale item, it is across a couple of solution lines, and we didn't disclose the specifics. But we are divesting this business. And so we think it's a much better representation of our organic revenue growth and the go-forward business. And then as we continue to describe the major impact on commercial risk is the M&A and IPO environment and that has remained depressed. And Eric and Greg have outlined how they see that recovering in 2024. But Eric, would you like to add anything here?"", 'Eric Andersen', 'Christa, the only thing I would add, I mentioned it before, is stronger business growth, strong retention and rollover for our clients in North America and around the world. So the underpinnings of the business continue to be very strong.', 'Elyse Beth Greenspan', ""Okay. That's helpful. And then as we -- one question I had on Reinsurance, right? Obviously, the lower volume quarter, we went through kind of what drove the growth in the fourth quarter. As we think about the Q1 and '24, right, we've heard about the renewals at January 1, being good. But right, obviously, price increases came down because they were so strong last year. How do we think about Reinsurance organic growth in a still strong but decelerating price increase environment?"", 'Eric Andersen', ""Maybe I'll take that one, Greg. Listen, I think there was certainly adequate capital to get the clients' needs done for the 1/1 renewals, then that's predominantly Europe and parts of North America, recognizing that Florida and Asia Pacific tend to be April and June of the year. I would also say part of the risk capital strategy is how do we actually deploy Reinsurance capability into either commercial risk or new sectors. And so just to give you an example, it's kind of early days, but I spent some time in Dubai at the COP conference. And we spent a lot of time working with various government entities around how you bring reinsurance structuring capability to help mitigate the effects of the climate -- change in climate. And so that is core reinsurance, data and analytics, structuring, global access to capital to a whole new sector of potential clients. And so I do think it's -- certainly the main of the business continues to be served by the insurance companies.But there is opportunity outside of that space to drive new growth for us in what you would consider core reinsurance capabilities. So that -- and you should look, think about fac, you think about investment banking, ILS markets and being able to use that capital for corporates. And -- so it's a very creative group that is well coordinated with our commercial risk clients in the risk capital framework. And so we do see opportunities for continued growth in that space over the coming period."", 'Gregory Clarence Case', ""I would add, Elyse, though, the momentum of this team in the core space of reinsurance, but more broadly across risk capital has been tremendous. And obviously, the quarter-by-quarter view is helpful. But we look at the annual view. If you think about kind of 10% for the year, that's what's really unique. Not saying where we're going to be next year other than mid-single-digit or greater across the solution lines, which is which we aspire to.And so I think you could take away, you've just heard on commercial risk momentum into 2024. And clearly, as you look at reinsurance momentum into 2024 for all the reasons that Eric described. In the core solution line, but also in risk capital. Don't lose this. This risk capital orientation is a big deal. It is meaningful in terms of sort of what we're doing same on the Human Capital side. The connectivity across Reinsurance and commercial risk creates better solutions. Eric described a couple of them already. And so for us, we feel good about the momentum going into '24 based on the work we did, the groundwork we laid in '23 on Risk Capital and Human Capital."", 'Elyse Beth Greenspan', ""And then one more, the savings. I know, Christa, you reaffirmed the $100 million for '24. It doesn't sound like there were any that came through in the fourth quarter, so I guess we'll start seeing the savings flow through in the first quarter. Is that correct?"", 'Christa Davies', ""That's correct, Elyse."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.', 'Meyer Shields', ""So Greg and Christa, you've been very consistent about the impact of the slow M&A and IPO market on organic growth. I want to take a step back and say, how do you think about the fact that organic growth is so dependent on one segment of the marketplace that you ended up with such differentiated results relative to peers. Is that a concern?"", 'Gregory Clarence Case', ""Well, if you step back, Meyer, I just would step back too and say look at the overall performance of the firm year-over-year. In essence, we are up for the year, 6% last year, 7% this year across the firm. You think about commercial risk, again, we were 4% in Q4 last year, were 4% in Q4 this year. Even against a substantial headwind we've described. And what we want you to understand in the context of that is imagine all the things are sort of went behind that. They created that momentum in Q4 and into now 2024 in the commercial risk piece. We've overcome that and maintain where we were last year. So we're very optimistic about the momentum into 2024.This category is substantial in M&A, and we love it. And we are disproportionately good at it. We are unbelievably good at it from a client leadership standpoint. And so we don't feel bad about that in the least, we love it, and we're going to double down in it. But we also continue to build out other platforms. This year has given us the opportunity to really think that through and really leverage the risk capital orientation.I would highlight, I mentioned it in my comments, the Property Symposium. We got 1,000 clients and markets in the room, and we bring up the Property Risk Analyzer, and this is really a function of reinsurance and commercial risk analytics. And the power of that in the minds of a client were substantial. And so now we've got a suite of capabilities that are going to contribute to commercial risk and the reinsurance as we head into 2024.So from our standpoint, what we would really like you to take away, and certainly, our feeling and commitment is mid-single-digit or greater, the translation into OI margin improvement, and as Christa described, the translation into double-digit free cash flow growth. We have never had more conviction about each of those 3 categories and are delivering those, and we'll continue to deliver those. And the addition of NFP is only going to strengthen our free cash flow profile over time. So for us, we're always going to be cautious in our approach but resolute, and we feel very good about the momentum going into 2024."", 'Meyer Shields', ""Okay. That's very helpful. Second question, when we look at the strong organic growth in Reinsurance, looking at the breakdown, I think you talked about treaty, facultative and investment banking. Is that component of revenues positive or negative to overall margin?"", 'Christa Davies', ""So Reinsurance is a similar margin business to all of our businesses, which is why we operate Aon as one segment, Meyer. And one of the things we would say part of our Aon United strategy is we are bringing together a lot of the back-office technology, operations and shared service functions into Aon Business Services, which is enabling focus on common and shared operations, technology platforms at scale and then product innovation at scale. And so we're really operating more and more the firm in one segment with Risk Capital, Human Capital, enterprise client and Aon Business Services."", 'Gregory Clarence Case', ""And Meyer, this is worth a -- really a great question, and really, worth a point of high emphasis. This connectivity that Christa is describing, Risk Capital, Human Capital connected through enterprise client delivered and amplified by Aon Business Services, a big deal. Our ability to continue to drive margin improvement as we did this year with lots of investments into the business is high.And the exciting piece is this connectivity on Aon Business Services, 15,000 colleagues working this interconnected into the business is not just continued margin improvement, which you saw, but also the capability to really create outcomes that really drive client innovation options that they didn't have before as well as service enhancements they didn't have before. And so these pieces all come together to sort of create this integrated view which really give us great confidence around not only top line growth, but also margin improvement and the implications on free cash flow."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Charlie Lederer with Citi.', 'Charles William Lederer', ""I guess first question, as we've seen some reserving issues in casualty and financial lines across the industry, wondering if this were to become a more widespread issue for the industry, could that impact Aon's profit commissions? And is that material enough that would impact your margins or organic growth near term?"", 'Eric Andersen', ""So I'll say we don't do the profit commission. So that's [not] true for us. And so that's not in our portfolio. But I would say in terms of what's happening in that marketplace, I do think it does reflect some pressure that the insurers are seeing, especially on the casualty side. I would say on the financial line side, it's probably more a question of just supply and demand, where a lot of the new -- into the market as company (technical difficulty) You're just seeing price competition versus any prior loss problems. But I think the casualty piece with medical inflation, they call it social inflation is affecting their prior reserves. So -- but it will not have an impact on us from that perspective."", 'Charles William Lederer', 'Got it. And then on the Commercial Risk segment. Just wondering as deal volumes come back eventually, does that carry a higher margin where that would help your margins as that becomes a larger proportion of the mix again?', 'Gregory Clarence Case', ""Again, I would just reinforce the point, Charlie, around sort of as Christa described, overall margin ability to sort of drive margin across the firm. We've got a very long track record of being able to do that over the last decade plus. And we have enhanced our ability to do that with Aon Business Services. And so we are excited about adding growth as it also helps us deliver on margin. You don't see us really make that trade-off. We really do both. And the profile is ahead of us to do exactly that. And we would absolutely see as our 3x3 plan fits together that M&A is going to be -- and IPOs are going to be the fundamental part of that, and we're excited to have that growth come back."", 'Operator', 'Our last question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.', 'Jamminder Singh Bhullar', ""I just wanted to follow up on your comments around the expected timing of the close of the NFP deal. Is mid-2025, what you realistically think the deal will close? Or is it just more given the uncertainty you don't want to overpromise because it seems like it's a long lead time for a deal that really, in my view, doesn't entail a lot of antitrust or other issues given the market focus of NFP, but..."", 'Christa Davies', ""Thanks so much for the question. And we agree, we operate in very different segments with very limited overlap, and we fully expect to close in mid-'24. We have modeled the deal very conservatively with a mid-'25 close, and that is us being conservative financially."", 'Jamminder Singh Bhullar', ""Okay. But in terms of -- and then in terms of sort of processes, are there areas where there is some overlap that we can see from the outside? Or do you not think there's going to be anything related to potential dispositions in order to get the deal approved?"", 'Christa Davies', ""So Aon and NFP operate in highly competitive markets. And most importantly, the purpose of this transaction is to grow Aon's presence in the fast-growing middle market segment. And so we do not see overlap, and we again expect the deal to close mid-'24."", 'Operator', 'I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks.', 'Gregory Clarence Case', ""I would like to add a couple of thoughts as we close today, just picking up, Eric and Christa on some of the comments that have been made throughout the call which have been very, very helpful. Just reiterate a couple of things. First, reflect on the long track record we've had delivering on the strategic initiatives and external commitments. And think about it included a number of significant acquisitions and divestitures and a history of successfully executing around the restructuring programs. And that brings us to where we are today, which you can tell from our enthusiasm we're very excited about. You think about the 3x3 plan, each component of our strategy and the execution plan here are fully aligned, totally connected.If you think about Eric described today, Risk Capital and Human Capital and the capability that comes together with that, the client response to this has been exceptional. As we continue to build that, it's now connected completely through our ability to deliver that into the field, enterprise client and the Aon client leadership model, fully connected. And then this amplification on Aon Business Services came up a few times today. We'd encourage you to really dig in and understand the power of what this really means. 15,000 colleagues in this group well beyond the efficiency that Christa described which you saw in the '23 OI margin of 31.6%. It's really the ability to deliver better content and a better service experience. That combination really is extremely -- it's exciting for us in terms of what it means for Aon and for our clients.And as Eric described, it really you think about sort of NFP, the opportunity in NFP is there because of their great capability and awesome operating platform, and our Aon Business Services capability. And again, we bring all that together with a $900 million investment to accelerate that and do that over 3 years across the 3x3 plan with whether we're taking more time. So I just want to highlight as the questions come together, they're really connected in our mind and really put us in a unique position to execute against our overall plan and deliver great momentum in '24, '25 and '26.So I just want to end with that summary and say thanks to everyone for being part of the call today and look forward to our discussion next time."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.""]"

Looking at our volume trends for the fourth quarter, while total average daily volume or ADV declined 7.5% from last year, our performance was a marked improvement from what we reported in the third quarter. During the fourth quarter, our salespeople did an outstanding job of winning back diverted volume and pulling through new volumes. In fact, US Domestic ADV surged 30% from the third quarter to the fourth which was our highest sequential volume ramp ever."", 'By the end of December, we had one back and pull through nearly 60% of the volume diverted during our labor negotiations. Winning back and winning new volume is part of a program we call Project Brown. And this program will continue into 2024. You will recall that at the end of the third quarter, we provided a range of expected revenue and operating profit for the fourth quarter. Looking at our fourth quarter results versus last year, consolidated revenue declined 7.8% to $24.9 billion, which was slightly below the low end of our expectation. Operating profit was $2.8 billion, a decrease of 27.1% from last year, but slightly higher than the low end of our expectations. As a result, our consolidated operating margin was 11.2%, which was well within our expectation.', 'For the year, consolidated revenue was $91 billion, a decrease of 9.3%. Consolidated operating profit totaled $9.9 billion, 28.7% lower than last year. And consolidated operating margin was 10.9%. We generated $5.3 billion in free cash flow during 2023 and we returned $7.6 billion to shareowners in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Brian will provide more detail about our financial results in a moment. 2023 was a unique and quite candidly a difficult and disappointing year. We experienced declines in volume, revenue, and operating profit in all three of our business segments. Some of this performance was due to the macroenvironment and some of it was due to the disruption associated with our labor contract negotiations as well as higher costs associated with the new contract.', ""Through the year, however, we controlled what we could control and in many areas, we delivered the highest productivity results in our company history. And I think most importantly, we stayed on our strategy of customer first, people led, and innovation driven. Let me share a few examples of how our strategy is establishing a foundation for future growth. Starting with customer first. In 2023, our healthcare portfolio achieved our target of $10 billion in revenue. Here we've made strong progress towards our goal of becoming the number-one complex healthcare provider in the growing $130 billion global healthcare logistics market. Our global network of healthcare-compliant distribution space topped 17 million square feet in 2023. And our acquisitions of Bomi Group and MNX Global Logistics have expanded our cold-chain capabilities and are enabling us to reach new markets and customers."", 'To support growth in our international small package business, in December, we announced plans to build a new air hub at Hong Kong International Airport. This new air hub supports our plans to grow in the best parts of the market, including highly profitable Asia trade lines and will enable us to expand our export and import business in the region. During the year, we continue to grow our SMB penetration. In 2023, SMBs made up 28.6% of our total US volume, an increase of 60 basis points from last year. Part of this growth came from DAP, our Digital Access Program. DAP has transformed how small companies do business with UPS. And in 2023, we generated $2.9 billion in DAP revenue, an increase of 22% year-over-year. Moving to People Led. In 2023, we delivered a labor agreement that provides certainty for the next five years.', ""And because I'm a big believer in the power of One UPS. This year, we are returning to a policy of everyone back in the office five days a week. In terms of our culture, we are a network company not just of logistics capabilities, but a personal relationships too which brings me to innovation driven. On our busiest peak days, we sort over 50 million packages in the US and deliver more than 30 million packages worldwide. How do we do it? By leveraging the agility of our integrated network powered by UPS technologies and the skills of our engineers and operating team. Our network planning tools enabled us to quickly match capacity with volume across the network and drive productivity. Technology also enabled improvements to driver and help our route planning and dispatch, resulting in improvements in density and fewer seasonal support drivers than in prior year."", 'It might surprise you to learn that we typically see an increase in returns volume before Christmas. In the fourth quarter, we moved lightening fast to integrate Happy Returns. We made box-free, label-free returns available in over 5,000 UPS store locations just eight days after the acquisition close. Happy Returns digital experience helped drive returns volume in the fourth quarter with momentum extending into the first quarter of 2024. Finally, we continue to deploy transformative technology to increase efficiency within our warehousing facilities. The latest example is our state-of-the-art pick, pack, and ship center in Louisville, Kentucky, that we call UPS Velocity. We named it Velocity because it leverages robotics, automation, machine-learning, and artificial intelligence to streamline fulfillment operations.', ""This facility is capable of processing over 350,000 units per day and enables a best-in-class experience for our customers and their customers. Our customer first, people led innovation driven strategy is the foundation of our business. And our continued execution of the strategy enables us to exit 2023 with momentum. But momentum is not enough. We have decided to take some bold moves to right-size our company for the future and to focus on the key enablers of growth. So today, we are announcing two actions. First, we plan to explore strategic alternatives for our truckload brokerage business known as Coyote. Coyote is part of Supply Chain Solutions, and it's a business that's highly cyclical with considerable earnings volatility. We will keep you apprised as we move forward with this analysis."", ""Second, we are going to fit our organization to our strategy and align our resources against what's wildly important. This will result in a workforce reduction of approximately 12,000 positions and around $1 billion in cost out this year. Here, we've identified new ways of working and are calling this fit to serve. Let me end by sharing our 2024 outlook. In 2024, the small package market in the US, excluding Amazon, is expected to grow by less than 1%. And projected market growth rates for the rest of our business segments picked up some improvement, but not until the latter part of the year. In building our 2024 financial targets, we incurred the low end of our guidance on market growth. And for the high-end of our guidance included growth we should experience if we capture market share."", ""In 2024, we expect to generate consolidated revenue ranging from approximately $92 billion to $94.5 billion and a consolidated operating margin ranging from approximately 10% to 10.6%. Given the nuances of our new labor contract, there will be stark contrast between our first-half and our second-half performance. First-half earnings will be compressed and second-half earnings will expand. In both the low and high end of our guidance range, we expect to exit the year with US operating margin of 10%. Brian will provide more details in a moment. UPS remains rock-solid strong. While our dividend payout is currently higher than our targeted payout of 50% of our prior year's adjusted earnings per share, we are confident in our future. As a result, the UPS Board approved $0.01 increase in the quarterly dividend from $1.62 per share to $1.63 per share."", 'This is the 15th consecutive year we have increased the UPS dividend. So now that 2023 is behind us, we look forward to seeing you at our upcoming Investor and Analyst Day on March 26th. At that time, we will share our three-year plans to grow and drive shareowner value. With that, thank you for listening. And now I will turn the call over to Brian.', ""Brian Newman: Thanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments, I'll cover three areas, starting with the macro and our fourth-quarter results, then I'll review our full-year 2023 results, including cash and shareowner returns. And lastly, I'll provide comments on expectations for the markets and our financial outlook for 2024. The macroenvironment in the fourth quarter showed improvements. However, in the transportation and logistics sector conditions remained under pressure, both in the US and internationally due to soft demand and overcapacity in the market. Throughout the quarter, we leveraged the agility of our integrated network to match capacity with demand. And we were recognized by an independent third party for providing industry-leading service for the sixth peak in a row."", ""Looking at our financial results, in the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue was $24.9 billion, down 7.8% from the fourth quarter of 2022. All three of our segments demonstrated agility and on a combined basis drove down total expense by $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter year-over-year. This enabled us to deliver operating profit within the range we communicated to you last quarter. Consolidated operating margin was 11.2% for the quarter and in line with our expectations. For the fourth-quarter, diluted earnings per share was $2.47, down 31.8% from the fourth quarter of 2022. Now, let's look at our business segments. In US Domestic, we knew going into the fourth quarter that volume will be ramping up of an exceptionally low third quarter."", 'Our efforts to win back diverted volume and pull through new volume resulted in a record sequential volume surge. Throughout peak, we delivered excellent service to our customers while managing expenses. In the fourth quarter, average daily volume came in at the low end of our range and was down 7.4% year-over-year. B2B average daily volume in the fourth quarter was down 6.8% year-over-year, driven by declines in the retail, manufacturing, and high-tech sectors. In the fourth quarter, B2B represented 35.5% of our volume, which was up slightly from 35.3% in the same period last year. Also in the fourth quarter, continued macro pressures drove customers to seek economy products as we saw customers shift volumes out of the air onto the ground.', 'Total air average daily volume was down 15% year-over-year, and ground average daily volume was down 5.8% versus the fourth quarter of last year. For the quarter, US Domestic generated revenue of $16.9 billion, down 7.3%. Revenue per piece was slightly positive year-over-year with a number of moving parts. A combination of strong base rates and customer mix increased the revenue per piece growth rates by about 390 basis points. This was offset by a few factors. First, changes in product mix and package characteristics decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 140 basis points. Second, reflecting the lower volume in the quarter, peak season surcharge revenue declined, which reduced the revenue per piece growth rate by about 120 basis points.', 'And lastly, changes in fuel prices decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 110 basis points. Turning to costs, total expense was down 3.6%. And in the face of a 12.1% increase in union wage rates, which was driven by the contractual increase that went into effect last August, we pulled several levers to more than offset the higher expense. First, we leveraged our network planning tools and total service plan to reduce total hours in the fourth quarter by 10.2% which was more than the decline in average daily volume. This enabled us to decrease compensation and benefits, which drove down the total expense growth rate by around 30 basis points. Second, lower purchase transportation expenditures reduced the expense growth rate by around 70 basis points, primarily from lower-volume levels and our continued optimization efforts.', 'Next, lower fuel costs contributed 160 basis points to the decrease in the total expense growth rate. And lastly, the net of all other expense items and allocations, reduced the expense growth rate by 100 basis points. Pulling it all together, these actions helped us reduce US Domestic expense in the fourth quarter by $578 million, which was our largest fourth quarter dollar cost reduction ever. Looking specifically at peak, as volume returned to the network and our biggest customers drove a surge in peak volume, we ran our integrated network with agility. In fact, in 2023, we closed over 30 sorts and they remain closed during peak. By leveraging our network planning tools, we took advantage of the flexibility of our integrated networks and flowed more volumes into our automated buildings.', 'And with smart package smart facility in over 1,000 buildings, misload frequency improved 67%, contributing to the superior service we deliver to our customers. The US Domestic segment delivered $1.6 billion in operating profit, down 32.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. However, compared to the third quarter of 2023, operating profit in US Domestic increased $904 million and was our highest sequential operating profit increase ever. Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 9.3%, a 440 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2023 Moving to our International segment. Soft demand continue to pressure volumes out of Asia. And in Europe, several key economies remain in recession, which pressured demand and drilled the shift away from Express Services.', 'In response, we focused on revenue quality and adjusted our global network to match changes in geographic demand. Looking at volume, in the fourth quarter, International total average daily volume was down 8.3% year-over-year. The decline was primarily due to lower domestic average daily volume, which was down 10.8% driven by declines in Europe and Canada. Areas of the world that continue to face persistent inflationary pressures. On the export side, total average daily volume declined 5.9% on a year-over-year basis, driven by declines in Europe due to weak macro conditions. Looking at Asia, export average daily volume was down 8.9% driven by soft demand in the retail and high-tech sectors. However, export volume on the China to US lane, which is our most profitable lane increased 2.7% driven by SMBs. Nearly offsetting the decline in Asia over in the Americas region export average daily volume grew 11.9%, led by customers in Canada and Mexico, leveraging our cross-border ground service.', 'In the fourth quarter, International revenue was $4.6 billion, which was down 6.9% from last year, primarily due to the decline in volumes. Revenue per piece increased 3.1%. Strong base pricing and a change in customer mix drove a 420 basis-point increase in the revenue per piece growth rate. A reduction in fuel surcharge revenue negatively impacted the revenue per piece growth rate by 60 basis points. And lower demand-related surcharge revenue, which was partially offset by the impact of a weaker US dollar decreased the revenue per piece growth rate by 50 basis points. Moving to expense. In the fourth quarter, total international expense was down $152 million, primarily driven by lower fuel expense. Additionally, in response to the lower demand environment, we managed our network to match capacity with demand, which included reducing international block hours by 9.4%.', 'Operating profit in the International segment was $899 million, down $192 million year-over-year. Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 19.5%. Now, looking at Supply Chain Solutions. In the fourth quarter, revenue was $3.4 billion, down $435 million year-over-year. Looking at the key drivers, in international air freight, overall volumes were down despite a mid-quarter spike in e-commerce. Market rates continue to be pressured, resulting in lower revenue and operating profit. On the ocean side, volume increased, driven by the retail sector. However, excess market capacity pressured revenue and operating profit. Within forwarding, our truckload brokerage unit known as Coyote continued to face pressure from excess capacity in the market, which drove revenue and operating profit down.', 'In the fourth quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated operating profit of $319 million and an operating margin of 9.4%. Walking through the rest of the income statements, we had $207 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $66 million, and our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.5%. Now, let me comment on our full-year 2023 results. For the full-year 2023, revenue declined 9.3% to $91 billion and we generated operating profit of $9.9 billion, a decrease of 28.7% compared to full-year 2022. Consolidated operating margin was 10.9%. We generated $10.2 billion in cash from operations and continue to follow our capital allocation priorities. We invested $5.2 billion in CapEx. Additionally, we acquired MNX Global Logistics and Happy Returns.', 'We distributed $5.4 billion in dividends, which represented a 6.6% increase on a per share basis over 2022. We repaid $2.4 billion in debt that matured during the year. And at the end of the year, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.2 turns. Lastly, we completed $2.25 billion in share buybacks in 2023. And in the segments for the full year, in US Domestic, operating profit was $5.4 billion and operating margin was 9%. The International segment generated $3.3 billion in operating profit and operating margin was 18.4%. And Supply Chain Solutions delivered operating profit of $1.2 billion and an operating margin was 9%. With 2023 behind us, let us move to our outlook for 2024. S&P Global is forecasting an improvement in global macro conditions as the year progresses.', ""Outside the US, real exports in Europe are expected to improve each quarter throughout the year. Looking at Asia, we saw positive momentum on the China to US lane exiting the year, and remain cautious on the outlook for 2024. In the US, the projected small package market growth rate is just under 1% excluding Amazon. A slight improvement is expected in US manufacturing and the consumer is expected to remain resilient despite lingering inflationary pressures. We've built a plan that reflects the current environment and potential risks that we see. This includes getting our organization to our strategy and aligning execution to our wildly important initiatives under what we call fit to serve. As Carol mentioned, we are exploring strategic alternatives for Coyote, our truckload brokerage business, which will enable us to address some of the cyclical impacts in our forwarding business."", 'And we are reducing our workforce by approximately 12,000 positions. This will cut around $1 billion in costs in 2024. Moving to our 2024 financial outlook, we are providing a range based on volume growth. The low end of the range has UPS growing at market rate and the high-end of the range as us gaining share. For the full year 2024, on a consolidated basis, revenues are expected to range from approximately $92 billion to $94.5 billion, and operating margin is expected to range from approximately 10% to 10.6%. In the range provided, we expect to move total average daily volume from negative growth in the first half of the year to positive growth in the back half. This is primarily driven by lapping the volume diversion we experienced in the US last year during our labor negotiations.', 'Additionally, cost will weigh on us in the first half of the year, primarily due to the higher labor cost inflation associated with the new contract. Looking at consolidated revenue, in the first half of the year, we expect the growth rate to decline with a range of approximately 1% to 2% with the first quarter driving the decline. And in the back half of the year, revenue growth is anticipated to be up within a range of mid-to-high single-digits. Looking at consolidated operating profit, we expect material improvement as the year progresses with the second half of the year outperforming the first half. Lastly, we expect to generate our lowest consolidated operating margin of the year in the first quarter. Now let me give you a little color on the segments.', 'Looking at US Domestic, average daily volume growth is expected to be within a range of approximately flat-to-up 2% for the full year. At both the low and high end of the range, we expect the revenue per piece growth rate to outpace the cost per piece growth rate beginning in the third quarter and we expect to exit the year at a 10% operating margin. Moving to the International segment, we expect 2024 average daily volume to be within a range of approximately flat-to-up around 3%. At both ends of the guidance range, operating margin is anticipated to be in the high teens. And in Supply Chain Solutions, for the full year in 2024, we expect revenue to be within a range of approximately $13 billion to $13.5 billion. At both ends of the guidance range, operating margin for SCS is expected to be high-single-digits.', ""And for modeling purposes, in total below the line, we expect approximately $400 million in expense in 2024. This is net of $262 million in pension income. We included a slide in the appendix of today's webcast deck to provide you more detail on pension. The webcast deck will be posted to the UPS Investor Relations website following this call. Now, let's turn to full year 2024 capital allocation. Our capital allocation priorities have not changed. We are staying on strategy and we'll make the best long-term decisions to capture growth, improve efficiency, and deliver value to our shareowners. We expect 2024 capital expenditures to be within our target of around 5% of revenue or $4.5 billion. Now, let's turn to our expectations for cash and the balance sheet."", 'We expect free cash flow to be within a range of approximately $4.5 billion to $5.3 billion including our annual pension contributions of $1.4 billion, which are equal to our expected service costs. As Carol mentioned, the Board has approved a dividend per share of $1.63 for the first quarter. We are planning to pay out around $5.4 billion in dividends in 2024 subject to Board approval. Finally, our effective tax rate in 2024 is expected to be approximately 23.5%. In closing, we look at 2024 as a year to pivot away from negative volume to positive volume growth and from high labor cost inflation to a much lower growth rate. We are laser-focused on executing our strategy, controlling what we can control, and improving our financial performance.', 'We look forward to sharing our multi-year targets in detail on our strategy at our Investor Day event on March 26th.

Thank you for your time and attention this morning.', ""Hal Lawton: Thank you, Mary Winn, and thank you to everyone for joining our call this morning. In 2023, Tractor Supply celebrated our milestone 85th anniversary. Over 85 years, Tractor Supply has been a growth company with a clear purpose to help our customers live Life Out Here. Since 1938, we've operated in all types of economic conditions, embraced innovation and adapted to changing times. We've elevated the farm and ranch channel, bringing the sophistication of other retail categories to improve the shopping journey and ensure we have scalable platforms. Tractor Supply's needs-based, demand-driven business model has stood the test of time. No doubt this past year has proved challenging, more top feature than we expected with the beginning of the year with unfavorable weather, rising interest rates and inflation impacting consumer spending habits, but we believe these headwinds are temporary."", ""We continue to invest for growth in 2023, and gain market share along the way, especially in companion animal and livestock feed. I think the opening video was a great recap of the highlights of the team's significant accomplishments across Tractor Supply in the year and over the last few years. As I reflect on 2023, our Tractor Supply team has navigated so much together, working with commitment and resilience to serve our customers and our communities, and our team has proven their ability to be unrelenting and executing against the macro and other headwinds, while also building our future. I sincerely thank them for living our mission and values. In 2023, we faced the well-documented macro headwinds that weighed on consumer goods spending, particularly discretionary goods, as well as unfavorable weather impacts every quarter on our business."", ""While we've made progress over the years to deseasonalize our business, we will always be the reliable supplier for our customers for their seasonal needs like heating fuel and fertilizer. We estimate that adverse weather conditions negatively impacted our comp sales by approximately 200 basis points for the full year, including the lapping of the late December winter storm in 2022. Personal consumption expenditures saw strong mid single-digit growth in 2023. That said, spending on goods as a percent of PCE declined nearly a point as consumers continue to shift spending on services back to pre-COVID levels. In particular, this affected our big ticket business, which represents a little over 10% of our sales and had a negative 6% comp for the year."", ""Despite the headwinds we faced, we remain committed to our journey of transforming Tractor Supply. Since introducing our Life Out Here strategy in October of 2020, we have dramatically transformed Tractor Supply. Over this time, we've invested nearly $2.5 billion in capital spending with about 80% of that spend targeted for growth initiatives as part of our Life Out Here strategy. This includes new and remodeled stores new distribution centers, upgrading our technology infrastructure and several other strategic investments. We've also significantly improved our operating capabilities, including relaunching our Neighbor's Club program, creating our field activity support team, expanding our mobile footprint and delivering on the increased volume of consumable, usable and edible products."", ""Additionally, our average store volume continues to far exceed pre-pandemic levels, going from $4.5 million to $6.5 million annually per store. Approximately 40% of our stores are in the Project Fusion layout, allowing us to drive improved space productivity. We continue to see a mid single-digit comp lift benefit in the first year from our Fusion remodel. We will enter the spring of 2024 with more than 450 garden centers that are also driving space productivity, while allowing us to enter into new categories that resonate with our customers' hobbies for gardening and their needs for outdoor products. Stores with our garden centers are attracting new customers at a faster pace than the rest of the chain. Additionally, our garden center stores are providing a multiyear comp benefit."", 'Our distribution centers achieved a record year of productivity. The opening of our Novar [ph], Ohio DC in January 2023 allowed us to unlock savings across our network with the largest rebalancing of our stores ever. This provided us with substantial stem mile savings, while also allowing for significantly improved service to our stores. Also importantly, our supply chain team member attrition reduced materially as we implemented a new progressive wage scale. And no doubt, these investments are resonating with our customers, as we have achieved record high customer satisfaction scores throughout the year. As always, our store managers were critical to the success and importantly, we achieved a near all-time low of 12% attrition in this group.', ""Overall, our customer base remains healthy and highly engaged. Now let's go through some of the specific highlights to the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. For the year, we achieved record sales of $14.6 billion. Our comp store sales were even with the prior year and diluted earnings per share were $10.09. This comes on top of record performance over the last three years. We continue to have solid market share gains across our major product categories. And our digital business reached another year of record sales, topping over $1 billion annually for the first time. Since launch, we have had over 7 million downloads of our mobile app and over 2 million in the year. For the fourth quarter, our comparable store sales declined 4.2%. Our fourth quarter diluted EPS was $2.28 with operating profit margin expansion of 16 basis points."", ""For the second consecutive year, we returned over $1 billion to our shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. Strategically, the transformation of our real estate model enabled by a number of new capabilities that are designed to deliver material benefit to both revenue growth and operating margin reinforces our long-term guidance. In 2023, we raised our new store growth target. We now believe there's a 3,000 store opportunity domestically for Tractor Supply. This is supported by our total addressable market of more than $180 billion, our robust growth and our ongoing market share gains. Our new target represents an increase of 200 stores from our previous target of 2,800. We also implemented new capabilities to enable own development of new store builds."", ""This capability is expected to generate significant construction cost savings and allow for lower rents in these applicable stores once we sell them post construction. Our real estate capabilities are a compelling addition to our Life Out Here strategy that will further solidify our growth for many years to come. In 2023, the cadence of new store openings returned to a more normalized rate. We opened 70 new Tractor Supply stores in 13 Petsense stores in 2023. The team has done a great job opening highly productive new stores as this remains a core strength and competency for Tractor Supply. During the year, we successfully converted the 81 Orscheln stores acquired in 2022 to the Tractor Supply brand, representing essentially a year's worth of new store growth."", ""We're very pleased with the opportunity to drive both top line and bottom line performance of these locations closer to our standard run rates over time. Total customer count increased 1%. As we had positive growth in active customers and new reactivated customers. Neighbor's Club added more than 4 million new customers and represented 77% of our sales for the year, our highest mark to date. Neighbor's Club is successfully helping us migrate customers to a higher threshold of spending with us. During the year, we reached a new record for the number of high-value customers. Overall, our best customers are shopping us more frequently, and spending more money per transaction. Last year's re-branding a Petsense to Petsense by Tractor Supply, along with our expansion of our Neighbor's Club program to Petsense, is also resonating with our customers."", ""This expansion is allowing us to deepen relationships with existing customers and help attract new Out Here pet customers to both banners. Our customers' response to these initiatives is very encouraging with Neighbor's Club membership already representing nearly 70% of sales at Petsense with continued momentum. The Petsense shopper is also cross shopping at Tractor Supply at an impressive rate of 47%. Petsense is also helping us gain share across pet specialty as we approach $225 million in sales and our 200 store milestone in the Petsense brand. For the year, our financial services offering of our private label credit card, together with our co-branded credit card outpaced our overall sales with strong growth. Our penetration increased from last year's record level and is now in the high single digits in overall sales."", 'Our supply chain continues to be a competitive advantage for us. During the year, we opened up our ninth distribution center in Novar, Ohio and broke ground on our tenth distribution center in Mall mill, Arkansas. These were investments were to enable the higher volumes of our existing stores, the continued build-out of our new stores as well as the acquisition of Orscheln. These investments in our DC network are complemented by our 15 mixing centers that are there for high-velocity replenishment items. In 2023, we moved nearly £8.5 billion of consumable, usable and edible products through our supply chain as we are the largest seller of packed feeding food for livestock and companion animals in the United States. Our scale and reach provides us with the cost to serve that is lower than our farm and ranch competition and any other competitor in these markets.', ""As we executed the third year of our Life Out Here long-term strategy, 2023 was a year that we made significant progress. We plan to continue building on that progress in 2024. Most of what you'll hear from us today, we'll sell all that different from the playbook we've used for the last two to three years but that's intentional as we continue to be pleased with the benefits and financial returns of our strategic investments. As I've shared many times, our biggest challenge is prioritizing the plethora of growth opportunities we have ahead of us. And we anticipate 2024 to be a continued story of ongoing share gains offset by macro headwinds. With this in mind, we've taken a cautious approach to our 2024 financial outlook with it being below our long-term target."", ""We remain confident in our long-term targets and expect to return to them when macro conditions return to neutral. Our underlying assumptions start with consumers continuing to be judicious and they're spending on good. Additionally, we anticipate average ticket to be pressured as we lap inflation. We're assuming market share gains that are supported by our strategic initiatives will continue. Housing, oil, agriculture and weather are anticipated to be neutral factors in our guidance. Collectively, all these factors are considered to help us provide the guidance range that Kurt will share with you more later on. Tractor Supply is a unique, highly differentiated retailer. We are the leader in a large, fragmented market. We're a needs-based business that is tailored to our Out Here lifestyle."", ""Our customers have a passion for the Out Here lifestyle and over-index as homeowners, landowners, pet owners and animal owners. We live our mission and values and our culture defines our relationship with our customers. As we begin the year, we take great pride in our path and are equally excited about our future. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt."", ""Kurt Barton: Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. I want to start by reiterating Hal's comments on 2023 and our confidence in the long-term opportunities for Tractor Supply. Over my 2.5 decades in this business, I've never seen a year where we've had many transitory headwinds as we did in 2023 that did not break positively at some point during the year. Before I get into my review of the quarter, I wanted to address two items. First, for comparability purposes, please keep in mind, 2022 had a 53rd fiscal week that provided a net sales benefit of $225 million to the prior year fourth quarter, representing about 5.6 percentage points of our net sales decline this quarter. On a full year basis, it negatively impacted net sales by 1.6 percentage points."", 'In addition, diluted EPS in 2022 benefited by $0.16 for the quarter and the year from the 53rd week. Second, overall, the unseasonably warm winter weighed on our results in the fourth quarter. We estimate the impact to be approximately 400 basis points of pressure on our comp sales performance. We knew this was going to be the most challenging quarter of the year, given our strong comp performance of 8.6% in the prior year as we were cycling the late December 2022 winter storm that provided a 200 basis point comp benefit to the fourth quarter of last year. The majority of the pressure was in transactions, given the needs-based nature of our business and it impacted our seasonal categories across Q and other winter goods. Our Q business in the fourth quarter has a higher mix of cold weather seasonal products such as wood pellets, bulk propane, bird feed and pine savings for bedding.', 'From the cadence of the quarter to our product categories, seasonal impacts always play into our performance. Coming into the fourth quarter, we anticipated it would work against us and the quarter played out much like we expected. Factoring in the seasonal impact from the weather, our fourth quarter performance was very much in line with our run rate from last quarter. Most of my remaining commentary of our comp sales performance is on a normalized basis, adjusting for the impact of weather. October and November were very similar in comp sales performance, with December seeing the biggest comp sales decline as we were lapping the winter storm from last year. On a normalized basis, all months performed relatively consistent with a slight decline in comp sales.', 'Turning to our product categories. We continue to see solid performance in Q with above chain average comps, essentially flat for the quarter. On a normalized basis, Q had a positive comparable sales as we continue to gain share. Discretionary categories performed in line with our expectations with a mid single-digit comp sales decline. Big ticket performance showed a continued improvement over the trends of the previous five quarters. Comparable big ticket sales ran slightly negative for the quarter and were positive in the low single digits on a normalized basis. Although our business is not primarily driven by holiday sales in Q4, we were encouraged by our performance during the holiday season, including recording our highest sales day of all time on the day after Thanksgiving and strong performance in the week leading up to Christmas.', 'As we have experienced all year, we saw a continued slowdown in retail price inflation throughout the year, with Q4 experiencing a slight net deflation. We have successfully managed through deflation in various commodities throughout 2023, and believe we are nearing the trough now. In 2023, raw material inputs rolled over as evidenced by the 35% decline in corn from its most recent high in 2022 and currently running about 15% above the historical average. As we exit 2023, these types of feedstock declines are already reflected in our retail prices. Structural inflationary factors such as higher wage rates, transportation costs and other overhead items are all still supporting higher product costs. Moving on to gross margin. For the fourth quarter, our trend of strong gross margin performance continued with a year-over-year improvement of 129 basis points to 35.3% of sales.', 'Our gross margin expansion was led by improvements in the supply chain from lower transportation rates and efficiencies in our network, including opening a new DC. We continue to benefit from our commitment to everyday low prices, and disciplined product cost management. While our promotional activity was modestly greater than the prior year, we were able to strategically provide great value for our customers while maintaining our gross margin. These favorable drivers were partially offset by an unfavorable product mix shift due to a higher mix of Q and a lower mix of high-margin seasonal categories. As a percent of that sales, SG&A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 113 basis points year-over-year to 26.2%. This increase was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included higher depreciation and amortization and the onboarding of our new DC, along with some lost fixed cost leverage due to the decline in comparable store sales.', 'Additionally, higher medical claims also contributed to the increase in SG&A, although to a lesser extent than last quarter. The SG&A deleverage was partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation and the benefits of the sale-leaseback program initiated last quarter. In Q4, we sold five Tractor Supply stores, which contributed a 40 basis point benefit to SG&A. Operating margin improved 16 basis points for the quarter to 9.1%. Excluding the cycling of the 53rd week, diluted EPS of $2.28 was essentially flat with the prior year. Our new store pipeline continues to be strong. Our new store sales and profitability numbers continue to outperform historical averages. Given the addition of the Orscheln stores to our non-comp sales numbers, the new store productivity metric for the organic new Tractor Supply stores is cloudy in our external reporting.', ""By our calculations, TSC new store productivity in 2023 was about 67% of our mature store average. Average sales in year one of a new store have increased more than 40% compared to 2019, in line with the performance of the chain. Our stores continue to be profitable in year one, cash flow positive at about the same point and have a payback in two to three years. Our new store economics unlock sustainable growth and solidify our lead in the channel. Strong new store economics are a hallmark of Tractor Supply. As I reflect back on 2023, I continue to be encouraged by the resiliency of our business and the structural nature of it. Now let's move to our outlook for 2024. Hal shared how we are thinking about the macro backdrop for the coming year."", 'We are anticipating a gradual slowdown with the lingering question of do we have a soft landing or if the risk of a harder recession remains. With this in mind, we have taken a cautious approach to our 2024 financial outlook and have forecasted our comparable sales performance below our long-term algorithm. Navigating economic cycles is in our DNA. We have successfully managed through diverse market conditions, including periods of inflation to disinflation and even deflation. Our deep understanding of these dynamics allows us to proactively adapt to the market conditions. We expect average unit retails to be neutral to a modest headwind for the near term, as we anticipate stickiness to input costs such as labor wage rates and other items to mitigate any further reversion in commodity pricing.', 'For fiscal 2024, we are forecasting net sales of $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion. Comparable store sales are anticipated to be in the range of down a modest 1% to an increase of 1.5%. We are cautiously optimistic that big ticket trends will revert to positive for the full year as we are cycling 18 months of declines. We expect gross margin expansion of about 40 to 60 basis points from continued supply chain efficiencies, benefits from effective cost management and a moderation of the mix impact of Q. We anticipate the gross margin expansion to be offset by SG&A deleverage due to a couple of primary factors. First, depreciation and amortization is anticipated to increase in the mid-teens. While this is an improvement from recent underlying growth as our investments in our strategic growth initiatives moderate, we will deleverage as D&A grows faster than sales.', 'Second, we plan to open our tenth distribution center in the second quarter. As a reminder, the operating cost for the new DC are reflected in SG&A, while the supply chain benefits are reflected in gross margin. Our DC network is expected to pressure SG&A by approximately 10 to 15 basis points. The benefit in gross margin will not completely offset this pressure since it takes time for the new facility to fully ramp to maturity and realize the supply chain benefits. As a result, we expect modest pressure on our operating margin from the opening of this new DC. These two primary factors are partially offset by the lapping of some higher-than-normal medical benefits in 2023. We do not expect those to reoccur due to our proactive changes to our benefit programs.', 'In 2024, we will continue our planned strategic sale-leaseback program to sell some of our existing owned stores. We anticipate these sales will occur in the second half of the year on a similar cadence to 2023 and with a similar EPS contribution. We continue to forecast these strategic sale leasebacks to be ongoing for the next 7 to 10 years. For the year, we forecast an operating margin of 9.7% to 10.1%. We are forecasting interest expense of approximately $50 million to $55 million. We plan to maintain a healthy leverage ratio of approximately two times, and we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.7% to 23.0%. Diluted EPS is forecast in a range of $9.85 to $10.50. Net capital expenditures are forecast to be $625 million to $700 million or about 4% to 4.5% of sales.', 'This net amount reflects the anticipated proceeds for the sale of existing and newly developed Tractor Supply stores. Gross capital expenditures are forecast to be in the range of $850 million to $925 million. Our capital plans reflect a ramp in our new store openings to approximately 80 Tractor Supply stores. We anticipate opening 10 to 15 Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in 2024. Our new store pipeline continues to be solid, and we expect store opening cadence B in line with 2024. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. For 2024, we anticipate share repurchases in a range of $575 million to $625 million which is estimated to have a benefit of a net reduction in weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 2%.', ""Now I'd like to walk through a few items to consider for the calendarization of our expectations. As always, we believe the best way to look at our business is in halves and not quarters due to the nature of our business. We expect comp sales for each of the quarters to be in a relatively tight range, consistent with our overall 2024 guidance. We are planning for positive comp transactions for the year. As to earnings, we expect our EPS growth to be slightly more favorable in the first half as opposed to the second half. There are a few factors that will impact operating margins in certain quarters. We anticipate the tailwinds of lower transportation costs to benefit our results through the second quarter and begin to flatten year-over-year starting in Q3."", 'As a result, gross margin expansion for the first half of the year is anticipated to be near the high end of our annual guidance range, while the second half may be near the low end of the range. In regards to SG&A, the second and third quarters will be pressured from the start-up costs for the new distribution center, while the supply chain benefits will not begin to be realized in gross margin until late in the third quarter. Please keep in mind, we will be lapping an $0.08 per share benefit from the depreciation change in the third quarter of last year. Considering each of these factors, the third quarter will be our toughest earnings comparison as we anticipate a decline in operating margin and EPS due to the combination of these factors.', 'As a reminder, the Orscheln stores will be added to the comp store calculation beginning in the second quarter with a tiered approach as we cycle the timing of moving these stores to our point-of-sale systems and rebranding of stores to Tractor Supply. Specific to the first quarter, we had a challenging first quarter last year as it was abnormally warm in January and February and relatively cold March. We were also benefiting from retail price inflation in the high single-digits. Given the recent Arctic cold temperatures across most of the regions, we are seeing good momentum as we start the first quarter. Overall, we are anticipating positive comp sales for the first quarter. To wrap up, we have clearly defined strategic priorities and are investing to capture the long-term opportunities in our market.', 'We are committed to driving productivity and making appropriate trade-offs to fuel our investments while we protect our operating profit margins and earnings. We intend to maintain this focused approach through 2024. We are committed to continuously striving for stronger results. With that, I will turn the call back over to Hal.', ""Hal Lawton: Thank you, Kurt. Now I'd like to update you on our progress on our Life Out Here strategy and share more about the exciting plans we have in place for the spring season. Tractor Supply continues to build on our competitive advantages. And arguably, the company is as strong as it's ever been. This is backed up by several proof points. We continue to gain market share across our major product categories and our customer metrics remain incredibly healthy with strong spending and retention with our best customers. Our strategic priorities are clearly resonating with our customers. We continue to see strength in our brand equity metrics, continue to grow our brand consideration and our unaided awareness. These strong customer trends are attributed to the team."", ""The team is executing at a high level and is extremely engaged. In 2023, our turnover improved at every level across the company as we're committed to being an employer of choice in rural America. With customer satisfaction scores at an all-time high, the team is passionate about their work, and we're energized to capitalize on our growth investments to provide our customers with legendary service. Our strong culture has always been a part of our secret sauce. The team has dialed in and determined to build on our long track record of success. Our Life Out Here strategy is on point. Our strategic initiatives in Project Fusion, Garden Centers, Neighbor's Club and Digital are working and they are driving results. In 2024, we anticipate that our Project Fusion layout will be in about 50% of our store base by year-end."", ""This layout is clearly driving improved comp sales force as we're leveraging category insights to determine space allocation and drive productivity. For instance, in the companion animal categories, we're seeing that the Fusion layouts are contributing to strong growth. We're able to have an expanded SKU offering and larger stack out. This layout is also seeing the highest quartile of customer satisfaction scores and attracting new customers at a faster rate. 2024 will be the year of the Garden Center for us. We will leverage the change of seasons across the storefront as the year shifts to spring. We will continue to build out about 150 garden centers across both new stores and sidelight transformations this year. As we look to leverage our learnings from our garden centers, we will implement a new live goods center prototype in many of these locations."", ""This new prototype requires about half of the capital investment of a traditional garden center that we've been building over the last few years and allows us to maximize the value creation of a sideline in lower volume stores and in markets where the season is less extensive and thus allowing us to achieve the ROIs that we target. Additionally, the new prototype in many ways, makes it easier for our stores to operate from a staffing standpoint and the maintenance costs are lower. With more broadly than ever and a grower network to support our garden centers, we're excited about the benefit of these initiatives in 2024 and the continued opportunity to serve our customers. Now turning to our Neighbor's Club. We have significant plans in place to capitalize on this strategic asset."", ""Our loyalty program has the scale and scope to continue to drive meaningful results. As we enter the third year since the move to a point-based rewards program, our members can expect more personalized offers, new tiers and more meaningful rewards. These compelling enhancements are designed to drive transactions and engagement, all while migrating customers upwards. Moving on to our digital business. We continue to capitalize on opportunities to accelerate our growth, between our website and our mobile app, we have more visitors online now than we do in our stores. These digital assets are essentially the front door to Tractor Supply. We'll be focused this year on improving our digital customer experience and capability as we look to accelerate conversion rate."", ""Just as the trip to a Tractor Supply store is highly differentiated, we'll be doubling down to ensure the shopping experience on our website and our mobile app has that same level of differentiation as we shop across our destination categories. We are looking to mirror our in-store legendary service and the digital experience through personalized and conversational commerce. We will leverage AI technologies to improve search, redesign our checkout, introduce a new refreshed homepage focusing on personalization that leverages our robust Neighbor's Club data. As our customer base continues to skew younger, these improvements will be key to unlocking future growth. Our strategic priorities are resonating with our customers and driving strong returns."", ""As the calendar shifts now and we start to turn to spring, it's an exciting time to be in our stores and online. In 2024, our merchant teams will be as diligent as ever to be our customers' purchasing agent with a sharp focus on value and innovation. We're committed to everyday low price, and we simply will not be beyond value. Our customers can trust Tractor Supply to be the dependable supplier for their lifestyle. Our merchandising strategies are focused to drive profitable sales and market share. Across product categories, we will have more innovation this year that I believe we will have seen collectively over the last three years. We have a number of new and exclusive product launches, including the introduction of the Toro HAVOC Zero-Turn Mower, the expansion of YETI and Solo Stove to more stores, and a test of Martha Stewart and Eddie Bauer, a limited rollout of Priefert cattle fencing, and a limited rollout of Weber Grill, a relaunch of MuttNation from Miranda Lambert, and the addition of Triumph Equine Feed, and that's just to name a few of the new innovations that we're bringing to our customers, and they'll be able to find in-store and online."", ""Let me share a few more highlights that you can see in our stores as you get out there. Tractor Supply has long been a destination for zero-turn mowers with a Cub Kid ad and Bad Boy brand. The Toro Havoc addition will continue to reinforce that positioning. Outside of Toro's dealer network Toro HAVOC is exclusive to Tractor Supply with a sharp price point. This is a unique and differentiated platform in just in time for the spring season. In big ticket, our entire trail assortment over the $1,000 price point is unique and exclusive to Tractor Supply. Across specifications and features, our trailer offerings are designed to support our customers' lifestyle.

Boston Scientific reported US$14b in revenue, roughly in line with analyst forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$1.07 beat expectations, being 2.6% higher than what the analysts expected. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year."", ' See our latest analysis for Boston Scientific ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Boston Scientific's 30 analysts is for revenues of US$15.5b in 2024. This reflects a decent 9.1% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to surge 23% to US$1.32. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$15.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$1.45 in 2024. The analysts seem to have become a little more negative on the business after the latest results, given the minor downgrade to their earnings per share numbers for next year."", ""Despite cutting their earnings forecasts,the analysts have lifted their price target 9.2% to US$70.14, suggesting that these impacts are not expected to weigh on the stock's value in the long term. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Boston Scientific, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$81.00 and the most bearish at US$55.00 per share. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Boston Scientific shareholders."", ""Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. It's clear from the latest estimates that Boston Scientific's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 9.1% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 7.4% p.a. over the past five years. Other similar companies in the industry (with analyst coverage) are also forecast to grow their revenue at 8.0% per year. Boston Scientific is expected to grow at about the same rate as its industry, so it's not clear that we can draw any conclusions from its growth relative to competitors."", 'The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Happily, there were no real changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow in line with the overall industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time.', 'Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

The company recently proved it could expand beyond the specialty area when it won approval with partner CRISPR Therapeutics for a gene editing therapy for blood disorders.', ""Next, Vertex is about to show that it can conquer one of the world's most common health problems: pain. The company recently reported positive phase 3 data for VX-548, its treatment candidate for moderate-to-severe acute pain, and aims to request regulatory approval by the middle of this year."", 'At this exciting time, is Vertex stock a buy?', ""First, let's talk a bit about the pain management opportunity. Today, at home or in a hospital setting, there are a limited number of options available. You can get over-the-counter drugs or prescription opioid painkillers. The former are often lacking in efficacy or associated with side effects like liver toxicity in the case of acetaminophen. And the latter have been linked to addiction, so doctors are more and more hesitant to prescribe them, and patients are more and more hesitant to take them."", 'Pain has consistently been the No. 1 reason for emergency department visits over the past six years, according to the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. And more than 20% of adults worldwide suffer from pain, estimates show. In the U.S., about 80 million people are prescribed a drug for moderate-to-severe acute pain every year, according to Vertex. So this clearly is an area of need.', ""Vertex's VX-548 is a non-opioid painkiller that blocks the activity of NaV1.8, a sodium channel that plays a key role in pain signaling. In the recent pivotal studies, VX-548 met its primary endpoint, or goal, of a statistically significant reduction in pain, compared to placebo, and a meaningful reduction in pain, compared to baseline levels. These studies involved patients who had abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) or bunion surgery."", ""Trials didn't meet the secondary endpoint of showing superiority to a combination of opioid hydrocodone bitartrate -- the most commonly used acute and chronic pain drug in the U.S. -- and acetaminophen. Still, this may not impact eventual sales prospects for VX-548 if it's approved."", 'As mentioned above, patients and physicians, understanding the risk of opioid addiction, may opt for a non-opioid if it works just as well. Second, recent legislation supports the idea of prescribing more non-opioids. The No Pain Act directs the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to offer healthcare facilities separate reimbursements for all non-opioids prescribed for pain. This would encourage hospitals and outpatient surgery centers to favor the prescription of non-opioids.', ""Analysts predict Vertex's eventual pain drug could bring in as much as $5 billion in annual sales, clearly making it a blockbuster. The company's regulatory request, based on the recent data, will seek a broad label in moderate-to-severe acute pain."", 'A current phase 2 study is building data for VX-548 in peripheral neuropathic pain, or nerve pain. And Vertex is also is working on other earlier-stage candidates with the same mechanism to address the problem of pain. So VX-548 represents a key growth area for the company.', ""Now let's get back to our question: Is Vertex a buy?"", ""The company's shares have climbed more than 30% over the past year as investors cheered Vertex's expansion into new areas. In spite of these gains and the fact that the stock is trading near a record high, Vertex still trades for only 25x forward earnings estimates. This looks incredibly reasonable for a company generating billions of dollars in earnings from its main business -- CF drugs -- and successfully expanding into new areas that could add billions of dollars to revenue."", 'As Vertex brings its candidate to solve a common health problem closer to the finish line, the stock makes a fantastic buy.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Vertex Pharmaceuticals right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Vertex Pharmaceuticals, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Vertex Pharmaceuticals wasn't one of them.

Here's why three Motley Fool contributors believe they are timely buys this month."", ""Jennifer Saibil (Coca-Cola): Resilience is an important feature in a company you want to invest in. When the going gets tough, you don't want to worry about how the company is going to survive. The current pressured economy has separated some of the great stocks from the rest, and investors should consider top, established stocks like Coca-Cola as anchors in their portfolios."", ""Coca-Cola emerged from early pandemic declines as a stronger, leaner, and more agile beverage giant. It's flexing its incredible pricing power, and its sales and profits are growing despite the pressure in the economy. In the 2023 third quarter, sales increased 8% year over year, and earnings per share (EPS) was up 9%. Comparable operating margin expanded a drop from 29.7% to 29.9%, illustrating the strength of its core brands."", ""Warren Buffett is a firm fan of this dividend king, and Coca-Cola stock makes up 6.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio. Coca-Cola is as reliable as you can get for a dividend stock, with a track record of 61 consecutive annual raises. At the current stock price, Coca-Cola's dividend yields 3.1%."", ""Buffett has said that he loves Coca-Cola because of its brand value and its potential to remain a part of the American growth story for many years. Buffett loves strong consumer brands because they have reliable, long-term growth drivers and can charge premium prices. This results in lots of cash, which sustains the company as it continues to operate, and its high dividend, which creates long-term shareholder value. Buffett noted in Berkshire Hathaway's most recent shareholder letter that the total cost of its position in Coca-Cola was $1.3 billion, and in 2022 alone, its total dividend was $704 million."", ""Coca-Cola releases fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 13, and if it keeps up its strong performance in the face of current challenges, expect its stock to jump. But don't buy it for short-term gain; buy it for its long-term value."", ""John Ballard (Kroger): Berkshire held a stake in Kroger of about $2.2 billion at the end of 2023's Q3. The relatively small position means it is likely the handiwork of one of Buffett's investing deputies, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, who manage about 10% of Berkshire's equity investments."", 'Still, leading grocery chains can be solid investments because of their loyal customer base that lives close to each store. No matter how the economy is performing, people have to eat. This translates to consistent annual sales.', 'Even with Kroger maintaining its strategy to deliver value to customers in a high-inflation environment, it expects to deliver adjusted free cash flow between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion for 2023, which is consistent with recent years.', 'If approved (the merger has been delayed pending additional FTC scrutiny and a lawsuit), the pending acquisition of Albertsons will expand its reach to more households and help the business achieve greater scale to deliver more savings to customers. Kroger has pledged to increase the availability of local products in stores by 10% following the merger, which could help grow average spending per customer and, therefore, more profitable sales.', ""Despite the stock's 35% return over the last three years, it remains cheap at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 10. It also pays an above-average dividend yield of 2.2%. The opportunities to grow more profitable by merging with Albertsons may be significantly undervalued."", ""Jeremy Bowman (Amazon): Berkshire Hathaway chief Warren Buffett has long expressed his admiration for Amazon and former CEO Jeff Bezos, so it's not surprising to find the stock in Berkshire's current portfolio."", 'Like other ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, Amazon was a big winner last year, with share prices jumping 81%. However, the company seems poised for more gains this year as it continues to make moves to expand profit margins. For example, the company just made ad-supported media streaming the default on Amazon Prime Video, creating a new revenue stream from ads on the service or charging Prime subscribers $3/month for ad-free streaming.', ""CEO Andy Jassy is committed to growing the business efficiently, and investors should expect more cost-cutting this year following substantial layoffs last year. Meanwhile, Amazon's revenue base continues to shift to high-margin businesses like its third-party marketplace, Amazon Web Services cloud infrastructure business, and advertising, which has reached a $40 billion run rate."", 'AWS struggled last year in line with cautious business spending, but business confidence seems to be rebounding as the economy seems unlikely to sink into a recession. Additionally, the AI boom should also support demand for AWS and its Bedrock AI managed service as more companies look to run the kind of models that make applications like ChatGPT work.', 'Finally, consumer discretionary spending is likely to rebound as the economy moves toward a recovery and interest rates come down later in the year, which should support growth in its e-commerce business.', 'Amazon still has tremendous competitive advantages, and with its renewed focus on profits, the stock should continue to reward investors this year.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them.

Investors love the fact that they don't need to worry about economic downturns or temporary earnings shortfalls interrupting these regular increases. The companies have ample cash holdings, after all, and long track records for generating profits through every phase of the economic cycle."", ""Shareholders can't know ahead of time just how big any particular raise will be, as it depends on management's reading of the market conditions heading into the new fiscal year. But it's still likely to be a positive piece of news for the business and for investors."", ""With that in mind, let's look at two attractive dividend stocks set to announce their 2024 payout hikes in the coming weeks."", ""Home Depot (NYSE: HD) will reveal its 2024 dividend hike as part of its fiscal fourth-quarter results in mid-February, but investors don't have to wait until then to consider buying this high-performing stock. The home improvement retailer's last boost was a hefty 10%, and it followed a decent year in 2022, in which comparable-store sales (comps) rose 3% and earnings expanded at an 8% rate."", ""Expectations aren't as high for the fiscal 2023 year that just ended. Management is forecasting that comps will decline by between 3% and 4%, in fact, as earnings fall by about 10%. Yet the chain is outperforming peers like Lowe's Companies in both areas, partly thanks to Home Depot's bigger market share among professional contractors."", 'Short-term prospects for the housing market are brightening thanks to good economic growth trends. Investors should be even more excited about the long term, though.', 'Factors like favorable demographic shifts, an aging stock of housing, and continued rising prices all point to many more years of growth ahead. ""We remain very positive on the medium to long-term outlook for home improvement,"" CEO Ted Decker told investors in August. Look for executives to echo those bullish comments when they describe their 2024 capital return plans in a few weeks.', ""Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) was among the worst-performing stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year. That's a good reason to consider buying this Dividend King, though, as its yield has been lifted by that weak stock price trend."", ""You can get an immediate yield of over 3% by owning Coke today, with many years of dividend gains likely on the way. Consider its strong 2023 operating performance, for example. Despite slowing consumer spending and consumers' price sensitivity last year, Coke is beating its original sales and earnings targets. Organic sales were up 11% in the most recent quarter as profit margin expanded, and management lifted its 2023 forecast in response."", ""Coke is getting contributions from both rising sales volumes and increased prices, suggesting healthy global demand for its biggest franchises like Coke, Coke Zero, and Fanta. The beverage giant has good exposure to faster-growing niches like energy drinks, teas, and sparkling waters, too. And its profit margin is roughly double PepsiCo's level."", ""The 2023 dividend hike, expected in mid-February, will follow last year's 5% increase. There's a good chance that investors will see a bigger increase in 2024 since Coke is expecting earnings to rise by about 13% after adjusting for currency exchange rate swings. In any case, this dominant consumer staples giant is on track for its 62nd consecutive annual increase, giving it one of the longest unbroken streaks on the market."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them.

I will now turn the call over to Zac Nagle, Vice President, Investor Relations.', ""Zac Nagle: Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechnologies.com where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We're also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Dave Regnery, Chair and CEO; and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?"", ""Dave Regnery: Thanks, Zach and everyone, for joining today's call. As we begin, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our purpose-driven strategy, which drives our differentiated financial results over time. Our strategy is aligned to powerful mega trends like energy efficiency, decarbonization, and digital transformation. These trends continue to intensify and increase the demand for our sustainable solutions. The year 2023 was recently confirmed as the warmest on record and caused many extreme weather events around the world. Urgent action is needed to reduce emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change on people's lives. That's where Trane Technologies is uniquely positioned to lead. We are the partner of choice to help our customers advance their own sustainability goals while driving broad impact through our Gigaton Challenge, a pledge to reduce customers' emissions by 1 billion metric tons by 2030."", ""Our purpose-driven strategy, relentless innovation and proven business operating system, enable us to consistently deliver a superior growth profile, strong margins and powerful free cash flow. The end result is strong value creation across the board for our customers, our shareholders, our employees, and for the planet. Please turn to Slide number 4. We expect to deliver top quartile financial performance over the long-term, consistently and reliably on behalf of our shareholders. This is core to our culture and central to how we set our targets and execute our strategy across our global portfolio. I'm proud of how our global teams rose to the challenge in 2023 and met or exceeded our targets top to bottom. We track top quartile performance against our core peer group closely."", ""And while the results are not yet in, we believe we'll hit top quartile on organic revenue growth up 9%, and adjusted EPS growth up 23%. We also delivered free cash flow of $2.2 billion or 103% free cash flow conversion, enabling us to make key strategic M&A investments while raising our dividend and returning significant cash to shareholders through share repurchases. Please turn to Slide number 5. Relentless investment in innovation and growth, people and culture and our business operating system are hallmarks of Trane Technologies. And over time, we see clear benefits accruing as evidenced by our strong track record. Since 2020, we have delivered a revenue compound annual growth rate of 12%, 260 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion and free cash flow conversion of approximately 100%, enabling us to execute a balanced capital deployment strategy."", ""We believe we're well positioned to continue to drive strong performance for shareholders over the long-term. Please turn to Slide number 6. Q4 was another strong quarter. Despite challenges in our transport and residential businesses, we leveraged the strength of our diversified and resilient global portfolio in our best-in-class business operating system to deliver strong financial performance as an enterprise. In the Americas, we expected the residential markets to continue to normalize and for the transport refrigeration markets to move into a moderate down cycle in Q4. While the markets were down more than anticipated, each business delivered strong bookings growth in the quarter, strengthening our position entering 2024. Global commercial HVAC markets continue to be robust, and we're leveraging the power of our direct sales force to identify and pivot to the highest growth opportunities."", ""We're thriving in key verticals such as data centers and high-tech industrial, working alongside these highly sophisticated customers to solve their most pressing challenges with ultra-efficient bespoke solutions. This is one of the things that Trane Technologies does best, and our commercial HVAC bookings, backlog and revenue reflect our success. To put this into context, our Americas commercial HVAC bookings are up more than 50% on a three-year stack. Our applied bookings, where we estimate an 8 to 10x multiplier of higher-margin services for every dollar of equipment sold, are up over 100% on a three-year stack. As we look at our commercial HVAC end markets over the next several years, we see a strong pipeline of projects increasingly playing to our unique strengths."", 'We entered 2024 with a backlog of $6.9 billion, with the composition shifting increasingly towards commercial HVAC, including a large percentage of long-cycle applied systems. For 2023, backlog in commercial HVAC is up approximately $700 million. Over the past three years, our commercial HVAC backlog has nearly tripled. Turning to guidance. We expect another year of strong financial performance, with organic revenue growth of 6% to 7%, and adjusted EPS of $10 to $10.30. Chris will discuss some of the key dynamics later in the presentation. Please go to Slide number 7. Demand for our innovative products and services continues to be broad-based across our segments. During the fourth quarter, organic bookings were up 12%, led by our commercial HVAC businesses.', 'In the Americas segment, commercial HVAC bookings were up mid-teens and revenues were even stronger, up mid-20s. Revenues were up more than 30% in equipment, with particular strength in applied. Services growth was also outstanding, up mid-teens as our service business continues to compound at a rapid rate. Our residential business continues to normalize, as expected, but the market declined at a faster rate than anticipated entering the quarter. We expect the normalization process to continue in the near term but to return to a GDP plus growth over the medium to long-term. Bookings were healthy, up 8%. Our transport businesses was the tale of two halves. The first half of the year, revenues were up about 20% and the back half of the year down 20%.', 'Q4 marked the beginning of a modest market down cycle, which is expected to snap back in 2025. Our fourth quarter was down approximately 20% against a tough prior year growth comp of up 30%. For full year 2023, we modestly outperformed end markets, which were down 5%. Our EMEA segment delivered strong performance in the quarter. Commercial HVAC bookings were robust, up mid-teens. Revenues were up high single digits in Q4 and up more than 50% on a two-year stack. Transport bookings were flat as expected, and revenues were up mid-single digits for Q4. In 2023, revenues were up low single-digits, outperforming end markets, which were down mid-single digits. Our Asia-Pacific segment performed in line with our expectations. Revenues were flat in commercial HVAC due to a tough prior year comp, which was up low 20s.', ""China bookings were down low single digits but up high single-digits on a two-year stack. Revenues were down mid-single digits against and up low teens prior year comp. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris?"", 'Chris Kuehn: Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide number 8. The scoreboard for the quarter highlights strong execution top to bottom. Organic revenues were up 6%, adjusted EBITDA and operating margins were up 150 basis points and 190 basis points, respectively, and adjusted EPS was up 19%. Q4 adjusted EPS includes a $0.03 headwind related to foreign exchange losses from the devaluation of the Argentine peso. At an enterprise level, we delivered strong organic revenue growth in both equipment and services, up low single-digits and low teens, respectively. Services growth continues to be a standout, representing about one-third of our enterprise revenues and making Trane Technologies more resilient, with higher recurring revenues and higher margins over time.', ""Over the past six years, our services business delivered a compound annual growth rate of high single-digits. 2023 services growth was even higher, up double digits. Last but not least, I want to thank our global teams for once again delivering strong free cash flow throughout the year, resulting in a 103% free cash flow conversion. Please turn to Slide number 9. At the enterprise level, we delivered robust volume growth with strong incrementals, positive price realization and productivity that more than offset inflation. In the Americas segment, we delivered about 4 points of volume and 3 points of price and 200 basis points of margin expansion. While volume growth was modestly higher than price growth at the segment level, it's important to understand the dynamics below the segment level."", ""Robust volume growth of approximately 20 points in commercial HVAC accompanied by strong leverage more than offset volume declines in residential and transport. EMEA segment delivered strong incrementals and margin expansion, with organic revenues up high single-digits in the quarter made up of approximately 5 points of volume and 3 points of price. The segment also delivered approximately 6 points of M&A growth in the quarter. Organic incrementals were greater than 30%. The Asia segment delivered strong margin expansion and organic leverage on flattish revenues, with positive price and productivity in the quarter adding to margin expansion. As we've highlighted throughout the year, we reinvested heavily in our business and accelerated the timing of key projects across the enterprise in 2023."", ""We see a tight linkage between investments in innovation and market outgrowth, and we will continue to leverage opportunities to go further and faster. A few high-priority areas in 2023 and 2024 are sales and services excellence, digital, and factory automation. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?"", ""Dave Regnery: Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide number 10. Looking at our segments and markets, we're excited about excited the year ahead. We expect continued strength in our commercial HVAC businesses globally, which comprise about 65% of our revenues, supported by robust end markets, unprecedented backlog, our innovative portfolio and our world-class sales and services teams. We expect the strength of this business to more than offset softness we may see in other parts of the portfolio. We expect the residential markets, which comprise about 20% of our revenues to continue to normalize in the near term but to show significant improvement in 2024 versus 2023. We expect modest declines in our transport markets globally in 2024, which comprise about 15% of our revenues, with a snapback to growth in 2025."", 'Further, we see opportunities to outperform and further mitigate the market impact and to deleverage within gross margin rates. Now I’d like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris?', 'Chris Kuehn: Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide number 11. Our guidance for 2024 reflects our optimism in key end markets and our ability to outperform. Embedded in our guidance is our philosophy around our value creation flywheel, which builds in continued investment in innovation, outgrowth across our end markets, healthy leverage and strong free cash flow. We’re guiding 2024 to 6% to 7% organic revenue growth and $10 to $10.30 in adjusted earnings per share or approximately 11% to 14% EPS growth. We’ve included approximately 1 point of growth from M&A in 2024, reflecting the carryover impact from bolt-on acquisitions completed in 2023. We’re targeting organic leverage of 25% plus for the year, which is consistent with our stated long-term target.', 'While we expect our recent M&A transactions to have a strong payout over the next several years, we’re expecting a modest headwind to operating income and to leverage in 2024 from M&A. Overall, we expect a negative impact of $30 million to operating income for the full year, primarily related to our technology acquisition Nuvolo, which carries non-cash accelerated intangibles amortization of approximately $25 million plus year one acquisition and integration related costs. We expect this acquisition to be EPS accretive by year three, consistent with our M&A. Turning to cash. We expect 2024 to be another year of free cash flow conversion of 100% or greater. We also wanted to provide some color on how we see the first quarter. We expect organic revenue growth of approximately 7%, led by continued strong commercial HVAC growth partially offset by softer residential and transport markets.', 'We expect adjusted EPS between $1.60 and $1.65, reflecting high levels of incremental business reinvestment we’ve discussed for 2024 and consistent with our historical Q1 adjusted earnings as a percentage of our full year earnings between 15% and 16%. Please go to Slide number 12. During 2023, we delivered an incremental $60 million of transformation savings. Over the last four years, we have successfully delivered $300 million of run rate savings from our business transformation program. The additional savings have allowed us to reinvest in our high performance flywheel, which ultimately drives consistent top quartile EPS growth. While this discrete program is complete as a lean based company with a world class business operating system, self-help, cost reduction programs, through productivity are part of our DNA.', 'This has been a strong lever for incremental margins historically and will continue to be in the future. Please go to Slide number 13. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we’re committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our balanced approach includes strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value.', 'Please turn to Slide number 14 and I’ll provide an update on our capital deployment for 2023 and our outlook for 2024. During 2023 and including activity in January 2024, we deployed $2.4 billion in cash, including approximately $750 million to share repurchases, $684 million to dividends, and approximately $900 million on strategic M&A. We’re targeting $2.5 billion in capital deployment in 2024 and expect to deploy 100% of excess cash over time. We have significant dry powder with approximately $2.5 billion remaining under the current share repurchase authorization, and our shares remain attractive, trading below our calculated intrinsic value. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity and balance sheet continue to give us excellent capital allocation optionality.', 'Our M&A pipeline remains active, and in 2023 we made key strategic investments to accelerate our progress across energy services and digital solutions, industrial process cooling and precision temperature control technology. Now I’d like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?', 'Dave Regnery: Thanks, Chris. Please go to Slide number 16. In 2023, we delivered solid execution across our transport businesses globally and outperformed our end markets. Over the past three years, we’ve outgrown our end markets by roughly 30 percentage points. Globally in 2024, we’re expecting a relatively shallow down cycle and an Americas transport weighted average forecast of down 10% and an EMEA forecast of down low single digits. In the table on the page we’ve also included forecasts for the big three trailer, truck and APU for your reference. We expect to outperform the markets in both segments in 2024 and to delever within gross margin rates. This slide also includes some additional data points related to our transport businesses that you may find helpful.', 'Please turn to Slide number 17. We operate our transport businesses for the long-term and while we’re moving through a modest downturn in 2024, this is a great business with a bright future. ACT projects a strong trailer market rebound from 2024 to 2025, up 19% and projects continued growth through their forecast horizon in 2028. We have a diversified transport business globally with opportunities to grow across the portfolio. With leading innovation, strong execution through our business operating system and a world class dealer network, we’re well positioned to outperform in any market environment. Please go to Slide number 18. In summary, we are well positioned to drive significant value over time. We are proud to have been recently named to Corporate Knights 2024 Global 100 list.', 'Our uplifting culture and our talented team around the world help us fulfill our purpose every day. This focus on purpose, along with the strength of our business operating system and continued high levels of customer demand, enable us to consistently deliver strong financial performance while continuing to reinvest in our business. We believe we have the strategy, the innovation and the team to deliver strong performance in 2024 and differentiated shareholder returns over the long-term.

At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.', 'David Kinney', ""Thank you, operator. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures.

We will also discuss current market dynamics and our near-term outlook. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter."", 'Peter Z. E. Vanacker', ""Thank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Let's begin, as we always do, with our safety results on Slide 3. During 2023, our employees and contractors demonstrated their commitment to outstanding safety performance. LYB's total recordable injury rate was 0.14, which is approximately 20% lower than the average of the prior 3 years. I want to congratulate our APS segment where injuries were 38% lower than 2022, a significant improvement from historical levels. We always view safety performance as a leading indicator of operational excellence and business performance. But there is no greater value than seeing every member of our team, return home to their families every day in the same health has -- when they begin to work their working day.Let's now turn to Slide 4 to discuss our financial results. 2023 was another challenging year for petrochemicals. While energy prices moderated in an environment of geopolitical unrest, markets were extremely cautious due to uncertainty about inflation, and the potential for a more pronounced downturn in economic activity.Reported GDP growth in the U.S. and China improved relative to 2022, but growth in petrochemicals was far below norms for our industry. Against that backdrop, LYB delivered earnings of $8.65 per share with an EBITDA of $5.2 billion. Cash generation was exceptional and resulted in $4.9 billion of cash from operations. We have a highly efficient cash conversion ratio of 98%. We ended the year with $7.6 billion of liquidity, supported by a strong investment-grade balance sheet, and we exceeded our cost of capital with an 11% return on invested capital.In March of last year, we successfully launched our new strategy at our Capital Markets Day in New York. Now let's turn to Slide 5 and briefly review the strategy. Our goal was to create focus, clarity and alignment about their direction LyondellBasell would be moving over the next 5 years and provides a clear vision of what the company would look like in 2027. Our strategy is built around 3 pillars: growing and upgrading the core, building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business and stepping up performance and culture.In growing and upgrading the core, we are investing in businesses that fit with our competitive advantages and long-term strategy. Our circular and low-carbon solutions business is driving leadership in circularity and addressing the massive demand for these products from our customers and society. In the third pillar, we are transforming the culture of LYB to embed a more comprehensive view of value creation while continuing to recognize that stringent cost management is vital in our industry.On Slide 6, we highlight our progress on our strategy in 2023 and the work underway over the next few years towards our 2027 goals. In just 10 months, since launching our strategy last March, LyondellBasell has unlocked nearly 1/3 of the $3 billion of incremental normalized EBITDA that we are targeting for 2027. The successful start-up of the PO/TBA plant this year is a major step forward in growing and upgrading our core by adding approximately $450 million to our normalized EBITDA.And I am very pleased to report that our value enhancement program is far exceeding our initial expectations. In 2023, the VEP achieved a year-end run rate of more than $400 million of mid-cycle recurring annual EBITDA improvements. And Michael will share more details on the progress of the VEP in a few moments. As shown on the slide, we have numerous work streams underway to build toward our strategic goals of $2 billion of incremental normalized EBITDA by 2025 and a total of $3 billion by 2027. With the announced sale of the ethylene oxide and derivatives business to INEOS for $700 million, we are redirecting resources away from non core businesses. The deal we announced in January to acquire 35% of net debt in Saudi Arabia for approximately $500 million is just one example of how we are growing our core cost advantaged olefins and polyolefins businesses. We're making great strides in building strong foundations for our circular and low-carbon solutions business. In 2023, we took a final investment decision for our first tranche of advanced recycling capacity in Germany using our proprietary catalytic MoReTec technology. And we are building partnerships to source waste plastic to supply our app in Germany, while also securing waste plastic in Houston to supply our next investment in advanced recycling capacity.And the VEP program is not a onetime initiative. Michael will describe our increased targets for 2024 and beyond. While we have a lot of work ahead of us, I want to congratulate our team on the substantial progress we achieved on our strategic journey in 2023, ensuring a robust platform for longer-term value creation and positive leverage to any market turnarounds. On Slide 7, let's take a look at the steps ahead to deliver on our goals. We will continue to grow and upgrade our core businesses by focusing on advantaged feedstocks in growing markets where LYB can build or extend our leading market position. Our new joint venture in Saudi Arabia is one example of how we will do this. As we add new positions, we will continue to review our portfolio for businesses and assets that are not aligned with our long-term strategy. The divestiture of [EEO] and Derivatives business, the sale of our Australian polypropylene business, the shutdown of a polypropylene line in Italy and the exit of the refining business are all examples of how we are sharpening the focus of our business portfolio.The rapid progress of the LYB value enhancement program also contributes to our growth through low-cost capacity debottlenecks and productivity improvements. We are making good progress on building the foundations for our circular and low-carbon solutions business as we work towards our goal of $500 million of incremental EBITDA by 2027 and $1 billion by 2030. And our VEP is not only delivering growth and productivity. The VEP also supports the third pillar of our strategy to step up performance and culture by instilling a value-based mindset across the company. We have numerous initiatives to improve margins through customer and commercial excellence embedded in the VEP. And our work is to transform our Advanced Polymer Solutions business is also an important part of our work to step up performance and culture.All of our progress is supported by our foundations of efficient cash generation, disciplined capital allocation and our investment-grade balance sheet. We're leveraging partnerships where it fits to achieve growth with capital efficiency, and we're pursuing a very value-focused investment program and we remain steadfast in our support for a secure, competitive and growing dividend as part of our commitment to competitive shareholder returns. And now, I will turn the call over to Michael to discuss the details of our financial progress."", 'Michael C. McMurray', ""Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, and let's take a look at the progress of our value enhancement program. As Peter mentioned, LYB's value enhancement program far exceeded our initial expectations in 2023. When we launched the program, we thought we could achieve a 2023 year-end run rate of $150 million of mid-cycle recurring annual EBITDA improvement with high engagement and rapid execution, our team achieved a run rate of more than $400 million by year-end 2023.We have a strong management system in place for our VEP program. Our team has screened more than 13,000 ideas and more than 1,900 of these ideas have advanced to the execution ready stage of our process. By the end of 2023, we executed on approximately 450 of these initiatives. Our system is robust and disciplined and our internal and external auditors have validated our processes. We currently believe this effort will add a total of $600 million of recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2024 and up to $1 billion by the end of 2025.This is a significant increase from our initial target of $750 million that we announced last March driven by the enthusiastic buying of our colleagues and the tangible results that we have delivered so far. The LYB value enhancement program is providing meaningful contributions to our strategic financial goals and will continue to do so as we move forward.On Slide 9, let me share more details about the progress on our VEP program during 2023. Our targets for the program are described as year-end run rates relative to 2021 volumes and using average margins from 2017 to 2019, a time period that provides a good approximation of mid-cycle margins. Through more than 450 initiatives, we generated over $300 million of VEP EBITDA from the program based on 2023 margins. This reflects the net recurring improvements throughout the year relative to 2021 volume, product mix and cost. Now let me highlight a few of the initiatives from last year.At our Lake Charles integrated polyethylene joint venture, we automated controls for a water treatment unit that reduced manual operations and water consumption. With a small investment, we were able to reduce LYB share of cost by $800,000 annually. In our oxyfuels business, our cost advantaged U.S. production is exported in vessels to markets around the world. We worked with one of our terminal providers to encourage their investment in a vapor recovery system that allowed LYB to double vessel loading rates to reduce demerge costs and vapor emissions for a net recurring benefit of $1 million per year. By investing resources to learn more about the needs of our customers, our polymer product development team allocated resources for new products to serve demanding applications and wire and cable seating for subsea infrastructure markets. This initiative improved recording profitability by at least $300,000 per year. We hope these examples provide you with some insight into the hundreds of small initiatives that we have -- that we expect to add up to $1 billion of mid-cycle recurring annual EBITDA to LYB's run rate by the end of 2025. Please turn to Slide 10 and let me begin by highlighting the outstanding cash generation from our business portfolio during 2023. LYB generated a total of $4.9 billion of cash from operating activities over the past year. Cash on hand increased to $3.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. During 2023, we achieved cash conversion of 98%, well above our long-term target of 80%. Our cash conversion was bolstered by a working capital reduction of approximately $700 million during the fourth quarter. The majority of the working capital benefit was from lower receivables and inventories. We expect our working capital needs will increase during the first quarter.Our efficient cash generation allowed the company to return more than $1.8 billion to LyondellBasell shareholders in 2023. This represents 53% of our $3.4 billion of free cash flow for the year. Let's continue with Slide 11 and review the details of our capital allocation over the past year. As Peter mentioned, we are committed to disciplined capital allocation as we execute our strategy and maintain our robust investment-grade balance sheet. During 2023, cash from operating activities fully funded $1.6 billion in dividends, $210 million in share repurchases and our capital investment program. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, marking the 13th consecutive year of annual dividend growth. This year, we invested $1.5 billion in capital expenditures. We reached an important milestone with the successful start-up of our new PO/TBA asset in 2023.With the completion of this world-scale project our future capital expenditures will be increasingly focused on a portfolio of smaller projects to advance our strategy. This includes investments in small profit-generating projects integrated hubs for circular solutions and hundreds of initiatives within the value enhancement program. We ended the year with $3.4 billion of cash and short-term investments and $7.6 million of cash and available liquidity.In line with our strategic focus on leadership and sustainability, we issued our inaugural green bond for $500 million. LYB's robust balance sheet positions us well to move forward on our long-term strategy during the year ahead. One last comment. We added over $1 billion of cash to our balance sheet in 2023 as a result of strong execution amid challenging market conditions.As a result, we are carrying about 2x our stated minimum of $1.5 billion. We have built a bit more cash because of the challenging market conditions and uncertain economic outlook that we have been navigating. That said, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, and we remain committed to returning 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders over the long term.Now I would like to provide an overview of the quarterly results for each of our segments on Page 12. LYB's business portfolio delivered $910 million of EBITDA during the fourth quarter. Our lower results reflect a significant decline in gasoline crack spreads and seasonally lower demand during the fourth quarter. Lower gasoline crack spreads negatively impacted our refining results. Oxyfuels and the Intermediates and Derivatives segment and the value of co-product fuels in olefins and polyolefins, Americas. During the quarter, lower ethane and energy cost and increased polyethylene exports benefited our O&P Americas business. Overall, olefins and polyolefins demand remains soft, particularly in Europe, where utilization rates remained low. Lower demand and higher raw material costs negatively impacted our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment.Across the portfolio, a noncash LIFO inventory valuation charge decreased pretax fourth quarter results by approximately $55 million. As a reminder, the LIFO impact reflects changes in inventory valuation over the full year and is not necessarily limited to fourth quarter valuations.Before we discuss our segment results in detail, let me discuss our capital expenditure plans for 2024. We expect that our CapEx will be approximately $2.1 billion this year, a $600 million increase compared to 2023, our capital plan includes approximately $800 million for profit-generating growth projects and $1.3 billion of sustaining investment to keep our assets running safely and reliably.The increased profit-generating capital includes investments to grow our circular and low-carbon solutions business as well as investments to lower the carbon footprint of our existing asset base, particularly in Europe. Funding required to drive our value enhancement program is included in our CapEx plan.We expect our 2024 effective tax rate will be approximately 20% and our cash tax rate will be a few percentage points higher. In the appendix of this slide deck, we have provided additional 2024 modeling information, including impacts from major plant maintenance costs associated with the exit from our refining business than other useful financial metrics. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken?"", 'Kenneth Todd Lane', ""Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 13 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $604 million. During the quarter, a significant decrease in co-product values negatively impacted olefins margins. Polyolefin prices were stable domestically, while a very strong export volume led to some lower pricing in our overall portfolio.Strong demand from export markets continues to drive increased polyethylene volumes, and we didn't see the typical seasonal slowdown. We operated our assets at approximately 85% of nameplate capacity to match market demand and continued to actively manage working capital. Fourth quarter EBITDA included a LIFO inventory valuation benefit of approximately $75 million. During the first quarter, we expect polyethylene prices to remain firm with modest improvements in domestic demand and ongoing strength in export markets.We anticipate ethane and energy costs will remain favorable for our assets in the region, providing some margin tailwinds. Overall, we expect to operate our O&P-Americas assets at an average of approximately 80% during the first quarter, slightly lower than fourth quarter 2023 due to planned maintenance. In December, we signed 2 new renewable power purchase agreements. With these agreements, we've achieved almost 90% of our goal to procure at least 50% of our global power from renewable sources by 2030.In total, we have 12 agreements in place, representing more than 1.3 gigawatts of renewable power capacity. As we mentioned last quarter, we announced our investment in Cyclyx, a joint venture with Agilyx and ExxonMobil. This partnership is focused on increasing plastic waste, recycling infrastructure to improve circularity. In December, Cyclyx announced the final investment decision to build the first Cyclyx Circularity Center in Houston. The Circularity Center will focus on increasing plastic waste recycling options through better sourcing and sorting of plastic waste.The facility will have the capacity to produce more than 130,000 tons of plastic feedstock per year for advanced and mechanical recycling and is expected to start up in 2025. Now please turn to Slide 14 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the quarter, European markets remained weak with softer seasonal demand and lower consumer confidence. Polymer prices were modestly higher with an improved sales mix and stable naphtha feedstock costs.Due to the low demand, we operated our assets at rates of approximately 65% during the quarter. The combined impact of the weak demand and low rates led to a fourth quarter EBITDA loss of $87 million. As we move into 2024, we expect weak European demand will persist with ongoing consumer uncertainty. Nonetheless, we are seeing modest improvements in orders as some customers begin to restock and seek local supply as imports moving through the red sea are disrupted. We expect to operate our European assets at a rate of 75% during the first quarter.Demand in China remains muted as customers manage inventories with the approach of the Lunar New Year amid a slow economic environment. As Peter mentioned earlier, we are making great progress on our strategy to grow and upgrade our core businesses. Our recent announcement to acquire a 35% share of NATPET reflects our focus on assets that have long-term advantage. But we're also moving away from the assets that can't deliver long-term competitiveness as demonstrated by last year's decision to close 1 of our 2 polypropylene assets in Brindisi, Italy. We are also making good progress with building our circular and low-carbon business.During the fourth quarter, we made the final investment decision to build our first commercial catalytic advanced recycling plant at our Wesseling Germany site. With an estimated capacity of 50,000 tons per year, this plant will utilize our differential MoReTec advanced recycling technology. And just like in Houston, we are collaborating with partners to secure plastic waste feedstock in Germany. In December, we acquired a minority share of Source One Plastics, a plastic waste sourcing company in Germany. Source One will provide the majority of the process plastic waste feedstock to our new MoReTec asset. Through our integrated hub model, we are establishing an integrated circular value chain at scale. Now please turn to Slide 15, and let's take a closer look at our new NATPET joint venture. A few weeks ago, we announced our agreement to acquire a 35% share of national petrochemical industrial company or NATPET from Alujain Corporation in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia. The joint venture is a great example of how we are growing our core businesses with advantaged assets by leveraging LYB's leading technology and global market reach. Today, NATPET consists of 400,000 tons of propane dehydrogenation or PDH capacity that converts cost-advantaged Saudi propane into propylene monomer to feed a 400,000-ton polypropylene unit utilizing LYB's proprietary SparePal technology. The assets have been operational since 2009 and have generated an annual average of USD 155 million in EBITDA over the 5 years from 2018 to 2022. NATPET's PP products serve a diverse range of customers across global markets. As part of the transaction, LYB will leverage our global marketing network to sell a majority of the product on behalf of NATPET creating a new revenue stream for LYB. NATPET's assets are first quartile, that have the advantage of sourcing local Saudi propane feedstock at a discount to global prices. Also, our investment in NATPET provides a platform for continued growth. In 2022, NATPET was awarded a new feedstock allocation that could support additional capacity. The partners are evaluating a second PDH and PP asset on the site that would benefit from meaningful synergies. Previously, Alujain selected LYB Spherizone polypropylene technology for the potential expansion. The high-performance polypropylene solutions enabled by our proprietary Spherizone technology provides the potential to expand NATPET's production into new applications and markets. We expect our investment in NATPET will exceed our 12% target for unlevered internal rates of return. Additional capacity could provide even higher returns.We expect the transaction will close in the first half of 2024, following regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. With that, I will turn the call over to Kim."", 'Kimberly A. Foley', ""Thank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 16 as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $265 million. Oxyfuel margins declined due to a significant decrease in gasoline tax spreads as well as an increased supply of oxyfuels after industry downtime during the third quarter. Styrene margins were pressured due to higher benzene feedstock costs. LIFO inventory charges were approximately $95 million. In the fourth quarter, we recognized an impairment of $192 million related to our PO/SM joint venture in the Netherlands.We operated our assets at a rate of approximately 70% during the fourth quarter due to low demand as well as planned and unplanned downtime across most businesses. As we begin the first quarter, Oxyfuel margins remained similar to fourth quarter levels. We anticipate higher volumes across the segment after downtime in the fourth quarter and plan to operate across the I&D segment at approximately 75% in the first quarter. These operating rates reflect the impact of the recent winter freeze event resulting in unplanned downtime at our U.S. Off Coast assets. In December, we announced an agreement to divest our ethylene oxide and Derivative business to INEOS for $700 million. As Peter mentioned earlier, we are taking decisive actions to grow and upgrade the businesses and assets that align with our long-term strategy, while exiting businesses where LYB does not have a path to a leading position. We expect the transaction will close in the second quarter following regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.Please note that the agreed transaction price is pretax and that these assets are heavily depreciated. Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of the Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $51 million, including charges of $40 million of LIFO inventory valuation. Refining margins compressed due to lower gasoline crack spreads. During the quarter, we operated the refinery at 85% of capacity due to planned and unplanned downtime with an average crude rate of 230,000 barrels per day. In the near term, we expect gasoline crack spreads will improve, offset by lower distillate cracks.We plan to operate the Refinery at approximately 80% of capacity in the first quarter, including a planned coker outage with an estimated EBITDA impact of $50 million. Our team remains highly focused on safe and reliable operations as we continue to run our refining assets through no later than the end of the first quarter of 2025. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel."", 'Torkel Rhenman', ""Thank you, Kim. Now let's review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 18. Fourth quarter EBITDA declined to $12 million. Margins were pressured by higher raw material costs and volumes decreased due to seasonally lower fourth quarter demand with a slowdown in December due to customer outages. LIFO inventory valuations benefits were $10 million. Looking ahead, we see signs of market recovery and expect modest demand improvement in the first quarter. This year, we continued our transformation journey with Advanced Polymer Solutions. APS results in 2023 were lower than 2022 and not reflected of our financial expectations for this business. Success with APS customers is largely based on project by project qualification. Today's underperformance is indicative of our low success rate in gaining new qualifications during prior quarters. However, our laser focus on our customers is gaining momentum.We have seen a step-up in our recent surveys of customer satisfaction with an organization that is focused and accountable we're making steady progress as we rebuild our project growth funnel. Our growth pipeline is already delivering. During the fourth quarter of 2023, volumes improved by 2.5% over the prior year. I want to congratulate the APS team for achieving record safety performance in 2023.I truly believe our customer focus, as measured by our recent customer satisfaction survey, our progress in refilling our growth funnel and our superior safety results reflects our attention to detail that provides a leading indicator for operational performance and eventual financial results. With that, I will return the call back to Peter."", 'Peter Z. E. Vanacker', ""Thanks, Torkel. I would like to thank the entire LyondellBasell team for delivering such resilient results during a very challenging year. To close out on the segments, let's turn to Slide 19 and discuss the results for our technology business on behalf of Jim Seward. During the fourth quarter, licensing revenue moderated after exceptionally strong results in the third quarter due to the timing of licensing milestones. Nonetheless, EBITDA for the segment exceeded the fourth quarter of the prior year.Fourth quarter catalyst volumes were higher than any quarter since the third quarter of 2022. First quarter results for the technology segments were expected to improve due to increased licensing revenue and a further rise in catalyst volumes compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. As Ken mentioned earlier, we will utilize our proprietary MoReTec technology as we build our first commercial scale advanced recycling plant in Germany. I'm very proud of the work our R&D team embarked on years ago to develop this differential and advantage technology from lab to commercial scale.Let me now summarize our outlook with Slide 20. As we begin 2024, the majority of our businesses are continuing to face the slow demand seen in the fourth quarter of 2023. But we are seeing a few early signs of improvement. Our North American O&P business is seeing modest demand improvements. In Europe, order trends were improving from a very low level as our O&P customers begin to pursue modest restocking. For the year, we expect normal seasonal demand, improvements to begin near the end of the first quarter and continue through the summer.As we progress through the second half of the year, we expect demand to benefit from moderating interest rates and reduced inflation. Durable goods are a critical market for LYB's products. Demand for durable goods lacked the economy during 2022 and 2023. As markets digested the extraordinary high levels of consumer activity that prevailed during pandemic era stimulus. We expect that moderating interest rates, reduced inflation and infrastructure-related stimulus spending will begin to support a gradual return to a healthier demand for durable goods during the second half of this year.China is the largest market for chemicals, exceeding North America and Europe combined, and we continue to watch closely for targeted stimulus and other measures that could drive improved economic growth in China. In the meantime, LYB will continue to advance on our strategic goals. We are actively managing our portfolio to grow and upgrade our core businesses.We will continue to see actions supporting the growth of regional hubs that will serve as the engines for our profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business. And our work to embed value creation into our corporate culture will continue to deliver results through our value enhancement program. We're now pleased to take your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI.', 'Stephen I. Richardson', 'Peter, I was wondering if you could just dig in a little bit on the expectations for the second half and maybe just a little bit more on the O&P businesses. What kind of recovery are you kind of underwriting in your outlook? And how do you think that plays out? And any guideposts beyond the statements on durables we should be thinking about as the year progresses?', 'Peter Z. E. Vanacker', ""Thank you, Stephen. As usual, very good question from your side. To start with, as we alluded to, I mean, we're still, I mean, a bit prudent on the guidance for Q1. But when we are looking at the second half of this year, a couple of things that I want to point to. This has been the longest downturn that we have seen as far as I can look back in our history. So one would expect I mean that there will be, if you look at inflation rates going down, interest rates going down, more consumer confidence in Europe maybe also in China, that demand would go up.So from a demand side, one would expect that demand would go up. And that covers not only the O&P business, but also if you look at durable groups, especially -- as we all know, I mean, demand has been very low last year in durable goods, which, of course, has a lot to do with very high interest rates and therefore, consumer behavior so also here you would expect, I mean, that durable goods demand would go up, I mean, especially in the second half of this year. The United States, as you know, has been quite robust. I mean we have been able to navigate. You see robust margins also on the polyethylene side. And also here, as you know, I mean, inflation rates are going down. You see already a little bit of indications. There is more house builds, houses that are being sold. And that, of course, has a direct impact on demand for durable goods."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America.', 'Stephen V. Byrne', ""Sorry about that. Pardon me, I was on -- sorry about that. Just regarding the NATPET joint venture, it seems like it's roughly 10x EBITDA. Is that roughly right? And do you see potential for this investment to generate a higher EBITDA down the road? And I am just wondering the basis for that investment, given it seems like polypropylene bit oversupplied. And I guess my other question on it would be what is the -- what are the contract terms for the propane that you get from Saudi, any risk that price could get escalated down the road?"", 'Peter Z. E. Vanacker', ""Thank you, Steve. Also a good question on NATPET. First of all, I mean, we are very pleased that we were able to sign this deal that has been work of a core team in our company, where I was personally, of course, deeply involved during quite an important period of time to come to this conclusion.When you look at the amount of money that we paid and Ken alluded to that in his remarks, then one cannot just look at the EBITDA, mid-cycle EBITDA to $150 million for the entire company. But what you don't see and what needs to take into consideration is the fact that we are the path to market. So we are generating value for the company that comes out of selling the products outside of Saudi Arabia to our other markets. And therefore, also strategically very important because we have a very sustainable low-cost feedstock basis that we have negotiated that is included in the deal so that we are better positioned in Polypropylene to go to certain markets where -- maybe today, we don't have the best position. And here, let's not forget that we did (inaudible) in Italy as well. In addition to that, as we alluded to, we have the income streams generated out of our license agreements. We have the opportunity to continue to invest with the second line next to the existing lines to capture synergies there. And that's why Ken alluded to the fact that with the current deal, we are (inaudible), which is above 12%. But then as we do the second step, then we would be higher to say, I mean, quite higher than 12% IRR. No final investment decision yet, but it is also part of the consideration in doing that first step."", 'Michael C. McMurray', 'Steve, in the multiple is probably closer to 9 versus 10, just for clarity.', 'Peter Z. E. Vanacker', 'Without taking into consideration, I mean, marketing fees, et cetera, et cetera.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi.', 'Patrick David Cunningham', 'Maybe within the $800 million in growth CapEx allocated for this year, how much of that is directly related to circular and low-carbon solutions? And beyond that, what should we expect in terms of inorganic growth and additional investments in that space for 2024?', 'Peter Z. E. Vanacker', 'I will just refer, I mean, to the Capital Markets Day, we said about 15% over the cycle. Ken -- Michael, do you want to add something to that, I mean, for next year?', 'Michael C. McMurray', ""Yes. I mean what I'd say is that the guidance that we gave at Capital Markets Day for CapEx remains intact. As a reminder, we said over the period, '23 to '25 on average, we'd spend $2 billion. We guided to $2.1 billion today. And as Peter said, the expectation for the CLCS, our circularity business, it's about 15% to 20% over the period.Now specifically around inorganic growth. I'd probably say a couple of things. I think at our Capital Markets Day, we were clear that we hope to get some M&A done over the next few years. I think we were pretty clear at the criteria that we shared in regards to growing and upgrading the core. I think the (inaudible) joint venture, our new PO/TBA facility, the circularity investments that we've made and the refining exit are all great examples and then our recent announcement of our EO and D exit is another great example. And quite frankly, it was a great valuation with the best owner mindset. We also shared our approach to growth through M&As and joint ventures at our Capital Markets Day.And I think with our NATPET acquisition, we're off to a great start, and this clearly fits the framework, which we shared back in March. And then it also has a great opportunity for future attractive growth. And then finally, at our March Capital Markets Day, we shared our goal of getting to $10 billion of EBITDA, normalized EBITDA, in 2027, which assumed we would deploy roughly the remaining 30% of our free cash flow that we haven't returned to investors to fund our future M&A ambitions.But I want to be clear about a couple of things. Our commitments to investors for (inaudible) make steadfast and our capital allocation principles and priorities remain unchanged. We will be disciplined acquirers. We will not burn it in your cash. We will not build a lazy balance sheet. If we can't find compelling transactions, we'll give back more of your cash to you."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.', 'David L. Begleiter', ""1Just in I and D, how much of the PO/TBA plant contributed in 2023? Do you think mid-cycle earnings power here is still with the new TBA plant above $2 billion. And when do you think you'll start achieving a run rating at that mid-cycle earnings level?"", 'Peter Z. E. Vanacker', ""Happy birthday, Dave. We heard that you have your birthday today. Good question. I mean if I take one step back on the I&D business in Q4, maybe a couple of numbers and stay with me, so $265 million, excluding identified items is the EBITDA that we generated in Q4. But one needs to take into consideration, of course, that we had a heavy LIFO impact of $95 million. So if I add, I mean, the LIFO impact of $95 million, then actually the underlying results were $360 million for Q4, comparing to Q4 2022 which was $291 million.So a quite underlying performance, good quarter in I and D, and I did not even take into consideration the fact that we had scheduled turnarounds, bottleneck as well as in Bayport. So we alluded to that, I mean, in our guidance at the time when we released the Q3 results of an impact of about $120 million. So (inaudible) quite a good quarter in I and D. And of course, part of that was also due to the fact that we very successfully started up our PO/TBA plant. The new PO/TBA plant, we alluded to mid-cycle margins, $450 million. We said last year in year one, so that means 2023. We would run at a minimum of 50% nameplate capacity. We overachieved set target. We ran at approximately a little bit more than 60%, I would say. And then also when we look at this year, we will continue to ramp up, and we will do it in a very disciplined way, reflecting on market demand for propylene oxide and oxyfuels. But one may see further progress, I would say, probably going to 70%, maybe exceeding 70% capacity utilization. And then when we move into 2025, that's where one would see the full benefit of the PO/TBA plant in terms of capacity utilization."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.', 'Vincent Stephen Andrews', ""Just on the value enhancement program. I'm just trying to understand the impact to '23 and '24, a bit better. If we just sort of kind of look at a ratio of sort of what that 2017 to 2019 EBITDA was at Lyondell then versus what it was in 2023. If we apply that ratio to the VEP numbers, would that be about right in terms of what you enjoyed from it in '23 and what you expect in '24?"", 'Michael C. McMurray', ""Yes. What I'd say, I mean, hopefully, you heard my prepared remarks, Vincent. So the benefit, the actual benefit in our P&L for 2023 was approximately $300 million. And then we guided for '24 for an exit run rate of $600 million. Now if you're trying to draw a line from '23 to '25, it looks like that kind of the pace of change slows a bit. But keep in mind that last year, we focused on low-hanging fruit, things that didn't require investment and that we could execute upon very quickly.So we're in kind of building up projects again as we sit in this year, but we have high confidence in the outlook that we gave up to $1 billion in 2025 and again, $300 million of P&L benefit in '23, actual."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo.', 'Michael Joseph Sison', ""Cheers, in terms of 2024, a lot of chemical companies you've reported thus far has sort of said their earnings could recover or be better in '24 versus '23. It sounds like your first half is going to be a little bit challenged with demand being weaker and the second half being a little bit better. So when you sort of total up potentially what you see in '24, should earnings be up, flat or down? Or just maybe directionally for the full year, how do you think about the setup for earnings?"", 'Peter Z. E. Vanacker', 'Well, Michael, you said it yourself. I mean, Q1, still modest, Q2 seasonal demands have been picking up. And then what I said at the beginning also second half of the year, we see -- we expect at least, I mean, that we will see interest rates going down demand for durable goods, I mean going up, some recovery in Europe, some recovery in China.So as a consequence, if you added all that, one would expect that earnings are going to be better than last year.', 'Michael C. McMurray', 'But mostly in the second half.', 'Operator', ""Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. I'm sorry. We'll go on to our next question, comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners."", 'Kevin William McCarthy', ""Yes. In 2024, would you expect your regional mix of earnings to differ materially from 2023. Part of the reason I ask is it looks like you're guiding to a tax rate of 20% and often regional mix is the reason behind that, but perhaps there are other reasons you might call out. Maybe you could just kind of talk through the dynamics there would be helpful."", 'Michael C. McMurray', ""Yes. I'm happy to talk through it. So yes, I mean, our -- the ETR, we guided to of 20% is up roughly 1 percentage point versus what was in 2023. So not a huge story. There's a few give and takes. Now, we did guide our cash tax rate to be up a couple of percentage points versus last year, and also our ETR from 2023 and that's largely driven by a decrease in U.S. tax depreciation and also the gain on the sale of our EO&D business. Hopefully, that's helpful."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho.', 'John Ezekiel E. Roberts', 'Could we get an update on your China operations both in PO styrene and your polyolefins JVs?', 'Peter Z. E. Vanacker', 'Yes, John. I mean, and welcome back. Let me give that question, I mean, to Ken. The opportunity?', 'Kenneth Todd Lane', ""Yes, sure. I'll take a question for O&P and then maybe Kim, you can comment on I and D. But for O&P, we continue to operate the joint venture at technical minimums. The focus really is on finding better product mix and customer mix in region. Our focus when we entered that joint venture was to build out an increased presence in the domestic market because we do market the high-density polyethylene and polypropylene from the asset. The team did a great job with that last year. So earnings, of course, are still very challenged in China.If you look at average margins, they're still slightly negative, which we're seeing that in our asset. Even with a new world-scale asset, it still is a very challenging market, and we expect to start to see some improvement in that in the second half of the year. But so far, demand has been, I'd say, modestly improving, but haven't seen really an improvement in margins yet, Kim?"", 'Kimberly A. Foley', ""I would say as it relates to the joint ventures we have on the propylene oxide side. We ran both of those JVs above 95% operating rates last year, excluding a turnaround, which was significantly higher than other PO plants in that region. As Ken alluded to, the margins were rather thin. We saw high raw material costs, and we also saw high utilities. But as we've mentioned before, these are the best technologies that we have in the region. They are very cost competitive.They sit on integrated sites owned by a very good operator with expertise in both of these technologies. And we think as we go forward, we have huge potential there."", 'Peter Z. E. Vanacker', ""And may I add, I mean to that also. You probably noticed some news flow around China, phasing out chlorine-based propylene oxide technologies towards, I mean, 2025. This is still -- I mean, the majority of propylene oxide capacity in China that would be phased out for time which also fits -- I mean, for us, very well together with our global strategy, the successful start-up of our PO/TBA plant. And we are running this business successfully under Kim's leadership from a global basis."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays.', 'Michael James Leithead', ""I wanted to ask you around O&P EAI, EBITDA has been below breakeven, I think 4 out of the last 6 quarters. And I appreciate demand isn't great across most markets. But it just seems like there's been a bit of a shift here versus the profitability in the past decade. So do we need to take a bigger restructuring overhaul to make this business profitable again?Do we need to wait for the world to get better? I mean just how are you approaching that business here in '24?"", 'Peter Z. E. Vanacker', ""Yes. Thank you, Mike. A very good question. And you've seen from our actions already last year that we are turning around, I mean, every stone. We did shut down the one line in Brindisi, which is an important capacity. We've seen that there has been a couple of other announcements in the marketplace in terms of consolidations. We continue to look, of course, at the entire portfolio. That's what you would expect us to do.But having said that, I also reflect back on Q4. So in a big picture on Q4 for the company for us, was towards the end of the year, we wanted to also optimize our cash flow and working capital. And we freed up about $700 million in working capital in that Q4. And as a consequence, of course, also can see this business towards lower than what we had originally guided to, 75% of capacity utilization was the guidance. We reduced at really, I mean, surprisingly low levels, 65% of our capacity utilization. Again, in the context of also with the current market environment, optimizing our working capital.

Or is there some different variation to that? Can you help us to think about those?', 'Peter Z. E. Vanacker', 'Yes, the current capacity, as you rightfully said, is around, I mean, 400 KTA. So with the other technology that Ken referred to, I mean, we would be able, I mean, to scale up to in total capacity of 1 million tonnes. Again, we have 35% of the joint venture. So that 35% valid, I mean, for the current capacity, but we can also be valid for future capacity if we take a final investment decision. Ken, some more information that you want to share?', 'Kenneth Todd Lane', ""Yes, I'll just add that part of the synergy that you had talked about before is that region is short of propylene. And so we're going to have additional propylene capacity with this expansion, which is one of the synergies around potentially executing that. But it will be financed by the joint venture. And yes, it will be proportionate for the shareholders, but we don't expect to be putting cash in, that's going to be something financed by the joint venture."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor Pickering Holt.', 'Matthew Robert Lovseth Blair', ""Looking at the 70% payout target versus free cash flow just in the context of increasing CapEx. When you're considering these payout targets, why is the denominator free cash and not more of like a cash from operations. Don't you need to balance these returns on the growth investments against returning cash to investors."", 'Michael C. McMurray', ""Not sure I fully understand your question, but it's pretty typical when you're giving payout targets to give it on the free cash flow line versus operating cash flow."", 'Peter Z. E. Vanacker', ""And then we also, at the Capital Markets Day, guided two words, I mean that what is the CapEx level that we are investing, so sustainable CapEx around , I mean, that $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion a year. And then the growth CapEx. We also said we're going to be pretty much in the range of our historic spending somewhere between $2 billion and $3 billion on a yearly basis depending on how these projects come.So I think that helps you, I mean, to do the back-of-the-envelope calculation, whatever cash flow number you take."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Vanacker for final comments."", 'Peter Z. E. Vanacker', 'Okay. Thank you, again, for all the excellent questions. And of course, I also want to thank our global team for delivering outstanding value and maximizing cash conversion during these challenging times.

This restructuring is designed to enhance operational efficiency, improve customer focus, and drive growth in each business segment. The successful spin-off of GE HealthCare as an independent company is a testament to GE's execution capabilities and strategic foresight, potentially unlocking shareholder value and enabling more targeted investment strategies."", ""Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: GE's extensive global supply chain is susceptible to disruptions, as highlighted in the 10-K filing. The company faces challenges such as raw material shortages, supplier capacity constraints, and production disruptions, which can adversely affect its ability to meet customer commitments and impact profitability. Despite efforts to mitigate these risks through lean initiatives and diversified sourcing, the complexity and interconnectivity of GE's supply chain remain a significant vulnerability that requires ongoing attention and strategic management."", 'Cybersecurity Risks: As a high-tech industrial company, GE is exposed to cybersecurity threats that could compromise sensitive data, disrupt operations, and damage its reputation. The increasing interconnectedness with suppliers and customers amplifies this risk. While GE has implemented measures to strengthen its cybersecurity framework, the evolving nature of cyber threats and the potential for significant financial and operational impacts necessitate a continuous investment in robust cybersecurity defenses and incident response capabilities.', ""Growth in Air Travel and Renewable Energy Markets: GE is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand in the air travel and renewable energy sectors.

Factors such as macroeconomic conditions, trade policies, and geopolitical tensions can affect customer investment decisions and disrupt global supply chains. The potential for economic downturns or political instability in key markets poses a threat to GE's financial performance and strategic objectives."", ""Intense Competition and Technological Disruption: The competitive landscape in which GE operates is characterized by rapid technological advancements and aggressive competitors. The company must continuously innovate and adapt to maintain its market position. Failure to keep pace with technological changes or to meet evolving customer needs could result in lost market share and reduced profitability. Additionally, competitors may develop disruptive technologies that challenge GE's traditional business models, necessitating proactive strategic responses."", ""In conclusion, General Electric Co (NYSE:GE) presents a compelling case of a company with deep-rooted strengths in innovation and market leadership, strategically restructuring to enhance focus and efficiency. However, it must navigate weaknesses such as supply chain vulnerabilities and cybersecurity risks. Opportunities for growth in burgeoning markets and alignment with sustainability goals offer promising avenues for expansion, while economic uncertainties and competitive pressures pose significant threats. GE's ability to leverage its strengths, address its weaknesses, capitalize on opportunities, and mitigate threats will be crucial in shaping its future success."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Amid this, Macerich’s shopping centers, located in densely populated areas having an affluent customer base with significant disposable income, are witnessing healthy demand from retailers as they continue to rent out more physical store spaces. Moreover, solid tenant demand has helped the company backfill its spaces, which is a positive.', 'From the beginning of 2023 through Sep 30, the company signed leases for 3.14 million square feet.

For 2023, we expect year-over-year growth of 2.8% in the company’s total revenues.', 'MAC has been making efforts to enhance its assets quality, as well as customer relationships through increasing adoption of the omni-channel model, a popular choice among several store retailers post the pandemic. This is likely to pay off well. Also, focusing on the re-use and mixed-use of its properties by recapturing and repositioning anchor tenants remains a key emphasis, while bringing brands to new markets at its retail real estate will likely attract shoppers.', 'Macerich’s healthy balance sheet position with ample financial flexibility is likely to continue supporting its growth endeavors.

Investors following this style of investing are usually not interested in betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.', ""Everyone likes betting on fast-moving trending stocks, but it isn't easy to determine the right entry point. These stocks often lose momentum when their future growth potential fails to justify their swelled-up valuation. In that phase, investors find themselves invested in shares that have limited to no upside or even a downside. So, betting on a stock just by looking at the traditional momentum parameters could be risky at times."", ""It could be safer to invest in bargain stocks that have been witnessing price momentum recently. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, is pretty useful in identifying great momentum stocks, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced."", 'There are several stocks that currently pass through the screen and American Airlines (AAL) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a great candidate.', ""Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 9.6% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this world's largest airline well in this regard."", 'While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. AAL meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 22% over the past 12 weeks.', 'Moreover, the momentum for AAL is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.56. This indicates that the stock moves 56% higher than the market in either direction.', 'Given this price performance, it is no surprise that AAL has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.', ""In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped AAL earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks.

I'll now turn the call over to Dan. Dan?"", ""Dan Amos: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. We're glad you are joining us. Reflecting on 2023, it was a very good year. Our management team, employees, sales distribution have continued to work tirelessly as dedicated stewards of our business. This has allowed us to be there for our policyholders when they need us most, just as we promised. Aflac Incorporated delivered a very strong earnings for the year. Net earnings per diluted share for 2023 were $7.78, adjusted earnings per diluted share was $6.23 were the best in the company's history despite the weakening yen and the impact of the reinsurance retrocession late in the fourth quarter. Beginning with Japan, Aflac Japan generated solid overall financial results in 2023."", ""For the year, total adjusted revenues declined 3.6% to nearly ¥1.5 trillion, largely reflecting the impacts of reinsurance and paid-up policies. But this was largely offset by a 7.3% decrease in total benefits and adjusted expenses. Pre-tax adjusted earnings increased 6% to nearly ¥457 billion for the year. As a result, Aflac Japan produced an extremely strong profit margin of 30.5%. I am pleased with Aflac Japan's 10.9% year-over-year increase in sales, which was largely driven 26% increase in cancer insurance sales with very significant contributions from Japan Post Company and Japan Post Insurance as well as other alliances, Dai-ichi Life and Daido Life. As you may recall, Aflac Japan aims to have a product lined up to meet customers' needs during any life stage."", ""Our latest medical insurance is designed to appeal to younger policyholders' basic needs and older and existing policyholders who want additional or updated coverage. While our medical insurance sales were off for the year, they increased 6.5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter following the introduction of our new medical insurance product in mid-September. Similarly, Aflac Japan refreshed WAYS and Child Endowment in 2022 as a way of acquiring younger customers and also introducing opportunities to sell our core third-sector products to them. Since the launch of our refreshed WAYS product, approximately 80% of our sales are to younger customers below the age of 50. The level of concurrent third-sector sales remains above 50%. Given Japan's demographics, our product strategy is to fit the needs of the customers at any stage in life."", 'Acquiring younger customers is critical to our success along with our intense focus on being where the customer wants to buy insurance. We have a broad network of distribution channels, including agencies, alliance partners, and banks. This reach continually optimizes opportunities to help provide financial protection to the Japanese consumers. We are working hard to support each channel. While the market presents challenges, we expect to reach ¥67 billion to ¥73 billion of sales in Japan by the end of 2026. Turning to the U.S. We also generated strong overall financial results in 2023. Total adjusted revenues increased 2.1% to $6.6 billion. The decline in total net benefits and claims was slightly offset by the increase in adjusted expenses.', ""Pretax adjusted earnings increased 10.4% to an all-time high of $1.5 billion for the year. As a result, Aflac U.S. produced an extremely strong profit margin of 22.7%. Aflac U.S. sales increased 5% in 2023, which was at the lower end of our expectations. As you know, we've been focused on increasing persistence to grow profitable earned premiums. In addition, we continually evaluate new business to ensure that it is profitable. During the fourth quarter, we made some tactical decisions to avoid sales opportunities to certain less profitable larger accounts like those of high turnover. At the same time, we focused on updating our products to ensure that our policyholders continue to realize the value of -- our products provide. As part of our efforts, we introduced our new cancer protection insurance policy in the second quarter of 2023."", 'Since that time, our cancer insurance has increased nearly 25%. We know that when people experience the value of our products, it increases persistency, which benefits our policyholders and lowers our expenses. I believe that the need for the products and the solutions we offer are as strong or stronger than ever before in both Japan and the United States. We are leveraging every opportunity and avenue to share this message with consumers, particularly given that our products are sold, not bought. As we communicate the value of our products, we know that the strong brand alone is not enough. We must paint a better picture of how our products help address the gap that people face, even when they have major medical insurance. Knowing our products help lift people up when they need us most is something that makes all of us at Aflac very proud, and propels us to do more and achieve more.', ""We continue to reinforce our leading position and build on that momentum. We are confident that the successful execution of our strategy will lead to sales of at least $1.8 billion in the U.S. by the end of 2025. I'd like to end on addressing our ongoing commitment to prudent liquidity and capital management. We have taken proactive steps in recent years to defend our cash flow and deployable capital against the weakening yen. At the end of 2023, we had nearly $2.8 billion of liquidity at the holding company, which means more than $1 billion over the minimum balance. As an insurance company, our primary responsibility is to fulfill the promises we make to our policyholders while being responsive to the needs of our shareholders. We remain committed to maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of our policyholders and balance this financial strength with the tactical capital deployment."", 'We intend to continue prudently managing our liquidity and capital to preserve the strength of our capital and cash flows. This supports both the dividend track record and the tactical share repurchase. 2023 marked the 41st consecutive year of dividend increases. We treasure our track record of dividend growth and remain committed to extending it. Last quarter, the Board put us on a path to continue this record when it increased in the first quarter of 2024 dividend 19% to $0.50. We also remain in the market, repurchasing our shares through 2023 at a historically high level of $700 million per quarter. We have remained tactical in our approach to share repurchase, deploying $2.8 billion in capital to repurchase nearly 39 million of our shares in 2023.', ""Combined with a dividend, this means we delivered over $3.8 billion back to the shareholders in 2023, while also investing in the growth of our business. At the same time, we have maintained our position among companies with the highest return on capital and the lowest cost of capital in the industry. Overall, I think we can say that it's been another strong year. I'll now turn the program over to Max, who will cover more details on the financial results for this year and provide an outlook for the key drivers of earnings in 2024. Max?"", ""Max Broden: Thank you, Dan. This morning, I'm going to address our 2023 results before providing an outlook for certain drivers for 2024 that were included in the slides with our earnings materials filed yesterday with our 8-K. Aflac Incorporated delivered very strong earnings for the year as adjusted earnings per diluted share rose 9.9% to $6.23, the highest amount in our company's history. This result included a $0.19 negative impact from foreign currency and variable investment income was $0.14 per share below our long-term return expectations. In addition, our annual results included remeasurement gains of $0.51 per share, a $0.20 per share non-economic loss in the fourth quarter under U.S. GAAP related to the innovation of our reinsurance treaty with a third-party ceded back to the company, and a $0.04 per share write-off of certain capitalized software development costs in the third quarter."", 'Our liquidity remained strong with unencumbered holding company liquidity being $1 billion above our minimum balance. Likewise, our capital position remained strong and we ended the year with an SMR above 1,100% in Japan. At the end of 2023, we estimated our internally modeled ESR to be above 250% and we expect the FSA to provide final guidance on the ESR later in 2024. We also estimated our combined RBC in the U.S. to be greater than 650% at the end of 2023. These are strong capital ratios which we actively monitor, stress, and manage to withstand credit cycles as well as external shocks. In addition, impairments have remained within our expectations and with limited impact to both earnings and capital. Our Adjusted leverage remains below our leverage corridor of 20% to 25% at 19.7%.', ""And this will fluctuate with the yen-dollar rate, since we hold approximately two-thirds of our debt denominated in yen as part of our enterprise hedging program to protect the economic value of Aflac Japan in U.S. dollar terms. In 2023, we repurchased $2.8 billion of our own stock and paid dividends of $245 million in Q4, offering good relative IRR on these capital deployments. We will continue to be flexible and tactical in how we manage the balance sheet and deploy capital to drive strong risk-adjusted ROE with a meaningful spread to our cost of capital. Adjusted book value per share increased 10.1% and the adjusted ROE was 13.8%, an acceptable spread to our cost of capital. I'm also pleased with our continued development of our Bermuda reinsurance platform, which resulted in three transactions during 2023."", ""We will continue to utilize this platform to better manage risk and improve capital efficiency across the enterprise, and we expect these transactions to be part of a series that will improve our run-rate adjusted ROE by 100 to 200 basis points over time, all things being equal. Overall, we're very pleased with these results, especially when normalizing for one-time items. Turning to Aflac Japan. Its total benefit ratio for the year was 66%, down 140 basis points from the prior year. Throughout the year, we continue to experience favorable actual to expected on our well-priced large and mature in-force block. We estimate the impact from remeasurement gains to be 130 basis points favorable to the benefit ratio in 2023. Long-term experience trends, as it relates to the treatment of cancer and hospitalization, have continued to lead to favorable underwriting experience."", 'Persistency remained solid with a rate of 93.4%, and was down 70 basis points year-over-year, reflecting elevated lapse as customers updated their cancer and medical coverage with our latest cancer and medical products. Our expense ratio in Japan was 19.8%, down 50 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by good expense control and to some extent, by expense allowance from reinsurance transactions. For the full year, total adjusted revenues in yen were down 3.6% to ¥1.5 trillion. Net earned premiums declined 5.9% to ¥1.1 trillion, reflecting the impacts of reinsurance transactions, paid-up policies, and deferred profit liability. When excluding these three factors, net earned premiums declined an estimated 1.7%. On this same basis, we would expect net earned premiums in 2024 to decline 2.5% to 1.5% when taking into consideration the impact of reinsurance, paid-up policies, and the deferred profit liability reclassification.', 'Adjusted net investment income increased by 4% to ¥365.6 billion as we experienced higher yields on our U.S. dollar-denominated investments and related favorable FX. This was partially offset by a transfer of assets due to reinsurance. Pretax earnings were ¥456.9 billion or 6% higher than a year ago. For 2024, we would expect our well-priced in-force to show greater stability in terms of the benefit ratio excluding unlockings and to be in the range of 66% to 68%. This is a function of both favorable morbidity experience and improved mix of business. With the current trend in revenues, we are actively reducing our expenses. We are taking both tactical efforts as well as more long-term transformational initiatives and we would expect our expense ratio to be in the range of 19% to 21% going forward.', 'The pre-tax profit margin for Japan for 2023 was 30.5%, up 280 basis points year-over-year. A very good result. With approximately 30% of the Japan portfolio in U.S. dollar assets, the strength of the U.S. dollar versus the yen has increased the proportion of net investment income as a component of our pretax profit. With a greater contribution to profitability from net investment income in yen terms, our pre-tax margin is naturally pushed up. In addition, having transitioned to option-based currency hedging, we expect quarterly hedge costs to remain roughly in line with what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2023. In combination with a lower expected benefit ratio, we expect a pretax profit margin of 29% to 31% in 2024. Turning to Aflac U.S. Our 2023 total benefit ratio came in well below expectations at 42.8%.', 'We estimate that the remeasurement gains impacted the benefit ratio by 500 basis points in 2023. Claims utilization has stabilized, but as we incorporate more recent experience into our reserve models, we unlocked assumptions and released reserves during the year. Persistency increased 130 basis points year-over-year to 78.6%. This is a function of poor persistency quarters falling out of the metric and stabilization across numerous product categories. Our expense ratio in the U.S. was 40.6%, up 90 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by our growth initiatives and higher DAC amortization. We would expect the U.S. expense ratio to decrease over time as these businesses grow to scale and improve their profitability. For the full year, total adjusted revenues were up 2.1% to $6.6 billion.', 'Net earned premiums increased 1.9% to $5.7 billion in 2023. Adjusted net investment income increased 8.6% to $820 million, mainly driven by higher yields on both our fixed and floating-rate portfolios. Pretax earnings were $1.5 billion or 10.4% higher than a year ago, driven primarily by the lower benefit ratio which was largely impacted by the third quarter unlock and only partially offset by the higher expense ratio. For 2024, we would expect net earned premium growth to be in the range of 3% to 5%. Profitability for the U.S. segment was solid with a pretax margin of 22.7%, driven primarily by the remeasurement gains from unlocking. Looking forward at 2024, as we grow products with a higher benefit ratio and lower expense ratio, like group life and disability, and network dental and vision, you should start to see those changes reflected in our ratios over time.', 'In 2024, we would expect to operate with a benefit ratio in the range of 45% to 47% and an expense ratio of 38% to 40%. This translates into an expected profit margin of 19% to 21%. In our corporate segment, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $425 million, compared to a loss of $218 million a year ago, primarily due to higher investment tax credits and the impact of the innovation of our reinsurance treaty with a third party. Adjusted net investment income was $54 million lower than last year due to an increased volume of tax credit investments. Higher rates began to earn in and amortized hedge income increased. These tax credit investments impacted the corporate net investment income line for U.S. GAAP purposes negatively by $343 million with an associated credit to the tax line.', ""The net impact to our bottom line was a positive $39 million. To date, these investments are performing well and in line with expectations. The impact from the reinsurance innovation was a one-time negative of $151 million. Overall, we're very pleased with our 2023 results and our outlook for 2024. I'll now turn the call back to David, so we can begin Q&A. David?"", ""David Young: Thank you, Max.

The company's stock led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Sherwin-Williams’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams ', 'The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 10.83% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Sherwin-Williams today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $279.70, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Sherwin-Williams’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.', ""Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 33% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Sherwin-Williams. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation."", 'Are you a shareholder? SHW’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on SHW, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) took the same path, after all, even though soda fans in the U.S. are more likely to order a Coke when they're thirsty."", ""That's about where the easy comparisons end between these two consumer-staples giants. PepsiCo sells dozens of beverage franchises besides Pepsi, including Gatorade, 7 Up, Mountain Dew, and Aquafina. Yet unlike Coke, it doesn't get all its revenue from drink sales. Pepsi doesn't even count most of its sales or earnings from its beverage segment. Foods and snacks are the real profit driver for this business."", 'Pepsi booked over $86 billion of revenue in fiscal 2022, up from $80 billion a year earlier. Just 42% of that sales figure was powered by drink sales, though, with the rest coming from its sprawling food business. That segment is split into two main categories: snacks and convenient food.', ""Snacks: Pepsi has a huge presence in the snack-foods aisle through its Frito-Lay division that sells various chips, dips, and spreads. Big brands here include Doritos, Cheetos, Lay's, Ruffles, and Tostitos. This segment is large, profitable, and tilted toward the U.S. market. Pepsi counted just 27% of revenue this past year from snacks in the U.S., but 44% of its earnings came from that segment ."", ""Convenience foods: Pepsi gets a much smaller contribution from its Quaker Foods division that's home to many cereal, rice, and pasta brands. The most popular include Cap'n Crunch and Life cereals, Quaker oatmeal, and Rice-A-Roni side dishes. Its U.S. segment accounted for just 4% of all of Pepsi's sales last year and roughly the same proportion of annual earnings."", ""Food is growing in importance to the business, beyond its status as a huge profit generator today. Beverages were worth 40% of sales in 2022, down from 45% a year earlier. That shift was partly driven by Pepsi's recent sale of a few juice brands, including Tropicana and Naked."", ""Pepsi is planning to use innovation to support this profit-generating food business over the next few years. Consumers are asking for more nutritious snacking options, and they're increasingly looking for chip ingredients that go beyond just potato and tortilla bases. Brands such as PopCorners and SunChips are satisfying those tastes by including more plant-based proteins, seeds, and vegetables. Look for more launches in these areas in 2024 and beyond."", ""Meanwhile, investors could see unusually strong earnings from Pepsi's food segments in the next several quarters. Soaring raw-material costs on things like grains spurred similarly large price increases for most of the last year. This cost inflation is slowing, though, meaning Pepsi could see higher demand as it reduces its pace of price increases."", 'The company also stands to recover some of its losses from the past few quarters as its price increases continue to pay dividends while costs come down. As a result, Pepsi could become even more dependent on its snack food business over its beverage segment in the next few years.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PepsiCo wasn't one of them.

This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, PepsiCo is expected to post earnings of $1.72 per share, indicating a change of +3% from the year-ago quarter.

With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer. Len?', ""Leonard Schleifer: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone joining today's call. Fourth quarter 2023 capped another strong year for Regeneron and Bob will walk you through our financial results. For my remarks today, I'd like to briefly look back at 2023 and then discuss what's to come in the year ahead. 2023 was another remarkable year for Regeneron highlighted by several significant achievements that better position the company to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value. At the start of the year, we identified five key strategic imperatives: First, obtaining FDA approval and successfully launching EYLEA HD. We did encounter a minor delay when we received a complete response letter in late June due to an issue at a third-party filler, but this was quickly remedied and EYLEA HD was granted approval in mid-August."", ""With what we believe to be a best-in-class potential clinical profile, EYLEA HD is poised to become the new standard-of-care for patients with wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic eye diseases. The launch is off to a great start, which Marion will discuss in a few minutes. Second, we had to defend our intellectual property related to EYLEA. We presented our best case and prevailed in the District Court, which found that one of EYLEA's formulation patents was both valid and infringed by a biosimilar aflibercept manufacturer. This favorable decision may have broad implications and could result in a delay to biosimilar aflibercept launches. Third, we and our collaborator, Sanofi, needed to continue driving Dupixent growth not only by further penetrating previously approved indications, but also reaching even more patients suffering from other diseases driven by type 2 inflammation."", 'In 2023, we did both. Dupixent global net product sales grew by 34% on a constant currency basis to $11.6 billion. Dupixent lead in new to brand prescription share in the United States across all five of its approved indications. We also had a major breakthrough in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. In March, we reported strong data from the BOREAS study, which enrolled COPD patients with uncontrolled moderate to severe disease and evidence of type 2 inflammation. The FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation during the summer, but required additional evidence of efficacy to support a regulatory filing. Based on this feedback, we and Sanofi decided to conduct an interim analysis on the replicate noticed study, which read out similarly compelling results enabling our December sBLA submission and a potential U.S. launch for this indication as early as mid-2024.', 'Fourth, we continued making progress toward our long-term goal of becoming a global leader in oncology. 2023 was highlighted by our regulatory submissions for linvoseltamab, our BCMA by CD3 bispecific in myeloma and odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific in lymphoma, while continuing to advance other opportunities in solid tumors. And finally, we needed to advance our early-stage pipeline and over the course of 2023, we presented intriguing proof of mechanism or proof of concept data across hematology and genetic medicines as well, as well as other areas including obesity with data from non-human primates. Many of these early programs which George will run through in a few minutes represent first or best-in-class opportunities that we believe can drive long-term growth for Regeneron.', 'Our accomplishments in 2023 have put us in a position of strength entering 2024. For this year, one of our strategic imperatives is to continue driving commercial execution, especially the ongoing launch of EYLEA HD with the goal of accelerating the pace of conversion from other anti-VEGF agents. Another important launch milestone was achieved last month when the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services assigned a permanent J-code for EYLEA HD that will go into effect on April 1, 2024, at which point a potential reimbursement concern for physicians will be removed. We also need to continue to drive Dupixent growth and its currently improved indications as well as from the potential FDA approval and launch in COPD with an eosinophilic phenotype.', ""If approved, Dupixent would represent the first meaningful advance in over a decade for the 300,000 patients in the United States suffering from this form of COPD and would be the first-ever biologic approved for COPD. In oncology this year, aside from continuing to build on the success of Libtayo in non-melanoma skin cancers and then in small cell lung cancer, we're excited about the potential launches of odronextamab and linvoseltamab, the latter of which has the potential to be the best-in-class bispecific for myeloma. We also expect to make significant advances across our pipeline in 2024 with key readouts for fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody in combination with Libtayo in metastatic melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Libtayo in adjuvant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and our Factor XI antibodies in thrombosis, which may inform pivotal studies."", ""We also plan to initiate clinical trials in obesity, geographic atrophy, hemophilia B and severe food allergies in addition to expanding early studies of our CD28 costimulatory bispecific programs in solid and hematologic malignancies. In closing, we had a strong 2023 and are poised to deliver in 2024 and beyond. Our pipeline of over 30 clinical programs is delivering important and differentiated innovations. Our commercial team is executing well and we continue to look at ways to efficiently deploy capital to drive shareholder returns over time. Before I hand it over to George, I want to take a moment to thank Bob Landry for his many contributions to Regeneron over his 10-years as our Chief Financial Officer. In addition to helping fortify Regeneron's financial strength and discipline, Bob has been an incredible mentor to many of Regeneron's current and future leaders, helped drive our financial results over the past decade and worked tirelessly to ensure we have the resources needed to help improve the lives of patients around the world."", ""Bob, on behalf of the entire Regeneron family, thank you and we wish you continued good health and happiness. As we first announced back in September upon Bob's retirement next week, Chris Fenimore will become the CFO of Regeneron. We all look forward to working closely with Chris in his new role knowing he brings a similar rigor and depth of financial knowledge that will ensure continuity and collaboration across the organization. With that, I'll now turn the call over to George."", 'George Yancopoulos: Thanks, Len. That was really impressive overview I have to say. 2023 was another year of first delivered by Regeneron as well as together with our collaborators, all of which have the potential to change the practice of medicine. Starting with inflammation and immunology. As you heard from Len, we are planning yet another launch for Dupixent, this time in eosinophilic COPD, which would represent the sixth disease if this remarkable medicine is approved to treat and the fifth for which it would be first-in-class. Dupixent’s transformative potential in COPD is based on the unprecedented results from our first Phase 3 trial BOREAS, which would then confirm our second Phase 3 trial notice demonstrating that Dupixent treated patients had a 34% reduction in the annualized rate of moderate to severe COPD exacerbations [Technical Issues] IL-33 blocking antibody.', 'The pivotal AERIFY-1 and 2 studies passed an interim futility analysis last year. The studies are now on track to complete enrollment in 2024 with an anticipated readout in 2025. If the Phase 3 results from these studies even approach the Phase 2 data reported in former smokers where a 42% reduction in annualized exacerbation rate was observed, itepekimab has the potential to further transform the treatment paradigm for COPD. Later this year, we are planning on testing an innovative new treatment approach for severe food allergies using a combination of transient BCMAxCD3 bispecific intervention in patients receiving Dupixent therapy. As many of you know, allergic responses are driven by pathologically high levels of Immunoglobulin E or IgE.', 'This is why many say the E in IgE stands for evil. About 40-years ago, it was discovered that interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 were the switch factors required for switching to IgE production. Based on exciting preclinical data including in non-human primates as well as human data, our innovative approach has the potential to reverse severe allergies by first eliminating the long lived plasma cells that serve as an IgE reservoir with the BCMAxCD3 followed by blocking of de novo immunoglobulin class switching to IgE with Dupixent. We are looking forward to starting a small proof-of-concept study, which will inform next steps for this program. We believe this approach has the potential to benefit the millions of people suffering from severe allergies, who are at constant risk.', 'As tragically highlighted just last week by the widely reported death of yet another young person unknowingly exposed to food a allergen. Moving to Oncology. Libtayo is the leading PD-1 antibody for non-melanoma skin cancers, including metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or CSCC and basal cell carcinoma. We are looking forward to potentially expanding the currently approved CSCC indication to include adjuvant CSCC and we expect results from potentially pivotal interim analysis in this setting in the second-half of the year. Regarding Libtayo combinations, our most advanced is the combination with a LAG-3 antibody fianlimab. As a reminder, our early clinical data in three separate first line metastatic melanoma cohorts demonstrated potential for best-in-class efficacy when compared cross trial with the approved anti-LAG-3 PD-1 combination product, highlighted by objective response rates greater than 60% and estimated median progression-free survival of longer than 15 months.', 'These early clinical data suggested that the Libtayo fianlimab combination maybe one of the most exciting examples of a checkpoint inhibitor combination with clinically meaningful benefit and with the safety profile that is similar to that seen with anti PD-1 monotherapy. We are expecting a potentially pivotal initial readout from our first line metastatic melanoma trial by the end of this year. We also anticipate Phase 2 data in non-small cell lung cancer in late 2024. Onto by specifics, starting with solid tumors. In the dose escalation trial of our EGFR by CD28 costimulatory bispecific combined with Libtayo, we have observed promising activity in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer with higher doses of the costim. In terms of safety, so far, we have not seen an increase in immune related adverse events with this costim.', 'Based on these encouraging early data, which will be presented at a scientific forum later this year, we will be initiating expansion cohorts across several solid tumors in the first-half of the year. In 2024, we are also planning to provide updates for our MUC16xCD3 and MUC16xCD28 programs in advanced ovarian cancer. Next, a bispecific for hematology oncology. For linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma, FDA acceptance of our BLA submission is expected later this month and the EMA recently accepted our MAA submission. These submissions were supported by potentially best-in-class profile in late line myeloma in terms of efficacy, safety, dosing, as well as convenience. The confirmatory Phase 3 study, as well as studies in earlier stages of myeloma and pre-malignant disease are enrolling or will soon begin enrolling patients.', ""For odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the FDA decision for our BLA is expected by its March 31 PDUFA date and the new decision is expected in the second half of the year. In terms of additional recent news for our oncology and immunology pipeline, this week, we announced the formation of Regeneron Cell Medicines unit and that we are acquiring full development and commercialization rights for 2Seventy Bio's pipeline of investigational immune cell therapies. We have worked with 2Seventy since 2018 on many of these programs and are excited about the opportunity to continue advancing our collective efforts. After deal closing, certain 2Seventy employees will join Regeneron Cell Medicines and continue to work on addressing cancer and other serious diseases in novel ways including by combining Regeneron's antibody capabilities with CAR-T therapies."", 'Moving from immunology and oncology to obesity and metabolic diseases. Despite all the enthusiasm surrounding GLP-1 agonist for obesity, it has been increasingly recognized that the profound weight loss is accompanied by substantial muscle loss accounting for up to as much as 40% of the weight loss. This potentially irretrievable muscle loss can be catastrophic for patients and may even lead to major public health concerns in the future. We have previously shown that our antibodies targeting myostatin in Activin A have the potential to preserve and grow muscle in human trials. Based on these data as well as additional data in obese non-human primates, we believe that inhibiting these pathways on top of GLP-1 receptor agonism has the potential to achieve comparable overall reductions in body weight, but with improved quality of weight loss resulting in more fat loss, while preserving or actually increasing muscle mass.', 'In mid-2024, we plan to start our first clinical trial to evaluate the combination of our muscle preservation antibodies in combination with semaglutide. Also in 2024, we are anticipating proof-of-concept data for our Factor XI antibodies in the setting of prevention of venous thromboembolism after knee replacement surgery. Based on preclinical and healthy volunteer data, our antibody approach demonstrated more complete Factor XI blockade, compared to competing approaches in development for coagulation disorders and the program is on rapid path to a registrational trial starting late this year or early next year. We will now conclude with our efforts in genetic medicines. Our siRNA collaboration with Alnylam has demonstrated successful silencing of genes in the liver and for the first time for siRNA in the brain.', 'Proof of principle was achieved for and ALN-APP last year and we are anticipating additional data from that program this year, including from patients who have received multiple doses. Based on this success, we are looking forward to new siRNA programs targeting CNS diseases entering the clinic this year such as ALN-SOD for ALS patients with SOD1 mutations. Our collaboration with Intellia on CRISPR gene editing continues to advance, where we together produced the first example of CRISPR-based gene editing of a pathological gene in human beings. This initial program for our lead indication of TTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy is now in the first in-vivo CRISPR program clear to enter Phase 3 studies in the United States. Together with Intellia, we also hope to be the first to use CRISPR technology to insert a corrective gene for deficiency disease.', ""We recently achieved IND clearance for our CRISPR-based gene insertion programs for Factor IX and initiated the leading portion of the clinical trial to evaluate it as a potential cure for hemophilia B. Moving to genetic hearing loss, we were the first U.S.-based company to announce hearing restoration in a young child suffering from genetic hearing loss after treatment with our novel gene therapy approach. We're excited by these early results for this ultra-rare disease and look forward to advancing to the clinic additional programs to potentially address more common forms of monogenic hearing loss. These data represent validation of our viral-based gene therapy program, in this case, locally delivered to the cells of the inner ear. Beyond these efforts, we have made significant investments in leveraging our monoclonal and bispecific antibody expertise to use these agents to systematically deliver virally based genetic based payloads directly to specific tissues in the body non-amenable to local delivery, such as to muscle and the central nervous system."", 'Based on encouraging preclinical data, we will be progressing these approaches to the clinic in the coming years. Finally, concluding with another notable first-in-class program involving a combination of an siRNA with an antibody, in this case to block the C5 complement target. Normally, one needs very high levels of infused antibody to achieve sufficient efficacy because of high target levels regarding C5, but our siRNA co-treatment dramatically lowers C5 target burden allowing lower and more convenient antibody dosing. We recently shared encouraging initial data from a Phase 3 study in patients with PNH, which supported our hypothesis that this combination approach could provide better efficacy and control of breakthrough hemolysis with more convenient dosing, and building on these data we continue to enroll our Phase 3 studies in PNH and myasthenia gravis.', ""We are also planning to extend this combination approach to geographic atrophy and dry AMD. While this combination is expected to have manageable systemic toxicities, including elevated risk of infections, we believe that our approach has several potential advantages over recently approved complement inhibiting agents for GA, which are delivered directly into the eye and have resulted in rare but serious cases of retinal vasculitis, sometimes resulting in permanently impaired vision. In conclusion, Regeneron's R&D engine continues to grow and deliver many firsts, including differentiated early, mid, and late-stage opportunities and we're looking forward to additional progress in 2024. Before I turn the call over Marion, I would like to add my thanks and appreciation to Bob for his many years of devoted efforts and leadership, and welcoming and look forward to adding Chris Fenimore to our leadership team."", 'With that, I will turn it over to Marion.', ""Marion McCourt: Thanks, George. Our business delivered strong results in the fourth quarter and for the year. Over the course of 2023, we successfully launched EYLEA HD, grew Dupixent across approved Type 2 inflammatory diseases, and expanded Libtayo's presence in lung and non-melanoma skin cancers. We look forward to several potential approvals this year in new therapeutic categories, including in COPD with Dupixent and in hematologic oncology using new treatment modalities. I'll start with our Retinal franchise. In January, we announced fourth quarter combined U.S. EYLEA HD and EYLEA net product sales of $1.46 billion. In its first full quarter, EYLEA HD net product sales were $123 million based on growing demand and positive early physician experience."", ""EYLEA HD is already being used across a broad range of patient types, including those switching from EYLEA, other branded agents or Avastin as well as modest but increasing use in treatment-naive patients. In the fourth quarter, EYLEA HD and EYLEA together secured 49% of the anti-VEGF category share despite increasing competition and changing market dynamics. This share gain was driven by the differentiated efficacy and safety profile of our medicine, as well as a short-term disruption in compounded Avastin due to a quality issue in a large supplier that has since been resolved. Since launch, we've made significant progress in securing access and reimbursement for EYLEA HD. More than two-thirds of eligible lives are now covered with the vast majority having first-line or single-step edit access."", ""Medicare fee-for-service, which represents approximately 45% of total category use claims are being paid across 100% of jurisdictions, using a miscellaneous J-code. Looking ahead in 2024, we remind you that the first quarter is typically impacted by payer re-authorizations and that EYLEA HD will remain subject to a miscellaneous J-code. However, in late January, we achieved another important launch milestone with CMS' assignment of a permanent J-code for EYLEA HD, that will go into effect on April 1. This will provide additional reimbursement confidence for those physicians hesitant to prescribe before a permanent J-code based on their negative experiences with other new eye disease medicines. Overall, we are very excited about the future of our Retinal franchise."", 'We continued to see physicians prescribe EYLEA HD in both treatment-experienced and treatment-naive settings as EYLEA HD is increasingly recognized as the new standard of care. Now to Dupixent, fourth quarter 2023 global net sales grew 31% on a constant-currency basis to $3.2 billion and US net sales grew 28% to $2.5 billion with more than 800,000 patients on therapy worldwide, Dupixent is one of the most important biologic medicines for patients across a spectrum of diseases. Additionally, it continues to have significant growth potential based on new and upcoming indications. In U.S., Dupixent leads new-to-brand prescription share across all five approved indications, an important leading indicator for future growth. In addition, Dupixent already leads total prescription share in four or five approved indications and we are approaching share leadership in biologic asthma.', ""In atopic dermatitis, Dupixent's largest Indication, physicians continue to prescribe Dupixent as the therapy of choice. Despite increased competition over the course of 2023, fourth quarter Dupixent new-to-brand prescription share in AD modestly increased sequentially compared to the third quarter 2023, driven by its differentiated mechanism of action, clinical results and trusted safety profile, including approval in patients as young as six months of age Dupixent's U.S. label was recently updated with efficacy and safety data for patients with moderate-to-severe hand or foot atopic dermatitis. Dupixent is the only biologic medicine data in the label supporting use for the subset of patients with this hard-to-treat disease. Beyond atopic dermatitis, growth also continues in asthma and nasal polyps, both of which are already blockbuster indications."", ""The recent launches for eosinophilic esophagitis noticed EoE and prurigo nodularis further contributed to Dupixent's performance and represent indications of significant growth potential. In EoE, which prior to Dupixent's approval had no FDA-approved treatments. Nearly 25,000 patients in the US alone have already initiated therapy on Dupixent. The FDA's recent approval of Dupixent in pediatric EoE extends this indication to patients as young as one year of age where approximately 20,000 children in the U.S. being treated for EoE with unapproved therapies. Patient initiations also continue to accelerate in prurigo nodularis solidifying Dupixent as the standard-of-care for multiple dermatologic conditions. In summary, Dupixent is delivering on its potential as one of the most important biologic medicines of our generation was significant remaining opportunity for growth."", ""We anticipate bringing Dupixent to many more patients this year across approved indications. The pediatric EoE launch is already underway and we are actively preparing to launch Dupixent in eosinophilic COPD pending potential FDA approval later this year. And finally to Libtayo, fourth quarter global net sales grew 43% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis to $244 million with U.S. net sales of $155 million, Libtayo continues to lead the category in non-melanoma skin cancers and we've made progress in penetrating the non-small cell lung cancer market In 2024, we expect continued growth across all indications, advancing our goal to exceed $1 billion in annual Libtayo net sales. In conclusion, 2024 provides the opportunity to further build Regeneron's market-leading positions with our medicines across even more therapeutic areas."", 'Now, I will turn the call over to Bob.', ""Bob Landry: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron ended 2023 with strong performance in the fourth quarter. Excluding contributions from Ronapreve, total revenues increased 14% year-over-year to $3.4 billion, primarily driven by sales growth and margin expansion from Dupixent, the launch of EYLEA HD and strong sales growth from Libtayo. Fourth-quarter diluted net income per share was $11.86 on net income of $1.4 billion. Moving to collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Fourth quarter 2023 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $890 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $377 million, of which $345 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue grew 19% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $993 million."", ""Excluding a $50 million sales milestone recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022, Sanofi collaboration revenue grew 26%. Our share of collaboration profits was $886 million, an increase of 43% versus the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by Dupixent's continued volume growth and improving margins. Reimbursements from manufacturing of commercial supply, a component of Sanofi collaboration revenues declined 36% versus the prior year due to the implementation of a new higher-yielding manufacturing process. At the end of 2023, the Sanofi development balance was $2.33 billion reflecting a net decrease of $534 million, compared to the balance as of December 31, 2022. Recall, this decrease is primarily recorded as a reduction to our share of collaboration profits."", 'We continue to expect this balance to be fully reimbursed in the next few years, which would result in a significant step-up in our Sanofi collaboration profits. Other revenue was $213 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, up 66% versus the prior year, primarily driven by higher royalties from Novartis on sales of Ilaris and an increase in our share of ARCALYST profit from Kiniksa. The increase in other revenue also reflects higher reimbursements for increased shipment volumes of ex-U.S. commercial supplies of Praluent to Sanofi. Moving now to our operating expenses. Fourth quarter 2023 R&D expense grew 13% year-over-year to $1.03 billion, which reflects continued investment in our growing pipeline. R&D growth was primarily driven by higher headcount and related costs, funding of our advancing late-stage programs and increased clinical manufacturing activity.', 'SG&A grew 7% from the prior year to $622 million in the fourth quarter reflecting higher headcount and related costs and higher commercialization expenses, including costs to support the launch of EYLEA HD in pre-launch activities for anticipated 2024 hem-onc product launches. Fourth quarter COCM declined 12% from the prior year quarter to $210 million. Recall that we are reimbursed for these costs. Now to cash flow in the balance sheet. In 2023, Regeneron generated $3.9 billion in free cash flow ending the year with cash and marketable securities, less debt of approximately $13.5 billion. In 2023, we repurchased over $2.2 billion of our shares with approximately $1.5 billion remaining authorized for repurchase as of December 31, 2023. Since we began repurchasing our shares in 2019, we have bought back approximately $12 billion worth and plan to continue to make opportunistic repurchases.', 'Now moving to our financial guidance for 2024. Note that these guidance ranges do not assume the completion of any business development transactions that were not completed as of today, including our recently announced agreement to acquire preclinical and clinical programs from 2seventy Bio. Starting with R&D expense in 2024, which is anticipated to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion, as George just discussed and as we highlighted at the J.P. Morgan Conference, our pipeline continues to expand with a growing number of registration-enabling studies ongoing or expected to initiate this year. These include potentially pivotal studies for Fianlimab, Phase 3 studies in earlier lines of odronextamab and linvoseltamab in our C5 programs.', 'In addition, we expect to bring 8 to 10 new molecules into the clinic in 2024. We expect 2024 SG&A spending to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.65 billion. This reflects increased promotional activities for the ongoing launch of EYLEA HD, investments to support two anticipated hem-onc product launches and higher headcount to support our growing organization inclusive of our ongoing international expansion. COCM is expected to be in the range of $850 million to $910 million. This range reflects lower drug substance manufacturing cost for Dupixent, offset by higher Dupixent volumes and higher production costs for other collaboration products including EYLEA HD for Bayer. Recall, we are reimbursed for COCM expenses, and as a result, we expect reimbursement from Sanofi, which are recorded as a component of Sanofi collaboration revenue to be slightly lower in 2024, as compared to 2023.', 'We expect the 2024 gross margin on-net product sales to be in the range of 89% to 91%. We also expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 10% to 12%. Finally, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $825 million to $950 million, which reflects the expansion of our R&D facilities at our Tarrytown, New York headquarters as well as the continued expansion of our manufacturing capabilities, including ongoing construction of our fill-finish facility in Rensselaer, New York. In addition to our full-year guidance, we expect U.S. net product sales of Praluent to be lower in 2024, as compared to 2023 due to changes in payer coverage. We also expect 2024 net product sales for Inmazeb to be in line with 2023 revenues with nearly all 2024 revenues expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter.', ""Finally, we anticipate other revenue in 2024 to be in line with 2023, with the second half expected to be higher than our first half. Overall, Regeneron performed well in 2023 and our continued investments position the company to drive long-term shareholder value. Before I conclude, I'd like to sincerely thank Len and George for their kind words. It has been an honor to serve as Regeneron's CFO for these past 10-years and I have appreciated all of my interactions with each of you in the investment community. I wish Chris Fenimore much success in this role and have the utmost confidence that he and the rest of the management team will continue to deliver breakthrough medicines for patients and value to shareholders. Thank you and I wish you all continued success."", 'With that, I will pass the call back to Ryan.', 'Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Bob, and congratulations again. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A. To ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer one question from each caller before moving to the next.

Once our call ends, Bob, Chris and the IR team will be available to answer any further questions.With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer. Len?"", 'Leonard S. Schleifer', ""Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone joining today's call. Fourth quarter 2023 capped another strong year for Regeneron and Bob will walk you through our financial results. For my remarks today, I'd like to briefly look back at 2023 and then discuss what's to come in the year ahead.2023 was another remarkable year for Regeneron, highlighted by several significant achievements that better position the company to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value. At the start of the year, we identified 5 key strategic imperatives. First, obtaining FDA approval and successfully launching EYLEA HD. We did encounter a minor delay when we received the complete response letter in late June due to an issue at a third-party filler but this was quickly remedied and EYLEA HD was granted approval in mid-August.With what we believe to be a best-in-class potential clinical profile, EYLEA HD is poised to become the new standard of care for patients with wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic eye diseases. The launch is off to a great start, which Marion will discuss in a few minutes.Second, we had to defend our intellectual property related to EYLEA. We presented our best case and prevailed in the District Court, which found that one of EYLEA's formulation patents was both valid and infringed by a biosimilar aflibercept manufacturer. This favorable decision may have broad implications and could result in a delay to biosimilar aflibercept launches.Third, we and our collaborator, Sanofi, needed to continue driving Dupixent growth not only by further penetrating previously approved indications by also reaching even more patients suffering from other diseases driven by Type 2 inflammation. In 2023, we did both. Dupixent global net product sales grew by 34% on a constant currency basis to $11.6 billion. Dupixent led in new-to-brand prescription share in the United States across all 5 of its approved indications.We also had a major breakthrough in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. In March, we reported strong data from the BOREAS study, which enrolled COPD patients with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe disease and evidence of type 2 inflammation. The FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation during the summer but required additional evidence of efficacy to support a regulatory filing. Based on this feedback, we and Sanofi decided to conduct an interim analysis on the replicate NOTUS study, which read out similarly compelling results, enabling our December sBLA submission and a potential U.S. launch for this indication as early as mid-2024.Fourth, we continued making progress toward our long-term goal of becoming a global leader in oncology. 2023 was highlighted by our regulatory submissions for linvoseltamab, our BCMA by CD3 bispecific in myeloma, and odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific in lymphoma, while continuing to advance other opportunities in solid tumors.And finally, we needed to advance our early-stage pipeline. And over the course of 2023, we presented intriguing proof of mechanism or proof-of-concept data across hematology and genetic medicines as well as other areas, including obesity with data from non-human primates. Many of these early programs, which George will run through in a few minutes, represent first or best-in-class opportunities that we believe can drive long-term growth for Regeneron.Accomplishments in 2023 have put us in a position of strength entering 2024. For this year, one of our strategic imperatives is to continue driving commercial execution, especially the ongoing launch of EYLEA HD, with the goal of accelerating the pace of conversion from other anti-VEGF agents.Another important launch milestone was achieved last month when the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services assigned a permanent J-Code for EYLEA HD that will go into effect on April 1, 2024, at which point a potential reimbursement concern for physicians will be removed. We also need to continue to drive Dupixent growth in its currently improved indications as well as from the potential FDA approval and launch in COPD with an eosinophilic phenotype. If approved, Dupixent would represent the first meaningful advance in over a decade for the 300,000 patients in the United States suffering from this form of COPD and would be the first ever biologic approved for COPD.In oncology this year, aside from continuing to build on the success of Libtayo in non-melanoma skin cancers and non-small cell lung cancer, we are excited about the potential launches of odronextamab and linvoseltamab, the latter of which has the potential to be the best-in-class bispecific for myeloma.We also expect to make significant advances across our pipeline in 2024, with key readouts for fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody in combination with Libtayo in metastatic melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Libtayo in adjuvant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and our Factor XI antibodies in thrombosis, which may inform pivotal studies.We also plan to initiate clinical trials in obesity, geographic atrophy, hemophilia B and severe food allergies, in addition to expanding early studies of our CD28 co-stimulatory bispecific programs in solid and hematologic malignancies.In closing, we had a strong 2023 and are poised to deliver in 2024 and beyond. Our pipeline of over 30 clinical programs is delivering important and differentiated innovations. Our commercial team is executing well. And we continue to look at ways to efficiently deploy capital to drive shareholder returns over time.Before I hand it over to George, I want to take a moment to thank Bob Landry for his many contributions to Regeneron over his 10 years as our Chief Financial Officer. In addition to helping fortify Regeneron's financial strength and discipline, Bob has been an incredible mentor to many of Regeneron's current and future leaders, helped drive our financial results over the past decade, and worked tirelessly to ensure we have the resources needed to help improve the lives of patients around the world. Bob, on behalf of the entire Regeneron family, thank you, and we wish you continued good health and happiness.As we first announced back in September upon Bob's retirement next week, Chris Fenimore will become the CFO of Regeneron. We all look forward to working closely with Chris in his new role knowing he brings a similar rigor and depth of financial knowledge that will ensure continuity and collaboration across the organization.With that, I'll now turn the call over to George."", 'George D. Yancopoulos', ""Thanks, Len. That was really an impressive overview, I have to say.2023 was another year of firsts delivered by Regeneron, as well as together with our collaborators, all of which have the potential to change the practice of medicine. Starting with inflammation and immunology. As you heard from Len, we are planning yet another launch for Dupixent, this time in eosinophilic COPD, which would represent the sixth disease that this remarkable medicine is approved to treat, and the fifth for which it would be first in class. Dupixent's transformative potential in COPD is based on the unprecedented results from our first Phase III trial, BOREAS, which were then confirmed by our second Phase III trial notice, demonstrating that Dupixent treated patients had a 34% reduction in the annualized rate of moderate, severe COPD exacerbations. (technical difficulty) IL-33 blocking antibody, the pivotal AERIFY-I and II studies passed an interim futility analysis last year. The studies are now on track to complete enrollment in 2024 with an anticipated readout in 2025. If the Phase III results from these studies even approach the Phase II data reported in former smokers, where a 42% reduction in annualized exacerbation rate was observed, itepekimab has the potential to further transform the treatment paradigm for COPD.Later this year, we are planning on testing an innovative new treatment approach for severe food allergies using a combination of transient BCMAxCD3 bispecific intervention in patients receiving Dupixent therapy. As many of you know, allergic responses are driven by pathologically high levels of the immunoglobulin E or IgE. This is why many say the E in IgE stands for evil. About 40 years ago, it was discovered that interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 were the switch factors required for switching to IgE production.Based on exciting preclinical data, including in nonhuman primates, as well as human data, our innovative approach has the potential to reverse severe allergies by, first, eliminating the long-lived plasma cells that serve as an IgE reservoir with the BCMAxCD3, followed by blocking of de novo immunoglobin class switching to IgE with the Dupixent.We are looking forward to starting a small proof-of-concept study, which will inform next steps for this program. We believe this approach has the potential to benefit the millions of people suffering from severe allergies who are at constant risk, as tragically highlighted just last week by the widely reported death of yet another young person unknowingly exposed to a food allergen. Moving to oncology. Libtayo is the leading PD-1 antibody for non-melanoma skin cancers, including metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC, and basal cell carcinoma. We are looking forward to potentially expanding the currently approved CSCC indication to include adjuvant CSCC. And we expect results from potentially pivotal interim analysis in this setting in the second half of the year. Regarding Libtayo combinations, our most advanced is the combination with our LAG-3 antibody, fanlimab. As a reminder, our early clinical data in 3 separate first-line metastatic melanoma cohorts demonstrated potential for best-in-class efficacy when compared cross trial with the approved anti-LAG-3 PD-1 combination product, highlighted by objective response rates greater than 60% and estimated median progression-free survival of longer than 15 months. These early clinical data suggested that the Libtayo fanlimab combination may be one of the most exciting examples of a checkpoint inhibitor combination with clinically meaningful benefit and with the safety profile that is similar to that seen with anti-PD-1 monotherapy. We are expecting a potentially pivotal initial readout from our first-line metastatic melanoma trial by the end of this year. We also anticipate Phase II data in non-small cell lung cancer in late 2024. On to bispecifics, starting with solid tumors. In the dose escalation trial of our EGFR by CD28 costimulatory bispecifics combined with Libtayo, we have observed promising activity in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer with higher doses of (inaudible). In terms of safety, so far, we have not seen an increase in immune-related adverse events with (inaudible). Based on these encouraging early data, which will be presented at a scientific forum later this year, we will be initiating expansion cohorts across several solid tumors in the first half of the year. In 2024, we are also planning to provide updates for our MUC16xCD3 and MUC16xCD28 program in advanced ovarian cancer. Next, our bispecific for hematology oncology. For linvoseltamab, or BCMAxCD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma, FDA acceptance of our BLA submission is expected later this month. And the EMA recently accepted our MAA submission. These submissions were supported by a potentially best-in-class profile in late-line myeloma in terms of efficacy, safety, dosing, as well as convenience. A confirmatory Phase III study as well as studies in earlier stages of myeloma and premalignant disease are enrolling or will soon begin enrolling patients. For odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the FDA decision for our BLA is expected by its March 31 PDUFA date, and the EU decision is expected in the second half of the year. In terms of additional recent news for our oncology and immunology pipeline, this week, we announced the formation of Regeneron cell medicines unit, and that we are acquiring full development and commercialization rights for 2seventy bio's pipeline of investigational immune cell therapies.We have worked with 2seventy since 2018 on many of these programs and are excited about the opportunity to continue advancing our collective efforts. After deal closing, certain 2seventy employees will join Regeneron cell medicines and continue to work on addressing cancer and other serious diseases in novel ways, including by combining Regeneron's antibody capabilities with CAR-T therapies.Moving from immunology and oncology to obesity and metabolic diseases. Despite all the enthusiasm surrounding GLP-1 agonist for obesity, it has been increasingly recognized that the profound weight loss is accompanied by substantial muscle loss, accounting for up to as much as 40% of the weight loss. This potentially irretrievable muscle loss can be catastrophic for patients and may even lead to major public health concerns in the future. We have previously shown that our antibodies targeting myostatin and Activin A have the potential to preserve and grow muscle in human trials. Based on these data as well as additional data in obese nonhuman primates, we believe that inhibiting these pathways on top of GLP-1 receptor agonism, has the potential to achieve comparable overall reductions in body weight but with improved quality of the weight loss, resulting in more fat loss while preserving or actually increasing muscle mass. In mid-2024, we plan to start our first clinical trial to evaluate the combination of our muscle preservation antibodies in combination with semaglutide. Also in 2024, we are anticipating proof-of-concept data for a Factor XI antibodies in the setting of prevention of venous thromboembolism after knee replacement surgery. Based on preclinical and healthy volunteer data, our antibody approach demonstrated more complete Factor XI blockade compared to competing approaches in development for coagulation disorders. And the program is on a rapid path to a registrational trial starting late this year or early next year.We'll now conclude with our efforts in genetic medicines. Our siRNA collaboration with Alnylam has demonstrated successful silencing of genes in the liver and for the first time for siRNA, in the brain. Proof of principle was achieved for ALN-APP last year and we are anticipating additional data from that program this year, including from patients who have received multiple doses. Based on the success, we are looking forward to new siRNA programs targeting CNS diseases entering the clinic this year, such as ALN-SOD for ALS patients with SOD1 mutations. Our collaboration with Intellia on CRISPR gene editing continues to advance, where we together produced the first example of CRISPR-based gene editing of a pathological gene in human beings. This initial program for our lead indication of TTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy is now in the first in vivo CRISPR program clear to enter Phase III studies in the United States.Together with Intellia, we also hope to be the first to use CRISPR technology to insert a corrective gene for deficiency disease. We recently achieved IND clearance for our CRISPR-based gene insertion program for Factor IX and initiated the lead-in portion of a clinical trial to evaluate it as a potential cure for hemophilia B. Moving to genetic hearing loss. We were the first U.S.-based company to announce hearing restoration in a young child suffering from genetic hearing loss after treatment with our novel gene therapy approach. We are excited by these early results for this ultra-rare disease and look forward to advancing to the clinic additional programs potentially address more common forms of monogenic hearing loss. These data represent validation of our viral-based gene therapy program, in this case, locally delivered to the cells of the inner ear. Beyond these efforts, we have made significant investments in leveraging our monoclonal and bispecific antibody expertise to use these agents to systematically deliver virally based genetic-based payloads directly to specific tissues in the body non-amenable to local delivery, such as to muscle and the central nervous system. Based on encouraging preclinical data, we will be progressing these approaches to the clinic in the coming years. Finally, concluding with another notable first-in-class program involving a combination of an siRNA with an antibody, in this case to block the C5 complement target. Normally, one needs very high levels of infuse the antibody to achieve sufficient efficacy because of high target levels regarding C5. But our siRNA cotreatment dramatically lowers C5 target burden, allowing lower and more convenient antibody dosing. We recently shared encouraging initial data from a Phase III study in patients with PNH, which supported our hypothesis that this combination approach could provide better efficacy and control of breakthrough hemolysis with more convenient dosing. Based and building on these data, we continue to enroll our Phase III studies in PNH and myasthenia gravis. We're also planning to extend this combination approach to geographic atrophy and dry AMD. While this combination is expected to have manageable systemic toxicities, including elevated risk of infections, we believe that our approach has several potential advantages over recently approved complement inhibiting agents for GA, which are delivered directly into the eye and have resulted in rare but serious cases of retinal vasculitis, sometimes resulting in permanently impaired vision. In conclusion, Regeneron's R&D engine continues to grow and deliver many firsts, including differentiated early, mid- and late-stage opportunities. And we are looking forward to additional progress in 2024. Before I turn the call over to Marion, I would like to add my thanks and appreciation to Bob for his many years of devoted efforts and leaderships, and welcoming and look forward to adding Chris Fenimore to our leadership team.With that, I will turn it over to Marion."", 'Marion E. McCourt', ""Thanks, George. Our business delivered strong results in the fourth quarter and for the year. Over the course of 2023, we successfully launched EYLEA HD, grew Dupixent across approved type 2 inflammatory diseases and expanded Libtayo's presence in lung and non-melanoma skin cancers. We look forward to several potential approvals this year in new therapeutic categories, including in COPD with Dupixent and a hematologic oncology using new treatment modalities. I'll start with our retinal franchise. In January, we announced fourth quarter combined U.S. EYLEA HD and EYLEA net product sales of $1.46 billion. In its first full quarter, EYLEA HD net product sales were $123 million, based on growing demand and positive early physician experience. EYLEA HD is already being used across a broad range of patient types, including those switching from EYLEA, other branded agents or Avastin, as well as modest but increasing use in treatment-naive patients. In the fourth quarter, EYLEA HD and EYLEA together secured 49% of the anti-VEGF category share, despite increasing competition and changing market dynamics. This share gain was driven by the differentiated efficacy and safety profile of our medicines as well as a short-term disruption in compounded Avastin due to a quality issue at a large supplier that has since been resolved. Since launch, we have made significant progress in securing access and reimbursement for EYLEA HD. More than 2/3 of eligible lives are now covered, with the vast majority having first line or single step edit access. Medicare fee-for-service, which represents approximately 45% of total category use, claims are being paid across 100% of jurisdictions using a miscellaneous J-Code. Looking ahead in 2024, we remind you that the first quarter is typically impacted by payer reauthorizations and that EYLEA HD will remain subject to a miscellaneous J-Code. However, in late January, we achieved another important launch milestone with CMS's assignment of a permanent J-Code for EYLEA HD that will go into effect on April 1. This will provide additional reimbursement confidence for those physicians hesitant to prescribe before a permanent J-Code based on their negative experiences with other new eye disease medicines. Overall, we are very excited about the future of our retinal franchise. We continue to see physicians prescribe EYLEA HD in both treatment experienced and treatment-naive settings as EYLEA HD is increasingly recognized as the new standard of care. Now to Dupixent, where fourth quarter 2023 global net sales grew 31% on a constant currency basis to $3.2 billion and U.S. net sales grew 28% to $2.5 billion. With more than 800,000 patients on therapy worldwide, Dupixent is one of the most important biologic medicines for patients across the spectrum of diseases. Additionally, it continues to have significant growth potential based on new and upcoming indications. In the U.S., Dupixent leads new-to-brand prescription share across all 5 approved indications, an important leading indicator for future growth. In addition, Dupixent already leads total prescription share in 4 or 5 approved indications and we are approaching share leadership in biologic asthma. In atopic dermatitis, Dupixent's largest indication, physicians continue to prescribe Dupixent as a therapy of choice. Despite increased competition over the course of 2023, fourth quarter Dupixent new-to-brand prescription share in AD modestly increased sequentially compared to the third quarter 2023, driven by its differentiated mechanism of action, clinical results and trusted safety profile, including approval in patients as young as 6 months of age. Dupixent's U.S. label was recently updated with efficacy and safety data for patients with moderate to severe hand or foot atopic dermatitis. Dupixent is the only biologic medicine with data in the label supporting use for this subset of patients with this hard-to-treat disease. Beyond atopic dermatitis, growth also continues in asthma and nasal polyps, both of which are already blockbuster indications. The recent launches for eosinophilic esophagitis, known as EoE, and prurigo nodularis further contributed to Dupixent's performance and represent indications of significant growth potential. In EoE, which prior to Dupixent's approval had no FDA-approved treatments, nearly 25,000 patients in the U.S. alone have already initiated therapy on Dupixent. The FDA's recent approval of Dupixent in pediatric EOE extends this indication to patients as young as 1 year of age, where approximately 20,000 children in the U.S. being treated for EoE with unapproved therapies. Patient initiations also continue to accelerate in prurigo nodularis, solidifying Dupixent as the standard of care for multiple dermatologic conditions.In summary, Dupixent is delivering on its potential as one of the most important biologic medicines of our generation with significant remaining opportunity for growth. We anticipate bringing Dupixent to many more patients this year across approved indications. The pediatric EoE launch is already underway, and we are actively preparing to launch Dupixent in eosinophilic COPD pending potential FDA approval later this year. And finally, to Libtayo. Fourth quarter global net sales grew 43% year-over-year on a constant currency basis to $244 million, with U.S. net sales of $155 million. Libtayo continues to lead the category in non-melanoma skin cancers, and we've made progress in penetrating the non-small cell lung cancer market. In 2024, we expect continued growth across all indications, advancing our goal to exceed $1 billion in annual Libtayo net sales. In conclusion, 2024 provides the opportunity to further build Regeneron's market-leading positions with our medicines across even more therapeutic areas.Now I'll turn the call over to Bob."", 'Robert E. Landry', ""Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron ended 2023 with strong performance in the fourth quarter. Excluding contributions from Ronapreve, total revenues increased 14% year-over-year to $3.4 billion, primarily driven by sales growth and margin expansion from Dupixent the launch of EYLEA HD and strong sales growth from Libtayo. Fourth quarter diluted net income per share was $11.86 on net income of $1.4 billion. Moving to collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Fourth quarter 2023 ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $890 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $377 million, of which $345 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue grew 19% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $993 million. Excluding a $50 million sales milestone recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022, Sanofi collaboration revenue grew 26%. Our share of collaboration profits was $886 million, an increase of 43% versus the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by Dupixent's continued volume growth and improving margins. Reimbursements for manufacturing of commercial supply, a component of Sanofi collaboration revenues, declined 36% versus the prior year due to the implementation of a new higher-yielding manufacturing process. At the end of 2023, the Sanofi development balance was $2.33 billion, reflecting a net decrease of $534 million compared to the balance as of December 31, 2022. Recall, this decrease is primarily recorded as a reduction to our share of collaboration profits. We continue to expect this balance to be fully reimbursed in the next few years, which would result in a significant step-up in our Sanofi collaboration profits. Other revenue was $213 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, up 66% versus the prior year, primarily driven by higher royalties from Novartis on sales of ILARIS and an increase in our share of [Arcelis] profit from (inaudible). The increase in other revenue also reflects higher reimbursements for increased shipment volumes of ex-U.S. commercial supplies of Praluent to Sanofi.Moving now to our operating expenses. Fourth quarter 2023 R&D expense grew 13% year-over-year to $1.03 billion, which reflects continued investment in our growing pipeline. R&D growth was primarily driven by higher headcount and related costs, funding of our advancing late-stage programs and increased clinical manufacturing activity. SG&A grew 7% from the prior year to $622 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher headcount and related costs and higher commercialization expenses, including costs to support the launch of EYLEA HD in prelaunch activities for an anticipated 2024 hem/onc product launches. Fourth quarter COCM declined 12% from the prior year quarter to $210 million. Recall that we are reimbursed for these costs. Now to cash flow and the balance sheet. In 2023, Regeneron generated $3.9 billion in free cash flow, ending the year with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $13.5 billion. In 2023, we repurchased over $2.2 billion of our shares with approximately $1.5 billion remaining authorized for repurchase as of December 31, 2023. Since we began repurchasing our shares in 2019, we have bought back approximately $12 billion worth and planning to continue to make opportunistic repurchases. Now moving to our financial guidance for 2024. Note that these guidance ranges do not assume the completion of any business development transactions that were not completed as of today, including our recently announced agreement to acquire preclinical and clinical programs from 2seventy bio. Starting with R&D expense in 2024, which is anticipated to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion. As George just discussed and as we highlighted at the JPMorgan Conference, our pipeline continues to expand, with a growing number of registration-enabling studies ongoing are expected to initiate this year. These include potentially pivotal studies for fianlimab, Phase III studies in earlier lines of odronextamab and linvoseltamab in our C5 programs.In addition, we expect to bring 8 to 10 new molecules into the clinic in 2024. We expect 2024 SG&A spend to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.65 billion. This reflects increased promotional activities for the ongoing launch of EYLEA HD investments to support 2 anticipated hem/onc product launches and higher headcount to support our growing organization inclusive of our ongoing international expansion. COCM is expected to be in the range of $850 million to $910 million. This range reflects lower drug substance manufacturing costs for Dupixent, offset by higher Dupixent volumes, and higher production costs for other collaboration products, including EYLEA HD for Bayer. Recall, we are reimbursed for COCM expenses and, as a result, we expect reimbursement from Sanofi, which are recorded as a component of Sanofi collaboration revenue, to be slightly lower in 2024 as compared to 2023. We expect the 2024 gross margin on net product sales to be in the range of 89% to 91%. We also expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 10% to 12%. Finally, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $825 million to $950 million, which reflects expansion of our R&D facilities at our Tarrytown, New York headquarters, as well as continued expansion of our manufacturing capabilities, including ongoing construction of a fill/finish facility in Rensselaer, New York. In addition to our full year guidance, we expect U.S. net product sales of Praluent to be lower in 2024 as compared to 2023 due to changes in payer coverage. We also expect 2024 net product sales for Inmazeb to be in line with 2023 revenues with nearly all 2024 revenues expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter. Finally, we anticipate other revenue in 2024 to be in line with 2023, with the second half expected to be higher than our first half. Overall, Regeneron performed well in 2023 and our continued investments position the company to drive long-term shareholder value. Before I conclude, I'd like to sincerely thank Len and George for their kind words. It has been an honor to serve as Regeneron's CFO for these past 10 years, and I have appreciated all of my interactions with each of you in the investment community. I wish Chris Fenimore much success in this role and have the utmost confidence that he and the rest of the management team will continue to deliver breakthrough medicines for patients and value to shareholders. Thank you, and I wish you all continued success. With that, I will pass the call back to Ryan."", 'Ryan Crowe', 'Thank you, Bob, and congratulations again. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A. To ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer 1 question from each caller before moving to the next.Shannon, can we go to the first question, please?', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with TD Cowen.', 'Tyler Martin Van Buren', ""Great. And I'd like to say congratulations to you as well, Bob. I wish you well during your retirement. It's been a privilege to work with you. And Chris, I look forward to working with you as well. So in the opening, Len mentioned accelerating the rate of conversion of patients from other agents to EYLEA HD. So can you discuss the different factors at play that will accelerate the rate over the year, which I assume includes a permanent J-Code and also the robust sampling effort that is impacting 2 mg sales?"", 'Marion E. McCourt', ""Sure, Tyler. I'm happy to answer. So as I mentioned, we're very encouraged by the early performance of EYLEA HD in the market, and a number of factors early are driving that success. First, it's the clinical data, which is now showing in the actual market real-world setting the efficacy, safety and durability of EYLEA HD, all very important factors. As we look to the future, physicians will build upon their early experience. And as I mentioned, that experience is coming from conversion patients from branded agents broadly, Avastin, and also, in some cases, naive patients. But going forward, I would share that, in addition to ongoing experience and confidence, the reimbursement consideration is very, very important for physicians, and some are hesitant to prescribe a product that doesn't have a permanent J-Code. So we do look forward to that occurring April 1 and beyond based on CMS's recent update. And then in addition to reimbursement confidence, we've made progress certainly in payer coverage. We anticipate making more. And certainly, the experience in market to date with EYLEA HD has been very favorable for physicians. And that is, probably, the most important, those differentiating characteristics of the product."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Brian Corey Abrahams', ""Congrats to both Bob and Chris. I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about the differentiation of the emerging obesity portfolio as you move into the next wave of studies. I know a patent filing revealed that the antibody tethered GLP-1 shows very competitive weight loss in animal models. So I'm wondering where you see that differentiating most? Is it tolerability and distribution or dose frequency or somewhere else? And then I know others are pursuing myostatin as well on top of GLP-1s. Just curious where you see your biggest competitive advantage there."", 'George D. Yancopoulos', ""Okay. Well, let me start with the latter first, in terms of muscle preservation. Other people have related approaches, but we're the only ones, we're the ones who discovered that there are 2 key ligands or growth factors that control muscle size: myostatin, myostatin 1, we call it, and Myostatin 2 or Activin A. And we're the only ones that have specific blocking antibodies for those 2. And we are testing them together and individually. And the reason why that's important is it's going to be a combination of both efficacy and safety that matters here. So we're going to see which approach does the best in terms of the muscle preservation in the face of the profound muscle loss that you can see with GLP-1 agonist treatment. But we're also going to see the safety profiles. And I think that, that's going to be so critical because safety is so important here. Other people are just testing one of these agents alone. I believe, the myostatin and others are testing very broad approaches such as trying to block the receptors for these factors. The problem with the receptor blockade approach is that the receptors that are used by these factors are also used by over a dozen other ligands that have very diverse biologic functions. And you can easily imagine that by blocking so many diverse functions, you might end up having all sorts of safety issues which you're not going to want to be able to be dealing with in the setting of a treatment that's intended to optimize obesity and body weight loss and give benefit to the patients. So our programs are very different in that we discovered the 2 key regulators, The 2 key growth factors. We have separate antibodies blocking them both. And we're evaluating them separately and together in the setting of GLP-1 receptor agonist, to see what gives us the best benefit vis-a-vis muscle preservation as well as safety profile. While we're doing that, as we said, we're initiating those trials this year, we are also developing unimolecular solutions. So whichever approach works best, we hope to have the possibility of having a tethered GLP-1, as you put it, associated with the right set of antibody molecules. So they will have the advantage of having a unimolecular solution that can provide all-in-one benefit in terms of providing, hopefully, the best convenience profile and potentially once-a-month dosing, together with providing not only the weight loss, the profound weight loss that one is seen with GLP-1 receptor agonist, but now complemented by providing muscle preservation but with the safest possible approach. So we think that we have the most unique program in terms of addressing all these possibilities. And we're very, very excited about these programs."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.', 'Mohit Bansal', ""Thank you, Bob, for all your help over the years. Maybe one question for Marion. Can you just comment on the trends in the anti-VEGF market, underlying trends? I mean, is the market growing or you are growing fast, as fast as it's been in the past, or is it slowing down a little bit? And in that context, how do you see the outlook for high dose EYLEA plus EYLEA going forward, with the underlying demand out there?"", 'Marion E. McCourt', 'Sure, Mohit. So there is variation between quarters and years as it relates to anti-VEGF category growth. Overall, though, the category is healthy from a growth standpoint, unfortunately, based on the number of individuals with diabetes or diagnosed with diabetes. On a brighter note, aging population is good. So overall, we see it as healthy category growth. But there is variability. And as an example, there has been some decline by a couple of points between last year and this year overall.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Raymond with Piper Sandler.', 'Christopher Joseph Raymond', ""Maybe just another EYLEA question. I know you guys don't want to get sort of too granular on your pricing strategy, but we've been struck that, even with the 2-milligram format revenue contracting in the last couple of quarters, our checks show that it's really not a market share issue. In fact, share of that format remains up around an all-time high. So one would think that, that's been price erosion that's been driving that. Just understand this may be a strategy to maximize the HD launch, in broad stroke, can you talk about what we should be expecting in 2024? Do you expect further price erosion for that 2-milligram format? Or have things sort of leveled off?"", 'Leonard S. Schleifer', ""Yes. I'm not sure we want Marion to get into the details of our strategies, pricing, rebates, things like that. But we can say, Marion, you could add thoughts, that we view it as a very competitive marketplace. There has been some price erosion on some of the products in the marketplace. We're starting at a new point with EYLEA HD. We think we priced it well. It was received well. It was intended to match on a yearly basis. And so we think the actual price point was fine. I don't know if Marion wants to add anything at all but we don't like to comment specifically on those competitive dynamics."", 'Marion E. McCourt', 'Yes. Chris, really nothing in everyone to add to that.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow with UBS.', 'Colin Nigel Bristow', ""And all the best in the future, Bob. Maybe a couple more on the muscle sparing myostatin program. I'm curious, George, what are your thoughts around the potential concerns of myostatin targeting, increases or preserves muscle volume but the muscle is less functional. And then any thoughts on the regulatory pathway that you would utilize for these muscle-sparing assets?"", 'George D. Yancopoulos', ""Regulatory. Okay. So first of all, we've done extensive work in preclinical models. And these antibodies have already been in humans. We believe that our studies are actually showing that this muscle is functional and certainly very important from both the metabolic and energy expenditure point of view. So, so far, those studies are very supportive of this whole approach. I should also say there's a variety of regulatory pathways that we're pursuing here. Obviously, the easiest, which would come from the possible results that we're seeing in the animal studies, is if there's incrementally more weight loss, that might suffice as a regulatory strategy. Alternatively, if it's just the quality of the white loss, then we would have to show functional outcomes in terms of strength and so forth and so on. So those are still early in the thinking. We have to see from these initial studies. But as I said, if we simply see increased weight loss, that would be the simplest way forward. And then you have more weight loss but better body composition data, and may also -- may be better metabolic benefits, which we also see in muscle, which could also provide additional pass-through approval. So it depends on those results that we're going to get from the initial studies. I should also mention, in terms of additional programs that we have, obesity. I mean, these are things that are here and now that we're doing these clinical trials and we hope to be getting results over the course of the next year, 1.5 years that could really inform in terms of all these questions that you have and really validate that there's real promise here. But remember, we're doing a lot of other things as well in obesity that are in earlier stages. So for example, as you probably know, we discovered a brand-new promising target in obesity using our Regeneron Genetics Center, the largest big data set on the planet in terms of human sequence linked to electronic health records, and identified, in some ways, one of the most exciting new targets in obesity that's been ever discovered. And we have a variety, it's called GPR75, it was published in a prominent paper in Science about a year or so ago. And we have a variety of promising and not-that-far-away approaches from the clinic in terms of blocking this target for weight loss. And I think that we presented at JPMorgan early preclinical data using siRNA approaches that look very exciting. I should also mention that, in terms of smaller programs and so forth, we have things like a very exciting leptin receptor-activating antibody that have had very promising human data as well. So there's a lot of things going on but I think the muscle preservation program and how it goes forward is going to be very interesting to look at over the next year, 1.5 years."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Evan David Seigerman', ""I have one final question for Bob. So Bob, you've done an outstanding job managing the financials of the business and helping drive shareholder returns over the past decade. Looking ahead, how do you believe Regeneron can best use its rapidly growing cash balance to further drive investor returns in the next decade of Regeneron? And thanks for everything, Bob."", 'Robert E. Landry', ""Evan, thanks for the question, and thanks for the video that we were able to show at my retirement party. It was great. On that question, George just laid out earlier today, we have so many opportunities with regards to our kind of research and development. And again, I mean I'm going to hand the mantle over to Chris but his #1 priority within capital allocation is to make sure that, that is kind of fully funded. Len and George do a great job with regards to making sure what we're bringing into the clinic as opportunities, and they're going to continue to do that, and there's just a lot coming, particularly when I said kind of 8 to 10 INDs.Proud on buybacks. Maybe I've kind of circled the victory too much on that with regards to how much we bought back and at what price. But we have a good methodology here that Chris is ingrained with, and he'll continue to do that. And with regards to business development, I mean, just because we can doesn't mean we're going to force something. It has to be right, it has to be a franchise, has to be modalities. You've heard George mention that has to be kind of incremental to what we currently have in the clinic here with regards to RGC and the targets we develop, and all of that. So we will remain prudent on that. Continue to be proud of the free cash flow that we're generating. And I trust that Chris, George, Len and the Board will optimize it and put it to great use."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs.', 'Salveen Jaswal Richter', ""And Bob, you truly will be missed, and enjoy the next stage of life here. With regard to your GA program, can you outline what's contributing to your confidence in the systemic approach here, and what data you've seen to support it given the move from animal models to Phase III?"", 'George D. Yancopoulos', ""Okay, geographic atrophy. So basically, the excitement is that, as we show data from our combination approach, we believe that we have the most effective way of blocking the body's C5 activity. The C5, which is active in the eye, is essentially all coming from the liver. And we've shown now in our PNH studies, when we revealed the data from the first portion of our Phase III program, that it looked like we had the best-in-class activity in terms of decreasing the C5 activity. So if you block it at the source, then you don't have to block it in the eye. And if you block it at the source, then you don't suffer from all the concerns and side effects and so forth that you have from having to block it in the eye. So you block it where it's coming from, then you don't have to treat local in the eye. You can avoid the local side effects. The concern with systemic blockade is it comes with increased risks of infections and so forth. So we will have to come up with a strategy, which we're working on, to try to mitigate that in the elderly population that suffers from GA. We believe that we may need for that an approach to identify the patients who might be at risk in those settings. Because we certainly know that, for example, patients with PNH and myasthenia gravis who are immunosuppressed and so forth, not only with our agent but certainly with this whole class of agents, can suffer from serious systemic infections when you block C5. So we are coming up with a way to mitigate that, in part by probably selecting out the patients who are at the highest risk. But in terms of efficacy, the fact that you block it at the source should make it much more effective than trying to block it indirectly in the eye while avoiding all of the serious local side affects you can get in the eye, including this horrific retinal vasculitis, which is associated with sudden and permanent blindness."", 'Ryan Crowe', 'Thanks, George. I think we have time for 2 more questions.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Leerink Partners.', 'David Reed Risinger', ""Yes. And first, I wanted to offer my congrats as well and best wishes to you, both Bob and Chris. So I have a commercial question on linvoseltamab, please. It's clearly generated best-in-class results and a more attractive profile for patients. But Regeneron has to displace the incumbents. So could you discuss your plans to convert prescribers to linvoseltamab?"", 'Marion E. McCourt', ""Thank you, David. I'm anxious to answer but Len will, of course, go first."", 'Leonard S. Schleifer', ""No, I just wanted to give a little history, David. You actually [ramp]. You may even have asked the exact question, I'm not sure, when we were launching EYLEA and we had to displace Lucentis by the behemoth Roche. There are some lessons in there that it can be done with starting with a really good molecule, as you described, one that is potentially be best-in-class and then strong execution at the commercial front. We've done it. We're not afraid of the 800-pound gorilla. We hope to put that gorilla on perhaps a weight loss program and get in there and show them what we can do.Marion, any comments? I just want to put that historical perspective out there."", 'Marion E. McCourt', ""Thank you, David, for the question. And I'm going to be a bit redundant, so I'll be short. But my comment was to say it always starts with the best-in-class molecule. It's about the science. And certainly, you've seen us across therapeutic areas launch into competitive categories, both in the anti-VEGF category and then, more recently, bringing great products into the marketplace. So we do look forward to this opportunity. And it fits quite beautifully with our oncology team, our onc will be onc/hem team. And certainly, we will be very ready for that launch and look forward to helping patients with linvo."", 'Ryan Crowe', 'Okay. Thanks, Len and Marion. Shannon, last question, please.', 'Operator', 'Our last question comes from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays.', 'Carter Lewis Gould', ""I'll echo all the prior comments about Bob, and best of luck. Maybe just on the 2seventy deal, Len and George. How should we think about this? Was this more about sort of protecting the rights of the assets that you already kind of partnered on or really around sort of getting access to that manufacturing facility? And does that have implications then as we think about your business development going forward and maybe change kind of your willingness to move further down that path of cellular therapies?"", 'Leonard S. Schleifer', ""I'll let George comment on the scientific rationale, which drives pretty much everything we do. Just to mention from a business development point of view, we have been a long-standing partner with 2seventy when they were still part of bluebird. We've invested in them, both in equity and, frankly, in development. So this was something that was well known.George can comment how we see this fitting in?"", 'George D. Yancopoulos', ""Yes. We're excited about the existing programs. But what we're even more excited about is as we know that the history of many diseases but cancer in particular, is about combination approaches. And thus far, even in the setting of this collaboration, the CAR-T space has been separate from the biologics space. And even though we were working together as separate companies, it was a little harder to really move forward in an expedited fashion. The incredible opportunities that I believe that we have to combine what we think is the largest and most exciting portfolio of biologics in immunotherapy, together with cell therapy approaches. Nobody else has really tried that. Nobody else has really led that. Now that we're really together all in with our new selected colleagues from 2seventy and their capabilities, we believe that we will now have the first opportunity to really try this new set of combination approaches against cancer. That is, combining our large portfolio of biologics in the immunotherapy space with their cell therapy capabilities and expertise, that brings a whole new level of combinations to the immunotherapy field. We believe we will be alone in that capability until somebody else tries to copy us and do what we're doing here. And that's what we're really excited about, in addition to just moving forward the existing cell therapy programs that we've been working on them for 5 years or more."", 'Ryan Crowe', 'All right. Thanks, Len and George, and thanks to everyone who dialed-in today for your interest in Regeneron. We apologize to those remaining in the queue that we did not have a chance to hear from. As always, the Investor Relations team here at Regeneron is available to answer any remaining questions you may have.

For the full-year 2023, we delivered strong revenue growth of 7% in our base business and delivered on our earnings commitment as we transitioned away from COVID testing. The results we announced this morning reflect a strong fourth quarter and full year for our base business, in which we made substantial progress on our strategy to drive top-line growth across our core customer channels and improve profitability. Throughout the year, we advanced our growth strategy with innovative testing solutions, new and expanded relationships with health systems and a robust pipeline of M&A and professional lab services opportunities. We also delivered double-digit revenue growth in several clinical areas, including advanced cardiometabolic, prenatal and hereditary genetics and neurology.', ""We also strengthened our oncology offering with a strategic investment in higher growth, minimal residual disease testing. In addition, our efforts to improve quality and productivity delivered our invigorate goal, which helped us to offset the cost headwinds we faced throughout the year. This morning, we issued guidance for 2024 that reflects a return to overall revenue growth, while balancing the earnings tailwinds and headwinds we see for the year. Looking beyond 2024, we are well-positioned to deliver our long-term financial outlook to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit earnings growth. I'm grateful to our dedicated Quest colleagues for making this happen. Every day, they bring our purpose to life, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time."", ""Before discussing highlights from 2023, I'd like to share some recent regulatory updates. First, as you know, Congress once again delayed Medicare reimbursement cuts and the next data collection process under PAMA that were scheduled to take place in 2024. While we are pleased with the delay, we continue to work closely with our trade association to seek a permanent fix to PAMA through SALSA, the saving access to Laboratory Services Act. ACLA's highest priority this year is to secure passage of SALSA. Second, ACLA and nearly 7,000 other individuals and groups submitted comments last quarter on a rule proposed by the FDA to regulate laboratory developed tests as medical devices. Lab-developed tests are essential medical innovations that are already highly regulated under federal legislation known as CLIA."", ""In addition to the oversight by states, accredited bodies and Medicare as it makes coverage determinations. If enacted, the FDA's proposed rule would compromise patient access to a central lab testing. It would also slow diagnostic innovation and add unnecessary health care costs. We agree with ACLA that the FDA does not have the statutory authority to unilaterally regulate LDTs and believe that resuming discussions with the FDA, Congress, ACLA and other stakeholders on a legislative solution is the most prudent path forward. Now I'll recap our strategy and discuss highlights from the fourth quarter. Then Sam will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our financial guidance for 2024. Our strategy to drive growth is focused on delivering solutions that meet the evolving needs of our core customers: physicians, hospitals and consumers."", 'We enable growth across our customer channels through advanced diagnostics with an intense focus on faster-growing clinical areas, including molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions are a key growth driver with an emphasis on accretive hospital outreach purchases as well as smaller independent labs. Our strategy also includes driving operational improvements across the business with strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, efficiency, workforce experience and service. Here are some updates on the progress we have made in these areas in the fourth quarter. In Physician Lab Services, we delivered mid-single-digit base business revenue growth. We attribute this growth to return to care, overall market growth and share gains driven by the competitive strengths of our scale and innovative offerings.', 'We continue to execute hospital outreach and independent lab acquisitions, which generate volume for our physician channel. In January, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire select assets of Lenco, an independent New York-based laboratory company and expect to complete the transaction later this quarter. In addition, we acquired outreach assets of Steward Health Care, which will deepen our reach to patients in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Ohio. As we said earlier, our acquisition pipeline is very strong, and we expect to complete additional transactions in 2024. Our strong relationships with health plans were also a key driver of growth in 2023 as we grew revenues from health plans by high single-digits versus the prior year.', ""As we've indicated, we successfully completed negotiations for all our strategic health plan renewals that were scheduled in 2023. Health plans and self-insured employer clients recognize the clinical and economic value we deliver to them and their members. To date, more than half of health plan revenues now come from value-based contracts, which enable faster growth compared to our traditional health plan contracts. In addition, working with health plans, we continue to reduce so-called lab leakage to high-cost out-of-network labs, partly by redirecting the volume to Quest. Importantly, this is good for both patients as well as employers, which pay for the majority of health care costs. In hospital lab services, we drove high single-digit base business revenue growth in the fourth quarter with strength in both reference and professional laboratory services."", ""Hospital reference testing, in particular, grew much faster than historical trends and well above our estimated growth for the market. Increasingly, health systems recognize that our innovative laboratory testing and collaborative lab management solutions can help them improve quality, productivity, affordability and care. They also continue to face labor and cost pressures prompting more of them to reach out to us to help with their lab strategy. Our professional lab services help manage a hospital's lab, supply chain and workforce. We also provide insights from our analytical solutions to help hospitals manage utilization to deliver the right test to the right patient at the right time. In the fourth quarter, we completed two PLS relationships that will contribute modest growth in the first quarter of this year."", 'We also provide health systems the opportunity to transition their non-core outreach laboratory assets to us through acquisitions. By selling their outreach assets to Quest, these hospitals are better able to redeploy scarce capital to areas of their business that have a greater impact on patient care. Our consumer-initiated testing service, questhealth.com, generated revenues of approximately $45 million in the full year 2023, with strong base business growth. Our return on ad spend and customer acquisition costs remained favorable in the fourth quarter. Another element of our CIT strategy is to drive revenue growth through channel partners. In 2023, we generated more than $30 million through this channel. We are also excited about new product releases in 2024, including blood testing for PFAS or forever chemicals via questhealth.com.', ""PFAS chemicals have been used in industrial and consumer products for decades and may contaminate food and water. In late January, the CDC issued new guidelines that recognize the value of PFAS blood testing for individuals that may have elevated exposure levels, which may increase risk of kidney cancer, eye cholesterol and other health conditions. According to a study in the Journal of Endocrine Society, PFAS chemicals accounted for approximately $22 billion in U.S. health care costs in 2018. In Advanced diagnostics, we experienced double-digit growth across several clinical areas in the fourth quarter, including advanced cardiometabolic, prenatal and hereditary genetics and neurology. Growth in neurology was driven largely by our Alzheimer's disease portfolio of tests, which is among the most comprehensive in the fast-evolving field of Alzheimer's care."", ""Our innovations include our AV detect blood test for early risk assessment based on amyloid beta proteins and Apo lead genetic risk. This week, we also added P-Tau181 to our AV detect blood test line to complement insights from amyloid beta testing. In addition, our Alzheimer's disease test portfolio includes several CSF tests for diagnosis and monitoring based on amyloid beta, P-Tau181 and Apo lead. We intend to add additional biomarkers later this year and continue to expand our menu. In molecular genomics and oncology, we are on track to launch our Haystack minimal residual disease test to physicians later this year from our Oncology Center of Excellence in Lewisville, Texas. We also believe Haystack MRD can help support clinical research and recently announced clinical trial collaborations using this innovative technology with the Rutgers Cancer Institute, Alliance Foundation trials in TriSalus Life Sciences."", ""In the fourth quarter, we announced a collaboration with Universal DX, which has developed an innovative blood test for screening for colorectal cancer, including precancerous lesions. We look forward to supporting Universal's effort to gain regulatory approval for this test. Through our collaboration with Scipher, we are expanding patient access to the PRISM-RA test for aiding treatment selection for rheumatoid arthritis. Turning to operational excellence. Our Invigorate program delivered our targeted 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements. Here are three examples of how we're improving operations. First, we continue to make progress in using front-end automation to enhance specimen processing. In 2023, we completed front-end automation upgrades in our Pittsburgh and Dallas laboratories, which will improve quality and productivity."", ""This year, we'll add five additional sites. Second, we also expanded the use of AI to improve quality, efficiency and workforce experience in several clinical areas. AI can quickly identify patterns that signify possible disease and digital images of patient cultures and slides. In 2023, we expanded the use of AI in microbiology to help identify bacteria as well as in cytogenetics to identify chromosomal abnormalities. Looking forward, we are encouraged by the opportunities to use AI in several additional clinical areas including cytology, pathology and parasitology. Third, in 2023, we deployed an AI tool at our Clifton lab that helps laboratory staff continuously identify ways to be more productive in their daily routines. And we look forward to introducing this AI job helper in other labs and support processes."", ""Finally, we made significant progress improving the margins of our base business in 2023. I'd like to personally thank our Quest colleagues whose efforts have helped make this possible. With that, I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our 2024 guidance. Sam?"", 'Sam Samad: Thanks, Jim. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.29 billion, down 1.9% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 4.7% to $2.25 billion. While COVID-19 testing revenues declined approximately 80% to $37 million. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 2% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the fourth quarter of 2022, partially offset by strong growth in our base testing revenue. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.9% versus the fourth quarter of 2022, with acquisitions contributing 50 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 5.2% versus the prior year. Revenue per requisition declined 3.5% versus the prior year driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume.', 'Base business revenue per rec was up 0.2%. Unit price reimbursement was positive and consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the fourth quarter was $267 million or 11.7% of revenues compared to $135 million or 5.8% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $338 million or 14.8% of revenues compared to $330 million or 14.2% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating income is related primarily to growth in the base business, actions taken in 2023 to reduce support costs and lower performance-based compensation, partially offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenues, wage increases, higher employee health care costs and higher deferred compensation expense. Reported EPS was $1.70 in the quarter compared to $0.87 a year ago.', 'Adjusted EPS was $2.15 compared to $1.98 last year. Cash from operations was $1.27 billion for full-year 2023 versus $1.72 billion in the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 testing revenue. Finally, our Board of Directors has authorized a 5.6% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.71 to $0.75 per share or $3 per share annually effective with the dividend payable in April 2024. The company has raised its dividend annually since 2011. Turning to our full-year 2024 guidance. Revenues are expected to be between $9.35 billion and $9.45 billion. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.69 to $7.99 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.60 to $8.90. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $420 million.', 'We have posted a presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website that includes an adjusted earnings bridge, which shows some of the key elements to bridge from our 2023 adjusted EPS to the 2024 adjusted EPS guidance we shared today. Our 2024 guidance reflects the following consideration. We are no longer providing detailed base business and COVID revenue guidance. However, note that we are assuming that COVID revenues will decline at least $175 million in 2024, which will partially offset the growth we expect from the base business. Most of the COVID headwind in 2024 will occur during the first quarter as we generated $119 million of COVID revenue in Q1 last year. In terms of M&A, our guidance only contemplates acquisitions that have been announced or closed to date, including the outreach acquisitions from NewYork-Presbyterian and Stewart Health Care, as well as Lenco, the independent lab Jim mentioned earlier.', ""We will absorb the full year of dilution from our acquisition of Haystack Oncology with an increment impact of approximately $0.20 to adjusted EPS in 2024. We made strong progress improving our base business operating margins in 2023 and expect margin expansion in 2024. We anticipate net interest expense to increase to approximately $190 million in 2024 as a result of higher borrowings following our debt issuance in November. We assume a roughly flat share count compared to the end of 2023. We are expecting adjusted EPS in Q1 to be roughly 21% of our full year earnings. This is slightly below the typical seasonality and reflects the significant amount of weather disruption we've experienced in January. At this point, we anticipate a weather headwind of $0.05 to $0.07 in Q1."", ""And finally, as Jim mentioned earlier, we are well-positioned to deliver our long-term financial outlook to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit earnings growth. With that, I'll now turn it back to Jim."", ""Jim Davis: Thanks, Sam. Finally, I'd like to take a moment to remember Dr. Paul A. Brown, who passed away in January of this year. In 1967, Dr. Brown founded MetPath, the predecessor company of Quest Diagnostics, providing basic lab services from his apartment in New York City. Dr. Brown was a pioneer who invented the blueprint for our industry that today is recognized as essential to quality health care, and we are grateful for his vision and leadership. To summarize, we delivered strong base business revenue growth in 2023 and achieved our EPS commitments. Our guidance in 2024 reflects a return to total revenue growth while balancing the earnings tailwinds and headwinds we see for the year. Looking beyond 2024, we are well positioned to deliver our long-term financial outlook to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit earnings growth."", ""And I'm grateful to our dedicated Quest colleagues who bring our purpose to life every single day, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. Now we'd be happy to take your questions.

If you want to skip our discussion on the emigration trends, you can go directly to the 5 Cheap Safe English Speaking Countries For Americans.', 'According to estimates from the US Department of State, approximately 9 million Americans may be living overseas. This is more than double the estimated figure of 4.1 million Americans residing in foreign countries in 1999. Moreover, a poll by Gallup revealed that 15% of US citizens wanted to move abroad permanently as of 2021. Various factors drive Americans to consider relocation to foreign countries. A survey conducted by Preply revealed that 59% of respondents cited concerns about gun violence as a significant motivation for considering moving abroad. Meanwhile, approximately a quarter of Generation Z Americans stated that they want to relocate for improved social programs such as healthcare. For 19% of participants, seeking a new cultural experience was the main reason for settling in a foreign country. Moreover, 18% identified the high cost of living in the United States as a key factor influencing their decision to move, while 17% attributed their desire to relocate to the political environment in the US. The increase in interest in traveling or moving abroad has also coincided with national events, according to Where Can I Live, a UK-based firm that helps people relocate. The firm saw a 72% increase in traffic from the US to its website after Roe vs. Wade was overturned, a 64% increase after Joe Biden’s Election win, and a 26% increase after the Uvalde shooting in Texas.', 'Retirees from the US are also contributing to the trend of settling abroad. According to the Social Security Administration, about 750,000 Americans get their retirement benefits transferred to overseas bank accounts. The US State Department estimates that 5 million overseas Americans are retirees, which makes up 12% of the 45 million retirees overall. One of the reasons for US citizens to search for cheap safe English-speaking countries to live in is the rising cost of living within the US. The consumer price index for the 12 months ending December 2023 rose by 3.4%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Furthermore, a New York-based insurance firm estimates that Americans can expect to live 25 years beyond the retirement age of 65 and will require a substantial sum of $987,000 to cover post-retirement expenses. Thus, it is no wonder that 4 in 10 workers and 3 in 10 retirees press a lack of confidence in their ability to keep up with inflation during retirement, according to findings from a Retirement Confidence Survey.', 'In addition to this, Medicare does not cover dental work or long-term care, which can cost about $54,000 to $106,000 a year for retirees. Due to the rising out-of-pocket expenses and cost of long-term care, the market for long-term care insurance is expanding. The market size for long-term care private insurance reached $14.37 billion in 2022, and the CAGR is expected to be 5.84% between 2023 and 2030. Some of the well-reputed long term care insurance companies heading into 2024 include Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP), Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC), and\xa0The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL).
