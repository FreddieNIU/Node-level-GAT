Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. But Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 59% over five years, which is below the market return. However, if you include the dividends then the return is market beating. The last year has been disappointing, with the stock price down 13% in that time."", ""Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments ', 'While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.', 'Over half a decade, Texas Instruments managed to grow its earnings per share at 10% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 10% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.', 'You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).', ""This free interactive report on Texas Instruments' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further."", ""When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Texas Instruments the TSR over the last 5 years was 83%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!"", ""Investors in Texas Instruments had a tough year, with a total loss of 11% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 16%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 13% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Texas Instruments (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing here."", 'If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.', 'Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.', 'Have feedback on this article?

The ability to consistently increase dividends is seen as a sign of financial strength and stability, indicating that the company is generating enough cash flow to reward shareholders while still reinvesting in its business. Historically, dividend growers have shown a tendency to outperform the broader market over certain periods. According to a report by Abrdn PLC, for the past two decades, companies that started paying dividends or regularly increased them did better than the overall global index.

By now, you should know that the Detroit Lions play every Thanksgiving and are currently in first place in the NFC North. Maybe the last shall become first after all. If you have ever felt the urge to pull for an underdog, why not a team that has never been to the Super Bowl? Never mind the same is true of the Browns, Jaguars and Texans. The Silver and Blue have their best record since the Kennedy administration which really should be a much bigger story than who may be attending a Chiefs game, a team that wins so much it puts viewers to sleep. I know some of the Lions’ wins barely materialized, after home crowd booing, and at the expense of subpar teams like the Bears, but a win is a win. Last week when traveling, I actually saw two people decked out in Lions gear. That is two more than I’ve ever seen at airports before and shows there are, in fact, other Lions fans out there. I bet there are dozens of us, maybe even one or two The Stockout subscribers. And anyone who accuses me of being a bandwagon jumper should be prepared to receive a picture of my Barry Sanders jersey and/or my Starter jacket as evidence of my longtime misery, I mean fandom.', 'Big-box retailers’ concerning October', 'Target shares (blue) have greatly underperformed Walmart (black), but that gap partially closed in recent days following their respective third-quarter earnings reports. (Chart: Barchart.com Inc.)', 'There has been plenty of mixed data on the health of the consumer, suggesting that consumers are on either solid or poor footing, depending on which track a particular set of consumers are on. For example, overall spending levels are still strong, but auto delinquencies are up and credit card balances are hitting record highs. Last week, Walmart and Target reported their fiscal third-quarter earnings, and there were several cautious comments regarding consumer spending. Walmart experienced unexpected sales weakness in the back half of October, and management said it had become more cautious on consumer spending than it had been 90 days earlier. However, November sales have appeared more normal to the largest retailer, and it believes unusual weather patterns may have played a role in the tepid October. Apparently, the only thing that stops Americans from buying is cold or inclement weather.', 'Meanwhile, in Target’s earnings last week, it also highlighted continued sales weakness, although I have a hard time separating what Target’s results say about the state of the consumer versus the heavy overlap between Target’s and Amazon’s customer base. Target highlighted overall same-store sales are still tracking down mid-single digits. In the discretionary categories, it has now seen seven consecutive quarters of declines in both units and sales. Comparable sales in the discretionary categories have deteriorated from year-over-year declines in the high-single digits to the low-double digits. Overall, consumer caution may be related to a loosening in the labor markets — last week Walmart said it was overstaffed and Home Depot said it is no longer having issues with attrition.', 'For more detail, see Monday’s The Stockout show here.', 'Big-box retailers report disinflation in some categories, deflation in others', '(SONAR: CPI.ALL, PPI.ALLCOM)', 'Aside from cautionary comments on consumer spending, and evidence of loosening labor markets, highlighted in the section above, the other major takeaways from retail earnings last week were related to more widespread disinflation or deflation, depending on category.', 'Walmart has seen the price level of the goods it is buying from suppliers come down broadly, with particular deflation in fresh foods as well as the broad, and typically discretionary, general merchandise category, which is showing mid-single-digit deflation. The prices of fresh and unprocessed foods are largely a pass-through of underlying commodities. Meanwhile, price levels for dry grocery and consumable items, which includes packaged food and most CPG items, have been slower to deflate. CPG companies attribute that to rising costs outside of underlying ingredients, such as for packaging and manufacturing. Walmart’s comments last week suggest that CPG price levels can only defy gravity for so long — the largest retailer expects prices in the dry and consumable categories to deflate in the coming weeks and months. That comment suggests that the retailer has already adjusted prices with many CPG suppliers for upcoming contractual periods.', 'Rail intermodal is a growth area again', 'The latest domestic intermodal volume data contained in SONAR, illustrated below via the ORAILDOML.USA ticker which limits the data to loaded 53-foot containers, suggests that not only was there a mini-peak in mid-to-late October, but volume also continues to track nicely above 2020 and 2021 levels in November.', 'Specifically, quarter-to-date loaded domestic volume is up 4.5%, year over year, including November volume that is up a similar 4.7% y/y.

For the third quarter, we delivered revenue of $3.3 billion, earnings per share of $0.41 and adjusted earnings per share of $0.25. Our teams executed against our priorities, adapted quickly to shifting sales trends and delivered year-over-year profit growth despite lower sales in a challenging macroeconomic environment. We managed our inventory well as evidenced by the positive sales-to-inventory spread, while leaning into pockets of demand. As we enter the holiday season, our teams have worked hard to deliver the right assortment and engaging experiences for our customers. In the third quarter, we continued to make progress on our three priorities improving Nordstrom Rack performance, increasing inventory productivity, and optimizing our supply chain."", 'We will continue to focus on these areas in the quarters ahead in order to drive growth, profitability, and an improved customer experience. Based on our year-to-date results, we remain confident in our outlook and expect to deliver full-year results within our updated guidance range. Turning now to our priorities. Our brand purpose is to help our customers feel good and look their best. At Nordstrom Rack, we know what works and believe in our strategy, delivering great brands at great prices, expanding our reach and convenience with new Rack stores in key markets and driving greater engagement and profitability at nordstromrack.com. Throughout the quarter, our teams stayed focused on our assortment and moved quickly to meet shifting demand, providing a compelling flow of new and relevant products for our customers.', 'In the third quarter, we continued to grow the most desirable brands which had over 300 basis points higher sell-through than other brands in our Rack assortment and feel good about our offering as we head into holiday. We also know that our Rack customers value convenience, and we believe our stores are underpenetrated. We opened 11 new Rack stores during the third quarter and one early in the fourth quarter, bringing the full-year total to 19 new stores. We saw strong customer response at each opening and have received positive feedback from customers. Rack stores continue to be a great investment for us, delivering returns well in excess of their cost of capital, with a short payback period. They also continue to be our largest source of new customer acquisition.', ""The scale of our digital off-price business is differentiated and unique, allowing us to serve our customers via omnichannel offerings in a way that other off-price retailers do not. And, while we still have work to do on our digital offering for the Rack, we're making progress as we've reworked the business model to ensure sustained profitability. The Rack digital channel is now profitable on a year-to-date basis, and we expect it to continue to be profitable for the full year. This digital channel plays an important role for the Rack in serving customers across stores and digital. Turning to our next priority. Increasing inventory productivity is critical in providing our customers with a consistent flow of the most relevant merchandise, when and where they want it."", ""Total inventory was down 9% in the third quarter and resulted in a positive sales-to-inventory spread. This lower level of inventory required fewer markdowns than last year and helped to drive expansion in our gross margin by 180 basis points in the third quarter. We're also pleased with the traction that our Nordstrom private brands are gaining. As a retailer of the best brands in the world, we believe our own brands will play a critical role in our overall mix as they have higher margins and lower return rates. Additionally, our investments in RFID technology continued to deliver improvements enhancing the integrity of our inventory by providing improved stock accuracy and creating operational efficiencies across our stores and supply chain."", ""Thanks to the hard work of our teams all year long, our overall inventory position is healthy heading into the holiday season. We also continued to make good progress on our third priority of optimizing our supply chain capabilities. Following four consecutive quarters of reductions in variable supply chain costs of more than 100 basis points, we were able to drive another 50 basis point reduction in the third quarter. Looking ahead, the absolute level of cost savings will stabilize as we've now been focused on this priority for over a year. However we'll continue to seek out additional efficiencies in flow and improved productivity through inventory management initiatives. Our efforts to improve our supply chain have also contributed to increased productivity in store fulfillment for online orders at the Nordstrom banner, and better inventory positioning and flow across the company."", ""Q3 marked our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in click to deliver times. We've been able to improve click to deliver times by nearly 20% over the last couple of years. All of this translates into a better experience for our customers and cost savings for us through faster delivery, lower cancellation rates, and increased accuracy of inventory. During the quarter we announced some key leadership changes and welcomed a new member to our Board of Directors. Jamie Nordstrom was appointed Chief Merchandising Officer. Jamie has worked across nearly every aspect of our business and has held broad-based leadership roles, including in merchandising, store operations, and across our digital channels. Fanya Chandler was named President, Nordstrom Stores."", 'She has held several leadership positions, most recently serving as Senior Vice President and Regional Manager of the Southwest region. Gemma Lionello was appointed to the role of President, Nordstrom Rack. She has served in numerous executive positions including in both merchandising and stores, and she spent 11 years working within our Nordstrom Rack business. And, Lisa Price re-joined Nordstrom as Chief Human Resources Officer. Having most recently served as CHRO of a large US consumer company, Lisa understands that the success of our business starts with our people. All four have proven track records of leading successful teams while maintaining a relentless focus on our customers, and we look forward to what they will accomplish in their new roles.', ""We also welcomed Guy Persaud to our Board of Directors. Guy is a Senior Leader at Proctor & Gamble. In closing, we are well-positioned for the holiday season as we navigate near-term macroeconomic headwinds, while continuing to advance our long-term strategic priorities, and remain focused on improving the customer experience. Before I hand it over to Pete, I'd like to recognize the teams throughout our company that have been instrumental in driving our progress this year, despite a challenging environment across the retail landscape. Their focus on and passion for our customer is what makes our success possible. With that, I'll turn it over to Pete."", ""Pete Nordstrom: Thanks, Erik, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll focus my remarks on our category performance and inventory position and provide some highlights of actions we are taking to drive holiday sales. Starting with category performance. The majority of our categories improved sequentially from the second quarter in terms of year-over-year trends, with Active, Beauty, and Accessories leading. Active sales growth was led by footwear, driven by New Balance, Hoka, and On Running, and in apparel, Vuori. Beauty was strong at both banners as well, driven by designer brands and fragrance. Beauty has been a consistently solid performing category for us and continues to be a top trip driver. This quarter, the introduction of a new Beauty 5x points promotion for our Nordy Club loyalty program members supported category growth in stores and online."", ""In anticipation of holiday, our in-stock rates at Nordstrom are above last year's levels, and we have a strong gift selection in Beauty. The Accessories category also posted positive growth in the quarter, led by sales at the Rack, where handbags as well as jewelry and watches were strong. As Erik mentioned, we are gaining traction with our Nordstrom private brands, which are more profitable with lower return rates, which suggests strong content at a good value. Consistent with trends all year, Designer remains pressured, primarily in shoes and handbags, and we continued to right-size our inventory to meet that demand. Looking ahead, we expect to end the year with an improved inventory position in this category. Heading into holiday, we're optimistic and pleased that our offering strikes the right balance of newness and relevance that our customers want."", ""We've launched a number of efforts to drive sales and create memorable experiences. From a merchandise perspective, we're offering more newness than we had at this time last year. And we're investing in hot brands and products. For example, we've stepped up our investment in a holiday favourite, UGG, and we've leaned into beauty gifts sets, cashmere sweaters, and affordable stocking stuffers. We've also teamed up with Disney to celebrate its 100th anniversary. Not only are we offering Disney merchandise from over 80 brands, we're also hosting events and immersive in-store experiences to celebrate. The Disney merchandise is featured in 25 Nordstrom stores and is also available online. We're taking a differentiated approach to connecting with our customers this holiday season."", ""Based on customer feedback, we're providing new ways for customers to discover gifts for everyone on their list, including more than 20 inspirational gifting guides and curated gift categories. We're also leveraging our data and analytics to show more relevant and personalized content on Nordstrom.com and in our app, based on shopping behavior, to further our key differentiator and that is serving customers. We've also positioned the Rack as a holiday destination, and we're prepared to welcome customers with an enhanced assortment. We're excited that our teams took a sharp focus around gifting to enhance the customer experience. Ahead of the holiday season, we've announced actions designed to not only drive sales in-store and online, but to also improve the customer experience."", ""We're expanding free two-day shipping to all Nordstrom.com customers in our top markets, as we know that customers will be more likely to make additional purchases and remain a Nordstrom customer if they're confident their purchases will arrive quickly. And, given the success that we've already seen with our new loyalty beauty promotion, we will continue to offer it throughout the holiday season. Looking ahead, we are excited to serve our customers this holiday season and into '24. Our teams have worked hard all year to provide a curated and diverse assortment of brands and products that balances relevance and inspiration. We've made meaningful improvements to the customer experience that will help our customers shop seamlessly across both of our banners both in stores and online."", ""By doing this work, we're fulfilling our brand promise to help our customers feel good and look their best. And with that, I'll hand it over to Cathy to discuss our financial results."", ""Cathy Smith: Thanks, Pete. I'll start with our third quarter results, and then discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. For the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.41, compared to a loss of $0.13 per share in the year-ago quarter. After excluding a favorable true-up related to the wind-down of our Canadian operations, third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.25. Last year's adjusted earnings per share was $0.20 after excluding an asset impairment charge. We are pleased with the year-over-year gross margin and EPS increase, despite lower net sales. Net sales and gross merchandise value, or GMV, both decreased 7% in Q3. Net sales included a negative impact of 270 basis points from the wind-down of Canadian operations."", ""It also reflects a positive impact of approximately 200 basis points from the timing shift of the Anniversary Sale, with about one week falling into the third quarter this year. Excluding the impact of these two items, net sales would have been down about 6% versus last year. Nordstrom banner sales and GMV decreased 9% and 10% respectively versus last year. The wind-down of Canadian operations had a negative impact on Nordstrom banner net sales of 410 basis points, and the Anniversary timing shift had a positive impact of approximately 300 basis points. Nordstrom Rack sales decreased 2%. The decision to eliminate store fulfillment of Rack digital orders starting in the third quarter of 2022 had a negative impact to this year's Q3 sales of approximately 100 basis points, and we've now lapped that change."", 'As Erik said, new Rack stores continue to be a bright spot. New Rack stores performed well during the quarter. Digital sales decreased 11% in the third quarter. This includes an approximately 100 basis point negative impact from eliminating store fulfillment of Rack digital orders last year and an approximately 400 basis point positive impact from the Anniversary timing shift. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 180 basis points, primarily due to lower markdowns, increased inventory productivity, and lower buying and occupancy costs, partially offset by deleverage on lower sales. Ending inventory decreased 9% versus last year, compared to a 7% decrease in sales. As Pete said, we are continuing to work through some aged Designer inventory.', ""However, we're pleased with our overall inventory position as we enter the holiday season. Looking ahead, we expect to continue to benefit from improved inventory management routines and disciplines while meeting customer demand. Reported SG&A as a percentage of net sales of 36.3% declined five basis points versus Q3 2022. Compared to adjusted SG&A in the year-ago quarter, SG&A increased 200 basis points primarily due to deleverage from lower sales and higher labor costs, partially offset by improvements in variable costs from supply chain efficiency initiatives. Adjusted SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, of 34.3% in the third quarter last year excluded an impairment charge. We have been pleased with the results that our supply chain initiatives have delivered over the last year."", ""As Erik mentioned, following four consecutive quarters in which we were able to deliver over 100 basis points of savings each quarter, we were able to drive another 50 basis point reduction in variable supply chain costs in the third quarter. EBIT margin was 3.2% for the third quarter. After excluding the $25 million favorable true-up related to the wind-down of Canadian operations in this year's third quarter and the impairment charge in the third quarter a year ago, adjusted EBIT margin improved 25 basis points to 2.4%, despite lower sales leverage this quarter. We continue to maintain a solid balance sheet and financial position, ending the third quarter with $375 million in cash as well as the full $800 million available on our revolving line of credit."", ""Turning to our outlook for the rest of the year, I'll start by discussing the current environment and related assumptions underlying our guidance. Regardless of external impacts, we expect to make continued progress on our key priorities, which will help drive sales, improve our profitability and mitigate inflationary cost pressures. We continue to see a cautious consumer and it remains to be seen how changes in inflation, higher interest rates, and the resumption of student loan repayments will affect discretionary consumer spending during the holiday season. Considering these factors, and the consistent execution all year long, we are maintaining our full-year revenue guide and narrowing our EPS guidance range. I'll highlight a few factors that shape our outlook for the rest of the year, starting with revenue."", 'We continue to expect full-year revenue to decline 4% to 6% versus 2022. This outlook includes an approximately 2.5 percentage point negative impact from the wind-down of our Canadian operations, which delivered sales of approximately $400 million in 2022. It also includes an approximately 1.3 percentage point positive impact from the 53rd week in fiscal 2023, which we expect will add approximately $200 million in sales to the fourth quarter. Year-to-date credit card revenues have increased 9% versus last year, primarily as a result of our credit card partner agreement. This improvement has come despite credit card losses, which have risen at a slower pace than expected. As we mentioned last quarter, we have seen delinquencies rise gradually and they are now above pre-pandemic levels.', 'However, delinquencies remain below industry levels, and are contemplated in our guidance. Turning to EBIT, we now expect adjusted EBIT margin of 3.8% to 4.1% for the full year, versus 3.3% in 2022. Our forecast assumes that adjusted EBIT margin expansion would be driven primarily by gross margin improvements in the fourth quarter from our focus on inventory productivity, when compared to the elevated markdowns we took in 2022. We are updating our outlook for adjusted EPS for the full year. Our GAAP earnings per share outlook is now $0.74 to $0.94 for the full year, which includes the Canadian wind-down charges and related tax impact. Excluding the impact of these charges, we now expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.90 to $2.10 for the full year.', ""Shifting to capital allocation, our priorities remain the same. The first is investing in the business to better serve our customers and support long-term growth. We continue to plan for capital expenditures of 3% to 4% of net sales. Our second priority is reducing our leverage. We remain committed to an investment grade credit rating through a combination of earnings improvement and debt reduction and continue to target a leverage ratio below 2.5 times. Our third priority is returning cash to shareholders. Last week, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share. Our third quarter results, along with the progress we've made on our priorities of improving Nordstrom Rack, increasing inventory productivity, and optimizing our supply chain capabilities, position us well to drive profitable growth in the fourth quarter and over the longer-term."", ""We are navigating through near-term uncertainty while remaining laser-focused on delivering shareholder value over the long-term. With that, Jamie, we're ready for questions."", ""James Duies: Thank you, Cathy. Before we get started with Q&A, we ask that participants please limit themselves to one question and one follow-up. We'll now move to the Q&A session."", 'See also 14 Low PE High Dividend Stocks to Buy Now and 20 Largest Economies in Africa Ranked by PPP.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

This means the annual payment is 5.7% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry.', ' View our latest analysis for Huntington Bancshares ', ""A big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained."", ""Having distributed dividends for at least 10 years, Huntington Bancshares has a long history of paying out a part of its earnings to shareholders. Taking data from its last earnings report, calculating for the company's payout ratio shows 40%, which means that Huntington Bancshares would be able to pay its last dividend without pressure on the balance sheet."", 'Over the next 3 years, EPS is forecast to fall by 17.8%. Fortunately, analysts forecast the future payout ratio to be 49% over the same time horizon, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.', ""Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.16, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.62. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 15% over that duration. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock."", ""Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Earnings has been rising at 3.2% per annum over the last five years, which admittedly is a bit slow. Huntington Bancshares is struggling to find viable investments, so it is returning more to shareholders. This isn't bad in itself, but unless earnings growth pick up we wouldn't expect dividends to grow either."", ""Overall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Huntington Bancshares might even raise payments in the future. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term.

Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of MetLife, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.', ""Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions.

Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board.

However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.', ""Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of MetLife, Inc.. But they may have an indirect interest through a corporate structure that we haven't picked up on. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$86m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.

This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.', ""We can see that Private Companies own 16%, of the shares on issue.

While an insider sell could suggest a lack of confidence in the company's future prospects, it could also simply reflect personal financial management or diversification strategies. In the case of Akhil Jain, the insider has sold 350 shares over the past year and has not made any purchases. This one-sided activity might raise questions among investors regarding the insider's long-term commitment to the company."", ""However, it is crucial to consider the broader insider transaction history for Gartner Inc. Over the past year, there have been no insider buys but a notable 45 insider sells. This trend could indicate that insiders, as a group, are taking profits or adjusting their personal investment portfolios rather than signaling a bearish outlook on the company's future."", ""On the day of Jain's recent sell, Gartner Inc's shares were trading at $420.47, valuing the company at a market cap of $33.39 billion. The price-earnings ratio stood at 36.83, above the industry median of 26.62 but below the company's historical median.

While the company's market cap and valuation metrics suggest a strong position, the insider trading trends could be a signal for investors to consider the potential reasons behind the sells. It is important to remember that insider trading is just one piece of the puzzle when evaluating a stock's attractiveness. Investors should also consider the company's fundamentals, industry trends, and broader market conditions before making investment decisions."", ""As with any insider trading activity, it is essential to approach the information with a balanced perspective, recognizing that insiders may have various motivations for their transactions.

This performance could support a bullish case for the stock, despite the recent insider selling activity."", ""In conclusion, while the insider sell activity by Srinivas Tallapragada at Salesforce Inc is certainly noteworthy, it should be considered as part of a broader investment analysis.

Even compared to the average industry ROE of 9.9%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. However, we we're pleasantly surprised to see that News grew its net income at a significant rate of 55% in the last five years.

This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders.

And it came at the expense of AI skeptics who, by many accounts, bungled an attempt to make a principled stand for caution about the technology’s long-term risks.', 'Sam Altman A clear winner in the whole debacle is, of course, Altman himself. Unceremoniously ejected from his post on Friday, Altman quickly rallied support from the vast majority of OpenAI’s staff, who signed what was essentially a loyalty pledge underscoring the deep rift between himself and the board. His return to OpenAI, in triumph over the board that summarily fired him, reflects a kind of personal vindication that’s only likely to bolster, for better or for worse, his carefully and intentionally constructed image as a charismatic visionary who is single-handedly unlocking the secrets of the universe.', 'Microsoft Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has sought to downplay the tech giant’s part in the crisis, insisting on Monday — before Altman’s reappointment — that whatever happens with OpenAI, “nothing changes.” Microsoft’s priority, Nadella said, was to ensure uninterrupted delivery of AI technology to its own customers, whether that meant Altman being hired by Microsoft or his reinstallation at OpenAI.', 'But Microsoft is hardly a disinterested party, having committed billions to OpenAI in a multi-year partnership that’s led to the tech giant integrating ChatGPT into Bing search and other Microsoft products. Now, Microsoft is poised to gain even more influence. Nadella hinted at this reality on Monday, signaling that if Altman were to return as OpenAI’s CEO, Microsoft would have a very strong opinion on how the AI startup is governed.', '“One thing I’ll be very, very clear [about] is, we’re never going to get back into a situation where we get surprised like this ever again,” Nadella said. “If we go back to operating like on Friday, we will make sure we are very, very clear that the governance gets fixed in a way that we really have more surety and guarantee that we don’t have surprises.”', 'Whether that could mean having a board observer or a full-fledged seat on OpenAI’s board, he said, is a bridge “we’ll cross…\xa0if it happens.”', 'New board members In naming ex-Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers to OpenAI’s board, the agreement stands to align the company even more closely with the country’s wealthiest and most influential elite.', 'Taylor isn’t just a former CEO of one of the tech industry’s biggest companies. He’s a former chief technology officer of Facebook, and in 2022, as the chair of Twitter, successfully forced Elon Musk to follow through with his $44 billion acquisition of the social media company, in a momentous bit of corporate maneuvering.', 'Summers, meanwhile, is the former president of Harvard University who has attracted controversy for suggesting that “innate differences” are the reason for women’s underrepresentation in scientific professions. The remark was widely criticized as sexist and Summers subsequently apologized.', 'The push to slow AI development In the same way that the deal breathes new life into Altman’s mythos, so does it give a tailwind to the ideology he represents: a belief in the rapid commercialization of generative AI. With some of the apparent architects of Altman’s ouster being pushed out themselves, a casualty of the affair may be the perspectives that those board members espoused. That seems to include a deep fear about the long-term, potentially even existential risks of AI.', 'In the letter signed by hundreds of OpenAI staffers threatening to quit, employees reported that board members claimed allowing the company to be destroyed “would be consistent with the mission” of OpenAI, which is to “ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.”', 'That OpenAI’s board apparently believed the company’s destruction would benefit society reflects the concerns of a vocal camp in the AI field that has called for pauses in AI development, more research to “align” AI with human-centered values, and concerns about the unchecked power of a truly sentient super-intelligence. Emmett Shear, whom the board named OpenAI’s interim CEO for all of two days, has also expressed similar worries. In the fallout of the leadership crisis, some have argued that the outcome is also a defeat for effective altruism, the movement with which some OpenAI board members are said to be affiliated.', 'OpenAI does not appear to be on the brink of an all-out AI sprint that disregards risk entirely. Summers has been vocal about AI’s near-term impacts on labor.

What Does It Mean for AI?: QuickTake', 'Job one for the interim board will be finding new directors who can strike a better balance between OpenAI’s business imperatives and the need to protect the public from tools capable of creating content that misinforms, worsens inequality or makes it easier for bad actors to inflict violence.', 'The reconstituted board should reflect greater diversity, said many people, including Ashley Mayer, CEO of Coalition Operators, a venture capital firm. “I’m thrilled for OpenAI employees that Sam is back, but it feels very 2023 that our happy ending is three white men on a board charged with ensuring AI benefits all of humanity,” she wrote on the social media site X. “Hoping there’s more to come soon.”', 'A person close to the negotiations said that several women were suggested as possible interim directors, but parties couldn’t come to a consensus. Both Laurene Powell Jobs, the billionaire philanthropist and widow of Steve Jobs, and former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer were floated, but deemed to be too close to Altman, this person said. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was also considered, but her name was dismissed as well. Ultimately, the board will include women, this person said.', 'Investors will also expect changes in the ways the board communicates with stakeholders.

Altman also declined to comment.', 'Sutskever — who is renowned in the field of AI, dating back to his research at the University of Toronto — later apologized for his role in the dismissal of Altman and went so far as to sign a letter threatening to leave OpenAI unless the board resigned.', 'Groundbreaking research to which Sutskever contributed is credited with helping usher in the modern AI age. A lawyer for Sutskever said the executive is “thrilled that Sam is back as CEO” and said he is still employed at the company.', '“I admire Ilya a lot” for changing his mind, Khosla said. He “absolutely” deserves a second chance, he added.', 'One of the big questions for OpenAI is to what extent Altman can continue pursuing outside ventures.

However you want to frame it. That seems to be a narrative that is out there. Is that a narrative that the people in the Valley are talking about or subscribing to as well."", ""ALEX KONRAD: It's certainly not the dominant narrative, at least in Silicon Valley today. We had over 95% of OpenAI employees sign a petition on Monday saying that they would resign if the Board of Directors didn't resign first. So Sam Altman was very popular almost to a cult-like level within his own company."", 'And also you saw a bunch of the leaders in the tech world, whether it was the CEOs of Airbnb, or it was Marissa Mayer, formerly of Google, and a bunch of other stuff, and maybe angling for a board seat here. A lot of folks were speaking out in support of Sam, and so I think that the prevailing narrative is more that OpenAI is going to get back to what it was doing and that this will be hopefully a blip or a distraction from the mission they were on.', ""But what you said is more popular with the research community, and with maybe people outside of Silicon Valley, where some folks are asking questions as you note about, is this the end for such non-profit governance? Does this basically give Sam Altman unchecked power to just grow at all costs or pursue business deals that may not fit the original mission? And so I think that question is one that is a valid one for us to discuss. But I think it's coming more from outside of the inside baseball Silicon Valley sphere.""]"

That style of campaigning seeks to combine shopfloor organizing with regulatory scrutiny, pressure on board members — including consumer pressure on companies affiliated with board members — shareholder action, customer action and political mobilization. The long-time frame of comprehensive campaigning and the breadth of its focus are intended to compensate for facets of American labor law, such as the lengthy NLRB elections and adjudication processes\xa0and the illegality of secondary boycotts\xa0and other actions banned by Congress in the wake of the 1946 strikewave.', 'Earlier this year, Starbucks shareholders voted in support of a measure proposed by New York City and Liverpool pension funds\xa0urging the board to undertake a comprehensive labor rights review.

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>Visa’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+20.9% vs. +15.7%). The company’s stock prices has consistently outperformed the industry, driven by strategic acquisitions and alliances fostering long-term growth.The fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings beat estimates, fueled by increased payments and sustained investments in technology. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.However, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. Increased client incentives may impact the top line. Additionally, it is witnessing a declining cash volume from the Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. As such the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)Shares of Marriott International have outperformed the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry over the year-to-date period (+40.6% vs. +22.9%). The company’s upside was backed by robust leisure demand and solid global booking trends.Also, substantial RevPAR growth in international markets added to the upside. In the quarter, RevPAR for worldwide comparable system-wide properties increased 8.8% year over year. Also, the emphasis on expansion initiatives, digital innovation and the loyalty program bode well.During the quarter, the company added 97 properties to its worldwide lodging portfolio. However, challenging macroeconomic conditions and high debt remain a concern. Earnings estimates for 2023 have declined in the past 30 days.(You can read the full research report on Marriott International here >>>)Shares of Parker-Hannifin have outperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry over the year-to-date period (+51.1% vs. +12.0%). The company is benefiting from higher demand from distributors and end users across the oil and gas, material handling, cars and light trucks, and farm and agriculture markets in the North American region within the Diversified Industrial segment.Higher volume across all businesses, especially the commercial and military aftermarket businesses bolstered the company’s Aerospace Systems unit. Synergies from the Meggitt buyout (September 2022) are also aiding the company. Benefits from the Win strategy are driving Parker-Hannifin’s margins. The company’s measures to add shareholder value hold promise.However, the escalating cost of sales and rising selling, general and administrative expenses pose a threat to its bottom line. Foreign currency headwinds may dent PH’s top line.

The trio of investigations is led by Commissioner Tom Plant, who said he would like to see a gas DR program operational by September and for the VPP to begin enrolling customers in July.', 'The PUC wants to utilize VPPs to shift peak load and mitigate electric system capacity constraints, though an October staff report outlined a broader range of potential benefits including helping to address affordability and equity issues, adding to system resource adequacy and introducing competition into the distribution system.', 'The Colorado PUC opened a “miscellaneous proceeding” in September to explore third-party implementation of pilot programs as the state looks to transition to 100% clean electricity generation by 2040.

Let’s take a look at Philip Morris International’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change."", ' See our latest analysis for Philip Morris International ', ""Philip Morris International is currently expensive based on my price multiple model, where I look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 18.03x is currently well-above the industry average of 11.51x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. Furthermore, Philip Morris International’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta.

Moreover, the figure increased 9.2% year over year. The performance was backed by better-than-anticipated revenues on healthy leasing activity.For 2023, management raised its outlook for FFO per share in the range of $12.15-$12.25 from $11.85-$11.95 estimated earlier. This marks an increase of 30 cents per share at the midpoint.Analysts, too, seem bullish on the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook as it has increased marginally upward over the past week to $12.04.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Let us now decipher the factors behind the increase in the stock price and upward estimate revisions for the FFO per share.Demand for retail real estate has remained robust in recent quarters as retailers continue to rent more physical store space to meet this growing demand. As a result, Simon Property’s portfolio of premium assets in the United States and abroad is experiencing solid leasing activity, driving occupancy levels across its portfolio.Notably, in the nine months ended Sep 30, 2023, the company signed 922 new leases and 1,440 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less) with a fixed minimum rent across its U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio.

Its online retail platform, coupled with an omnichannel strategy, is likely to be accretive to its long-term growth. The company is also focused on tapping its growth opportunities by assisting digital brands enhance their brick-and-mortar presence.Further, its efforts to explore the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, has enabled it to tap the growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play.As part of such efforts, this November, Simon Property and Mercedes-Benz HPC North America LLC entered into a strategic relationship for the deployment of premium EV charging hubs in the United States and Canada in no less than 55 Simon retail properties. The centers will be utilized for Mercedes-Benz vehicle launches, vehicle displays and test-drive opportunities. Also, it will bring hundreds of construction jobs to the communities that they’re located in, making the move a strategic fit.The company maintains a robust balance sheet position and had $8.8 billion of liquidity as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. The fixed-charge coverage ratio was 4.5 as of Sep 30, 2023, well ahead of the required level.SPG also enjoys a corporate investment-grade credit rating of A- (stable outlook) from Standard and Poor\'s and a senior unsecured rating of A3 (stable outlook) from Moody’s, rendering it favorable access to the debt market. The company’s strong financial footing is likely to support its growth endeavors going forward.Solid dividend payouts remain the biggest enticement for REIT investors, and SPG has remained committed to that even during the pandemic. Its latest dividend hike was announced concurrently with the second-quarter 2023 earnings release, whereby it raised the dividend payment to $1.90 per share from $1.85 paid out earlier, marking a 2.7% increase. Moreover, this retail REIT has increased its dividend 10 times in the last five years. Such efforts boost investors’ confidence in the stock.Nonetheless, higher e-commerce adoption and limited consumers’ willingness to spend amid persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and high interest rates may pose near-term concerns for the company.', 'Some better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are TANGER INC SKT and Urban Edge Properties UE, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers."", 'Packaging Corporation reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.05 in the third quarter of 2023, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of $1.92 per share by 7%. The bottom line was higher than the company’s provided guidance of earnings of $1.88 per share but marked a 28% decline year over year.The downside was primarily caused by lower volumes in both the Packaging and Paper segments. Lower price and mix in the Packaging segment combined with higher depreciation expense, tax rate and other expenses added to the headwinds.\xa0 Nonetheless, higher prices and mix in the Paper segment, a lower share count as well as reduced scheduled maintenance outage expenses in the quarter offset some of these negatives. The company also witnessed declines in operating, converting and freight costs, which proved favorable to earnings in the quarter.Including one-time items, earnings in the reported quarter were $2.03 per share compared with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $2.80 per share.', 'Sales in the third quarter fell 9% year over year to $1.94 billion due to low volumes.

We had anticipated a volume decline of 3.4% and an unfavorable price and mix impact of 5.4%. In the Packaging segment, total corrugated products shipments per day rose 1.9% year over year. We had anticipated a 3.2% decline in daily shipments.Containerboard production was reported at 1,118,000 tons for the quarter, higher than our expectation of around 1,068,750 tons. Containerboard inventory was down 84,000 tons year over year and down 12,000 tons sequentially, reflecting better-than-expected demand.Adjusted operating profit was $257 million, a 29% drop from $362 million in the prior-year quarter.Paper: The segment’s revenues were $158 million in the July-September quarter, down 4.5% year over year.

The company will work toward bringing its inventories back to normal levels by restarting the No. 3 machine at the Wallula mill during the fourth quarter. Pricing is, however, likely to be lower due to the majority of the May decrease in the published benchmark index grades being realized throughout the third quarter as well as a seasonally less rich mix.In the Paper segment, volumes are expected to lower compared with the third quarter of 2023, which witnessed seasonally stronger demand. Prices are suggested to trend lower based on the recent declines in index prices.Operating and converting costs are anticipated to be slightly higher primarily due to elevated recycled fiber prices, seasonal energy costs as well as costs associated with the re-start of the Wallula mill.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Perrigo, it has a TSR of -46% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""While the broader market gained around 14% in the last year, Perrigo shareholders lost 3.3% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested.

We regard announced partnerships between Tesla and its competitors in the quarter as important. In early June, Tesla agreed to provide Ford Motors access to Tesla’s electric vehicle (EV) charging technology and network. Other traditional and pure EV manufacturers, including General Motors, Rivian, and Volvo, quickly followed suit. We expect additional charging partnerships to ensue. In our view, these relationships validate Tesla’s charging technology and infrastructure as superior to other standards. Consolidation around a single technology should accelerate charging infrastructure deployment, diminish the risk of Tesla’s technology becoming obsolete, and lessen a key concern of hesitant EV purchasers. EV adoption is at a tipping point.

The company beat earnings and revenue estimates in Q3 due to higher GLP-1 product sales. It has one of the broadest diabetes portfolios in the industry. Ozempic and Rybelsus have been performing well in the diabetes market.Obesity drug Wegovy has been enjoying increasing demand. Label expansions of diabetes and obesity care drugs in cardiovascular and other indications will likely boost sales. Novo Nordisk raised its 2023 view due to higher demand for Ozempic and Wegovy. Its diversifying efforts to develop new treatments are encouraging.However, stiffer competition from pharma bigwigs like Pfizer, who are likely to eat away from Novo Nordisk's Diabetes care market share due to serious supply constraints in international markets.

Because of inflationary pressure, overall costs are expected to remain elevated.The current tough macroeconomic outlook might weigh on the company's investment banking (IB) business. This, along with the volatile nature of the capital markets, might hurt non-interest income growth.Despite these headwinds, we believe that higher rates and decent loan demand will keep aiding the company's net interest income (NII) growth, which the Zacks analyst expects to grow 8.5% this year.

But the name did not stick, and since the 1980s retailers began to describe Black Friday as the day when their retail ledgers are allegedly ""in the black,"" or operating at a profit, as customers start holiday shopping, according to Marcus Collins, a marketing professor with Ross School of Business, University of Michigan.', '""What we know is Black Friday, because it\'s so ceremonial, we get more people participating in it,"" Collins said.', ""WHAT ARE RETAILERS' PLANS THIS YEAR?"", 'Retailers including Best Buy, Macy\'s, H&M and pure e-commerce retailers like Shein and Temu are already touting early Black Friday ""deals"" of up to 30% off on some limited merchandise online and in stores. Such early promotions could help them measure shopper demand and avoid product shortages, which could be a big problem this year. Water levels in a key shipping artery, the Panama Canal, have dropped due to a severe drought, cutting the number of ships carrying merchandise through it. Many retailers in the U.S. intentionally muted their holiday hiring plans. Labor shortages are also a challenge for retailers in Europe, meaning shoppers could find fewer staff to help them.', 'ARE BLACK FRIDAY CROWDS LIKELY THIS YEAR? Around 130.7 million people are planning to shop on Black Friday this year, according to data from the National Retail Federation (NRF). Thanksgiving weekend, which encompasses Black Friday and Cyber Monday - the Monday after Thanksgiving - is typically the busiest shopping period in the United States.', 'But Dana Telsey, CEO of Telsey Advisory Group, said Black Friday itself will not be as important this year. With Christmas falling on a Monday, the ""procrastination factor (is) even greater because shoppers can wait until Saturday or Sunday"" before Christmas to get gifts, she said this week.', 'Throughout the holiday season, in-store traffic is expected to fall slightly this year, dropping by 3.5% compared to last year, according to retail analytics firm Sensormatic Solutions.', 'Wet weather, which deterred in-store traffic in some parts of the U.S. last year on Black Friday morning, is largely not expected this year, according AccuWeather.', 'Although most U.S. stores will be closed on Thanksgiving again this year, opening for shoppers at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. on Friday, some retailers are advertising discounts online that kick in starting at 12:01 a.m. on Thanksgiving.', 'Among them is Kohl\'s, which is promoting what it calls a ""Super Deal"" on Thanksgiving and Black Friday on products including Beats Studio Buds wireless noise cancelling earbuds for $89.99, from the regular price of $149.99.', ""Retailers big and small are touting online ordering and curbside pick-up this year for the convenience of shoppers who want to avoid stores. In the past decade, Americans' Black Friday purchases online have more than tripled, reaching $9.12 billion on the day last year, according to data from Adobe Analytics."", ""WILL SHOPPERS FIND BLACK FRIDAY DEALS THIS YEAR? Several major retailers from Dollar General to Walmart and Macy's could be saddled with too much stock for a second straight year, according to a Reuters analysis. They likely will need to offer discounts in order to drive shoppers to their stores and websites."", ""Even ahead of Black Friday, research firm Jane Hali & Associates said discounts at Kohl's and Macy's were as high as 60%, with foot traffic lower at these two retailers and Nordstrom compared to last year."", 'Adobe said online discounts were expected to be as steep as 35% on toys, 24% on sporting goods and 19% on furniture.', 'ARE DISRUPTIONS EXPECTED DURING THANKSGIVING WEEKEND?', 'Amazon workers in more than a dozen U.S. warehouses are striking on Black Friday, in a fight for higher wages, improved environmental efforts and tax payments to Europe. Protests are slated in more than 30 countries, including Germany, India and Spain, where at least 30 facilities will see walk-outs.', 'The strike\'s organizer Make Amazon Pay expects ""thousands of workers"" to participate with the hopes of causing friction to the e-retail giant\'s supply chain, which sees peak demand during the holiday shopping season. ""Tens of thousands"" of workers participated in three previous Amazon Black Friday walk-outs.', 'HOW MUCH ARE SHOPPERS EXPECTED TO SPEND?', 'Holiday sales online and in U.S. stores are expected to rise between 3% and 4% during November and December, their slowest pace in five years, according to a forecast by the NRF.', 'Spending online during Black Friday is expected to rise 5.7% to roughly $9.6 billion, according to Adobe.', 'In the United Kingdom, online spending during Black Friday is expected to rise 4.5% to 1.05 billion pounds ($1.30 billion), with total sales over the Cyber Weekend reaching 3.8 billion pounds, according to an Adobe forecast.', 'WHAT ARE RETAILERS DOING TO ATTRACT HOLIDAY SHOPPERS? With student loan payments returning, and costs of housing and essentials pinching household budgets, analysts believe retailers will have to rely on promotions and early offers to stay afloat this holiday season.', 'Consumers were looking to make the most of promotional events and wrap up their shopping in just 5.8 weeks this year, when compared to a 7.4-week window pre-pandemic, according to data from Deloitte.', ""WHAT ITEMS ARE HOT FOR BLACK FRIDAY THIS YEAR? IPhones will be hot again, with the recent launch of the iPhone 15. Last year, shoppers looking for Apple's OiPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max returned empty handed as the technology company struggled with production snafus in China."", 'Electronics are expected to be the top pick this shopping season, with estimates of a 6% growth, according to a report by Mastercard. Best Buy kicked off its Black Friday deals in late October with offers such as its Play Station 5 for $499.99 bundled with either ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III"" or Marvel\'s ""Spider-Man 2"", though the retailer on Tuesday forecast a bigger decline in annual comparable sales and pointed to ""difficult to predict"" consumer demand.', 'Skin and hair care products remain popular, with Ulta Beauty offering up to 40% discount on CoverGirl and Lancome mascaras, Bobbi Brown concealers and select products of its own label.', ""WHAT ARE RETAILERS SAYING ABOUT THIS YEAR'S BLACK FRIDAY?"", 'Macy\'s CEO Jeff Gennette on Thursday said the competitive landscape has shifted to Black Friday deals prior to Black Friday.

This shrinkage (caused by clerical error, goods being damaged, lost, or stolen) led to a decline in profits. Macy's also lowered full-year EPS guidance, which came in below consensus estimates.

', 'The Houston-headquartered energy giant on Nov. 20 said Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG’s long-time and influential president and CEO, “has departed the Company and resigned from the Board.” The company’s board “has initiated a search to identify a permanent CEO and retained a leading search firm to assist with this process,” it said. ', 'NRG also announced that, pursuant to a “cooperation agreement” with Elliott, it would add four new independent directors to its board. These include Marwan Fawaz, a former executive at Google, Alphabet, Nest, and Motorola Home; Kevin Howell, who served as COO of Dynegy Inc. and Regional President of NRG Texas; Alex Pourbaix, the executive chair and former CEO of Cenovus Energy; and Marcie Zlotnik, who co-founded and led StarTex Power as COO and Chair.', 'The new directors “were identified as part of NRG’s previously announced Board refreshment process and in collaboration with Elliott,” NRG said. With the appointments, NRG’s board now comprises 13 directors, 12 of whom are independent. ', 'Finally, NRG said it would also “conduct a comprehensive review of its operations and cost structure to identify additional opportunities to become more efficient and further enhance capital return to shareholders,” it said. “The review will be undertaken with a continued commitment to reliability in the markets NRG serves and with the support of external advisors.”', 'The changes follow repeated calls by utility investor and hedge fund Elliott for a new CEO and “enhancements” to the board of directors. Elliott in May notified NRG it had spent $1 billion and claimed to hold a 13% “economic interest” (through stock and derivatives) in NRG. In a letter sent to NRG’s board, the firm suggested the company had “meaningfully underperformed due to a number of operational and strategic missteps.” Among the missteps the firm outlined is NRG’s $2.8 billion purchase earlier this year of Vivint Home, a “smart-home” platform. ', 'Vivint’s acquisition, as POWER has reported in-depth, marked a step change for the historically generation-focused competitive energy provider—which was once the nation’s largest independent power producer. But it was designed as a strategic effort to shape the company’s future market standing as electrification gains pace and the residential sector adopts smart and connected devices. According to Elliott, however, the acquisition, “measured by the one-week market reaction following its announcement, was the single worst deal in the power and utilities sector in the past decade.” ', 'Elliott has notably said its recent intervention echoes activism in 2017 when it recommended NRG rein in its focus on its core merchant power and retail electricity business. The effort culminated in the company’s “Transformation Plan,” reinvigorating the company’s financial initiatives, including $1.065 billion of total cost and margin improvement, $2.5 billion to $4.0 billion of asset divestitures, and $13 billion of debt reduction, the firm has claimed. During that time, NRG relinquished GenOn’s 15.4-GW fleet—nearly a third of its fleet—to its creditors and unloaded a 3.4-GW renewable asset portfolio in NRG Yield.', 'In June, Elliott once again called for a new leader, shifting blame directly on CEO Gutierrez, who it claimed had ""lost the confidence of the core investor base."" The board ""lacks the will to make the right decision for the company,"" it said. In response, NRG Board of Directors Chair Coben in a statement said the board fully supported Gutierrez, the company’s management team, and the company’s strategy “to drive substantial, sustainable shareholder value.”', ""But in July, Elliott asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for permission to buy up to 20% of NRG’s stock. The firm’s power play raised concerns from consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, which in August called on FERC to investigate Elliott’s proposed acquisition, suggesting that Elliott's relationship with coal supplier Peabody Energy raised anti-competitive concerns. Public Citizen has urged FERC to require more details of all derivative contracts it used to acquire NRG’s “economic interest” as well as clarify what role its executives will play on NRG’s board."", ""Under Elliott’s cooperation agreement with NRG reached on Monday, NRG’s board will have a maximum of 13 directors until NRG’s 2024 annual meeting, and then reduce it to 11 directors afterward. This size adjustment is conditioned on a new CEO's appointment or by Dec. 31, 2024. If any new director appointed under the agreement cannot serve or leaves before the end of the Cooperation Period—which is slated with conditions to end in November 2024—NRG and Elliott will jointly select a replacement, provided Elliott still owns at least 1% of NRG's outstanding common stock."", 'On Monday, Elliott appeared to laud NRG’s abrupt reshuffle. “We invested in NRG because we believed that a renewed focus on best-in-class operations and returns-driven capital allocation would strengthen NRG and enable it to deliver significant upside for shareholders,” said Elliott Partner John Pike and Portfolio Manager Bobby Xu in a statement. “The changes announced today, including the addition of four new Board members with strong operational backgrounds, represent a key milestone toward this end. We look forward to continuing our dialogue with the Company as it works to execute on this opportunity.”', 'Coben, who has served as NRG’s board of directors chair since 2017 and has been a member of the company’s board since 2003, thanked Guitierrez “for his contributions in helping to build NRG’s solid foundation as we prepare for the next generation of leadership.” ', 'The new directors, Coben suggested, will bring “complementary experience as proven operators in the energy industry and in leading growing innovative home technology companies with iconic brands. Their expertise will help ensure we capture the value we create by offering a smarter, cleaner and more digitally enhanced energy ecosystem. We welcome them to the Board,” he said.

During this period, the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, which Qualcomm falls in, has gained 14.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'Qualcomm is expected to post earnings of $2.33 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.4%.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of $9.07 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.6%.

Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.6%.', ""Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'In the case of Qualcomm, the consensus sales estimate of $9.46 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0%.

The company beat earnings and revenue estimates in Q3 due to higher GLP-1 product sales. It has one of the broadest diabetes portfolios in the industry. Ozempic and Rybelsus have been performing well in the diabetes market.Obesity drug Wegovy has been enjoying increasing demand. Label expansions of diabetes and obesity care drugs in cardiovascular and other indications will likely boost sales. Novo Nordisk raised its 2023 view due to higher demand for Ozempic and Wegovy. Its diversifying efforts to develop new treatments are encouraging.However, stiffer competition from pharma bigwigs like Pfizer, who are likely to eat away from Novo Nordisk's Diabetes care market share due to serious supply constraints in international markets.

Both the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ indexes are back within close reach of the peak yearly values hit at the end of July, after their single best month since Oct 2022 – and the month isn’t over yet. The gains have paralleled a drop in bond yields; the 10-year Treasury note touched 5% a few weeks ago, but is now down to nearly 4.4%.', 'Clearly, market sentiment is running positive, and investors are not shy about buying into stocks right now. Support for this bullish surge came from the October inflation data, which was reported at a 3.2% annualized rate. That came in lower than expected, and shows the pace of inflation decelerating – good news, and news that buttresses expectations for a Fed rate cut sooner rather than later. Right now, market watchers are pricing in a 29% chance of a 25-basis point cut by March of next year.', 'This all brings up a question – how to find the right place to put those stock purchasing dollars to work, given a hotter market? We could use a tried and true screen, and look for stocks endorsed by the big-name investment banks – international firms like Deutsche Bank, that have reputations to uphold and customers looking for solid portfolios. Their incentive is clear – do the homework, find the best stocks.', 'So let’s follow some of Deutsche Bank’s recent suggestions. The bank’s analysts have, in recent weeks, picked out 3 stocks for particularly bullish praise; here they are, with the latest details drawn from the TipRanks platform to go along with the DB commentaries.', 'Goldman Sachs Says These 2 Healthcare Stocks Have up to 130% Upside Potential', 'Tech Stocks Have More Room to Run, According to Bank of America — Here Are 2 Names to Watch', '‘Riding the Clean Energy Wave’: This Analyst Suggests 2 Stocks to Play the Renewable Energy Transition', 'Griffon Corporation (GFF)', 'We’ll start with a holding company, whose various wholly-owned subsidiaries operate in two large segments: home and building products, and consumer and professional products. From its NYC headquarters, Griffon Corporation oversees Clopay, North America’s largest manufacturer and distributor of garage doors and rolling steel doors, and AMES Companies, which focuses on branded consumer and professional-grade tools aimed at the home improvement and landscaping sectors.', 'While not a household name, Griffon can still trace its history back to the beginning of the US. AMES Companies was originally established in 1774, making it one of the oldest US companies still in continuous operation. Clopay isn’t that venerable, but is still well over a half-century in the business; it was established in 1964. Together, Griffon’s subsidiaries employ approximately 6,000 people.', 'Griffon Corporation has worked hard in recent years to both support its share price and to return capital to shareholders. In an announcement earlier this month, the company publicized a $200 million increase to its share buyback authorization. Including that increase, the company now has an authorized buyback program worth $262 million. The company repurchased $150.8 million worth of stock during its fiscal year 2023, which ended on September 30.', 'The buyback is complemented by a modest dividend, which Griffon pays out quarterly. In its last declaration, on Nov 15, the company scheduled a 15-cent payment for December 14. This marked a 20% increase in the payment. The dividend annualizes to 60 cents per common share and yields 1.3%.', 'Griffon maintained its capital returns even though it missed revenue expectations in the recently reported fiscal 4Q23. The company showed a top-line of $641.4 million, $10.95 million below the forecast and down 9.6% year-over-year. The bottom line figure was $1.19 per share by non-GAAP measures. This was up 10 cents y/y, and came in 23 cents better than had been anticipated. Griffon’s free cash flow in the fiscal year came to $389.1 million.', 'For Deutsche Bank analyst Joe Ahlersmeyer, there’s plenty to like here, and he particularly shines a light on the firm’s work ethic: “Griffon investors can anticipate a dual track of positive momentum over the coming years, with a high-quality, high-margin garage door business in HBP, and a compelling improvement story in CPP, where hard work on streamlining the business model will likely start to show results in FY24 and into FY25.”', 'Looking ahead to future performance, the analyst also saw plenty of reasons to take a bullish view, writing of Griffon’s potential, “After years of rationalization and readjustment, what remains at Griffon is a focused Building Products business with strong FCF generation potential, which we anticipate will surpass $400mm in annual cash from operations by FY25, providing more than $1bn of deployable capital from FY25-FY27. We see the company increasing share repurchases and growing its dividend, and to a lesser extent deleveraging and exploring bolt-on M&A.”', 'Ahlersmeyer goes on to give these shares a Buy rating, with a $65 price target to point toward a 40.5% appreciation for the coming year. (To watch Ahlersmeyer’s track record, click here.)', 'This stock has slipped under the radar a bit, and holds a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on just 2 analyst reviews – but they are both positive. The shares are trading for $46.25 and their $62.50 average price target suggests a 35% one-year upside potential. (See Griffon’s stock forecast.)', 'DoorDash, Inc. (DASH)', 'Next on our list, DoorDash, is a name you probably know – and have very possibly ordered from. DoorDash is a Silicon Valley tech name, founded in 2013, and in the last 10 years has become a well-known provider of online food ordering and delivery services. The company operates in more than 25 countries around the world, bringing convenience to private and small-merchant consumers.', 'While the company’s business may focus on small customers, individuals and small businesses, DoorDash itself is decidedly large-cap. The company has a market cap near $38 billion, and has expanded beyond its original food delivery niche. Today, DoorDash can connect consumers with a wide range of products, including food of course, but also flowers, pet supplies, groceries, household goods, and even alcohol. Customers can even call DoorDash to pick up package deliveries, and take them to UPS, FedEx, or the post office.', 'We all want convenience, and more and more are willing to pay for it. That opens up a huge vista of opportunity for DoorDash, which saw its total orders increase 24% y/y in 3Q23, reaching $543 million. The firm’s gross order volume for the same period also grew 24% y/y, and was reported at $16.8 billion. That’s a solid foundation for any business.', 'At the top-line, DoorDash reported $2.16 billion in revenue for Q3, beating the forecast by $70 million while growing 29% y/y. At the same time, like many Silicon Valley tech firms, DoorDash is operating at a loss. Its EPS for Q3 was reported as ($0.19); on the positive side, the year-ago quarterly loss was 77 cents per share, and the current figure was 22 cents better than the forecast. We should note here that DoorDash’s quarterly revenues have been showing consistent sequential growth for the past several years, and that the stock is up more than 95% for the year-to-date.', 'Deutche Bank analyst Lee Horowitz puts this into context when he notes the sheer size of DoorDash’s potential market – and just how much room the company has to keep dashing. In his words, “DoorDash’s core markets in restaurant, grocery, convenience, and retail delivery are massive and measure at around $6.7trn. With DoorDash capturing only 1% of its overall market via users that represent only 7% of available homes, there is ample runway for user growth from here. With this in mind, DoorDash’s ability to take share of these opportunities while also growing profitability despite a more strained global consumer has been on full display in 2023. Thus, we’d argue this should give investors confidence in underwriting the idea that DoorDash will be one of the prime beneficiaries of digital transformation trends within these multi-trillion markets over the coming years. With this in mind, we look for user growth to compound at a CAGR of ~13% between 2022 and 2026.”', 'Horowitz, a 5-star analyst, initiates his coverage of DASH with a Buy rating, encouraging investors to jump in now while there is plenty of space for the company to expand. His price target here is $125, implying a one-year gain of 32%. (To watch Horowitz’s track record, click here.)', 'While DB is bullish, the Street generally is somewhat more cautious. All in all, DoorDash receives a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 21 recent reviews that break down to 8 Buys, 12 Holds, and 1 Sell. The stock is trading for $94.60 and its $100.39 average target price suggests an upside of a modest 6% in the next 12 months. (See DoorDash’s stock forecast.)', 'Goodyear Tire (GT)', 'Let’s finish in the automotive world, with Goodyear Tire. This name is instantly recognizable, as it is one of the world’s top automotive tire companies – and because its eponymous Goodyear Blimp has long been an icon of outdoor advertising. Goodyear was founded in 1898 and today employs 72,000 people and boasts 57 facilities in 23 countries. The company has a $4 billion market cap and is consistently one of the world’s top-five largest tire companies. It is the largest tire company in the US market.', 'Most of us don’t really think about automotive tires until ours run bald and the car starts to drift – but in today’s world, tires are an essential product, and the market for them is expected to continue growing. Last year, the market for automotive tires clocked in at approximately $126 billion; it is expected to reach $176 billion by 2027. The push toward EV adoption is providing an unexpected boost for tires, too. EVs are typically heavier than comparable-class combustion vehicles, and so wear out their tires faster – necessitating a shorter lifespan and more rapid tire replacement cycle.', 'For the past several years, the top line has been remarkably stable, staying between $4.73 billion and $5.36 billion, with most values closer to $5 billion. That said, in the most recent quarter, Goodyear posted $5.14 billion in revenues, slipping some 3% year-over-year and missing the forecast by nearly $140 million. At the bottom line, the company realized a non-GAAP EPS of 36 cents; this was 17 cents per share better than expected.', 'Having a solid base will be important for Goodyear in the near future. The company’s long-time CEO Richard Kramer will be retiring next year, and Goodyear has begun an executive search for a new head. The leadership search was a key point for Deutsche Bank’s analyst Emmanuel Rosner, who notes it among several other factors that should attract investors to GT stock.', 'Getting into details, Rosner writes, “With a credible operational turnaround path, strategic portfolio optimization through large noncore divestitures, and new leadership coming in to execute, we think Goodyear is about to start a new chapter. We see strong potential for the company to improve its profitability and narrow the gap with its peers through self-help, de-leverage its balance sheet, and unlock large shareholder value.”', 'These comments back up Rosner’s Buy rating here, while his $21 price target shows his confidence in a 50% upside for the stock. (To watch Rosner’s track record, click here.)', 'Even though Goodyear is a venerable name in the US auto industry, the stock only has 3 recent analyst reviews. These include 2 Buys and 1 Hold, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating; the stock’s $18.33 average price target suggests a 31% one-year gain from the current trading price of $13.99.

But this could be related to good market conditions -- stocks in its market are up 7.2% in the last month.', ""So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress."", ' See our latest analysis for Republic Services ', ""There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", ""During five years of share price growth, Republic Services achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 4.1% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 16% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Republic Services the TSR over the last 5 years was 128%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""We're pleased to report that Republic Services shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 20% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 18%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

We summed the percentage population in these three categories, to produce a percentage distribution representing positive self-reported health. After that, we assigned equal weights to the population maintaining normal weight and the population rating their health status as good to excellent and calculated a weighted average.

Healthcare, an important consideration for retirees, is becoming more and more inaccessible. CBS News reported that in 2022 alone, nearly 40% of Americans have been reported to skip their necessary medical care because of the inability to afford it. As quoted by the Economist, America\'s healthcare system is particularly ""dysfunctional"", with many middlemen taking a huge slice of the pie in terms of profits. “The big health”, as they like to call it, comprising of drug distributors, insurers, chemists, and similar professions, have reported a combined revenue equating to 45% of America’s healthcare bill in 2022 alone.', ""While Americans are struggling with medical care costs, the nation's largest private health insurers are reporting substantial financial gains. For the year 2022, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported more than $20 billion in profits, Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV); $6 billion, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) $4.2 billion, and The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) reported $6.7 billion. Moreover, in the first six months of 2023, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported $184.8 billion in revenue and $11.1 billion in profits. In the specific case of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), it is believed that their revenues have not only grown because people deferred care during the pandemic, but also because the health giants hold a bigger piece of the healthcare system."", ""By directing its members toward its own healthcare providers, the company retains a more substantial portion of the premium dollars. This business model is increasingly becoming attractive to other companies such as Bright Health, who are now following in its footsteps. Nevertheless, while nearly 28 million Americans don't even have health insurance, those who do don't have sufficient access to it. According to a survey from KFF, a nonprofit health research group, majority of Americans having healthcare insurance report facing obstacles in getting coverage. Some of these obstacles include high bills, lack of doctors, and even denied-medical-care. Respondents also report having trouble paying their share of costs when covered."", 'To quote an example, internal records of The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) that have been reviewed by ProPublica and The Capitol Forum, imply that the company has been saving millions by rejecting claims on medical grounds. Cigna Doctors don’t even bother to open patient files, as claimed by the report. As of 2022, over 300,000 requests for payments have been rejected, leaving patients with unexpected bills to pay. While The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) reports these claims to be “biased and incomplete”, former doctors quote that the review system at the company has been quick to reject claims.', 'Another way such insurance companies are delaying or denying care is by requiring pre-authorization for routine care and even life-saving treatments. This step delays and even denies the care required by patients. As a result, insurance companies keep making billions, and the average American struggles to pay the costs.', 'Owing to the rising costs of living and inaccessible, often expensive healthcare; many Americans are now choosing to retire overseas. The US Department of State notes that more than 760,000 beneficiaries abroad receive $6.1 billion in Social Security benefits each year. There are many countries where expats are choosing to retire, depending on their needs. For example, one popular overseas retirement destination for Americans is Canada, favored for its high quality of life and proximity to the United States. A total of 71,376 social security benefits were withdrawn from the country in 2021, followed by Japan.', 'While many expats who reside in countries such as Canada and Japan consider quality of life a top priority, many others opt for the cheapest and safest countries for retirement, such as Hungary, Romania, Chile, and Mongolia. For yet many others, affordable healthcare is the way to go. However, the best country to retire to is one that offers the best of everything. As such, good-quality healthcare, affordable living costs, and a safe environment should be top priorities for an expat.

This transaction has caught the attention of investors and market analysts, as insider activity, such as sales and purchases, can provide valuable insights into a company's financial health and future prospects."", ""Jonathan Auerbach is an executive with a strategic role at PayPal Holdings Inc, a leading technology platform and digital payments company. In his position, Auerbach is responsible for guiding the company's growth initiatives and leveraging data analytics to drive business strategy. His insights and decisions are crucial for PayPal's expansion and adaptation in the rapidly evolving digital payments landscape."", 'PayPal Holdings Inc is a global leader in digital payments, offering a wide range of services that include online money transfers, payment processing for merchants, and various consumer financial products. The company operates a robust platform that enables users to connect and transact in new and powerful ways, whether online, on a mobile device, in an app, or in person. With millions of active accounts, PayPal is committed to democratizing financial services and empowering people and businesses to join and thrive in the global economy.', ""The recent sale by Jonathan Auerbach is notable, as it represents a substantial divestment from the insider's holdings in PayPal. Over the past year, Auerbach has sold a total of 64,957 shares and has not made any purchases. This could be interpreted in several ways; insiders might sell shares for personal financial planning, diversification, or other non-company related reasons. However, when an insider of Auerbach's caliber sells a significant amount of stock, it often prompts investors to take a closer look at the company's performance and future outlook."", ""The insider trend for PayPal Holdings Inc shows a pattern of more insider selling than buying over the past year, with 2 insider sells and only 1 insider buy. This trend could suggest that insiders, on balance, see the stock as fairly valued or are taking profits after a period of appreciation. It's important to consider this information in the context of the overall market and specific company developments."", ""On the day of the insider's recent sale, PayPal Holdings Inc's shares were trading at $55.58, giving the company a market cap of $60.742 billion. The price-earnings ratio of 16.82 is higher than the industry median of 12.82 but lower than the company's historical median price-earnings ratio. This indicates that, while PayPal may be trading at a premium compared to its industry peers, it is somewhat undervalued based on its own historical standards."", 'The GF Value, an intrinsic value estimate by GuruFocus, suggests that PayPal Holdings Inc is significantly undervalued with a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.49. This is based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. The current stock price of $55.58 compared to the GF Value of $112.35 indicates that the stock may have considerable upside potential, assuming the company meets performance expectations.', ""The sale of 64,957 shares by Jonathan Auerbach is a significant event that warrants attention from PayPal investors and market watchers. While the reasons behind the insider's decision to sell are not publicly known, the transaction, alongside the insider trend and current valuation metrics, provides a mixed signal. On one hand, the insider selling trend could be seen as a cautionary sign, but on the other hand, the GF Value suggests that the stock is significantly undervalued.Investors should consider these factors in conjunction with PayPal's overall financial health, competitive position, and growth prospects before making any investment decisions. As always, insider transactions are just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to evaluating a stock's potential."", 'Warning!

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with TGT.', ""On November 22, 2023, Target Corp (NYSE:TGT), the nation's sixth-largest retailer, filed its 10-Q report, revealing a mix of challenges and triumphs in its financial performance. Despite a year-over-year decrease in total revenue from $26.5 billion to $25.4 billion, Target demonstrated resilience with a substantial increase in operating income from $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion for the third quarter. Net earnings also saw a healthy rise to $971 million, up from $712 million in the prior year, translating to a robust earnings per share of $2.10. These figures underscore Target's ability to navigate a complex retail environment while maintaining profitability and shareholder value."", ""Robust Financial Health: Target Corp's financial health remains a cornerstone of its competitive advantage. The third quarter of 2023 saw the company's net earnings soar to $971 million, a significant increase from $712 million in the previous year. This financial robustness is further evidenced by a strong operating income of $1.3 billion, up nearly 29% from the prior year. The company's ability to maintain a solid balance sheet, even in the face of declining sales, speaks to its operational efficiency and cost management strategies. This financial stability provides Target with the flexibility to invest in growth initiatives and weather economic downturns."", ""Supply Chain and Inventory Management: Target has made notable strides in refining its supply chain and inventory management. The company's recent 10-Q filing highlights a decrease in inventory from $17.1 billion in the previous year to $14.7 billion, reflecting a strategic alignment with sales trends and supply chain enhancements. These improvements have led to reduced costs associated with managing elevated inventory levels, contributing to the company's increased operating income. Efficient inventory management not only optimizes working capital but also positions Target to respond swiftly to changing consumer demands, a vital strength in the dynamic retail sector."", ""Declining Sales and Market Penetration: Despite Target's strong financial performance, the company is not immune to the challenges of the retail industry. The latest SEC filing reveals a 4.3% decline in total sales, with comparable sales decreasing by 4.9%. This downturn is attributed to a 4.1% decrease in traffic and a 0.8% reduction in average transaction amount. Additionally, RedCard Penetration, a measure of purchases made using Target's proprietary RedCards, has decreased from 19.6% to 18.3% year-over-year. These figures indicate a weakening in customer engagement and market penetration, which could signal a need for Target to revitalize its marketing strategies and customer loyalty programs to reverse this trend."", ""Increased Inventory Shrink: Target Corp has experienced a rise in inventory shrink rates, which are higher than historical levels and particularly pronounced in certain stores. This increase in shrink, as a percentage of sales, has had an adverse impact on the company's results of operations. While this trend is industry-wide, it points to a potential weakness in loss prevention strategies and could lead to impairment of long-lived assets if not addressed. Target must enhance its loss prevention measures and store operations to mitigate this growing concern."", ""E-commerce and Digital Growth: The shift towards digital shopping presents a significant opportunity for Target Corp. Although the company has seen a 6.0% decline in comparable digitally-originated sales, the broader trend towards online retailing continues to accelerate. Target's established digital infrastructure, including its mobile applications and websites, positions the company to capitalize on this trend. By focusing on enhancing the digital customer experience and integrating it seamlessly with physical stores, Target can drive future sales growth and expand its market share in the e-commerce space."", ""Strategic Capital Allocation: Target's disciplined approach to capital allocation, as evidenced by its robust operating cash flows of $5.3 billion for the nine months ended October 28, 2023, provides the company with opportunities to invest in long-term growth initiatives. These investments could include store remodels, technology upgrades, and expansion into new markets. By prioritizing profitable growth and sustainable value creation, Target can leverage its financial strength to pursue strategic opportunities that enhance its competitive position."", ""Competitive Retail Landscape: The retail industry is fiercely competitive, with players ranging from traditional brick-and-mortar stores to online giants. Target Corp operates in this challenging environment, where it must continuously innovate to maintain its market position. The company's recent sales decline underscores the threat posed by competitors who may offer more compelling value propositions or shopping experiences. To remain competitive, Target must keep pace with industry trends, consumer preferences, and technological advancements."", ""Economic and Market Volatility: Economic uncertainty and market volatility pose ongoing threats to Target's operations. Fluctuations in consumer spending, driven by factors such as inflation, unemployment rates, and consumer confidence, can impact Target's sales and profitability. The company's reliance on discretionary spending makes it particularly vulnerable to economic downturns. Target must navigate these uncertainties by maintaining operational flexibility and a strong value proposition to attract cost-conscious consumers."", 'In conclusion, Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) exhibits a robust financial foundation and operational strengths, particularly in supply chain and inventory management.

In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders."", ' View our latest analysis for News ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for News is:', '2.0% = US$179m ÷ US$8.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.02."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""As you can see, News' ROE looks pretty weak. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 9.9%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. However, we we're pleasantly surprised to see that News grew its net income at a significant rate of 55% in the last five years. We believe that there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently."", ""As a next step, we compared News' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 13%."", ""Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation.

This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", 'News has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 24%, meaning that it has the remaining 76% left over to reinvest into its business. So it looks like News is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.', ""Besides, News has been paying dividends over a period of eight years. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 18% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 6.8%, over the same period."", ""In total, it does look like News has some positive aspects to its business.

A solid 7.1% compounding annual growth rate is predicted for the hydrogen industry by 2040, with the potential for faster growth in the following years. Harnessing the power of hydrogen more efficiently and sustainably could be extremely beneficial, as hydrogen has the highest energy per mass of any fuel. As of now, most of its uses are only industrial, though there is potential for change.

Behind the scenes, you’re still working out the details of getting the car to sell. Suddenly, a shift in the market occurs and the price of the vehicle jumps higher.', 'Because you’re contractually on the hook for selling the car to the buyer at a near-term date at a previously agreed-upon price, you’re in deep trouble if the price keeps marching higher. At some point, you’re going to need to cut your losses because no law exists that limits the price of a car. It’s whatever the market will bear (no pun intended).', 'So, if you’re the seller of the car, you’d be panicked right? That’s exactly the case with gamma-squeeze stocks.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Typically, traders sell (write) call options and collect premium for the troubles. With sold calls, the risk is if the underlying security blows past the listed strike price. In that case, the call writer has the obligation to fulfill the contract (i.e. buy the stock). If you don’t have the stock – that is, you sold naked call options – you are, you know, in trouble.', 'Here, we care about the fundamentals but not excessively.

So, it’s understandable why many traders would want to sell NTR call options. You can collect a premium under the assumption that shares will continue to fall lower and lower. And you can assume that until you no longer can’t.', 'Some high rollers are finding out the hard way. According to Fintel’s options flow screener – which exclusively focuses on big block trades likely made by institutions – in late October, major traders sold thousands of contracts of calls expiring on Nov. 17, with strike prices ranging from $62 to $65. Open interest for these calls remains elevated, implying vulnerability and thus candidacy for gamma-squeeze stocks.', 'Now, at time of writing, NTR closed Tuesday at $56.30 after having gained nearly 4%.

Sure, it’s up almost 5% since the January opener. However, around the middle of last month, VSTO absolutely cratered. Again, we don’t really care so much about why it fell when it comes to gamma squeeze stocks. The main point is, traders speculated bearishly against VSTO and it might go bad.', 'Sure enough, on Oct. 16 following the dramatic implosion of Vista, an institutional trader (or traders) sold 506 contracts of the Nov 17 ’25.00 Call. As well, on Nov. 7, another trader (or the same ones – we just don’t know) sold 500 contracts of the Dec 15 ’23 25.00 Call. Combined, both of these calls have thousands of contracts in open interest, translating to vulnerability to a gamma squeeze.', 'Here’s the critical part. On Tuesday, VSTO gained over 6% of equity value, closing at a price of $26.03. That means that as I write this, both of these calls are in the money (ITM) for the buyer.

Open interest for this call stands at 2,267 contracts, making it one of the cynically compelling gamma-squeeze stocks.

So, on Nov. 8, Yahoo Finance reported that Toast missed its Q3 sales targets, sending shares down 13%. In response, on Nov. 10, institutional investors sold 3,340 contracts of Dec 29 ’23 14.00 Call. At the time, it seemed a reasonable wager.', 'But get this – these speculators underwrote the risk when TOST stock was around $14. That’s gutsy to sell an at-the-money (ATM) option!

However, that opens Nabors’ candidacy for gamma-squeeze stocks to consider.', 'For whatever reason, NBR has been volatile in the trailing month, losing almost 20% of equity value. Subsequently, institutional investors may have gotten cold feet last month, selling hundreds of contracts of the Dec 15 ’23 Calls with strike prices of $120 and $130. As of the close of Nov. 14, the options chain reveals that most of these contracts are still in the open interest category.', 'To be fair, NBR closed at $95.66 on Tuesday, Therefore, we’ll need to see a significant move higher in the next month for this trade to spark panic.

Unfortunately, that’s just not the case. Per a CNBC report last month, publicly traded toymakers forecast a lackluster holiday season. In turn, HAS lost more than 27% of equity value since the beginning of the year. Under this context, it wasn’t shocking that options traders decided to scalp a quick “bear” trade.', 'Sure enough, Fintel’s options flow data shows that on Tuesday, major entities sold a consider volume of Nov 17 ’23 45.00 Call options. However, the issue is that the traders underwrote the risk when HAS was trading in the open market at $45.16. The reason speculators do this is because selling near-expiry options – all other things being equal – yield limited premiums (rewards).', 'To ramp up the reward, speculators will buy near-ITM (or in this case slightly ITM).

For many families, this is an ongoing tradition, but the box office has failed to regain its foothold on a once busy time of year in the wake of COVID-19. But what will this year bring? Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal has the details. Allie."", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hey, Jared. And that's right. We've yet to see this juggernaut box office since before the pandemic in 2019. And that's due to a variety of factors, from the content pipeline, to the hybrid streaming releases where consumers realize, hey, I don't need to go to the theaters to watch these films. But flash forward to today, and the box office is trying to revive itself."", ""We've seen hints of that with the summer, the Barbenheimer success and other tentpoles outperforming. But at the same time, we've also seen some serious underperformers, particularly from Disney. And Disney is looking for a big win here with the debut of its animated film, Wish. I spoke earlier this morning with box office pro chief analyst Shawn Robbins, who said the number to watch here is in the 40 to 50 million range. If this film is able to reach that, we could consider that a win for Disney, especially under the circumstances."", ""It's also a film that could play the long game here with audiences over the next few weeks, especially since we haven't seen a ton of family-friendly content out there. So perhaps an opportunity for Disney to capitalize on. But there's no denying that Disney has struggled. I mean, this is a company that debuted Toy Story, Frozen, Frozen 2 all over Thanksgiving weekend, and those films in particular really helped drive the Thanksgiving box office to 250 million or more in that weekend alone."", ""And then if you take a look at last year, Disney's animated film, Strange World, massive bomb. Just 18.5 million. Even Encanto the year before, Thanksgiving weekend 2021, that only secured around 40 million. So if Wish underperforms here, it's going to be a further sign that Disney has its work cut out for them."", ""Iger has consistently stressed quality over quantity. He wants more wins versus simply more films, but that's all going to come down to strategy in terms of the marketing creative and execution of these films. So Disney, a big studio to watch this weekend. Also Apple, they'll be releasing Napoleon in theaters after debuting Killers of the Flower Moon last month. This is obviously a much more adult film compared to Wish, so won't be too much competition between those two movies there."", ""And then with the Hunger Games prequel still in theaters, perhaps the Thanksgiving weekend can reach 150 million or more at the box office. That really has yet to happen post 2019. So we'll see if the box office, and really Disney in particular, can bring back a little bit more of that magic this year."", ""- Allie, you mentioned some of the success or maybe lack thereof that we could see this weekend, what that would mean then for Disney strategy going into 2024. I'm curious what you see the strategy being overall here when you take a look at the studios. Obviously, they were able to end the strike here. Good news in terms of releases. How much delay are we likely to see, and do you expect any sort of shift in strategy as they do struggle to get even more people back into the theater?"", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, the strikes is a great point, Seana, because a lot of the momentum that we've seen from the Thanksgiving box office in the past has happened because the fall slate had been so strong. And because of the strikes, we saw that Dune sequel from Warner Brothers be pushed into 2024. So not as much momentum here as we had previously."", ""Obviously, the fact that the strikes have ended, that's a huge win for the studios, but they still have seen major movie delays. There are some films that were pushed into 2025. So the pipeline has always been a critical piece of that story. And particularly for Disney, analysts that I've spoken with have said they really need to program things strategically and get those bigger sequels. Get that Frozen 3, Frozen 4, which Bob Iger said it's coming eventually. Get that into the schedule and really pack in those types of movies, so that you could lift those box office dollars that way."", ""So I do expect Disney to focus more on those types of films that are going to be the blockbuster for them for that period of time, whether that be in the summer, which is always a lucrative time for theaters, or the fall. And again, Bob Iger, stressing quality over quantity. There's a lot of oversaturation after the debut of Disney especially in terms of Marvel and Lucasfilm, some of those Star Wars content. So I expect to see a lot less of that and a lot more maybe animated films or just more targeted films when it comes to some of those big franchises that Disney has.""]"

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. In light of that, when we looked at DENTSPLY SIRONA (NASDAQ:XRAY) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled."", ""If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for DENTSPLY SIRONA, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.048 = US$290m ÷ (US$7.2b - US$1.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Therefore, DENTSPLY SIRONA has an ROCE of 4.8%.

This indicates to us that assets are being sold and thus the business is likely shrinking, which you\'ll remember isn\'t the typical ingredients for an up-and-coming multi-bagger. In addition to that, since the ROCE doesn\'t scream ""quality"" at 4.8%, it\'s hard to get excited about these developments.', ""It's a shame to see that DENTSPLY SIRONA is effectively shrinking in terms of its capital base.

The slightly lower success rate for upper jaw implants is attributed to the lesser density of the upper jaw compared to the lower jaw.', ""In 2023, the cost of dental implants varies widely due to the procedures' complexity. The total cost for a single tooth implant, including a comprehensive dental exam, 3D imaging, extraction if necessary, implant installation, abutment placement, and crown fabrication and placement, ranges from $3,000 to $4,500. For those requiring multiple implants, such as a full mouth replacement, the total cost can escalate to a range between $60,000 and $90,000. The variability in pricing is attributed to factors like the need for a CT scan, sinus lift, bone graft, and the type of bone graft required."", 'When replacing multiple adjacent teeth, options like a bridge held in place with two implants can save costs. Full-mouth tooth replacement has different approaches, with the individual tooth replacement being the most expensive at $60,000 to $90,000, while implant-supported dentures, such as the All-on-4 method, range from $24,000 to $50,000.

During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Oracle falls in, has gained 13.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'Oracle is expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of $5.52 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.8%. This estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.', 'For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.15 indicates a change of +11.4% from what Oracle is expected to report a year ago.

After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'For Oracle, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.05 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +6.3%.

The payment will take the dividend yield to 2.4%, which is in line with the average for the industry."", "" View our latest analysis for McDonald's "", ""While it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. Based on the last payment, McDonald's was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business."", 'Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 30.4%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 44% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.', 'The company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $3.08 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $6.68. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.0% a year over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.', ""Some investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. McDonald's has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 12% per annum. Earnings are on the uptrend, and it is only paying a small portion of those earnings to shareholders."", ""Overall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that McDonald's is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash.

On November 22, 2023, Joseph Erlinger, President of McDonald's USA, sold 4,487 shares of the company. This transaction has caught the attention of investors and market analysts, as insider activity can often provide valuable insights into a company's financial health and future prospects."", ""Joseph Erlinger has been a key figure in McDonald's leadership team, overseeing the company's operations in the United States. His role is critical in driving growth and maintaining the brand's dominance in the fast-food industry. Erlinger's experience and strategic decisions have been instrumental in navigating the company through various market conditions, including the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic."", ""McDonald's Corp operates and franchises McDonald's restaurants worldwide, offering a standardized menu of value-priced food items, with a particular focus on hamburgers, chicken, french fries, breakfast items, soft drinks, milkshakes, and desserts. The company has also expanded its menu to include salads, fish, wraps, smoothies, and fruit. McDonald's maintains its relevance by continuously innovating its menu and embracing technology to enhance customer experience."", ""The recent insider sell by Erlinger has prompted a closer look at the relationship between insider transactions and the stock's performance. Over the past year, Erlinger has sold a total of 26,922 shares and has not made any purchases. This pattern of selling could suggest that the insider is adjusting his personal investment portfolio or possibly that he perceives the stock to be fully valued at current levels."", ""When examining the broader insider transaction history for McDonald's Corp, there has been a noticeable trend of more insider sells than buys over the past year, with 19 sells and only 1 buy. This trend can be interpreted in various ways, but it is essential to consider the context of each transaction and the individual circumstances of the insiders involved."", ""On the valuation front, McDonald's Corp shares were trading at $281.25 on the day of Erlinger's sell, giving the company a market cap of $204.495 billion. The price-earnings ratio stands at 24.82, slightly higher than the industry median of 23.66 and above the company's historical median. This indicates that the stock is trading at a premium compared to its peers and its own historical valuation."", ""However, according to the GuruFocus Value, which is calculated based on historical multiples, an adjustment factor for past performance, and future business estimates, McDonald's Corp has a GF Value of $291.96. With a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.96, the stock appears to be Fairly Valued, suggesting that the current price is in line with the intrinsic value estimated by GuruFocus."", ""It is important to note that insider sells do not always indicate a lack of confidence in the company. Insiders might sell shares for personal reasons, such as diversifying their investment portfolio, funding personal expenses, or taking profits after a significant stock price appreciation. Therefore, while insider sells can provide a clue about an insider's sentiment, they should not be the sole basis for investment decisions."", ""Looking at the stock's performance in relation to insider activity, there does not seem to be a direct correlation between Erlinger's selling pattern and significant movements in the stock price. The stock has remained relatively stable, with fluctuations that appear to be more closely tied to market conditions and the company's financial performance rather than insider transactions."", ""In conclusion, while the insider sell by Joseph Erlinger is noteworthy, it should be considered within the broader context of McDonald's Corp's financial health, market position, and valuation. Investors should conduct their due diligence, taking into account various factors such as the company's earnings, growth prospects, competitive landscape, and overall market sentiment. As always, insider transactions are just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to making informed investment decisions."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, to which McDonald's belongs, has gained 9.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", ""For the current quarter, McDonald's is expected to post earnings of $2.80 per share, indicating a change of +8.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.7% over the last 30 days."", 'For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.75 points to a change of +16.3% from the prior year.

Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial."", ""In the case of McDonald's, the consensus sales estimate of $6.46 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +9%. The $25.55 billion and $27.2 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.2% and +6.5%, respectively."", 'Last Reported Results and Surprise History', ""McDonald's reported revenues of $6.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14%.

His insider status and deep involvement with the company make his trading activities particularly noteworthy to investors seeking insights into the company's health and prospects."", ""Lyft Inc operates as a peer-to-peer marketplace for on-demand ridesharing in the United States and Canada. The company offers a range of mobility services, including traditional ride-sharing, bike and scooter rentals, car rentals, and transit integration. Lyft's platform is designed to connect drivers with passengers who need a ride, and it has expanded its offerings to include a multimodal transportation network aimed at reducing the need for personal car ownership."", ""Insider trading activities, such as buys and sells, can provide valuable clues about a company's internal perspective on its stock's valuation and future prospects. In the case of Lyft Inc, the recent sell by John Zimmer is part of a broader pattern observed over the past year. Zimmer has sold a total of 57,453 shares and has not made any purchases. This could signal a lack of confidence from the insider in the company's short-term growth potential or simply a personal financial decision."", ""When examining the relationship between insider trading and stock price, it's important to consider the context and magnitude of the trades. While Zimmer's sell is substantial, it is just one of 13 insider sells over the past year, compared to 3 insider buys. This trend might suggest a bearish sentiment among those with intimate knowledge of the company's workings."", ""However, it's crucial to analyze these insider activities in conjunction with the stock's performance and valuation metrics.

The insider selling trend, in this case, might lean towards the latter interpretation, suggesting that insiders are not convinced the stock will rebound to its historical valuation levels in the near term."", 'The insider trend image above provides a visual representation of the buying and selling activities of insiders at Lyft Inc. The predominance of selling over buying could be interpreted as a lack of confidence among insiders, which may influence investor sentiment and contribute to bearish pressure on the stock price.', 'The GF Value image further illustrates the discrepancy between the current stock price and the estimated intrinsic value. This gap may attract value investors looking for discounted opportunities, but the insider selling trend could deter them, as it suggests potential underlying issues that are not reflected in the public financial statements or growth forecasts.', ""John Zimmer's recent sell of 18,255 shares of Lyft Inc is a significant event that warrants attention from investors. While insider sells are not always indicative of a company's health, the pattern of sells over the past year, combined with the stock's low price-to-GF-Value ratio, suggests that investors should approach Lyft Inc with caution. The insider trend and valuation metrics provide a mixed picture, and it is essential for investors to conduct thorough due diligence and consider all available information before making investment decisions."", ""As Lyft Inc navigates the competitive and rapidly evolving ride-sharing market, insider trading activities will continue to be a valuable barometer for investor sentiment and confidence in the company's future.

Based on Tractor Supply Co's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of Tractor Supply Co stock as of today is approximately 6.30%."", ""To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-09-30, Tractor Supply Co's dividend payout ratio is 0.39. Tractor Supply Co's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers.

The company has reported positive net income for each year over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability."", ""To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Tractor Supply Co's growth rank of 10 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is strong relative to its competitors. Tractor Supply Co's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. The company's revenue has increased by approximately 22.30% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 84.83% of global competitors. The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Tractor Supply Co's earnings increased by approximately 27.50% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 71.43% of global competitors. Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 25.00%, which outperforms approximately 80.62% of global competitors."", ""In conclusion, Tractor Supply Co's consistent dividend increases, coupled with a reasonable payout ratio and high profitability rank, indicate a strong foundation for continued dividend payments. The company's robust growth metrics further bolster confidence in its ability to sustain and potentially increase dividends in the future. For value investors seeking to capitalize on dividend-paying stocks, Tractor Supply Co presents a compelling case.

Tesla’s deliveries in China are recovering. The company’s newest factory in Texas has ramped production and should contribute to improved domestic sales and margins. U.S. government policies have lowered the cost to own Tesla vehicles, while also reducing the company’s battery production expenses.', 'We continue to believe that Tesla is only scratching the surface of its potential. We regard announced partnerships between Tesla and its competitors in the quarter as important. In early June, Tesla agreed to provide Ford Motors access to Tesla’s electric vehicle (EV) charging technology and network. Other traditional and pure EV manufacturers, including General Motors, Rivian, and Volvo, quickly followed suit. We expect additional charging partnerships to ensue. In our view, these relationships validate Tesla’s charging technology and infrastructure as superior to other standards. Consolidation around a single technology should accelerate charging infrastructure deployment, diminish the risk of Tesla’s technology becoming obsolete, and lessen a key concern of hesitant EV purchasers. EV adoption is at a tipping point. And Tesla, with its approximately 60% domestic market share of EVs, should be the most important beneficiary of this shift…”\xa0 (Click here to read the full text)', ""Click to continue reading and see Philippe Laffont's Top 5 Stock Picks."", 'Suggested Articles:', '15 Most Advanced Countries in the World', '10 Stocks Under $50 To Buy', '15 Most Famous Investment Gurus of All Time', 'Disclosure.

To skip our detailed analysis of the global urban planning and infrastructure industry in 2023 and its relationship with economic development, go directly and see 5 Most Walkable Cities in Europe.', ""It has been widely known for decades that sound infrastructural development is an absolutely critical predeterminant for stable economic growth and progress. According to a research paper by the Brookings Institution, good infrastructure facilitates seamless trade, powers economic activity, connects workers and ensures their physical and mental wellbeing thereby encouraging maximum output from labor, creates opportunities for struggling communities, and proves to be a reliable safeguard for states in an increasingly volatile natural and geopolitical atmosphere, especially in some of the most walkable cities. The paper outlines that more than sixty million people globally have jobs in fields directly related to infrastructure. From locomotive engineers and electrical power line installers, to road and construction workers, infrastructure jobs account for more than eleven percent of the United States' workforce. According to an estimation by PwC, the global infrastructure industry is well positioned for significant growth, with a current valuation of $2.57 trillion as of 2023. It is projected to reach $3.48 trillion by 2028, at a CAGR of 6.27% during the forecast period 2023-2028. Some of the most prominent players in the global infrastructure industry are Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), and Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP).

One of the primary trends emerging within the industry as a shift towards territorialism and the transformation of allegiances. The report highlights that the world is currently seeing a conscious pull away from geopolitical consensus with numerous fracture points now emerging - whether it be on regional lines, political lines, trade lines, or economic lines - and are significantly degenerating the advancements made by globalization. However, there is still some optimism around the fact that infrastructure may be one of those areas where common ground and consensus can still be achieved as people on all sides of the political spectrum can agree that there is a profound requirement for new and improved infrastructure. In a political environment where institutional trust is at its lowest ebb ever, infrastructural development has the potential to be the tissue that connects people and renews their faith in the government. For global infrastructural players like Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), and Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP), this fracturing to continuously shift allegiances is proving to be an incredibly significant roadblock with traditional supply chains now seeming as the riskier option. Prices seem to be more volatile and regulation much more fragmented. Hence, these infrastructure players are adapting by keeping their new geopolitical and supply chain security lenses on a pivot, and increasing their awareness and adaptability capabilities, especially in relation to the most walkable cities in Europe and America.', 'According to a report by PwC, the resumption of travel, supply chain turbulence, and drastic shifts in consumer behavior are beginning to impact every sector of the infrastructure industry. Post the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a surge in public transport and road infrastructure usage, causing demand and revenues to skyrocket in the aftermath of 2022. Furthermore, the pandemic shifted much of the labor force to remote conditions, which has consequently impacted other related industries like real estate. The shift from mass mobility to micro-mobility is now on the backward trend, which is also a significant determinant in all future infrastructure planning. Within such a precarious and complex climate, players within the infrastructure industry have now been contemplating localized supply chain. The effects of these rapid shifts are likely to be seen in operational resilience, technology adoption, affordability, and sustainability. Companies like Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), and Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP) have already introduced new assessment criteria such as responsiveness, adaptability, and resilience to complement existing parameters such as cost and quality. They have also deployed supply chain visibility tools which provide transparency into capacity restrictions. Furthermore, companies are ramping up investments in technology in order to develop predictive models for proactive scheduling and dynamic planning which in turn, account for uncertainties and risks.

Hence, walkability is a critical juncture which can prove to be an advantageous prospect in three main areas, primarily with respect to health, economic progress and sustainability. Some of the traditional players within the infrastructure industry like Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), and Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP) have begun to adopt walkability is an important urban solution thereby releasing conceptual and practical tensions with respect to transport infrastructure.', 'According to a report by McKinsey, more than sixty percent of the global population is likely to be residing in urban centers by 2030, up from 49% in 2023. Within the same period, more than 2 billion people are likely to be knocking at the door of the middle class, with a majority of them residing in emerging markets like China and India. The report warns that existing infrastructure will not be able to support such a massive shift in global demographics with congestion already being a substantial problem in many of the major cities across the world. Companies have often cited lack of sustainable infrastructure as one of their primary reservations when considering new market entries. Hence, investing in walkability solutions in a bold, coordinated manner from the public and private sector could prove to be a game changer for the industry. Pedestrian zones are not an entirely new concept; however, greater investments in such a direction can prove to have incredibly positive implications for urban mobility in the most walkable cities in the world. Cities across the world are opening car-free zones for the benefit of pedestrians and cyclists.', 'Photo by Désirée Krennrich on Unsplash', ""To compile our list of the 20 most walkable cities in Europe, we decided to undertake a consensus-based approach using a diverse variety of credible sources (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). We then shortlisted more than 50 European cities which appeared most frequently during our research. Since walkability is an incredibly multifaceted and complex phenomenon, we established a three-pronged criteria to measure the walkability of each city; the criteria is premised on each city's pedestrian infrastructure (20 points), urban design (15 points) and environment and activities (10 points). Data on each city's pedestrian infrastructure and urban design was obtained through Eltis. Safety was ascertained through the local police department's records of each city. We then proceeded to award each city a cumulative score according to the aforementioned criteria and selected 20 cities which scored the highest points. Subsequently, we ranked each entry based on the total points scored, from lowest to highest.

In August this year, news agency Reuters reported that Halvorsen was planning to reopen the long/short flagship fund of Viking Global for new capital. In 2011, Halvorsen had closed the fund because it had become too big to explore profitable trading opportunities. The move comes as equity funds become leading gainers.

Healthcare, an important consideration for retirees, is becoming more and more inaccessible. CBS News reported that in 2022 alone, nearly 40% of Americans have been reported to skip their necessary medical care because of the inability to afford it. As quoted by the Economist, America\'s healthcare system is particularly ""dysfunctional"", with many middlemen taking a huge slice of the pie in terms of profits. “The big health”, as they like to call it, comprising of drug distributors, insurers, chemists, and similar professions, have reported a combined revenue equating to 45% of America’s healthcare bill in 2022 alone.', ""While Americans are struggling with medical care costs, the nation's largest private health insurers are reporting substantial financial gains. For the year 2022, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported more than $20 billion in profits, Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV); $6 billion, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) $4.2 billion, and The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) reported $6.7 billion. Moreover, in the first six months of 2023, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported $184.8 billion in revenue and $11.1 billion in profits. In the specific case of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), it is believed that their revenues have not only grown because people deferred care during the pandemic, but also because the health giants hold a bigger piece of the healthcare system."", ""By directing its members toward its own healthcare providers, the company retains a more substantial portion of the premium dollars. This business model is increasingly becoming attractive to other companies such as Bright Health, who are now following in its footsteps. Nevertheless, while nearly 28 million Americans don't even have health insurance, those who do don't have sufficient access to it. According to a survey from KFF, a nonprofit health research group, majority of Americans having healthcare insurance report facing obstacles in getting coverage. Some of these obstacles include high bills, lack of doctors, and even denied-medical-care. Respondents also report having trouble paying their share of costs when covered."", 'To quote an example, internal records of The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) that have been reviewed by ProPublica and The Capitol Forum, imply that the company has been saving millions by rejecting claims on medical grounds. Cigna Doctors don’t even bother to open patient files, as claimed by the report. As of 2022, over 300,000 requests for payments have been rejected, leaving patients with unexpected bills to pay. While The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) reports these claims to be “biased and incomplete”, former doctors quote that the review system at the company has been quick to reject claims.', 'Another way such insurance companies are delaying or denying care is by requiring pre-authorization for routine care and even life-saving treatments. This step delays and even denies the care required by patients. As a result, insurance companies keep making billions, and the average American struggles to pay the costs.', 'Owing to the rising costs of living and inaccessible, often expensive healthcare; many Americans are now choosing to retire overseas. The US Department of State notes that more than 760,000 beneficiaries abroad receive $6.1 billion in Social Security benefits each year. There are many countries where expats are choosing to retire, depending on their needs. For example, one popular overseas retirement destination for Americans is Canada, favored for its high quality of life and proximity to the United States. A total of 71,376 social security benefits were withdrawn from the country in 2021, followed by Japan.', 'While many expats who reside in countries such as Canada and Japan consider quality of life a top priority, many others opt for the cheapest and safest countries for retirement, such as Hungary, Romania, Chile, and Mongolia. For yet many others, affordable healthcare is the way to go. However, the best country to retire to is one that offers the best of everything. As such, good-quality healthcare, affordable living costs, and a safe environment should be top priorities for an expat. For this reason, we have curated a list of the best expat retirement countries in the world.', 'Pradit.Ph / Shutterstock.com', 'To compile the list of best expat retirement countries in the world, we have used the Expat Insider Survey 2023 report, our list of best countries for expats, and the 2023 Natixis Global Retirement Index.

The country has been deemed as one of the most prosperous non-European countries to move to. Expat Insider Survey 2023 notes that 63% of expats are happy with their life in the country, and 95% are particularly happy with the natural environment it offers. The cost of living is a bit of a challenge here for those on limited budgets, with a retiree requiring $50,570 a year for comfortable living.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 5.67', 'One of the easiest countries to retire to, Panama stands tall in our list due to its affordable cost of living, tropical climate, and attractive retirement visa. The Panama Pensionado Program is considered to be one of the best retirement programs in the world, offering incentives such as 25% off on utility bills, 15% discount on loans, 10% discount on medicines, and much more.

However, the friendly locals aren’t the only reason this country makes it to our list of best expat retirement countries in the world.\xa0 The country makes it to our list also because of its affordable cost of living, ease of retirement, rich culture, and great weather.

From its Mediterranean climate to its pristine beaches and lush greenery, the country is a beautiful place to spend one’s retirement years. American expats can retire here by applying for a residence permit and demonstrating a regular income of at least $2,200. Since Greece is a tax-free retirement country, expats don’t need to pay taxes on the same income twice.\xa0 The quality of healthcare is high, the doctors are well-trained, and many of them speak English.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 7', ""Vietnam, one of the cheapest and safest countries to retire to, is ideal for the retiree seeking a peaceful and affordable lifestyle.

If you want to read about some more stocks in the Halvorsen portfolio, go directly to Andreas Halvorsen Stock Portfolio: 5 Top Stock Picks.', 'Andreas Halvorsen, the billionaire chief of Viking Global, is a Viking in the true sense of the word, hailing from Norway and serving in the Norwegian military for a short period. The world of finance is a lot different than the Norwegian Naval Academy, but Halvorsen has managed to hack both. His net worth is close to $6 billion and the value of the 13F equity portfolio of his fund, at the end of September 2023, was in excess of $24 billion, with sizable stakes in firms like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).', 'Halvorsen earned an undergraduate degree in economics from the Williams College in the United States in 1986. He also has a postgraduate business degree from Stanford. He got his first taste in finance while working for Morgan Stanley straight out of college. Afterwards, he moved to Tiger Management under Julian Robertson, one of the biggest hedge funds in the world at the time. In 1999, he left the fund to co-found his own investment firm alongside David Ott and Brian Olson.', 'Even though Ott and Olson left the firm in 2010 and 2005 respectively, Halvorsen has marched on to even greater success. In August this year, news agency Reuters reported that Halvorsen was planning to reopen the long/short flagship fund of Viking Global for new capital. In 2011, Halvorsen had closed the fund because it had become too big to explore profitable trading opportunities. The move comes as equity funds become leading gainers. Per latest figures, the value of the equity portfolio at Viking increased by $200 million in the past three months.\xa0', 'Our Methodology', 'These were picked from the investment portfolio of Viking Global at the end of the third quarter of 2023. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details.

Here is what the fund said:', '“APi Group Corporation (NYSE:APG) – The investment thesis remains the same: APi Group has a wonderful asset-light fire/life safety business whose customers are legally required to purchase their type of services. This business has grown organically at mid- to high single digits with incremental growth coming from tuck-in acquisitions. With very low customer churn for their non-discretionary services, APi revenues and earnings should grow with the passage of time, and 2024 earnings should benefit from the resolution of supply chain issues and the company’s full digestion of its large acquisition, Chubb. Our returns should come from a combination of improved earnings through organic growth, small acquisitions, and margin improvement. The real “juice,” if there is any, will come from multiple expansion, as there are several asset-light non-cyclical business trading at >2x APG’s multiple.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 225\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', 'Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:META) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:', '“As for other quarterly contributors, Alphabet, Inc., (GOOG) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) added to their exceptional year-to-date returns. Meta Platforms and Alphabet were the true year-to-date standouts. After steep declines in 2022, both stocks rebounded sharply due to a combination of solid fundamentals, disciplined operational execution, and improved sentiment. Despite outsized gains and attention, we think both Alphabet and Meta remain undervalued.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 111\xa0', 'UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) operates as a diversified healthcare firm.

The company continues to diversify its top management positions, where 40% of top management positions are held by women, up from 37% in 2020.

At first, the position led to a small loss in Q2 when the UK CMA initially blocked the deal in April, but we stayed close to the case, analyzed the FTC trial and scaled up the ATVI position as it became apparent FTC had a weak case, meaning the probability of the deal going through was mispriced by the market since the companies would likely find a solution to work with the UK CMA (only global regulator who had an issue) if the FTC lost.”', 'Click to continue reading and see Andreas Halvorsen Stock Portfolio: 5 Top Stock Picks', 'Suggested Articles:', '12 Best Nancy Pelosi Stocks To Buy', 'Top 10 Green Hydrogen Companies in the World', '15 Best Self-Driving Car Stocks To Buy', 'Disclosure.

Sure, they’re not the sexiest investment category to target. However, the concept of a continued rise in the capital market might be stretching credulity.', 'For one thing, we must consider the technical dynamic. Indeed, the benchmark S&P 500 gained over 9% of value since the close of the Oct. 27 session. Since the start of the year, the index returned nearly 18%. However, it’s still conspicuously below the peak closing value set at the end of July. Put another way, it’s not entirely clear if enough of a correction has materialized.', 'Second, the bounce back seems suspect given the state of the consumer economy. To be fair, the latest read on inflation presents encouraging data. However, prices remain grossly elevated compared to pre-pandemic norms. As pressures extend, a greater correction may be necessary to rid the market fully of toxicities.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Thus, with uncertainties still in the air, these wide-moat stocks offer substantial relevance.', 'Source: VanderWolf Images / Shutterstock.com', 'A multinational aerospace and defense conglomerate, RTX (NYSE:RTX) offers a range of solutions critical for national security. These include guided missiles, air defense systems, satellites, drones and cybersecurity. At the moment, the company features a market capitalization of around $116 billion. However, it’s on a relative discount. Since the January opener, RTX dropped 20%.', 'To be sure, excessive red ink is often a warning sign. However, RTX could be a strong candidate for overlooked wide-moat stocks. Presently, RTX trades at a forward earnings multiple of 15.49X. In contrast, the sector median stat comes in at 16.56x. Also, shares trade at 1.67x book value. Here, the industry median is much higher at 2.52x.', 'Fundamentally, current and ongoing geopolitical flashpoints should make RTX incredibly relevant. Also, tensions only seem to be rising, not fading. Now, while analysts only rate RTX a hold with a modest average price target of $84.18, the high-side target stands at $105.', 'Source: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock', 'An e-commerce firm focused on handmade or vintage items and craft supplies, it’s easy to see why Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) ranks among the overlooked wide-moat stocks. With inflation and rising borrowing costs broadly impeding consumer sentiment, discretionary spending isn’t high on households’ agendas. Sure enough, ETSY fell around 37% since the beginning of the year.', 'However, Etsy offers a distinct if not unique platform. Sure, e-commerce sites are a dime a dozen. But where Etsy distinguishes itself is that it directly focuses on creatives seeking to transition their talents and hobbies into legitimate businesses. Under present circumstances, the possibility of increased income streams should be appealing.', 'Even with the tough economic backdrop, Etsy continues to grow. For example, in the third quarter, the company posted $636 million in revenue, up 7% against the year-ago quarter. So, the red ink in the charts could be an opportunity. Analysts rate ETSY a consensus moderate buy with a $74.39 target. However, the max target stands at $125.', 'Source: mimohe / Shutterstock.com', 'As a stalwart in the athletic apparel and equipment industry, Nike (NYSE:NKE) doesn’t appear to be one of the overlooked wide-moat stocks. Narrative wise, it’s difficult to say that the brand is overlooked considering that everybody is familiar with it. However, it hasn’t performed that well this year in the price charts. Since the January opener, NKE slipped 9%.', 'For full disclosure, the traditional financial stats undergirding NKE don’t really scream value. For example, shares trade at 28.6x forward earnings, well above the 11.63X ratio for the broader apparel industry. Also, it trades at 3.27x trailing sales, which seems overheated. However, Nike’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 11.6%, above nearly 75% of its peers.', 'In other words, people continue to buy Nike products despite pressures to the consumer economy. And that’s clear based on the consistency of its gross margins. Analysts peg NKE a moderate buy with a $118.48 price target. Further, the high-side target stands at $150.', 'Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.com', 'As a giant in the cosmetics space, Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) wouldn’t ordinarily constitute one of the overlooked wide-moat stocks. However, since the start of the year, EL plunged 50%. It’s not without reason, either. Recently, the company disclosed that slower China demand negatively impacted its earnings performance. Still, a possible turnaround may be in play.', 'For example, in the trailing five sessions, EL popped up 7%. Some of this robust upside sentiment could be due to contrarian speculators trying to blow up the bears’ position. For instance, Fintel’s options flow screener – which filters exclusively for big block trades likely made by institutions – shows a large swathe of long-expiry sold calls.', 'To be sure, the financials could use some serious work. However, the company is consistently profitable. If the beauty care specialist can gain some traction, Estee Lauder could be interesting. Analysts rate EL a moderate buy with a $138.74 target. Also, the max target clocks in at $200.', 'Source: solarseven / Shutterstock', 'A multinational conglomerate, Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) is an industrial and applied science stalwart. Again, under normal circumstances, you wouldn’t expect to find HON on a list of overlooked wide-moat stocks. After all, Honeywell commands a market cap of around $125 billion. Still, it’s been a choppy ride. Since the start of the year, HON slipped 11%.', 'However, circumstances appear to be moving in a favorable direction recently. In late October, the company posted strong Q3 results and also beat its earnings guidance. Also, since hitting a recent bottom on Oct. 26, HON gained about 8%.', 'In full disclosure, the traditional financial stats for Honeywell aren’t exactly pretty. For example, HON trades at 19X forward earnings, which is overcooked. Still, the company is on an uptrend. Since 2020 to the trailing-12-month (TTM) basis, revenue has been consistently growing.', 'Analysts are overall bullish on HON, pegging it a moderate buy with a $215.42 price target. Further, the high-side target is $265.', 'Source: chrisdorney / Shutterstock', 'Over the past several months, I’ve become sort of a Disney (NYSE:DIS) whisperer. Back in April of this year, CGTN America invited me to discuss the political woes impacting the Magic Kingdom. At the time, circumstances got heated between Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and the entertainment giant over certain hot-button issues. Ultimately, I viewed the matter as a free speech versus family sensibility issue.', 'More recently, Disney found itself in hot water with Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) and its Spectrum brand. This time, a conflict erupted over carriage fees. Again, I was asked by CGTN America to chime in with my analysis. Granted, while these two headwinds have largely simmered down (for the moment), it’s understandable why DIS may be considered one of the overlooked wide-moat stocks.', 'Nevertheless, I believe Disney does enjoy a moat despite its troubles. Sure, you’re going to pay a premium relative to earnings. However, this is a company that’s been consistently growing the top line since the pandemic-disrupted fiscal year 2020. Not shockingly, analysts rate DIS a moderate buy with a $107.23 target, implying over 14% growth.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock', 'Commanding a market cap of nearly $32 billion, Corteva (NYSE:CTVA) doesn’t immediately strike investors as one of the overlooked wide-moat stocks. Rather, the latter description – that of having a wide moat – seems much more appropriate. After all, the company represents a major agricultural chemical and seed enterprise. It’s extremely valuable to the global food supply chain.', 'However, Wall Street has other ideas, which is why it’s underappreciated among many investors at the moment. Since the start of the year, CTVA crumbled almost 21%. In the past 52 weeks, the security dipped more than 28%, which is problematic. Still, the red ink also means that shares now trade at 1.31x book value. This stat compares to the sector median value of 1.66x.', 'Fundamentally, it’s arguably difficult to maintain a bearish posture on CTVA indefinitely. That’s because the geopolitical realm which is impacting energy prices also affects food resources. At some point, we will need to bolster this industry, which may bode well for CTVA.', 'Finally, analysts peg shares a strong buy with a $56.43 target, implying nearly 21% upside.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

But in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, the The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) share price is 62% higher than it was five years ago, which is more than the market average. The 3.1% share price rise over the last year is decent, but not great.', ""So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Procter & Gamble ', ""To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", ""During five years of share price growth, Procter & Gamble achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 10% per year. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 10% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth."", ""The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers)."", ""Dive deeper into Procter & Gamble's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Procter & Gamble's earnings, revenue and cash flow."", 'It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Procter & Gamble the TSR over the last 5 years was 84%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.', ""Procter & Gamble shareholders gained a total return of 5.7% during the year. But that was short of the market average. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 13% over five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Procter & Gamble  you should be aware of."", 'For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.', 'Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.', 'Have feedback on this article?

That said, the lack of existing homes for sale in the market along with a desire to own a home has been driving demand. Also, the companies’ focus on cost control, increased operating leverage and important buyouts have been boosting the confidence of the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry players. Companies like D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI, Lennar Corporation LEN, KB Home KBH, M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. MDC and Dream Finders Homes, Inc. DFH have been gaining from their fundamental strength and the above-mentioned tailwinds.', 'Industry Description', 'The Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry comprises manufacturers of residential and commercial buildings. Some industry players are involved in providing financial services that include selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance agencies as well as closing services. The industry players are involved in building single-family detached and attached home communities; townhouses, condominiums, duplexes and triplexes; master-planned luxury residential resort-style golf communities; and urban low, mid, and high-rise communities. The companies are also involved in the purchase, development and sale of residential land. Additionally, the companies build and own multi-family rental properties, residential real estate, and oil and gas assets.', ""4 Trends Shaping the Homebuilding Industry's Future"", 'Lack of Supply: There is a sizable shortage of new homes after more than a decade of under-building compared with population growth. Although demand has slowed recently, supply remains very low. Continued demand for homes despite rising mortgage interest rates amid low supply has been generating profit for homebuilders. Meanwhile, the changing geography of housing demand has been supporting builder confidence.Despite a continued decline in builder sentiment in November, recent macroeconomic indicators suggest a positive outlook for home construction in the upcoming months. Specifically, the 10-year Treasury rate has reverted to the 4.5% range, marking the first occurrence since late September. This shift is expected to bring mortgage rates to, or even below, 7.5%. With a limited supply of existing homes, the anticipated slight decrease in mortgage rates is likely to stimulate housing demand, laying the groundwork for builders to perceive improved market conditions in the months ahead. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) is predicting a roughly 5% uptick in single-family starts in 2024, as financial conditions improve alongside favorable inflation data in the coming months.Cost-Control Efforts, Focus on Entry-Level Buyers & Acquisitions: Given the accelerated raw material prices, companies have been relying on effective cost control and focusing on making the homebuilding platform more efficient, which, in turn, is resulting in higher operating leverage. Homebuilders have been controlling construction costs by designing homes efficiently and obtaining construction materials and labor at competitive prices. Some homebuilders also follow a dynamic pricing model, which enables them to set the price according to the latest market conditions.Again, the majority of companies are focused on the growing demand for entry-level homes and addressing the need for lower-priced homes, given affordability concerns in the U.S. housing market. Meanwhile, industry players have been acquiring other homebuilding companies in desirable markets, resulting in improved volumes, market share, revenues and profitability.Higher Rates: The home affordability issue remains a headwind owing to accelerating mortgage rates. While remaining committed to combating inflation, the Fed raised interest rates last year at the fastest pace since the 1980s, pushing borrowing costs above 5% from near zero. In September 2023, the Federal Reserve kept the interest rate unchanged after having raised its policy rate by 525 basis points (bps) since March 2022 to the current 5.25%-5.50% range (the highest level in the past 22 years) while leaving its options open on future rate hikes. This is less encouraging for this rate-sensitive market, which accounts for almost 3% of the economy.Tight Labor & Credit Markets: The shortage of skilled construction labor continues to be a pressing concern. With the rising demand for construction, the industry requires more skilled professionals, which is vital to America’s economy. Meanwhile, there still exists supply shortages of building materials as well as tightening credit conditions for residential real estate development and construction due to the recent banking crisis and higher interest rates.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects', 'The Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry is a 17-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #87, which places it in the top 35% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a higher earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

It suggested that ASTA’s complaint represents an effort by some travel agencies to impede the pace of innovation due to their reluctance to invest in new technologies.', '“ASTA’s complaint is not an effort to protect consumers: it is an effort to protect certain agencies,” said American. “It is a plea to the government, on behalf of some travel agencies, to slow the pace of innovation for those agencies that have not invested in new technologies or adjusted old ways of doing business.”', 'In a complaint filed in July with the Department of Transport (DOT), ASTA said that by removing over 40% of its fare inventory from traditional, i.e., non-NDC, booking channels, American Airlines was causing substantially higher air ticket prices for consumers, indirectly impacting the ability of travel agents to do their job .', 'In its response, filed on Tuesday, American Airlines stated that NDC is more transparent than the older Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce, and Transport (EDIFACT) technologies. The airline said it continues to make all fares viewable and comparable in both EDIFACT and NDC channels.', 'American Airlines has made more changes to its distribution strategy than nearly any giant carrier in the world, since around 2006. Its response echoed the sentiments of CEO Robert Isom, expressed earlier in November at the Skift Aviation Forum, that NDC is a “competitive and consumer-friendly advancement” in the travel industry.', 'The lengthy response to the DOT sees American emphasize the NDC-enabled transparency for consumers.', '“The evidence shows that customers are (understandably) more satisfied with flexible and responsive NDC-enabled technologies than with dated Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce, and Transport (“EDIFACT”) technologies launched in the 1970s,” said American. “And for good reason: Customers who are given more information can select what they value, and they understand what they are buying… There is no evidence in ASTA’s 50-plus-page complaint that American’s NDC plans have led to higher prices or fewer options on any route, increased American’s alleged dominance, or otherwise harmed consumers. ”', '“ASTA’s complaint is limited to the fact that American does not allow all of its fares to be transactable using EDIFACT. That may be problematic for agencies stuck in the old way of doing business, but customers, of course, can still get access to those fares through AA.com, meta-search travel sites, and/or by using other agencies that have adopted NDC,” said American. “In that case, an agency need only do what is best for the client — explain that another fare is available at a lower price on AA.com or through other third-party booking tools and agencies using more modern technologies.”', 'American Airlines further argued that its changes to ticket distribution have spurred other U.S. airlines, including United Airlines, to adopt NDC-based technologies.', '“United Airlines has implemented changes that have resulted in as much as 40% of all sales being fares that are only accessible through its NDC channel and, as of September 5, 2023, has entirely removed Basic Economy offerings from EDIFACT. (Mysteriously, ASTA seems fine with both of United’s efforts.)” said American.', 'The airline further stated that agencies in America were lagging in technology adoption to the detriment of U.S. consumers.', '“In fact, many of the agencies now complaining about NDC efforts are already using these same technologies in other countries. Regrettably, though, agencies based in the United States lag far behind in NDC adoption, which is the real harm to American consumers,” said American.', 'As the process moves forward, the DOT is expected to review the response and determine the next steps. This could involve further investigation or potentially a ruling on the complaint, shaping the future dynamics of airline distribution and travel agency operations.', 'Skift has reached out to ASTA for further comment.', 'Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.']"

Plus, sales of $125.61 million came in 11% better than expected.', ""Rocky Brands attributed the strong results to product improvement which resulted in reduced inventory levels and an acceleration in at-once orders from key wholesale partners with some of the company's brands including Rocky Outdoor Gear, Durango, and Dickies."", ""Year over year, Rocky Brands' Q3 earnings soared 47% from $0.74 a share in the prior year quarter despite sales falling -15%.

Even better, FY24 EPS estimates have climbed 53% to $2.55 per share compared to estimates of $1.66 a share 30 days ago.', ""Attractive Valuation: Trading around $25 a share, Rocky Brands stock is up a respectable +8% this year and the company's P/E valuation also points to the plausibility of more upside.

More concerning, FY25 EPS estimates have dropped -16% over the last month from $10.41 per share to $8.70 a share."", ""Making the glaring drop in annual earnings estimates look even more bleak is that Skyworks' price performance and the inflationary recovery of the Semiconductor-Radio Frequency Industry have largely trailed the broader indexes."", ""While the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have rebounded and soared +19% and +36% this year respectively Skyworks' stock is up a modest +3% with its Zacks Subindustry down -2%.

To skip our detailed analysis of the global urban planning and infrastructure industry in 2023 and its relationship with economic development, go directly and see 5 Most Walkable Cities in Europe.', ""It has been widely known for decades that sound infrastructural development is an absolutely critical predeterminant for stable economic growth and progress. According to a research paper by the Brookings Institution, good infrastructure facilitates seamless trade, powers economic activity, connects workers and ensures their physical and mental wellbeing thereby encouraging maximum output from labor, creates opportunities for struggling communities, and proves to be a reliable safeguard for states in an increasingly volatile natural and geopolitical atmosphere, especially in some of the most walkable cities. The paper outlines that more than sixty million people globally have jobs in fields directly related to infrastructure. From locomotive engineers and electrical power line installers, to road and construction workers, infrastructure jobs account for more than eleven percent of the United States' workforce. According to an estimation by PwC, the global infrastructure industry is well positioned for significant growth, with a current valuation of $2.57 trillion as of 2023. It is projected to reach $3.48 trillion by 2028, at a CAGR of 6.27% during the forecast period 2023-2028. Some of the most prominent players in the global infrastructure industry are Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), and Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP). To read about more players which are dominating the infrastructure industry in 2023, check out our article on the 10 Best Infrastructure Stocks to Buy Now."", 'According to a report by KPMG, 2023 is likely to serve as an inflection point for infrastructural development and economic progress. One of the primary trends emerging within the industry as a shift towards territorialism and the transformation of allegiances. The report highlights that the world is currently seeing a conscious pull away from geopolitical consensus with numerous fracture points now emerging - whether it be on regional lines, political lines, trade lines, or economic lines - and are significantly degenerating the advancements made by globalization. However, there is still some optimism around the fact that infrastructure may be one of those areas where common ground and consensus can still be achieved as people on all sides of the political spectrum can agree that there is a profound requirement for new and improved infrastructure. In a political environment where institutional trust is at its lowest ebb ever, infrastructural development has the potential to be the tissue that connects people and renews their faith in the government. For global infrastructural players like Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), and Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP), this fracturing to continuously shift allegiances is proving to be an incredibly significant roadblock with traditional supply chains now seeming as the riskier option. Prices seem to be more volatile and regulation much more fragmented. Hence, these infrastructure players are adapting by keeping their new geopolitical and supply chain security lenses on a pivot, and increasing their awareness and adaptability capabilities, especially in relation to the most walkable cities in Europe and America.', 'According to a report by PwC, the resumption of travel, supply chain turbulence, and drastic shifts in consumer behavior are beginning to impact every sector of the infrastructure industry. Post the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a surge in public transport and road infrastructure usage, causing demand and revenues to skyrocket in the aftermath of 2022. Furthermore, the pandemic shifted much of the labor force to remote conditions, which has consequently impacted other related industries like real estate. The shift from mass mobility to micro-mobility is now on the backward trend, which is also a significant determinant in all future infrastructure planning. Within such a precarious and complex climate, players within the infrastructure industry have now been contemplating localized supply chain. The effects of these rapid shifts are likely to be seen in operational resilience, technology adoption, affordability, and sustainability. Companies like Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), and Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP) have already introduced new assessment criteria such as responsiveness, adaptability, and resilience to complement existing parameters such as cost and quality. They have also deployed supply chain visibility tools which provide transparency into capacity restrictions. Furthermore, companies are ramping up investments in technology in order to develop predictive models for proactive scheduling and dynamic planning which in turn, account for uncertainties and risks.

Hence, walkability is a critical juncture which can prove to be an advantageous prospect in three main areas, primarily with respect to health, economic progress and sustainability. Some of the traditional players within the infrastructure industry like Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC), Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), and Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP) have begun to adopt walkability is an important urban solution thereby releasing conceptual and practical tensions with respect to transport infrastructure.', 'According to a report by McKinsey, more than sixty percent of the global population is likely to be residing in urban centers by 2030, up from 49% in 2023. Within the same period, more than 2 billion people are likely to be knocking at the door of the middle class, with a majority of them residing in emerging markets like China and India. The report warns that existing infrastructure will not be able to support such a massive shift in global demographics with congestion already being a substantial problem in many of the major cities across the world. Companies have often cited lack of sustainable infrastructure as one of their primary reservations when considering new market entries. Hence, investing in walkability solutions in a bold, coordinated manner from the public and private sector could prove to be a game changer for the industry. Pedestrian zones are not an entirely new concept; however, greater investments in such a direction can prove to have incredibly positive implications for urban mobility in the most walkable cities in the world. Cities across the world are opening car-free zones for the benefit of pedestrians and cyclists.', 'Photo by Désirée Krennrich on Unsplash', ""To compile our list of the 20 most walkable cities in Europe, we decided to undertake a consensus-based approach using a diverse variety of credible sources (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). We then shortlisted more than 50 European cities which appeared most frequently during our research. Since walkability is an incredibly multifaceted and complex phenomenon, we established a three-pronged criteria to measure the walkability of each city; the criteria is premised on each city's pedestrian infrastructure (20 points), urban design (15 points) and environment and activities (10 points). Data on each city's pedestrian infrastructure and urban design was obtained through Eltis. Safety was ascertained through the local police department's records of each city. We then proceeded to award each city a cumulative score according to the aforementioned criteria and selected 20 cities which scored the highest points. Subsequently, we ranked each entry based on the total points scored, from lowest to highest.

In our view, these relationships validate Tesla’s charging technology and infrastructure as superior to other standards. Consolidation around a single technology should accelerate charging infrastructure deployment, diminish the risk of Tesla’s technology becoming obsolete, and lessen a key concern of hesitant EV purchasers.

For the climate sector, this is no exception and Climate Week NYC kicked it off with a bigger-than-ever crowd, next it was VERGE in San Jose, culminating to COP28.', 'The development of many conversations and discussions in this space, more than usual, left me feeling hopeful. Hopeful because it felt that an overwhelming number of climate conversations explored specific topics deeply, were centered on action today, and strove to rise above, or even slice through, the depths of jargon that often make it difficult to get to the ""so what really are we going to do about it?"" part of important conversations. These critical sentiments, conversations and questions explored included the following.', 'There is no ""Net Zero"" without nature.', ""For a while now, climate action is often used simultaneously with carbon reduction. To reduce carbon, we look to engineering new, more sustainable, efficient technologies. However, in a comprehensive carbon strategy, there are solutions to reduce carbon emissions, remove carbon from the atmosphere, and protect or preserve natural carbon sinks. In recent years and conferences, airtime and large-scale efforts by large stakeholders were often paying most attention to the reduction of emissions as well as engineered carbon removal. It was prevalent in this year's events that a multitude of actors and capital providers showed up energized, informed, and ready to ensure nature-based solutions alongside the preservation and restoration of nature not only were present in strategic discussions, but center stage in them."", 'How do underserved communities themselves define a ""Just Energy Transition""?', 'Thankfully, the intersectionality of inclusion and clean energy is a shared interest across the climate space. However, as commonly occurs, this intersection was given a jargony title that we began seeing painted across projects, strategies, and conversations at length. As the title became common and shared, I could not help but question if we - both the diverse climate community as well as the public - really do have a shared, comprehensive definition of what this phrase means and if this meaning is still capturing the voices of underserved communities themselves. Reflecting on such, I took the opportunity to ask a local Indigenous leader from Arizona and an inner-city community leader from New York City what this phrase meant to them and was both enlightened and refreshed by their different takes on the same topic. Additionally, Nantu Canelos, Director of Territorial Autonomy of Cisco Foundation grantee, Kara Solar, also shared their thoughts on the topic, ""In the remote communities of the Amazon rainforest such as Achuar territory, where I live, we are transitioning our energy use from gasoline to solar, and from not having energy to having energy. We use solar energy for transportation, for communication, for light, and other purposes. We see energy as a way to improve the lives of our people, and to alleviate pressures on the ecosystems we live in and depend on, which further improves the lives of us humans, creating a beneficial cycle. When we work with technologies, we focus on building local understanding. Local technicians are trained, and solar energy is embedded in the school curriculum so that children learn about it from a young age. In that way we can make sure that the benefits are sustainable, and that this energy transition is truly just."" In a typical pass by interaction, another climate enthusiast shared gratitude for posing this question publicly and expressed that she too found herself reflecting on the intentionality and reality behind and beyond our most used climate jargon. It was clear people were questioning, redefining or even looking past the jargon all around, especially those capturing themes of justice and inclusion.', 'How do we materialize the repetitive call for ""blended"" and ""innovative\' finance?', 'Conversations around climate finance only continue to mature and acknowledge the unique capital stack necessary to reverse the impacts of climate change. Discussions of this week did not harp on ""what"" we need and ""why"", but rather dissected and challenged capital providers of all sorts to think about ""how"". For example, for corporate climate financiers, Salesforce at Climate Week NYC published The Corporate Climate Finance Playbook. Additionally, the Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance (the Lab) endorsed six innovative financial instruments to accelerate climate action in emerging markets, including Cisco Foundation investee, The Catalyst Fund. Maelis Carraro, Managing Partner of Catalyst Fund, shares more about their approach to materializing this call to action, ""Catalyst Fund was intentionally designed as a blended finance structure so that a concessionary capital layer could provide downside risk protection for senior investors and catalyze more private investment to climate adaptation and resilience in Africa. This type of structure can be incredibly powerful in leveraging multiple types of capital (concessionary and commercial) to invest in nascent sectors, underserved and frontier markets, and unlocking benefits to underserved communities. Climate resilience and climate tech more broadly in Africa remain a nascent asset class and we were proud to be endorsed by the CPI Lab as one of this year\'s most innovative instruments for climate adaptation!""', 'We cannot have ""breakthroughs"" in Climate Tech without acknowledging the challenging landscape of Climate Hardware.', 'The 2020 International Energy Agency\'s Clean Energy Innovation perspectives report expresses: ""Almost 35% of the [reductions needed to avoid a 2 degree C temperature rise must] come from technologies that are currently at the prototype or demonstration phase which will not become available at scale without further R&D. About 40% of the cumulative emissions reductions rely on technologies that have not yet been commercially deployed in mass market applications."" This will require new hardware innovation. A sector which has significant capital requirements, long time frames, and a high level of technological risk. To develop these hardware breakthroughs will require capital providers coming together to provide a diverse capital stack as well as potentially a new investment model. Azolla Ventures is an innovative investment fund trying to tackle just that. Matthew Nordan, General Partner at Azolla Ventures shares, ""To avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change, we have to pair both emissions reduction and carbon removal at mass scale. We\'re not going to forestall climate catastrophe solely with the technologies that exist and are ready now such as solar, wind, short-duration energy storage, and electric vehicles. We need new innovations that are neither developed nor deployed today. There is some irony that the innovations that are most potentially impactful are often the ones least likely to be financed at the earliest stages because the risk is so high and the time frame is so long; our approach is purpose-built to fill this gap."" During this conference season, we not only heard these points from Azolla Ventures, but in climate tech roundtables as well as presentations from other investors like Third Sphere.', 'As we continue to provide financing for solutions via the Cisco Foundation Climate Commitment, these discussions and progress in how we think about the solutions we need and how to finance them are vital to the success we will have in playing our part in driving climate action. We are eager, energized, and enthused to continue to co-learn, support, and collectively act alongside an array of innovators, capital providers, ecosystem builders, and visionaries to build a more sustainable and regenerative future.', 'View original content here.', 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.', 'View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/808446/beyond-the-climate-jargon-reflections-from-climate-conference-season-2023']"
