The company is benefiting from steady demand for iPhone 14 and 14 Plus as well as expanding footprint in emerging markets. Growing services subscriber base and improving customer engagement are tailwinds for the services business.Apple is expanding service offerings with the new features and enhancements in its upcoming iOS 17, iPadOS 17, macOS Sonoma, watchOS 10, and tvOS 17. Expanding content on Apple TV+ bodes well for Apple.

Stiff competition from other major players and saturation in the U.S. wireless market is hurting profits.Heavy spending on promotional activities to attract customers is also weighing on margins. Nevertheless, Verizon is witnessing significant 5G adoption and fixed wireless broadband momentum. It is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans that has led to solid customer additions.Strong demand for Fios and fixed wireless products are tailwinds.

2,5cc7b4f5-fd7f-3bfe-bda2-b189c93380fc,NUE,2023-07-06,Nucor Corporation (NUE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucor-corporation-nue-attracting-investor-130011387.html,1688562011,STORY,['NUE'],"[Nucor (NUE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this steel company have returned +15.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.2% change. The Zacks Steel - Producers industry, to which Nucor belongs, has gained 18.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Nucor is expected to post earnings of $5.56 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -42.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.8%.The consensus earnings estimate of $17.95 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -37.7%. This estimate has changed +1.9% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.09 indicates a change of -32.7% from what Nucor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Nucor.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Nucor, the consensus sales estimate of $9.76 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -17.3%. The $36.04 billion and $32.88 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -13.2% and -8.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNucor reported revenues of $8.71 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -17%. EPS of $4.45 for the same period compares with $7.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.5 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.45%. The EPS surprise was +16.8%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nucor is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nucor. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

3,a9d82378-3621-308e-8d70-85779aff1edb,UNM,2023-07-06,5 Value Stocks With Exciting EV-to-EBITDA Ratios to Own Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-value-stocks-exciting-ev-113100307.html,1688556660,STORY,"['GPI', 'ENS', 'DXPE', 'UNM']","[Investors typically have a fixation on the price-to-earnings (P/E) strategy while seeking stocks trading at attractive prices. This straight forward, easy-to-calculate ratio is the most preferred among all the valuation metrics in the investment toolkit for working out the fair market value of a stock. But even this ubiquitously used valuation metric is not without its pitfalls.While P/E enjoys great popularity among value investors, a less-used and more-complicated metric called EV-to-EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative. EV-to-EBITDA gives the true picture of a company’s valuation and earnings potential. It has a more comprehensive approach to valuation.  UFP Industries, Inc. UFPI, Unum Group UNM, EnerSys ENS, DXP Enterprises, Inc. DXPE and Group 1 Automotive, Inc. GPI are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios.EV-to-EBITDA is a Better Substitute, Here’s WhyEV-to-EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company’s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents.The other component of the multiple, EBITDA, gives a better idea of a company’s profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Usually, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more appealing it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could indicate that a stock is potentially undervalued.EV-to-EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company’s balance sheet that the P/E ratio does not. Due to this reason, EV-to-EBITDA is generally used to value the potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume. Stocks boasting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Another shortcoming of P/E is that it can’t be used to value a loss-making firm. A company’s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, EV-to-EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value loss-making companies that are EBITDA positive.EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful yardstick in evaluating the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.But EV-to-EBITDA has its limitations too. The ratio varies across industries (a high-growth industry typically has a higher multiple and vice versa) and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital requirements.Therefore, a strategy solely based on EV-to-EBITDA might not yield the desired results. But you can club it with the other major ratios in your stock-investing toolbox such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to screen value stocks.Story continuesScreening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks:EV-to-EBITDA 12 Months-Most Recent less than X-Industry Median: A lower EV-to-EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation.P/E using (F1) less than X-Industry Median: This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers.P/B less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued.P/S less than X-Industry Median: The lower the P/S ratio, the more attractive the stock is, as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proven its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that passed the screen:UFP Industries supplies wood, wood composite and other products in retail, industrial and construction markets. This Zacks Rank #1 stock has a Value Score of A.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UFP Industries’ current-year earnings has been revised 4.4% upward over the past 60 days. UFPI beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters at an average of 22.7%.Unum Group provides long-term care insurance, life insurance, employer- and employee-paid group benefits and related services.

This Zacks Rank #1 stock has a Value Score of B.EnerSys has an expected year-over-year earnings growth rate of 28.1% for the current fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ENS’s current-year earnings has been revised 11.6% upward over the last 60 days.DXP Enterprises provides innovative pumping solutions, supply-chain services as well as maintenance, repair, operating and production services.

The consensus estimate for DXPE’s current-year earnings has been revised 52.2% upward over the last 60 days.Group 1 Automotive is one of the leading automotive retailers in the world. GPI, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, has a Value Score of A.The consensus estimate for Group 1 Automotive’s current-year earnings has been revised 4% upward over the past 60 days.

Words such as ""believes,"" ""anticipates,"" ""plans,"" ""expects,"" ""seeks,"" ""estimates,"" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, but other statements that are not historical facts may also be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties relating to: the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic; any natural disaster, public health crisis or other catastrophic event; the need to develop new products and adapt to significant technological change; implementation of strategies for improving growth; general economic conditions and related uncertainties; dependence on customers' capital spending policies and government funding policies; the effect of economic and political conditions and exchange rate fluctuations on international operations; use and protection of intellectual property; the effect of changes in governmental regulations; and the effect of laws and regulations governing government contracts, as well as the possibility that expected benefits related to recent or pending acquisitions, including the proposed acquisition of CorEvitas, may not materialize as expected; the proposed acquisition of CorEvitas not being timely completed, if completed at all; regulatory approvals required for the transaction not being timely obtained, if obtained at all, or being obtained subject to conditions; CorEvitas’ business experiencing disruptions as a result of the acquisition or due to transaction-related uncertainty or other factors making it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, customers, other business partners or governmental entities; difficulty retaining key employees; the outcome of any legal proceedings related to the proposed acquisition of CorEvitas; and the parties being unable to successfully implement integration strategies or to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected time-frames or at all.

Thermo Fisher excludes the above items because they are outside of the company's normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. Thermo Fisher believes that the use of non-GAAP measures helps investors to gain a better understanding of the company's core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts.1Adjusted earnings per share is a non-GAAP measure that excludes certain items detailed later in this press release under the heading ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.""View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230706365006/en/ContactsMedia Contact:Sandy PoundPhone: 781-622-1223E-mail: sandy.pound@thermofisher.comInvestor Contact:Rafael TejadaPhone: 781-622-1356E-mail: rafael.tejada@thermofisher.com]"

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.2%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.38%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 9.78%.Coming into today, shares of the maker of scientific instrument and laboratory supplies had gained 0.55% in the past month. In that same time, the Medical sector gained 2.95%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.16%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Thermo Fisher Scientific as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Thermo Fisher Scientific to post earnings of $5.43 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 1.45%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $10.99 billion, up 0.2% from the year-ago period.TMO's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $23.69 per share and revenue of $45.3 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +1.94% and +0.86%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Thermo Fisher Scientific. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Thermo Fisher Scientific is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Story continuesInvestors should also note Thermo Fisher Scientific's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 21.92.

The result was a combined $100,000 donation to these nonprofits.Project Analyst Christine Bailey, one of this year's Legends recipients, selected Girls Garage to receive a donation on her behalf.

A Look At Its Intrinsic Value,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cintas-corporation-nasdaq-ctas-expensive-140019130.html,1688565619,STORY,['CTAS'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Cintas is US$384 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCintas' US$487 share price signals that it might be 27% overvaluedOur fair value estimate is 23% lower than Cintas' analyst price target of US$501Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Cintas Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.57bUS$1.82bUS$1.98bUS$2.06bUS$2.22bUS$2.33bUS$2.43bUS$2.52bUS$2.59bUS$2.67bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 5.06%Est @ 4.18%Est @ 3.56%Est @ 3.12%Est @ 2.82% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$1.5kUS$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$15bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.7b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.1%) = US$50bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$50b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$24bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$39b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$487, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cintas as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.913. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for CintasStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Commercial Services industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Commercial Services market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value?

We expect All Other revenues to jump 19.9% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter.Focus on operational execution, cost-control measures and pricing actions are expected to have supported Cintas’ margin performance.However, the escalating cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses are likely to have dented CTAS’ bottom line in the fiscal fourth quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Cintas this time around.

The GARP approach helps identify stocks priced below the market or any suitable target determined by a fundamental analysis.The strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive prospects and trading at a discount. A portfolio based on the GARP strategy comprises stocks that offer the best of value and growth investing. Ferrari RACE, W.W. Grainger GWW, Allegion ALLE and Edwards Lifesciences EW are some such stocks that hold promise.GARP Metrics — Mix of Growth &amp; Value MetricsThe GARP strategy offers ideal investment options by utilizing the best features of value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach prefer stocks priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. The stocks have solid prospects based on cash flow, revenues, EPS and others.Growth MetricsA strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the primary concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. Growth rates between 5% and 20% are considered ideal under this strategy.Another metric considered by growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with a positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing prioritizes one of the popular value metrics — the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though the investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios than value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. The price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also taken into consideration.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Story continuesScreening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last five-year EPS &amp; projected 3-5-year EPS growth rates between 5% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared with the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than the M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)Here are four of the 11 stocks that made it through the screen:Ferrari is a leading designer and manufacturer of sports cars.

He pleaded guilty in February to 90 counts including 23 counts of hate crime resulting in death under a plea agreement in which he agreed to 90 consecutive life sentences in order to avoid the federal death penalty.Even with that agreement, the judge must conduct a hearing before sentencing. The shooter also faces prosecution from the state of Texas that could result in the death penalty.Gasps and cries could be heard from the packed gallery as Crusius entered the courtroom, according to multiple media reports from journalists witnessing the hearing.The shooter, wearing a blue prison jumpsuit, glasses and shaggy long hair, showed no emotion and avoided looking at victims, reporters said.Victims expressed both a desire for retribution and allowed for the chance of divine forgiveness for the killer.Genesis Davila, who was 12 years old and present while her soccer coach was killed and her mother and father were injured, looked directly at Crusius and told him, ""I want you dead,"" KVIA television reported.""I hate you so much. Hell has a special place for you,"" Davila said.Another victim called him an ""evil parasite,"" the Dallas Morning News reported.""You are nothing without your weapon,"" said Thomas Hoffman, who lost his father, Alexander Hoffman.Story continuesRaul Moya, the brother of a victim, was more charitable, according to KVIA, reading from a statement that said, ""I've tried so bad to forgive what you've done, it's been hard. I hope God forgives you for what you've done.""Just before the massacre, which was carried out with a Romanian derivative of the AK-47 and hollow-point ammunition, the shooter posted on the internet a manifesto that declared, ""This attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.""The shooter's attorney, Joe Spencer, said he could not comment until after sentencing. At the time of the guilty plea in February, Spencer told reporters, ""There are no winners in this case. He's going to be serving 90 consecutive life sentences.""(Reporting by Daniel Trotta in Carlsbad, California; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Jacqueline Wong)]"

In the first quarter of 2023, the company exceeded expectations, with its top and bottom-line figures seeing year-over-year growth.

JWN has been gaining from the continued progress in its key initiatives, improved trends at Nordstrom Rack and supply-chain efficiencies. This led to robust margins in first-quarter fiscal 2023, which, in turn, boosted the bottom-line performance.Notably, the gross profit margin expanded 110 bps year over year to 33.8% for the said quarter, mainly driven by the company’s focus on enhancing inventory productivity. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $50 million rose 56.3% year over year, while the adjusted EBIT margin expanded 70 bps in the fiscal first quarter to 1.6%. Consequently, adjusted earnings were 7 cents per share against the year-ago quarter’s loss of 6 cents.Going into fiscal 2023, management remains focused on enhancing customer experience, improving the Nordstrom Rack performance, increasing inventory productivity and progressing in its supply-chain optimization initiatives. The company is confident about the strength of its brands, and its ability to drive profitable growth and deliver long-term value to shareholders.The adjusted EBIT margin is likely to be 3.7-4.2% of sales, which compares favorably with the prior year’s reported figure of 3.3%. Adjusted earnings are envisioned to be $1.80-$2.20 per share, excluding the charges related to the Canada business wind-down. This view is also in sync with our estimate of $1.80. Earnings per share, including wind-down-related charges, are expected between 60 cents and $1.Other Growth EffortsNordstrom has been making efforts to drive efficiency and improve customer experience via faster order fulfillment. It is also on track to reduce inventory and optimize its product mix. Also, increased focus on Nordstrom Rack bodes well.The company witnessed an improvement in the Nordstrom Rack banner, driven by strategic brand penetration increases. The brand opened two stores in the fiscal first quarter as part of its efforts to expand its reach. The two stores that it opened last year have been performing well. It recently opened six stores and plans to open 13 stores later this year. Going ahead, it intends to roll out in more markets.With an improved assortment and more new stores, Nordstrom Rack’s performance is expected to sequentially improve throughout 2023. The Rack banner also remains on track to increase productivity throughout its network, lower transportation costs, and reduce delivery times and enhance services via faster delivery.Earlier, Nordstrom Rack reduced store-based order fulfillment and raised the minimum order amount for free ship-to-store delivery on rack.com. These actions led to lesser order cancellations, simplified rack operations and improved profitability. It continues to focus on introducing more premium brands at Rack, better assortment and increased brand awareness. Driven by these factors, it expects to optimize the Rack product mix by mid-2023.The company’s long-term strategy, which builds on its market strategy to capitalize on its digital-first platform to better serve customers, gain market share and deliver profitable growth, bodes well. It has also been focused on the closer-to-you strategy, which aims to link stores and services to expedite deliveries, expand online offerings, and add cheaper merchandise at its Rack off-price stores to improve customers' shopping experiences.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Driven by these factors, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 29.1% in the past three months against the industry’s decline of 1.8%.Headwinds to OvercomeDespite such upsides, Nordstrom is not free from struggles. The company has been witnessing muted customer demand from the ongoing macroeconomic environment, which dented the top-line performance in the fiscal first quarter.Revenues of $3,181 million declined 11.6% year over year due to a 175-basis-point (bps) adverse impact of the wind-down of Canada operations and an 11.9% decline in gross merchandise value (GMV). Net sales fell 11.6% year over year to $3,064 million.In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, net sales for the Nordstrom banner decreased 11.4% from the year-ago quarter to $2,027 million. GMV declined 11.8% year over year for the Nordstrom banner in the fiscal first quarter. Sales at the Nordstrom Rack banner declined 11.9% year over year to $1,037 million. The elimination of store fulfillment for Nordstrom Rack digital orders hurt fiscal first-quarter Rack banner net sales by 600 bps.Going into fiscal 2023, management expects total revenues to decline 4-6% year over year, in line with our estimate of a 5% decline. Revenues are expected to include a 250-bps impact of the closing of the Canada operations and a nearly 130-bps gain from the 53rd week.ConclusionAlthough inflation-led dismal demand is concerning, Nordstrom seems well-placed to drive further growth on the back of an improved Rack performance, supply-chain efficiencies and its long-term strategy. Topping it, a VGM Score of A and a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.6% reflect its inherent strength.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks are Abercrombie &amp; Fitch ANF, Walmart WMT and Urban Outfitters URBN.Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, a specialty retailer of premium, high-quality casual apparel for men, women, and kids, carries a Zacks Rank #1.

19,9318f353-73a9-37ab-8d6b-a6d127e6f3f2,EQR,2023-07-06,Equity Residential (EQR) Up 12% in 6 Months: Will the Trend Last?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/equity-residential-eqr-12-6-125300633.html,1688561580,STORY,"['EQR', 'SUI', 'BRT']","[In the peak leasing season, residential real estate investment trusts (REITs) like Equity Residential EQR have benefited from the healthy demand for residential properties. Also, EQR’s focus on technological advancements to drive margin expansion and a rise in rental revenue have enabled it to ride the growth curve.Backed by continued strong market demand, particularly in New York, and lower-than-expected delinquency rates, mainly in Southern California, EQR raised its 2023 earnings guidance this May. It now expects normalized funds from operations (FFO) per share in the range of $3.73-$3.83, up from its previous outlook of $3.70-$3.80. Same-store revenue projection was revised upward to 5.5-6.25% from 4.5-6% guided earlier.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 12% in the past six months compared with the industry's growth of 5.3%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEquity Residential has a dominating presence in the markets of Boston, New York, Washington, DC, Seattle, San Francisco and Southern California, which generally command the highest rents. This has aided stable rental revenue generation over the years.Keeping in line with the recent migration trends of affluent renters, EQR has made concerted efforts to expand its footprint in the suburban markets, especially in Denver, Atlanta and Austin. Its efforts to capture the renter demand in these growing markets are likely to have had a favorable impact.In addition, high interest rates and limited single-family home inventory have acted as catalysts, making home ownership costlier and renting apartments a more viable option.The company is leveraging technology and organizational capabilities to drive innovation, rent growth and improve the efficiency of its operating platform. This is likely to provide EQR competitive edge over others. The company expects to capture incremental net operating income (NOI) in the upcoming period through its operating model. Our estimate for current-year NOI indicates an increase of 4.2% year over year.Also, Equity Residential’s encouraging development pipeline gears it up for long-term growth.  As of Mar 31, 2023, it had eight projects (consolidated and unconsolidated) under development, comprising 2,519 apartment units.This residential REIT had $2.5 billion of available liquidity and net debt to normalized EBITDAre of 4.17X as of Mar 31, 2023. Its limited near-term debt maturities and ample financial flexibility have positioned it well to capitalize on growth opportunities.Moreover, EQR’s trailing 12-month return on equity is 8.17% compared with the industry’s average of 4.62%, indicating that it is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and Equity Residential remains committed to the same. In March 2023, the residential REIT increased its quarterly cash dividend on its common stock to 66.25 cents from 62.50 cents per share paid out earlier, marking a hike of 6% on its annualized dividend. Such efforts boost investors’ confidence in the stock.Nonetheless, the lack of rental relief payments and regulatory issues in 2023 may weigh on EQR’s revenue growth to a certain extent in some regions and markets. Elevated supply in some markets and a high interest rate environment raise concerns.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the residential REIT sector are Sun Communities SUI, Invitation Home INVH and BRT Apartments BRT. While Sun Communities and Invitation Home carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), BRT Apartment sports a Zacks Rank #1.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sun Communities’ current-year FFO per share has been raised marginally over the past month to $7.34.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Invitation Home’s 2023 FFO per share has moved 1.1% northward over the past month to $1.78.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BRT Apartments’ ongoing-year’s FFO per share has moved 33.6% upward in the past two months to $1.55.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Crocs (CROX) earns a Zacks Rank #3 29 days from its next quarterly earnings release on August 3, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.96 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $2.96 Most Accurate Estimate and the $2.95 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Crocs has an Earnings ESP of 0.29%.CROX is one of just a large database of Consumer Discretionary stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is MGM Resorts (MGM).Slated to report earnings on August 2, 2023, MGM Resorts holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.70 a share 28 days from its next quarterly update.MGM Resorts' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 39.65% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.50.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, CROX and MGM could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

In some cases, they're reaching record peaks.Walmart (WMT) closed at an all-time high of $158.20 on Monday. During the same session, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) hit an intraday record following its record close of $2,139 last Friday. Fast food chain McDonald's (MCD) also recorded its best closing price ever last week at $298.41.Until now, analysts had noted that this year's massive market rally had been fueled by a handful of tech stocks.

During the first quarter of 2023, the company reported solid booking volumes courtesy of strong demand in the WAVE season. The company stated that the cumulative booked position for 2023 is higher than the 2019 level. Also, it reported strength in advance ticket sales with a balance of $3.4 billion, up 26% (from the previous quarter’s levels) and 60% (from 2019 levels).Encouraging Fleet Expansion: Norwegian Cruise is constantly looking to expand its fleet size. It has plans to introduce nine more ships through 2027. A majority of them are on order for the Norwegian Cruise Line, while the rest are for Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises.  The company anticipates the additions to increase the count to approximately 82,000. In 2023, the company anticipates the additions of Norwegian Viva, Oceania Cruises Vista and Regent Seven Seas Grandeur to its fleet.Strategic Initiatives: The company emphasizes on its booking window to drive the top line. The initiative not only evaluates the extent and willingness of consumers to spend on cruise travel but also provides better visibility for price increases and moderating marketing expenses.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) is up 45% year-to-date. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is up over 180%. However, many undervalued semiconductor stocks have yet to rally.The AI tide has not lifted all boats. While beneficiaries like Nvidia and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) have had enormous rallies, other semi stocks have lagged.Some underperforming stocks have had idiosyncratic challenges. For instance, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is losing market share in the PC and data center market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMeanwhile, the other factor is a continuing demand slump in end markets. Double ordering and raising inventories to avoid supply issues created a supply glut.Then, demand in some end markets like smartphones and tablets peaked. Unfortunately, the elevated inventory issues that surfaced in 2022 haven’t subsided. Chip inventories are hitting record levels underscoring the weak demand.Because of the demand slump and elevated inventories, select semi-companies in memory, industrial and smartphone end markets are experiencing lower sales. These stocks are yet to recover their steep drawdowns in 2022.However, as demand rebounds from a cyclical bottom, expect these undervalued semiconductor stocks to recover.Microchip Technology (MCHP)Undervalued Semiconductor StocksSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comMicrochip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) is an Arizona-based chip maker that produces and sells smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions for various applications.In fiscal year 2023, industrial, data center &amp; computing and automotive made up 41%, 19% and 17% of revenues, respectively.Although Microchip has had a decent 16% YTD rally, it’s still undervalued. For fiscal year 2023, ending March 31, the company grew EPS 30.6% year-over-year (YOY) to $6.02.Story continuesThe stock trades at 13.6 times trailing earnings. Clearly, the market is not crediting one of the best semiconductor companies for its 130 consecutive quarters of non-GAAP profitability.What makes MCHP stock one of the top semiconductor stocks to buy are its prospects going forward. It has positioned its product portfolio to benefit from 5G, the Internet of Things, data centers, electric vehicles, advanced driver assist systems and sustainability mega-trends.For instance, their Bernstein Conference presentation highlighted 88 Microchip products used in the HKMC IONIQ 6 electric sedan.Over the next five years, management forecasts a 10%-15% organic revenue compounded-annual-growth rate. They expect to convert more than 38% of revenue into free cash flow and return 50% of adjusted FCF to shareholders.Considering the forward P/E is 13 and shareholder returns will increase going forward, MCHP stock is a bargain. Analysts agree it is one of the undervalued semiconductor stocks. They have an average price target of $90, representing a 10% upside.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphoneSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a chip maker that focuses on wireless communication applications.Its specialty is radio frequency semiconductors used in mobile devices like smartphones. Because of its leadership in RF, it counts Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as one of its largest customers.In today’s world, everything from the home, house appliances and vehicles have cellular connectivity. According to Statista, a typical U.S. household has over ten wirelessly connected devices.This trend is increasing the addressable market for Skyworks. Besides, the company is venturing into new markets. For instance, the company is winning contracts to supply onboard charging and digital radio connectivity solutions to EV manufacturers.In terms of its traditional market, 5G adoption is a massive growth opportunity for the stock. The technology improves data rates and expands network capacity, supporting new applications. Also, the company is penetrating the IoT market through several design wins.Over the last year, Skyworks has experienced revenue declines because of the contraction of the global smartphone market. Notably, revenues have declined for two consecutive quarters highlighting the sustained weakness in end markets.Looking ahead to the next quarter, demand is yet to hit a trough. Management expects sales between $1.050 billion and $1.090 billion, a decline from last year’s $1.2 billion.Skyworks’ revenues have always been dependent on Apple’s product cycles. In the aggregate, Apple accounted for 59% and 58% of revenues in FY2021 and FY2022, respectively.The company could benefit from a new iPhone cycle. Also, if Apple includes its chips in the Vision Pro, the company will see incremental revenue growth.Buying SWKS stock here as a play on a new Apple product cycle or the eventual recovery in the smartphone market. The stock is trading at a cheap forward P/E of 11. And you are paid to wait for the recovery, with a healthy 2.4% dividend yield.NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI)Undervalued Semiconductor StocksSource: Lukassek / Shutterstock.comAlthough NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI) is up 20% YTD, it is still a bargain relative to peers.Because of the discount, it makes the undervalued semiconductor stocks list. Besides valuation, it’s also one of the best-positioned semiconductor companies.In terms of its portfolio mix, NXP generates 51% of its revenues from electric vehicles (EV) and ADAS. The company has established partnerships with global OEMs.As a result, growth in its automotive segment is outpacing other segments. For instance, in FY2022, automotive YOY growth was 25.2%. Meanwhile, growth in industrial and mobile was 11.7% and 8.5%, respectively.As EV adoption increases, the Netherlands-based company will be a huge beneficiary. Moreover, its ADAS business will also see increased demand. Since the automotive segment represents over half of revenues and is growing faster, revenues will become less cyclical.In the medium term, the weakness in its industrial and mobile segments has been weighing down the stock. As Q1 2023 results showed, revenue declined -26% and -35%, respectively.In contrast, automotive delivered an outstanding performance, with revenues growing 17%.“NXP is successfully navigating through the cyclical downturn in our consumer-exposed businesses, while we see continued strength in our automotive and core-industrial businesses,” said CEO Kurt Sievers.At a forward P/E of 13, NXPI is among the best semiconductor stocks to buy. It is a secular long term bet on EV adoption and the rise in autonomous driving. And in the meantime, you earn a 2% dividend.On the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The group in June extended supply curbs into 2024 to support the market as concern of weakening demand pressured prices.For 2024, three OPEC sources said that while demand growth was likely to show a slowdown it would not be as severe as the IEA predicts and growth will likely be above 1 million bpd and likely below 2 million bpd.""It can be expected that the increase in oil demand in 2024 will be much lower than 2023,"" one of the OPEC sources said, adding that it could be between 1.5 to 1.7 million bpd.OPEC is expected to publish its first demand forecast for 2024 in its monthly report on July 13.""It will be more bullish than the IEA,"" another source said of OPEC's 2024 demand view.Top officials from OPEC countries at a conference this week such as Amin Nasser, chief executive of state-owned oil producer Saudi Aramco, expressed optimism over the oil demand outlook despite economic headwinds weighing on prices.Story continues""Asia is growing. China alone between 2019 and 2023, 3 million bpd growth, India 1 million bpd growth, so there is a pickup in demand,"" he said.Oil demand forecasters often have to make sizeable revisions given changes in the economic outlook and geopolitical uncertainties, which this year included China's lifting of coronavirus lockdowns and rising interest rates.OPEC originally forecast demand growth in 2023 of 2.7 million bpd in its first forecast published in July 2022, later revising it down to 2.35 million bpd.(This story has been corrected to fix the date in paragraph 8)(Additional reporting by Ahmad Ghaddar, editing by David Evans)]"

If we don't, we will have a mismatch of supply and demand,"" BP Chief Executive Bernard Looney said, according to a source present at the conference.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has withheld media access to reporters from Reuters, Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal to cover the event, which ends on Thursday.Climate activists and some investors have placed pressure on oil and gas producers to shift their portfolios towards zero-carbon renewable energy to tackle global warming.But record profits from oil and gas last year and relatively low returns from renewable energy prompted some investors to demand companies renew their focus on oil and gas to raise profits.Companies, such as Shell and BP, have slowed plans to reduce fossil fuels output.In an interview with the BBC published on Thursday, Shell CEO Wael Sawan said cutting oil and gas production would be ""dangerous and irresponsible"", given the likely impact on prices when inflation is already high.Simon Stiell, the executive secretary of the United Nation's climate change body (UNFCCC), in turn described Sawan's comments as ""irresponsible"" at the OPEC event, according to a source present.Story continuesDEMAND HITS RECORDOil demand has reached new peaks of above 102 million barrels per day this year, recovering from a dip during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is expected to rise further, driven by strong demand from Asia and for petrochemical production, oil executives and analysts said.The burning of fossil fuels accounts for the majority of planet-warming emissions, which scientists say need to be reduced to net zero by 2050 to avoid the most extreme effects of climate change.The head of Abu Dhabi's national oil company ADNOC, Sultan al Jaber, said the phase-down of fossil fuels was inevitable: ""But it cannot be irresponsible... It will also depend on strong demand signals.""Abu Dhabi will host U.N. climate talks starting at the end of November.The oil industry has long said lower investment in oil and gas in the absence of a reduction in oil demand will only lead to higher prices.""The mistake is to think that if we diminish the investments in the existing system, in oil and gas, then the money will be transferred. No. The reality is if we do it that way, the price will go back up,"" Patrick Pouyanne, the chief of France's top company TotalEnergies, said.OPEC ministers and oil companies have said restrictions on access to bank loans for fossil fuel projects have deprived the industry of investments needed to even maintain existing production levels.Investments in the upstream sector have fallen to about $580 billion this year from a peak of $887 billion in 2014, according to analysts at consultancy Rystad Energy, although they said this week the claims of chronic under-investment were exaggerated.""It is very important to have the national and international collaboration of governments on subsidies and incentives of all kinds to change consumer habits,"" said Jean Paul Prates, chief of Brazil's energy giant Petrobras.""Otherwise we will have the same demand for say plastic that we have now... I believe that a transformation will happen much more on the downstream and demand side rather than upstream,"" Prates said.Amin Nasser, CEO of Saudi Aramco, said his company would invest $45-$55 billion this year alone: ""It is growing in the years ahead, so this shows our confidence in the future"".(Writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; editing by Barbara Lewis)]"

Methane is a greenhouse gas that is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term and is released into the atmosphere by the oil and gas industry through leaks or flares.Al-Jaber, who’s set to head up the talks known as COP28 in Dubai in December, is the head of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, one of the world’s largest oil producers, as well as the United Arab Emirates’ renewables firm Masdar.He urged OPEC nations to ""show the world once more how essential this industry is to the solutions we need” for the climate crisis. Scientists and climate activists have repeatedly called for fossil fuels to be phased out to limit warming.Meanwhile, the head of global energy giant Shell said it would be “irresponsible” to cut oil and gas production at a time when the world economy is still dependent on fossil fuels in an interview with the BBC released Thursday.The oil and gas industry accounts for around 15% of energy-related global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.Al-Jaber's appointment as head of the climate talks was widely criticized by climate activists. Lawmakers in United States and Europe have called for him to be replaced given his ties to the fossil fuel sector and for the industry’s influence at the upcoming talks to be sharply limited.He's countered criticism at various international meetings, including the climate talks at Bonn, Germany last month, with claims that the talks will be “inclusive” and deliver a “game-changing outcome” for international efforts to tackle climate change.Story continuesA report by the group Climate Action Tracker earlier this year showed that many major producers of oil and gas, including the UAE and the United States, are currently increasing production.“The sector is acting like there’s a gold rush, not a climate crisis,” the authors had warned in March.Continued fossil fuel production goes against a global pledge to try to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) compared with pre-industrial times, the report said.Scientists say that in order to achieve that goal, emissions need to be halved by 2030 and reach net zero by mid-century, meaning all emissions are either slashed or canceled out somehow.___Associated Press reporter Frank Jordans contributed to this report from Berlin.___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Unique profile identifiers can link previously unidentified in-store transactions to shopper profiles, unlocking a breadth of analytics-driven use cases. Equipped with stronger customer understanding, businesses can reward customer loyalty, tailor shopper experiences, and drive value for existing customers.Ayden logoWith a majority of transactions (82%) occurring in physical stores but lacking customer identification, retailers face a significant ""blind spot"" in understanding their customers' preferences. Data Connect for Marketing removes this by providing a structured data set that integrates easily into a business' external tooling, with use cases ranging from Customer Data Platform (CDP) or Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. Salesforce is one of the first players to build this integration to offer payments-enriched profiles to their customer base.""Understanding the customer journey has been a major hurdle for omnichannel retail businesses,"" says Brian Dammeir, Global Head of Unified Commerce at Adyen. ""With Data Connect for Marketing, Adyen is bridging the gap between in-store and online experiences by connecting our wealth of data to single customer profiles. This means we can support businesses to build customer loyalty, and unlock new customization and advertising opportunities through their existing Adyen integration.""Story continuesRather than relying on third-party data sources in an attempt to understand their customers, Data Connect for Marketing means businesses can now leverage their own first-party payments data to build a comprehensive customer view. This capability presents a large opportunity for businesses to enhance their loyalty offering, as Adyen's data reveals that 68% of consumers report they would like to see more personalized discounting from the retailers they shop most regularly with.

Naturally, there are concerns that the rally among many tech stocks may be overdone or can’t be sustained.With that being said, Salesforce (CRM) and VeriSign (VRSN) are two tech stocks that may have more room to run, and now appears to be a great time to buy.Sustainable Growth Salesforce stock has rebounded with a vengeance and has now soared +60% this year with the leading provider of customer relationship management software expecting its business to be boosted by generative artificial intelligence (AI).Expansive annual top and bottom-line growth is expected for Salesforce with sales forecasted to rise 10% in its current fiscal 2024 and jump another 11% in FY25 to $38.47 billion. Even better, earnings are now projected to soar 42% in FY24 at $7.44 per share compared to EPS of $5.24 in the company’s FY23. Plus, FY25 earnings are expected to leap another 21% at $8.99 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLooking at VeriSign, its stock is only up +8% in 2023 but the global provider of domain name registry services and internet infrastructure has an attractive outlook as well.VeriSign’s sales are expected to be up 5% this year and rise another 8% in FY24 to $1.62 billion.

45,f146938c-a986-34bd-9bb5-eea651ef85b8,CRM,2023-07-06,‘High-Quality Growth Is the Key’: Billionaire Ken Fisher Stays Heavily Invested in These 2 Quality AI Growth Stocks,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/high-quality-growth-key-billionaire-133241279.html,1688563961,STORY,"['NVDA', 'CRM']","[Ken Fisher2023 will surely be looked upon as the year AI went mainstream. Fueled by the rise of ChatGPT, the tech has captured the public’s imagination and it is a topic constantly hogging the headlines.Naturally, investors have also tuned in to the conversation, and AI has been driving the year’s rally in tech stocks. But there are already murmurings regarding a bubble in all things AI, so the question is: has the opportunity already played out this year? Not entirely, appears to be the opinion of one investing legend.Billionaire Ken Fisher concedes that this is no longer a ‘ground floor’ moment for those looking to ride the AI trend. However, he also does not see the current state as a bubble. Fisher believes that the rise of Big Tech this year is “mostly about quality growth and rebounding from its outsize 2022 bear market slide.”“It is not tiny start-ups in Silicon Valley that are driving AI,” he adds. “It is the big guys in chips, software, data analytics, search and more with pole position.Still, the Fisher Investments founder, who has a net worth valued at ~$6.7 billion, thinks “some AI exposure may be beneficial,” although that should only partially inform an investor’s decision to load up on a promising equity. “Instead,” Fisher goes on to say, “intelligent investing means seeking high-quality growth. If AI partly drives that growth, OK.”With all this as backdrop, we thought we’d take a look at two names sitting in Fisher’s portfolio that boast all the qualities he refers to: top-quality, growth and some exposure to AI. Using the TipRanks platform, we can also see whether the Street’s stock experts agree these are good names to own right now. Let’s take a closer look.Salesforce, Inc. (CRM)The first Fisher-backed name we’ll look at is Salesforce, a software giant that specializes in customer relationship management (CRM). The firm develops software and applications that enable its clients to enhance the level of service they provide to their own customers. Its offerings encompass various areas such as sales, analytics, and automation, as well as tailored customer service, community management, and relationship intelligence. With a market cap surpassing $206 billion, the company proudly claims to be the leading CRM platform for businesses worldwide.Story continuesYou can get an idea of the size involved by looking at the most recent earnings report, for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (April quarter). The company generated revenue of $8.25 billion, amounting to an 11.3% year-over-year increase, while beating the Street’s forecast by $80 million. Furthermore, Salesforce maintains consistent profitability, with EPS of $1.69 in FQ1, exceeding analyst expectations by $0.08.Salesforce has been making use of AI for several years and began incorporating the tech into its platform in 2016 with the introduction of Salesforce Einstein. It has recently stepped up its efforts with the introduction of AI Cloud, an offering that combines AI, data, analytics, and automation that the company touts as providing “trusted, open, real-time generative AI that is enterprise ready.”All of this must be appealing to Fisher, who remains heavily invested. His money management firm currently owns 14,022,629 shares of CRM, which have a market value just under $3 billion.Salesforce also has a fan in JMP analyst Patrick Walravens, who highlights the various reasons why the stock represents an “attractive opportunity for long-term capital appreciation.”These reasons include: “1) the company is the clear leader in a very large market estimated to reach $290B+ by 2026; 2) the company seems to have settled into an effective leadership rhythm between CEO Marc Benioff, President &amp; COO Brian Millham, and CFO Amy Weaver; 3) Salesforce just finished the first quarter of what should be a multi-year transformation with both short-term and long-term restructuring to drive higher margins and better efficiencies; 4) the company has interesting opportunities to streamline its sales processes with more suite selling across its clouds; and 5) the company is only just beginning to address its opportunities to leverage the recent advancements in large neural networks and AI for organic product innovation.”Walravens adds an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating to his reasons, and completes his stance with a $275 price target, indicating his confidence in an upside of 30% for the next 12 months. (To watch Walravens’ track record, click here)Turning now to the rest of the Street, where CRM claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 22 Buys, 10 Holds and 1 Sell. The forecast calls for 12-month returns of 13%, considering the average target stands at $239.1. (See CRM stock forecast)Nvidia (NVDA)So, we’re talking high-quality, growth and AI, right? Then it’s safe to say, Nvidia will be the first name that springs to mind for many. The semiconductor giant has been a leading chipmaker for years now, known for its GPUs – graphics processors – that are used in gaming, which used to account for the majority of its revenues, and for data center use, which eventually overtook the gaming segment as the main breadwinner.Due to the quality of its offerings, the company has practically cornered the AI hardware industry. Most AI applications currently depend on Nvidia hardware, as it boasts a 95% dominance of the machine learning GPU market, according to a recent report from CB Insights.Nvidia has been known for some tremendous growth, but it has also been affected by the slowing economy. Nevertheless, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (April quarter), the company beat expectations on both the top-and-bottom line. Although revenue declined by 13.3% year-over-year to $7.19 billion, the figure still beat the analysts’ forecast by $670 million. Likewise, adj. EPS of $1.09 beat the Street’s call by $0.17.Those results were good, but the company left the best for an outlook that stunned Wall Street. With demand for its AI chips surging, Nvidia guided for FQ2 revenue of $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. Consensus was looking for just $7.11 billion.These results, on top of the AI hype, have helped the stock get a place at the table of the exclusive $1 trillion market cap club, with the shares having gained 190% year-to-date.It wouldn’t be too much of a stretch to estimate Fisher is pleased with his NVDA investment. He is the owner of over 10 million shares, and these are presently valued at more than $4.27 billion.Nvidia is well-known for its hardware, but it is no slouch on the software front, either, as highlighted by Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosemann.“Nvidia stands in a league of its own when it comes to software compilers, vertical market optimizations, and accelerator libraries. These strengths easily compensate for many of the hardware specifications offered by new AI chip companies. Software subscriptions, royalties, and other sources will increasingly contribute to Nvidia’s revenues in the coming years, particularly as we transition to autonomous driving, Omniverse AI worlds, and similar technologies,” the 5-star analyst explained. “We expect tech to continue to lead the market higher and we also believe that the AI enthusiasm is not over-hyped. NVDA’s recent sequential guide was telling. We think this rally has plenty of runway as investor risk appetites continue to climb the wall of worry.”The year-to-date gains are not an issue for Mosesmann, then. He has a Buy rating on the shares to go alongside a $600 price target. The implication for investors? Additional upside of 41% from current levels. (To watch Mosesmann’s track record, click here)Most on the Street remain in NVDA’s corner. The stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 28 Buys vs. 2 Holds and 1 Sell. The shares are priced at $423.47 and the $471.8 average target implies one-year share appreciation of 11%.

With a year-to-date (YTD) gain of 59.6%, CRM stock has outperformed the broader equity indexes, Nasdaq Composite, The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500, increasing 32%, 3.8% and 16.1%, respectively.It has also surpassed the gains of Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), the most important component of the broad market index, which has increased 40% YTD.Why Is CRM Stock Rallying?We believe that Salesforce’s impressive growth profile is attracting investors. CRM has been benefiting from the strong adoption of its cloud-based products and solutions as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation amid the ongoing hybrid work environment. Its ability to provide an integrated solution for customers’ business problems is the key driver.Salesforce Inc. Price and ConsensusSalesforce Inc. Price and ConsensusSalesforce Inc. price-consensus-chart | Salesforce Inc. QuotePer a Grand View Research report, the global CRM software market is projected to witness a CAGR of 13.9% during the 2023-2030 period. With its SaaS-based CRM and social enterprise applications, we believe Salesforce is well-positioned to lead the market.Additionally, the cloud-based customer relationship management software provider’s sustained focus on acquisitions and partnerships is helping it enhance its product offerings and expand across newer markets. The buyouts of Slack, Tableau, ClickSoftware, Mulesoft, Datorama and CloudCraze over the last couple of years have been beneficial for the company.Salesforce's partnership agreements with the likes of Amazon and Google’s parent Alphabet for the firms’ cloud services have been helping it expand its international operations. The company also entered into an alliance with Apple through which it is offering new apps for iPhones and iPads.Accelerated digital transformation and a sustained focus on acquisitions and partnerships are driving its revenues. Salesforce’s revenues more than doubled from $13.3 billion in fiscal 2019 to $31.4 billion in fiscal 2023.Story continuesThe company’s first-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues increased 11% year over year to $8.25 billion. Moreover, it targets to achieve annual revenues of $50 billion in fiscal 2026.Betting on Generative AI for Long-Term GrowthSalesforce is currently focusing on incorporating generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools across its products as it looks to keep its business ahead of rivals. Generative AI is a type of AI technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. It is driven by a large language model, which means it uses a lot of data to understand and generate conversations.The company forayed into the generative AI space with the launch of Einstein GPT in March 2023. Einstein GPT is the world’s first generative AI CRM (Customer Relationship Management) technology, which delivers AI-created content across every sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT interaction at hyperscale. With Einstein GPT, the company will transform customer experience with generative AI.Upping its ante in the space, last month, Salesforce launched its AI Cloud service, which the company claims is a one-stop AI-powered solution for enterprises looking to enhance productivity. Salesforce stated that its AI Cloud is a suite of services that delivers enterprise-ready real-time, open and secure generative experiences across all applications and workflows. The suite will power new capabilities across CRM’s products, including Einstein service, data analysis software Tableau and workplace-messaging app, Slack.Generative AI technology is finding applications in marketing, advertising, drug development, legal contracts, video gaming, customer support and digital art. This has sparked AI competition among the world’s biggest tech players, including Intuit INTU, ServiceNow NOW and Adobe ADBE.In June 2023, Intuit expanded its platform architecture with the introduction of a proprietary generative AI operating system — GenOS. This will enable the company to design, build and deploy breakthrough generative AI experiences for millions of customers, including small businesses. It will also help customers solve their financial challenges.ServiceNow recently launched generative AI capabilities — ServiceNow Generative AI Controller and Now Assist for Search — for the Now platform that helps deliver faster and more intelligent workflow automation.The digital media solutions provider, Adobe, aggressively expanded its footprint in the generative AI space through partnerships and new solutions. Adobe has unveiled a family of generative AI models, Firefly, focused on the generation of texts and images. Per the company, Firefly will offer more precision, speed, power and ease in content creation. It will let users of various experience levels create high-quality images and stunning text effects.At present, Salesforce sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Intuit, ServiceNow and Adobe each carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

56,09bcd738-5039-3908-a457-bbd2718821a3,SIG,2023-07-06,The 7 Most Undervalued Consumer Stocks to Buy Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-most-undervalued-consumer-stocks-175556841.html,1688061356,STORY,"['TGT', 'TROLB', 'SIG', 'CPB', 'WSM', '^GSPC', 'LOW', 'KR']","[Recession, interest rates, employment, and the housing market – American consumers are weighing the futures of all these topics. Apprehension has led to a fallback in spending. A June survey released by CNBC and Morning Consult found that 92% of Americans are pulling back their spending due to inflation and growing concerns about an economic downturn. The survey confirmed what retailers have been saying for months on earnings calls with analysts and media.Consumers are exercising caution when spending money on discretionary items. This has led to a downturn in many consumer stocks. While the S&amp;P 500 index has risen 15% year to date, several consumer stocks are in the red. This has created an opportunity for investors to buy shares of leading retailers and household brands at discounted prices. Here are the seven most undervalued consumer stocks to buy now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTarget (TGT)an image of bullseye the target dog in a target storeSource: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.comLet’s begin with Target (NYSE:TGT), the department store chain that is one of the largest retailers in the U.S. Today, Target has nearly 2,000 stores, 440,000 employees, and generates more than $100 billion in annual revenues. The company continues to expand its physical store locations while also increasing its online sales. While Target thrived during the pandemic, it has been tough sledding for the company and its shareholders more recently. TGT stock is down 12% this year even as the S&amp;P 500 index has climbed 15% higher.TGT stock has been under pressure after the company reported mixed earnings and provided cautious forward guidance, saying it is seeing cautious consumers amid a slowing economy and a drop in spending on discretionary items. The company’s online sales fell 3.4% in Q1 from a year earlier. Target has also experienced a consumer backlash over its support of Pride month and the LGBTQ+ community. Regardless, TGT stock is trading at an attractive price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22 and offers a strong dividend that yields 3.30%.Story continuesWilliams-Sonoma (WSM)Williams-Sonoma (WSM) store in a shopping mallSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.comHome furnishing and kitchenware retailer Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) is another undervalued consumer stock worth buying now. Over the last 12 months, WSM stock has risen only 6%, currently trading at a rock bottom P/E ratio of 8, and is offering shareholders an attractive quarterly dividend that yields 2.87% or 90 cents a share. The dividend was just increased by 15%. Best of all, Williams-Sonoma has proven to be a long-term winner, with its share price rising 105% over the last five years.The lukewarm performance of WSM stock can be attributed to a weakening economy and slowdown in consumer spending. Management at the company have forecast flat earnings for this year as a result, news that hasn’t sat well with investors or analysts. However, the company’s profit margins remain near an all-time high of 17%. Brighter days are ahead once we emerge on the other side of a recession that is forecast for late this year or early 2024. Given its long-term performance, WSM stock is worth considering.Tootsie Roll Industries (TR)Two Tootsie RollsSource: Famartin, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia CommonsCandy maker Tootsie Roll Industries (NYSE:TR) has been in business since 1896, and the company still basically does one thing: makes Tootsie Rolls and Tootsie Pops. It’s a shockingly simple business model that has sustained the company for more than a century. Tootsie Roll Industries has added a few other candies to its portfolio, such as Junior Mints and DOTS, but not many. Its bread-and-butter remains the enduringly popular Tootsie Roll. Today, this Americana, chewy, chocolaty candy company has annual sales in excess of $500 million and 2,000 employees.TR stock is currently on sale, having declined 16% this year and trading near a 52-week low. The share price is up 33% through five years and has doubled over the past decade. Other reasons to be sweet on the stock (pun intended) are a reasonable P/E ratio of 32 and a decent dividend payment of 9 cents a share each quarter, for a yield of 1.02%. The company’s sales and stock tend to spike around Halloween each year, so interested investors may want to take a position now before we move into the autumn.Signet Jewelers (SIG)A close-up shot of a diamond engagement ring with a rose-gold band. Hidden Gem Stock picksSource: ShutterstockSignet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG) doesn’t get as much attention as it ought to considering that it is the largest retailer of diamond jewelry in the world. However, SIG stock landed on the investors’ radars recently when it was revealed that investor Michael Burry of “The Big Short” fame has taken a sizable position in the company. Burry went from no position in Signet Jewelers to making the stock 9% of his $100 million portfolio, his fifth largest holding.Burry, a self-proclaimed value investor, clearly feels that Signet Jewelers is undervalued. SIG stock certainly looks cheap right now. The share price is down 4% year to date and trading at a P/E ratio of 7. Like the other securities on this list, it provides shareholders with a quarterly dividend that yields 1.45% or 23 cents a share. If there’s a caution here it is that the long-term performance of SIG stock isn’t great, up only 14% over five years. But Burry is the man who bought GameStop (NYSE:GME) at $7 a share before it skyrocketed to more than $300.Kroger (KR)Source: ShutterstockAnother stock that looks undervalued is grocery retailer Kroger (NYSE:KR). Down 3% over the last 12 months and also near a 52-week low, KR stock could use a boost. Its P/E ratio is a modest 13, and it pays a strong dividend that yields 2.48% or 29 cents a share each quarter. The shares are currently trading 25% below the all-time high they reached in April 2022. If there’s a good time for investors to take a position in this consumer stock, now would be it. In business for 140 years, Kroger has annual grocery sales of $138 billion and 465,000 employees.KR stock has been underperforming because of concerns over the company’s $24.6 billion acquisition of rival Albertsons (NYSE:ACI), which was announced last fall. The deal is still working its way through regulatory approvals and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) appears to be taking its time. Additionally, several industry groups, including the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers union (UFCW) and independent grocers are opposing the deal. While this has created some uncertainty, the deal is likely to be approved with Kroger emerging stronger as a result.Campbell Soup (CPB)a grocery store aisle stocked with cans and cans of Campbell's SoupSource: HeinzTeh / Shutterstock.comSpeaking of groceries, how about Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB)? As with Tootsie Roll Industries, Campbell Soup does one thing exceptionally well. They make soup. Another old company that has been around for more than 150 years, Campbell Soup has branched out into other products, although not many. Today the company also sells Pepperidge Farm cookies, Goldfish crackers, and V8 vegetable juice. However, the bulk of the company’s $8.69 billion annual revenue still comes from its soups.As an investment, CPB stock looks undervalued. Its share price is down 19% on the year and up only 12 % after five years. The stocks P/E ratio of 17 is below average among S&amp;P 500 listed companies. It also pays a dividend that yields 3.27% or a quarterly payment of 37 cents a share. CPB stock has been brought low by declining sales after it raised prices in the current inflationary environment. However, strong brand loyalty and resilient consumers should help Campbell Soup prosper going forward.Lowe’s (LOW)the front of a Lowe's storeSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comThe other home improvement big box retailer, Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) stock looks interesting at its current valuation. LOW stock is up 11% year to date, trailing gains in the broader market. The P/E ratio of 21 is reasonable and justifiable. And shareholders benefit from a dividend that yields 1.98% or $1.10 a share each quarter. Although Lowe’s stock hasn’t been lighting the world on fire lately, it has proven to be a long-term winner, having gained 133% over the last five years and 455% in the past 10 years.Retailers that specialize in home improvement projects tend to be viewed as discretionary by consumers. As a result, their sales typically suffer during difficult economic times. A slumping real estate market across the U.S. due to higher interest rates and a decline in lumber prices also haven’t helped Lowe’s. A rebound in housing, coupled with declining interest rates and a resumption of growth in consumer spending, should help drive LOW stock to new heights in the not-too-distant future.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

Nevada is among numerous states that have reached settlements now totaling more than $50 billion nationwide.“When I first took office as attorney general, I made it clear that seeking justice for those harmed by the opioid epidemic was one of my top priorities,” Ford said.Walgreens had no comment on the settlement, a company spokesman said in an email to The Associated Press on Wednesday.Walgreens is the final defendant named in a lawsuit the state filed in 2019, Ford's office said.The $285 million settlement will be paid over 15 years and will be split between the state and the signatories of the One Nevada Agreement, a coalition of Nevada county and city governments, Ford said.The state will retain about $98.1 million, which will be placed in a fund that was created to help finance opioid recovery programs through the state Department of Health and Human Services.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Starbucks (SBUX) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.98 a share, just 27 days from its upcoming earnings release on August 1, 2023.SBUX has an Earnings ESP figure of 2.26%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.98 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.96.SBUX is one of just a large database of Retail-Wholesale stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Amazon (AMZN).Amazon is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on July 27, 2023. AMZN's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.35 a share 22 days from its next earnings release.For Amazon, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.34 is 3.41%.Story continuesSBUX and AMZN's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms Inc. META, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Palo Alto Networks Inc. PANW, Cadence Design Systems Inc. CDNS and Synopsys Inc. SNPS.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Can the Rally Continue on the Nasdaq Composite?Wall Street rebounded in the first half of 2023 after a highly disappointing 2022. The rally was primarily led by growth stocks, especially technology stocks. Consequently, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index took the lead role in enabling U.S. stock markets to restart their northbound journey.In the first half of 2023, the blue-chip Dow and the broad-market Index S&amp;P 500 advanced 3.8% and 15.9%, respectively. On the other hand, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite jumped 31.7%, marking its best first-half performance since 1983.Nasdaq's rally was evenly spread across the first half. The index climbed 16.8% in the first quarter and 12.8% in the second quarter of 2023. Barring a marginal loss in February, the index closed on a positive note in the rest of the five months in first-half 2023.Rally Likely to PersistAt this stage, the important question is will the momentum continue for Nasdaq Composite in second-half 2023? Nasdaq's rally has fundamental and technical aspects.Fundamentally, the index's performance is primarily linked to the movement of interest rates. The performance of growth stocks like technology is inversely related to the interest rate trajectory. The Nasdaq Composite was the best performer in pandemic-ridden 2020 and 2021 as the Fed kept the benchmark interest rate to almost zero.The opposite happened in 2022 as the central bank hiked the lending rate by a massive 4.5% to combat record-high inflation. The valuation of most of the technology behemoths plunged last year. The situation once again turned in favor of the Nasdaq Composite in 2023 on the expectation that the rate hike cycle is nearing its end.Story continuesMoreover, the tech rally in the first half was led by a massive thrust toward artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. The rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet worldwide during the lockdown period, ushered in significant adoption of AI.Some financial and technology experts opine that AI is much-hyped and may lead to a bubble. We believe the AI-space is yet to unfold in the United States and in international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies producing high-end products.Technically, at its current level of 13,787.92, the Nasdaq Composite is well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 12,815.09 and 11,637.69, respectively. The 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as the short-term trendsetter in financial literature, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trend setter.Historically it has been noticed in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50-day moving average line surges ahead of the 200-day moving average line, a long-term uptrend for the index becomes a strong possibility.Valuation-wise too, Nasdaq Composite is not overheated. The index is in fact 13.5% below its closing level of 2021. The current rally is looking so bright because of the low base of 2022. The tech-heavy index reached its all-time high of 16,212.23 on Nov 22, 2021. At present, the index needs to rise 17.6% more to reach that level.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five Nasdaq-listed technology giants.

A.C. Roman &amp; Associates Founder-CEO Anthony C. Roman, who is also an FAA Licensed Commercial Pilot, discusses investments to improve airlines' infrastructure and how the revised pilot retirement age could weigh on the industry.Video Transcript- July 4th weekend has been a record for travel with TSA screening more than 2.8 million passengers on Friday alone. But many of those flyers, they've been caught up in cancellations and delays. According to FlightAware, over 3,800 flights have been scrubbed, nearly 45,000 have been delayed now. For more on the recent travel chaos, we want to bring in Anthony Roman, a former FAA commercial pilot and also the founder of Roman and Associates Investigative firm.Anthony, it's good to see you here. So there's certainly a lot of finger pointing going on after what we've seen play out over the last week and a half or so. We have Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, he's pointing fingers at the airlines, the airlines are blaming the FAA. I'm curious, just to get your perspective as to why we have seen-- what we have seen the chaos transpire over the last week or so?ANTHONY ROMAN: It's a conglomerate of problems that have come together in an unholy alliance that have created this and it's all forged by the pandemic. And the steep decline in passenger flights during that period of time, it resulted in massive layoffs and early retirements for pilots, for flight attendants, for baggage handlers. Infrastructure investments dropped, so the computer software, the computer hardware, the FAA air traffic control system was slow to modernize to current standards. And there are fewer controllers.In addition to that, the airport infrastructure was not receiving many investments during the pandemic, and all of that is surging now. And you have all of the problems trying to be solved at once. It's going to take several years to do this.Story continues- Anthony, and that's come at a time when we have seen incredible travel demand despite some of these inflated prices with Americans showing they're still willing to shell out that money. So what's the breaking point you think?ANTHONY ROMAN: Well, you know, I think we're close to the breaking point. But the airlines and the FAA have started rapid initiatives to begin solving the problem. And I think over the next year or two, we're going to see progressive improvements in the situation. For example, the FAA has now started to hire many more controllers, accelerate their training, put ground radar at the most important airports so that they can monitor the taxing of aircraft.The airlines have associated themselves with accelerated flight training programs, which have proved to be very, very safe to get pilots into the pipeline much sooner. They're also petitioning the FAA to consider extending the pilot mandatory retirement age to 67 and that would help immensely. You have many, many baby boomer pilots who are reaching that age. I got to tell you. If that retirement segment goes into effect and it's still mandated that they have to retire at 65, the problems will increase.- Anthony, what about the backlash though, and what we've seen play out over the last week or so pales in comparison to the number of flights that Southwest canceled right around the holidays. But United this time around was arguably the most affected, they canceled over 3,000 flights. What is the backlash look like from a consumer perspective, and what these airlines need to do to win back those fliers that they might have lost?ANTHONY ROMAN: Well, the consumers are angry and rightfully so. Some airlines have done a better job at infrastructure investment than others. Delta, one of those examples. One of the largest if not, the largest airline in the world. And that is the foundation of the problem.Now I understand that United has offered all passengers who suffered significant delays and/or cancellations, 30,000 miles in flight points. So we hope that this is a sad that soothes the wound and keeps passengers coming back to United. It is a very clear.- Finally, Anthony, you talked about two key shortages that we're seeing. One with pilots something that's been ongoing, and then the other with air traffic controllers. What does that training entail for air traffic controllers? Is it a recruitment issue or is it about having to get any newer ones up to speed? And what does that timeline look like, how long until we clear the backlog?ANTHONY ROMAN: I think there's sufficient recruiting success for this problem to be managed over the course of a year or two. It takes a long time for air traffic controllers to gain the knowledge, and then the experience to manage the lives of everyone flying above, and the risk of any errors that are fatal for residents on the ground. It's a very serious business, and the FAA takes it as a very serious business. But that'll be a year or two before we start seeing improvement, but it's going to be on a graduated scale.We'll see small improvements over time on a continuous basis. The pilot situation is very, very similar. If the FAA extends the retirement age to 67, I think we'll see the improvement faster. If it remains at 65, then it's going to take a bit longer to start seeing that situation improve.The concerns we do have is young, quickly trained, but well trained pilots in the cockpit that don't have the kind of experience they would have in the elongated training programs of the past. Now that's something that we'll be learning while they're in the cockpit with a senior airman, the captain, and that seems to be working out well.However, there have been some taxi incursions and several of them in a very short period of time. The question is, is that secondary to the accelerated flight training and the shorter period of time with well trained young pilots, without a lot of experience? That's a big question mark. Time will tell.- Either way, it sounds like still a choppier travel experience, at least in the immediate future. Anthony Roman, good to talk to you today. Appreciate the time.]"

68,60be10c6-44d0-3327-9d6b-03c5be744072,PM,2023-07-06,Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/philip-morris-international-inc-pm-130007007.html,1688562007,STORY,['PM'],"[Philip Morris (PM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands have returned +7.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.2% change. The Zacks Tobacco industry, to which Philip Morris belongs, has gained 9.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Philip Morris is expected to post earnings of $1.48 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.5%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.20 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.7%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.77 indicates a change of +9.2% from what Philip Morris is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Philip Morris.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Philip Morris, the consensus sales estimate of $8.69 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11%. The $35.19 billion and $36.96 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.8% and +5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPhilip Morris reported revenues of $8.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.6%. EPS of $1.38 for the same period compares with $1.56 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.08 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.3%. The EPS surprise was +3.76%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Philip Morris is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Philip Morris. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

72,d1ba7e2c-e66e-36ab-bbe6-a17c0febc7eb,GS,2023-07-06,Goldman and JPMorgan duke it out for the title of top M&A advisor for the first half of 2023,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-jpmorgan-duke-title-top-110529094.html,1688555129,STORY,"['GS', 'JPM', 'MS', 'GSBD']","[Nowhere are bragging rights more hotly contested than on Wall Street. And for the first six months of 2023 Goldman Sachs kept the crown as the top M&amp;A advisor globally, according to new data from both Dealogic and Refinitiv.Goldman worked on 145 deals valued at $321.3 billion during the first six months of this year, Dealogic said. In second place was JPMorgan with $309.9 billion in transactions, while BofA Securities jumped up a spot to third place with $228.7 billion in deals. Refinitiv data had Goldman in first with $305.6 billion worth of deals, while JPMorgan placed second with $301.5 billion, and Morgan Stanley ranked third with $193 billion in mergers. BofA was fourth with $192.8 billion in transactions, said Refinitiv, an LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group) business.Goldman and JPMorgan declined to comment.Bloomberg, using its own data, reported last week that Goldman had lost its crown as the top global M&amp;A advisor for the first time in five years, tumbling to second place in the league table rankings with $237 billion worth of transactions. JPMorgan was the lead M&amp;A advisor this year with $284 billion in deals, the story said.Investment banks typically use league tables as a marketing tool to attract new clients.For the layperson, league tables don’t really mean too much. But on Wall Street, it can be contentious. In April, Refinitiv had JPMorgan edging out Goldman Sachs for the top spot at the end of the first quarter. Dealogic had it the other way around, Reuters reported. This caused Goldman to ask Refinitiv for an explanation while JPMorgan quizzed Dealogic, the story said. Refinitiv and Dealogic will typically provide data with slight differences, but it’s rare for them to have different winners of the most coveted spot in the league tables. Dealogic told Reuters that its methodology is based on feedback from the market, while Refinitiv said it had a process in place that couldn’t be unduly influenced.Story continuesOtherwise, the slowdown in mergers continued during the first half of 2023. The number of global announced M&amp;A transactions dropped by 21% as of July 3, while valuations plunged by 39%, Dealogic said. So far in 2023, there were 18,311 global announced deals, valued at $1.36 trillion. This compares to 23,247 mergers totaling $2.24 trillion for the same time period last year. The drop in deals is the slowest since the pandemic of 2020 caused dealmaking to go on pause for several months.The biggest deal so far this year is Pfizer’s $45.6 billion buy of cancer specialist Seagen. Glencore’s nearly $32 billion offer for Teck Resources’ steelmaking core business came in second while a SPAC merger, Black Spade Acquisition’s $23 billion combination with VinFast Auto, ranked third.When it comes to private equity, the number of global deals fell by 30% to 1,309. But valuation plunged by about 61% to $314.6 billion. In the U.S., the results were just as bad. The number of U.S. private equity deals fell by 33% to 519 transactions valued at $168.5 billion, a 59% drop. The biggest global PE deal was Bunge, the grains merchant that is backed by Glencore, which agreed to buy Viterra, a Canadian grain handling business, in June.

But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. So we wouldn't blame long term Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 34% over a half decade.Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for Leggett &amp; Platt To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Looking back five years, both Leggett &amp; Platt's share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 0.5% per year. Readers should note that the share price has fallen faster than the EPS, at a rate of 8% per year, over the period. This implies that the market is more cautious about the business these days.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Leggett &amp; Platt's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Leggett &amp; Platt's TSR for the last 5 years was -19%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveLeggett &amp; Platt shareholders are down 11% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 16%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 3% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Leggett &amp; Platt better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Leggett &amp; Platt has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.But note: Leggett &amp; Platt may not be the best stock to buy.

MYO recently achieved a significant milestone with its MyoPro device. The company's request to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to reclassify the MyoPro as a brace has been published for public comment. Myomo is a pioneering wearable medical robotics company catering to individuals with neurological disorders and upper-limb paralysis.With this development, the company advances with its target to support health equity for medically-qualified Medicare Part B beneficiaries.More on the NewsAt present, MyoPro is categorized as durable medical equipment, reimbursed through rental payments. However, Myomo has appealed to CMS to reclassify it as a brace, which historically receives lump-sum payments.On Jun 30, 2023, CMS issued a proposal as part of its new rules governing home health services. The proposal, aiming to define a brace to include advanced technologies like the MyoPro, could potentially lead to a positive outcome for Myomo's classification request.The proposed rule suggests that the existing Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes, L8701 and L8702, be classified as a brace.If this rule is finalized without any changes to reimbursement practices, Myomo's MyoPro could be reimbursed in a lump-sum manner by CMS, aligning with the payment approach adopted by private health insurers.Looking AheadBefore the proposed rule becomes official, a 60-day public comment period is required. This period allows stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, and industry experts, to provide feedback and insights to CMS. Additionally, CMS plans to disclose the fee for the MyoPro HCPCS codes at an upcoming public meeting, expected to be held in late 2023 or early 2024.A Long-Awaited MilestoneMyomo's CEO, Paul R. Gudonis, expressed his satisfaction with this progress, describing the proposed rule as the culmination of a multi-year endeavor to secure the appropriate classification for the MyoPro as a brace. The company intends to collaborate with CMS and other stakeholders in the orthotics and prosthetics industry to support the proposed rule's enactment, as it holds the promise of advancing health equity and enabling Medicare beneficiaries to access MyoPro.Story continuesMedical Robotics Market ProspectsAccording to a comprehensive research report by Market Research Future, the global market for medical robotics is poised for significant growth.

Despite the ongoing macro headwinds, the preference for UroLift over other outpatient BPH treatments continued to be driven by strong clinical results.Moreover, the underlying performance in densely populated geographies like Asia buoys optimism. However, mounting expenses and a competitive space are worrisome for TFX.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 5.2% against the 9.8% growth of the industry and the 15.7% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The global provider of med-tech products has a market capitalization of $11.20 billion. The company has an earnings yield of 5.57% against the industry’s -6.35%. Teleflex surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average earnings surprise of 3.26%. Let’s delve deeper.TailwindsImpressive Performance Across Product Category: Teleflex had a strong start to 2023 with continued momentum across its broad business. Vascular Access delivered a solid performance across the portfolio, with the business getting back to growth post the tough COVID-19 comparisons experienced in 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWithin Interventional Access, TFX benefitted from the strength of its largest product categories, including complex catheters, balloon pumps and OnControl. Among larger franchises in the Anesthesia business, the performances of hemostatic products, regional anesthesia and endotracheal tubes were noteworthy in the first quarter.In the Surgical business, metal ligation clips and instrument revenues increased by double digits year over year. Broad-based strength across the OEM portfolio is also encouraging, with double-digit growth in all product categories.Strong Prospects of Urolift: Within Interventional Urology, TFX witnessed growth for UroLift in the hospital setting in the first quarter. The end market for UroLift in the United States is expected to continuously improve throughout 2023.Story continuesMeanwhile, Teleflex made considerable progress in the geographic expansion of UroLift with entry into several new markets in 2022, including Japan and China. The company will spend 2023 training surgeons, building its presence in key cities and continuing to engage with the Chinese Urological Society to build acceptance.Business in Asia Holds Long-Term Potential: From a geographic perspective, Asia continues to be an important growth driver for Teleflex. In the first quarter of 2023, the company experienced strength across the region, with all of them posting a solid performance.China continued to be a significant contributor with very high single-digit growth in the quarter. Although the surgical procedure activity in China has not yet reached normal COVID-19 levels following the termination of the zero-COVID-19 policy in late 2022, the company noticed improvement as the quarter went on.DownsidesQ1 Negatives: In the first quarter, Teleflex’s SG&amp;A expenses rose 13%, while R&amp;D expenses increased 14.1%. During the first quarter earnings update, management stated that through the first two months of the quarter, patient flow declined by another 3.7%. Foreign exchange and a competitive environment remain a concern.Increasing Competition: Teleflex competes with companies, ranging from small start-up enterprises to larger and more established companies that have access to significantly greater financial resources. Major competitors include Medtronic and Becton, Dickinson and Company. Per TFX, it competes primarily based on clinical superiority and innovative features that enhance patient benefit, product reliability, performance, customer and sales support and cost-effectiveness.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for TFX’s 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has remained constant at $13.29 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.94 billion.

(HOLX) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hologic-inc-holx-trending-stock-130013366.html,1688562013,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this medical device maker have returned +1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.2% change. The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which Hologic belongs, has gained 8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.88 per share, indicating a change of -7.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.89 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -35.4%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.09 indicates a change of +5.1% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Hologic.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Hologic, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $956.48 million indicates a year-over-year change of -4.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $4.01 billion and $4.15 billion estimates indicate -17.6% and +3.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $1.03 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -28.5%. EPS of $1.06 for the same period compares with $2.07 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $967.05 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.15%. The EPS surprise was +20.45%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer breaks down the story.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]SEANA SMITH: Netflix shares higher today after the streaming giant got an upgrade at Goldman Sachs from sell to neutral. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer joining us now with more on that move. And Josh, they like what they're seeing here from the password crackdown looks like.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Seana. So it's the password crackdown and sort of how that combines with the ad tier, right? So this is one of several upgrades we've seen for Netflix in the last several weeks. A lot of price target boosts as well as the stock's been up significantly over the last year.And really, what Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs laid out today in that note when he upgraded the stock from sell to neutral, you can see the price target there up from 230 to 400. He said that Netflix's management executed its password share-- sharing initiatives in excess of our prior assumptions.Essentially, saying, they've clamped down on these password-sharing users more than they initially thought they could. And that's been impressive to Goldman. And overall, what that creates is more users that are going to have to go out and get their own account.Now, when Goldman estimates what that's going to be worth for Netflix it's interesting when you think about the overall revenue. So Netflix did about $36 billion in 2022. Goldman sees that coming up to about $49 billion annually in 2025. And that's from people either signing up for a shared account at 799 or becoming an add to your member, which Goldman says per month brings in Netflix about $15 in revenue.So turning that 100 million people that were sharing passwords into paying Netflix users is the key, Goldman says. And they think that's going to turn out to go pretty well for Netflix in the long-term based on what they're seeing right now in the early days.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: Josh, what about some other data that Goldman is pointing to when it relates to app demand.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Akiko, so it's been interesting to just look at how the app downloads have gone back up into positive growth year over year. We remember a big talk about Netflix in 2020 over the pandemic was how much year over year app downloads were growing. And then, of course, that meant subs were growing, right?Well, now since we've seen this password crackdown, you can see on your screen now in 2023, app downloads have gone over 0%, so growing year over year for the first time since 2023, meaning people are signing on their Netflix account. They're realizing they can't share their password anymore with whoever they're sharing it with. And they're actually downloading the app themselves on another device and potentially signing up for an account.Now, it's still to be seen how many of those app downloads lead to more subscriptions, right, and sort of what tier they are buying into. But we'll probably find out a little bit more about that when Netflix reports earnings in two weeks.But, again, just another bullish sign from the Street heading in-- headed into that earnings report.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, recently, got kicked off myself, Josh after using my parents' password for so long.JOSH SCHAFER: You got a new account, Akiko?AKIKO FUJITA: I do have the app. I do have the app. And that's how I'm watching it now. So I'm one of those. Josh Schafer, as always, thanks so much for that.]"

But it's having some positive effects on the stock so far.Late Tuesday night, Goldman Sachs joined the growing list of Wall Street firms that believe the streaming giant's password advancements make the stock a more attractive buy. Netflix's controversial password-sharing crackdown hit the US in May.""NFLX [management] has executed its password sharing initiative in excess of our prior assumptions, has regained content creation momentum in a manner that has muted any post-pandemic growth headwinds and overall industry competition has become more muted (especially from traditional media companies) in the past six months,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan wrote in a note late Tuesday night.Sheridan upgraded the stock from Sell to Neutral and boosted his price target from $230 to $400. Sheridan had slapped a Sell rating on Netflix in June 2022 foreseeing a ""series of headwinds"" including a post-pandemic subscriber normalization.But in the past year, Netflix has built out an ad tier that's drawn 5 million monthly active users, and most recently, it has drawn new subscriptions in the US after limiting password sharing.Amid the changes, Netflix's stock has soared. Shares have risen about 135% since Goldman Sachs initiated its sell rating last year, per Sheridan.Netflix stock added to those yearly gains on Wednesday, rising more than 2% in early morning trading.As Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal has been tracking, at least four other Wall Street firms have raised their price targets on Netflix in the last several weeks leading into Netflix's second quarter earnings release, which is expected on July 19.""We increasingly view NFLX's crackdown on password sharing and the AVOD (advertising video on demand) opportunity as inextricably linked,"" Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote in a note to clients on June 13. ""At the $6.99 price point, the ad-supported tier provides an attractive low-priced option for 'borrowers' who still wish to access the Netflix service. In our view, the broader crackdown on password sharing will be an accelerant to NFLX's ad-supported tier.""Story continuesSheridan notes the ""key debate"" over Netflix has been whether it can capture the roughly 100 million households that had been using Netflix through password sharing.Goldman Sachs mapped out a scenario where Netflix converts 40 million password sharers to add-on members at $7.99 per month by the end of 2023 and 30 million sharers convert to their own ad-supported tier subscription (which generates an average monthly revenue per user (ARPU) of $15, per Goldman Sachs).These estimates have Goldman Sachs projecting Netflix revenue to increase from $31.62 billion in 2022 to about $49 billion in 2025.""Better than expected execution on the paid sharing initiative could result in meaningfully higher ARPU growth and ultimately higher revenue and operating margins,"" Sheridan wrote. ""Conversely, if paid sharing results in an uptick in churn levels and/or downgrades to lower-priced tiers, our operating assumptions may be overstated.""At least four Wall Street firms in addition to Goldman have raised their price targets on Netflix stock in recent weeks.

Yahoo Finance anchors Diane King Hall and Brad Smith break down the reasons for the upgrade.Video Transcript- We got some positive news for Netflix this morning after the streaming giant got an upgrade from Goldman Sachs from sell to neutral with analyst Eric Sheridan saying Netflix has regained content creation momentum and executed its password-sharing initiative. So you're seeing the stock get a little pop there. About 1.25%.I mean, Eric saying in the note that the recommendation before was based on some headwinds, the sell recommendation from the post-pandemic subscriber growth, but saying that he sees the, you know, execution of the password-sharing playing out better than expected. I guess it hasn't, you know, turned people off to Netflix.BRAD SMITH: It has not, no. In fact, it's kind of worked to their strategy at least that they had laid out on set of making sure that they were cracking down on password-sharing. They also said within this note that they've regained content creation momentum in a manner that has muted any post-pandemic growth headwinds, and overall industry competition has become more muted, especially from traditional media companies in the past six months. It's also probably worth noting on the content creation front that we are still in the midst of a writers' strike.- Right.BRAD SMITH: As we were told by the chairman of UTA Paul Wachter out in Cannes a few week back-- weeks back, we could potentially be looking at--- An actor's strike.BRAD SMITH: --an actor's strike. And so with that, the content costs are certainly going to become in focus-- coming in focus among investors where they're looking across how much companies are going to have to spend in this near term just to make sure that they are still creating content that keeps people on these platforms as well.- Yeah, and that's why they're also expanding their international content efforts.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: Yeah.- You know, preparing for a potential actor's strike as well.BRAD SMITH: Absolutely.]"

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.2% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.38%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 9.78%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the defense contractor had gained 2.36% over the past month. This has lagged the Aerospace sector's gain of 6.33% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.16% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from General Dynamics as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect General Dynamics to post earnings of $2.63 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 4.36%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $9.45 billion, up 2.84% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $12.65 per share and revenue of $41.33 billion, which would represent changes of +3.77% and +4.88%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for General Dynamics. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell).

We will also analyze the current job scenario of the federal government and the changing landscape it is adapting to. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can head straight to 5 Highest-Paying Government Jobs Without a Degree. The public sector in the United States is facing serious challenges in hiring for essential jobs, such as teachers, police officers, firefighters, paramedics, and garbage collectors. As of July 2022, there were 1.1 million unfilled positions at the local, state, and federal levels, nearly double the number from five years ago. Federal jobs have not recovered as steadily as private sector employment, with surveys revealing dissatisfaction among government employees regarding wages. Layoffs during the pandemic and the Great Recession have also highlighted that government jobs are not necessarily secure.Federal Government Aims to Bridge Tech Talent Gap Amidst Layoffs in Private SectorTo improve the situation, the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is taking steps to attract tech industry talent to the federal workforce, especially now as layoffs continue to impact companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). OPM plans to issue new pay guidance, allowing agencies to hire tech workers at higher rates. The increased pay will be funded partially through the 2021 infrastructure funding bill and the 2022 CHIPS Act.Currently, the federal government is offering numerous opportunities for tech professionals in sectors such as energy, transportation, healthcare, and national security. While the tech industry has recently experienced waves of layoffs, affecting around 191,912 employees across 1,148 companies, the federal government has been unable to fill approximately 2,500 jobs in the past three years. Hence, OPM has launched the website tech.usajobs.gov to simplify the application process for multiple federal jobs, with a promising increase of 50% in the availability of options for remote and telework in the last two fiscal years. Currently, the federal government has been on a lookout for the job of accountancy in remote position, which is also one of the high-paying remote jobs without a degree and experience.Story continuesRemote Work in Government Jobs: A New RealityOn the brighter side, however, in an effort to improve hiring for federal jobs, the United States Government has not only embraced but also ensured to pay lucrative compensation for remote positions. These roles can come with salaries as high as $180,000. Currently, there are approximately 688 federal remote or remote-eligible job openings listed on the USAJOBS website, spanning various departments such as finance, marketing, medical care, research, engineering, and more. These positions cater to individuals at all levels, from entry-level to executive positions. Additionally, U.S. government employees and their families enjoy a range of benefits, including flexible spending accounts, and health, vision, dental, and life insurance plans. Speaking of the benefits, the highest-paying job in the government is that of the U.S President who makes $400,000 annually.Along with the rise of remote jobs, both in the public and the private sector, the popularity of federal jobs without a degree, and jobs without experience and a degree has also been noticeable. This can be attributed to the pandemic which accelerated digital transformation through online learning and created new job opportunities that prioritized skills over formal qualifications, making it easier for individuals without degrees to enter the workforce. According to US News, the highest salary without a degree is that of a patrol officer with a median salary of $64,610.Key Companies in the GovernmentLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT): As a global aerospace and defense company, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) plays a significant role in supporting the US military and government agencies.

95,66cc415e-0f0d-3914-854d-ec7e21c82f88,ZTS,2023-07-06,Investing in Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS) five years ago would have delivered you a 105% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-zoetis-nyse-zts-five-110050576.html,1688641250,STORY,['ZTS'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, long term Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) shareholders have enjoyed a 98% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 50% (not including dividends).Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Zoetis In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Zoetis achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 17% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 15% per year. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Zoetis' key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Zoetis's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Zoetis' TSR for the last 5 years was 105%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in Zoetis had a tough year, with a total loss of 4.6% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 13%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 15%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

96,9de41a26-c8b4-32ed-b1b2-d0883721e39a,ZTS,2023-07-06,Wall Street Analysts Believe Zoetis (ZTS) Could Rally 27.94%: Here's is How to Trade,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-believe-zoetis-135504144.html,1688565304,STORY,"['ZTS', 'TGT']","[Zoetis (ZTS) closed the last trading session at $170.23, gaining 0.1% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $217.80 indicates a 27.9% upside potential.The average comprises 10 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $180 to a high of $260, with a standard deviation of $28.35. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 5.7% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 52.7% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in ZTS. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.Here's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why ZTS Could Witness a Solid UpsideThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month, as one estimate has gone higher compared to no negative revision.Moreover, ZTS currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much ZTS could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

There are many different companies out there that have steadily increased their dividends over 25 years. A select few dividend stocks have even done it for more than 50 years. Investing geared towards dividends can also help weather the storm in bear market times, where you are still able to have some source of steady income within a choppy market.Paying attention to a company’s overall financial health and outlook on dividend yield is very important. If you are trying to make some money in dividends from a stock that is a sinking ship. It’s just a recipe for disaster. Compare dividend yields for companies within the same sector to determine if one company is paying huge dividends to shareholders instead of reinvesting that capital back into the business to help it grow. Below I will discuss three dividends stocks, two are very safe options for dividend investing and the third one is a riskier option.NextEra Energy (NEE)The NextEra Energy (NEE) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) generates and sells electricity to consumers on a residential and commercial scale. They generate power through various forms such as solar, nuclear, coal and natural gas. One of the company’s subsidiaries is Florida Power &amp; Light, another Florida-based utility company. And they also operate a renewable energy segment of their business. The company has seen 30 consecutive years of dividend increases, and they just recently announced another dividend increase to 47 cents per share.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn April, NextEra released its first quarter earnings with revenue that grew 132% year-over-year. The jump in revenue is because the company has been expanding its renewable energy business. NextEra Energy, as a whole, is a well-established energy company that profited heavily during the much higher energy prices over the last couple of years. But, with the energy market now in a slump, NextEra is trading lower compared to the previous year, making it an interesting buying opportunity, especially with the predictable dividend increases in the future.Story continuesRealty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockRealty Income (NYSE:O) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) located in San Diego, California.

One of the advantages when it comes to REITs regarding dividends is that these companies must pay at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividend payments every year, which makes them a really appealing option for dividend growth.The company’s net income for the first quarter grew by 13% compared to the previous year. They also recently announced their 121st dividend increase, which is now 26 cents per share, payable on July 14.

The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.1% during a shortened session on Monday, while the Nasdaq edged 0.2% higher. Both indexes were slightly lower through early afternoon trading Wednesday as investors waited for inflation and interest rate updates via the Fed’s June minutes.Wall Street isn’t likely to learn too much more, since Jay Powell and the Fed already said they plan to raise rates again in 2023 and leave them higher for longer than many hoped several months ago. Traders currently place a roughly 90% chance on the Fed raising rates by 0.25% at its late-July FOMC meeting to take its benchmark rate to between 5.25% and 5.50%, based on the CME Fed Watch Tool. Peeking further down the road, Wall Street sees rates staying (70% chance) at those new levels or 25 basis points higher into January 2024.  Investors appear to be growing comfortable with the new higher-rate environment. And the economy is showcasing impressive resilience that has more on Wall Street calling for a soft-landing as the labor market, supply chains, and more continue to normalize following the truly unprecedented Covid shocks. Plus, if history is a useful guide, the market could be headed for a strong back half of 2023 even after its bullish start.Plus, other areas outside of big tech are finally starting to participate in the rally. All 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors climbed in June. And the overall S&amp;P 500 earnings picture is stabilizing and even starting to trend higher for some areas of the market.The first-half rally also showcases why it is vital to stay exposed to the stock market as much as possible because few were calling for a bullish first six months of 2023 back at the end of 2022.Today we use a Zacks screen that helps find stocks that offer a combination of value and improving earnings outlooks for investors looking to buy stocks in July and beyond.Screen BasicsThe screen we are digging into today comes loaded with the Research Wizard and aims to sort through highly-ranked Zacks stocks to find some of the top value names.Story continuesThis value-focused screen searches only for stocks that boast Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buys) or #2 (Buys). It also focuses on stocks with price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios under the median for its industry. The screen also looks for stocks with price-to-sales (P/S) ratios under the median for its industry to help lock in relative value compared to its peers, since basing it off the wider market is not always the most useful tool.The screen then digs into quarterly earnings rates above the median for its industry. This particular Zacks screen also uses a special blend of upgrades and estimates revisions to select the best seven stocks in this list.The screen basics are listed below…·       Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) Stocks ·       P/E (using 12-month EPS) - Under the Median for its Industry·       P/S - Under the Median for its Industry ·       Percentage Change Act.

It can be found in the SoW (Screen of the Week) folder.The screen is pretty simple, yet powerful. Here are two of the seven stocks that made it through this week's screen…KB Home (KBH) KB Home is one of the largest homebuilders in the U.S., operating in nearly 50 markets across Colorado, Arizona, Texas, California, Nevada, Washington, and beyond. KBH allows buyers to customize many aspects of their homes and it is committed to energy-efficient offerings. KB Home’s revenue soared 37% in 2021 and another 21% in 2022 amid the Covid housing boomThe housing market has cooled from its blistering pace. Thankfully, demographic trends and the overall housing shortage remain long-term tailwinds for KB Home and the broader homebuilder segment. The housing market is also showing signs of life as buyers realize rates are likely stabilizing at higher levels. And the economy remains on very sturdy footing, with the unemployment rate continuing to hover near historic lows.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKBH’s revenue climbed 3% YoY in Q2 FY23, with homes delivered up 6% and the average selling price down 3%. Zacks estimates still call for KB Home’s adjusted fiscal 2023 earnings and revenue to slide as it faces a very difficult to compete against stretch. But KBH’s adjusted earnings outlook has soared since its Q2 report, with its consensus estimate up 19% for FY23 and 16% for FY24 to help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Plus, KBH is projected to return to strong top and bottom-line growth in FY24.KB Home shares have surged 70% over the last year and 60% YTD. This is part of a 95% run over the past five years to outpace the S&amp;P 500’s 64%. Despite the climb, KBH trades right around its own five-year median at 8.1X forward 12-month earnings and at a 35% discount to its own high during this stretch. KB Home also trades at a 20% discount to its Building Products - Home Builders industry, which currently ranks in the top 4% of over 250 Zacks industries.Patterson Companies, Inc. (PDCO)Patterson Companies aims to provide top-of-the-line products, technology, and services to both the dental market and the animal health segment in North America and the U.K. The company’s dental segment includes roughly 130K offerings across products, equipment, software, technology, and services, from dental care essentials to its Patterson Revolve Software Suite. Patterson’s Animal Health segment aims to service everything your local veterinary might need, alongside all the essentials to keep livestock and farm animals healthy.  Patterson’s fiscal 2023 revenue (period ended on April 29) came in essentially flat from FY22 and its adjusted earnings popped 7%. PDCO’s solid showing last year came up against a big two-year stretch of top and bottom-line growth. And Zacks estimates call for PDCO to post solid adjusted earnings and revenue growth both this year and next. Plus, its EPS outlook has popped since it reported its Q4 FY23 results on June 21 to help it grab a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the moment.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPDCO shares have jumped 16% YTD, including a 14% post-earnings release surge. Patterson stock has now climbed 40% in the last five years to outpace its Medical - Dental Supplies industry’s (currently ranked No. 52 out of 252 Zacks industries) 27% run. PDCO currently trades at a 31% discount to its industry at 12.9X forward 12-month earnings. Patterson also trades roughly 10% below its own five-year median and offers 35% value vs. its own highs. Plus, PDCO’s dividend currently yields around 3.2%.Click here to sign up for a free trial to the Research Wizard today.Want more articles from this author?

It is often considered an important parameter for gauging a company’s potential to make profits.Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors’ radar, regardless of market conditions. This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to offer impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated to its price performance.However, at times, it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:These efficiency ratios are:Receivables Turnover:  This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company’s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or “debtor’s turnover ratio” is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company’s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.Inventory Turnover: The ratio of the 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company’s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which has resulted in excess inventory.Story continuesOperating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company’s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Screening CriteriaIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) — to the screen to make this strategy more profitable. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization, and Operating Margin greater than the industry average(Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)  The use of these few criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to 12.Here are the top four stocks that made it through the screen:GMS GMS is a distributor of wallboard and suspended ceilings. GMS has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 9.2%.ABB ABBNY is a leading technology company.

This clarification will not result in any domicile changes for any U.S. companies, as it simply provides more clarity and transparency to the existing rule.Previous Domicile Eligibility Methodology StatementUpdated Domicile Eligibility Methodology StatementCompany is subject to U.S. Securities Exchange Act reporting obligations for domestic issuers, including requirements to file periodic reports such as, but not limited to, Form 10-K annual reports, Form 10-Q quarterly reports, and Form 8-K current reports.Company satisfies its periodic reporting obligations under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act by filing forms for domestic issuers, such as, but not limited to, Form 10-K annual reports, Form 10-Q quarterly reports, and Form 8-K current reports.Below are the full U.S. domicile criteria including the above wording update:Domicile.  Only common stocks of U.S. companies are eligible. For index purposes, a U.S. company has the following characteristics:1.Company satisfies its periodic reporting obligations under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act by filing forms for domestic issuers, such as, but not limited to, Form 10-K annual reports, Form 10-Q quarterly reports, and Form 8-K current reports.2.The U.S. portion of fixed assets and revenues constitutes a plurality of the total but need not exceed 50%. When these factors conflict, fixed assets determine plurality. Revenue determines plurality when there is incomplete asset information. Geographic information for revenue and fixed asset allocations are determined by the company as reported in its annual filings.3.The primary listing must be on an eligible U.S. exchange as described under Exchange Listing below.If criteria #2 is not met or is ambiguous, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices may still deem it a U.S. company for index purposes if its primary listing, headquarters, and incorporation are all in the U.S. and/or a ""domicile of convenience"". For further information on domiciles of convenience, please refer to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices' Equity Indices Policies &amp; Practices Methodology.In situations where the only factor suggesting that a company is not a U.S. company is its tax registration in a ""domicile of convenience"" or another location chosen for tax-related reasons, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices normally determines that the company is still a U.S. company.The final determination of domicile eligibility is made by the Index Committee which can consider other factors including, but not limited to, operational headquarters location, ownership information, location of officers, directors and employees, investor perception and other factors deemed to be relevant.The U.S. Indices methodology and the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Indices methodology documents are being updated to reflect the above changes.

There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Unhappily, Tyson Foods had to report a 62% decline in EPS over the last year. The share price fall of 40% isn't as bad as the reduction in earnings per share. So the market may not be too worried about the EPS figure, at the moment -- or it may have expected earnings to drop faster.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Tyson Foods' earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 16% in the last year, Tyson Foods shareholders lost 38% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 2% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

109,2f4d463e-c09c-3905-a5f4-a14883a23599,QCOM,2023-07-06,China to restrict exports of chipmaking materials to U.S.: Market impact,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/china-restrict-exports-chipmaking-materials-200723810.html,1688587643,VIDEO,"['^DJI', 'MPWR', '^GSPC', 'AMD', '^NDX', 'QCOM', '^IXIC', 'INTC', 'TSM']","[Ahead of U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's visit to the nation, China has moved to restrict exports of chipmaking materials to the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations ​​Senior Fellow Charles Kupchan joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the United States' delicate trade relationship with China, and how these restrictions could impact the semiconductor industry.Video Transcript- Well, shares of chip makers are down broadly today after China restricted the exports of metals that are critical to manufacturing semiconductors. The new rules specifically target gallium and germanium, and it comes months after the US imposed sweeping restrictions all but banning shipments of advanced chips to China. And of course, it comes as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen prepares to visit Beijing.Here to discuss further, let's bring in Charles Kupchan, professor of International Affairs at Georgetown University, and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Always good to have you on the show. Talk to me about the timing of all of these restrictions being announced just days before Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is set to make the trip?CHARLES KUPCHAN: Well, the US and China are in a bit of a dance here, where the relationship was in the freezer, basically since the US shoot down of the Chinese balloon that drifted across the United States. Blinken, Secretary of State, his trip to Beijing was canceled. Finally, it was put back on the schedule, he went a couple of weeks ago. Now Janet Yellen is going in an attempt to restart the dialogue about the relationship is in a very difficult place right now. And just in advance of this trip we're seeing number one the Chinese say export controls on these metals that you use in advanced chips.The United States we're now hearing is about to restrict the access of Chinese companies to cloud computing as a potential backdoor to getting advanced access to AI and these kinds of things. So she's going at a time when the relationship is fraught. I think there's a willingness on both sides to try to push the conversation as a positive direction, but it's going to be real, it's going to be an uphill battle.Story continues- Specifically in these critical metals. And what we have seen China do this before around rare Earth minerals many, many years ago. How critical are these metals that have been mentioned, and what's your assessment of the impact this is likely to have, at least within the chipmaking space, as well as the solar space?Well, I think that the Chinese have seen the US announcement about restricting access to high-end chips and chip making machines as a sign that the United States wants to contain China and prevent its rise, prevent it from economic growth. Keep it to three steps behind the United States. And they see this as in many respects, not an act of war, but a real sign that the US-China relationship is headed in a very negative direction.And as a consequence, they are trying to begin to push back. They're saying if you restrict our access to high-end chips, we're going to restrict the access of the metals that you need to make those chips. And I think what we're seeing here is the two sides feeling each other out about how far this tit for tat game is going to go. The National Security advisor Jake Sullivan has said, ""small yard, high fence,"" that is to say we're going to restrict a relatively small number of technologies but we're going to make sure the Chinese can't get them.The big question right now, is it going to turn into big field high fence? Is there going to be a snowballing effect where the US and the Chinese economies begin to effectively decouple? We're not there yet, but that in some ways is the $6 million question. And the Chinese announcement about restricting the export of these metals, I think is a sign that we are heading in that direction.- You highlighted a number of issues that are on the table and the Treasury secretary's visit to Beijing. Do these latest restrictions that have been announced from China-- does that give Beijing a little more leverage in these talks?CHARLES KUPCHAN: Well, you know, I think that both sides are trying to set the table here. I don't think it's an accident that the ""Wall Street Journal"" reported that in this new announcement, this new rule that's going to be coming out later this year from the Biden administration that it will include potentially restrictions on access to cloud computing. The Chinese, I don't think accidentally announced that they're going to restrict the export of these critical metals. In some ways, both sides are jockeying. They are trying to get the upper hand in this conversation.And I think we know from history that you've got to get the geopolitics right if you're going to get the economics right. You can't solve US-China tension by Janet Yellen making a breakthrough here or breakthrough there on trade. But I do think what we're seeing here is the two sides begin to engage in a conversation that's aimed at trying to put a floor beneath the tension. Trying to prevent the further slide in US-China relations.Right now, it's simply too soon to tell. Both sides are taking tough measures against the other, not making concessions and so on. So showing signs of moving toward more cooperation.- What do you think this leaves other countries that are US allies and big players, particularly in the chip space. I mean, South Korea, for example, has really shown that they're a little uneasy in having to take sides on in either direction?CHARLES KUPCHAN: Well, you know so far, the United States has gotten the Netherlands and Japan to cooperate on this chip restriction. I think the bigger question is Europe, is South Korea, is Japan, are these other countries that have major trade relationships with China going to agree to go down the road of some significant measure of decoupling with China.And at this point, I don't think we know the answer to that. I do think that the Europeans in particular are uncomfortable with the prospect of an escalation in a trade war. Germany's main trading partner is China. Its car companies have big business in China. And so I think right now the sides are feeling each other out, and the United States is trying to pull Europe in its direction. But so too are the Chinese worried about the erosion of their relationship with Europe.And that relationship has taken a serious southward turn because of the war in Ukraine and China's backing of Russia in that war. Right now, I think the Chinese are on a bit of a charm offensive with Europe. And not just with Europe, they're trying to get more involved in Middle East diplomacy, brokering a deal for rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia.So I think that the Chinese strategy here is to try to isolate the United States. Keep good relationships with the Global South, with the Europeans in particular at a time when the relationship with the US seems to be going in a more difficult direction.And finally, Charles, so many of these restrictions or at least verbal warnings have been around the tech space. We talked about concerns around data sharing, cloud computing, AI, semiconductors, and materials there. Does this go beyond that? Is there a risk of that or is this largely contained to tech because of the competition and then the ramifications of tech being transferred in either direction?CHARLES KUPCHAN: Yeah. I mean, it's a great question. And I think for now, this is as Jake Sullivan puts it a small field, it's restricted to high-end technology, it's restricted to technologies. But if the Chinese military got its hands on it, it could put it in a position to become a more serious competitor of the United States in a geopolitical sense. We know that during the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union had both had effectively no commercial relationship. A fracture in the global economy.We now live in a much more interdependent world, in which the US, Europe, many countries in the Global South are deeply integrated into the Chinese economy. Going back to a global fracture, in which you don't just decouple in a minimal way, but you deglobalize, that would wreak havoc on the international economy. And that's why I think everybody's watching carefully to see whether this tit for tat that we see between the US and China now stays restricted in the realm of AI and high-end semiconductors, or begins to broaden to other sectors. That I think is the key question, we won't know the answer because right now we're both sides are feeling each other out.- They will all be watching for any developments coming out of the treasury secretary's visit there. Charles Kupchan, Georgetown University professor and member of council on Foreign Relations. Thanks so much for joining us today.CHARLES KUPCHAN: My pleasure.]"
110,d0368878-5512-3166-a8f2-ddd83379818f,QCOM,2023-07-06,3 Semiconductor Stocks That AI Predicts Will Deliver Triple-Digit Returns in 2024,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-semiconductor-stocks-ai-predicts-105611573.html,1688122571,STORY,"['NVDA', 'INTC', 'AMD', 'SWKS', 'QCOM']","[Semiconductor stocks have been the best-performing names in 2023, driven by the accelerating interest in artificial intelligence. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is up 187%-plus year-to-date, while other stocks like Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) are up nearly 474%. Indeed, the momentum is too hot to ignore, but it should also be noted that a cooldown is overdue here.Nonetheless, AI will eventually be a massive sector. It will take substantially more time for that to happen than many people expect. In that time, some up-and-coming companies will challenge the current AI industry bellwethers. Nvidia, for example, is priced for perfection. Not many investors see the long-term threat from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which is rumored to be partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). AMD will likely be neck and neck with Nvidia by the time AI starts to generate substantial sales and profit. Thus, I don’t see NVDA stock as a good bet with its current entry point of&gt;$400.We’ll be using Google’s Bard AI to find semiconductor stocks that are a good bet. Using Bard as a tool and screening their fundamentals can yield great stock-picking results. Let’s start!InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMe: Hi Bard, I am writing an article for InvestorPlace titled “3 Semiconductor Stocks That AI Predicts Will Deliver Triple-Digit Returns in 2024” Can you give me some ideas?Intel (INTC)The Intel (INTC) booth at the CES show in Las Vegas on January 08 2017 , CES is the world's leading consumer-electronics show.Source: Kobby Dagan / Shutterstock.comBard: “Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is a leading provider of microprocessors and other semiconductor products. The company is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for cloud computing, data centers, and artificial intelligence. Intel is also investing heavily in new technologies, such as 5G and artificial intelligence, which could drive significant growth in the future.”Even though Intel is up 27% since my last buy recommendation, it has been quiet recently. But that doesn’t mean it lacks the potential to deliver triple-digit returns in the long run. INTC trades at a depressed valuation, the likes of which haven’t been seen in almost a decade. Thus, it is a no-brainer to snap up the stock before it runs higher.Story continuesWhile competitors like AMD did surpass the company and give it a beating regarding consumer processor chips, Intel is far from dead. For one, Intel’s processors are still top-notch choices for single-core performance. The company has been delivering on their promise of a comeback against AMD by showcasing many chips ahead of schedule. Intel also cut prices on its Arc A750 to just $199, comparable to Nvidia’s RTX 3060, going for $329 officially.We’ll be looking at further appreciation once the gaming sector receives tailwinds again. I won’t delve too much into financials. However, revenue is expected to rebound by 13.4% next year which will make it appeal more to Wall Street. But again, I’m confident that this long-term play can deliver better returns than most semiconductor stocks.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphoneSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comBard: “Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a leading provider of high-performance analog semiconductors. The company’s strong track record of innovation and growth make it well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for analog chips in a variety of applications. Skyworks Solutions also has a strong balance sheet and a dividend yield of over 2%.”Finding semiconductor stocks that provide both growth and value is difficult in this environment –  and Skyworks is no different. You may wonder where the “growth” is since its bottom line has been shrinking since Q4 2021, and the top line declined by 12% YOY in the last two quarters. Skyworks is a risky play because its growth is in the future. But it can deliver double-digit returns if you snap up the stock at its current price.Skyworks is projected to grow its revenue by 6.3% next year and accelerate to 9.3% YOY in 2025. EPS will also bounce back by up to 17.2% YOY in the next two years. The downside risk here is low, and I believe substantial appreciation is ahead once growth returns. The chips supplied by the company to a range of different industries should also insulate it from headwinds in 2024.Qualcomm (QCOM)Source: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.comBard: “Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading provider of mobile processors. The company is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for 5G smartphones and other mobile devices. 5G is the next generation of cellular network technology, and it is expected to drive significant growth in the mobile market. Qualcomm is one of the leading providers of 5G chips, and the company is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this growing market.”While Qualcomm is an excellent pick, despite Bard’s explanation for choosing it being a little old. Qualcomm currently changes hands 14 times forward earnings, and 5Gs tailwinds are still in play. This underappreciated company dominates the 5G and telecommunications space and is a well-known semiconductor player.Semiconductor stocks outside of the AI space are facing a cyclical downturn. QCOM is likely near or at the trough of this downturn, as it is already down over 35% from its peak, and Wall Street’s concerns have been priced in. Still, the consensus analyst price target is not that high, implying a 15% upside.However, I believe there is much higher upside potential. Sales are expected to decline by over 18.8% this year but return to growth in the next two years. This growth is moderating, but further surprises are possible if the handset market recovers.All things considered, this is a passive pick, and there won’t be any triple-digit returns anytime soon (as Bard believes), but the small downside risk makes it worth grabbing because there is a 2.72% dividend yield as a sweetener!On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The public sector in the United States is facing serious challenges in hiring for essential jobs, such as teachers, police officers, firefighters, paramedics, and garbage collectors. As of July 2022, there were 1.1 million unfilled positions at the local, state, and federal levels, nearly double the number from five years ago. Federal jobs have not recovered as steadily as private sector employment, with surveys revealing dissatisfaction among government employees regarding wages. Layoffs during the pandemic and the Great Recession have also highlighted that government jobs are not necessarily secure.Federal Government Aims to Bridge Tech Talent Gap Amidst Layoffs in Private SectorTo improve the situation, the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is taking steps to attract tech industry talent to the federal workforce, especially now as layoffs continue to impact companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). OPM plans to issue new pay guidance, allowing agencies to hire tech workers at higher rates. The increased pay will be funded partially through the 2021 infrastructure funding bill and the 2022 CHIPS Act.Currently, the federal government is offering numerous opportunities for tech professionals in sectors such as energy, transportation, healthcare, and national security. While the tech industry has recently experienced waves of layoffs, affecting around 191,912 employees across 1,148 companies, the federal government has been unable to fill approximately 2,500 jobs in the past three years. Hence, OPM has launched the website tech.usajobs.gov to simplify the application process for multiple federal jobs, with a promising increase of 50% in the availability of options for remote and telework in the last two fiscal years.

This can be attributed to the pandemic which accelerated digital transformation through online learning and created new job opportunities that prioritized skills over formal qualifications, making it easier for individuals without degrees to enter the workforce.

117,51951302-c921-375c-96a0-f5bb41896e24,JNJ,2023-07-06,15 Countries With The Best Healthcare In The World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-countries-best-healthcare-world-213454089.html,1688592894,STORY,"['JNJ', 'PFE', 'MDT']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 countries with the best healthcare in the world. If you wish to see the top ones, head straight to the 5 Countries With The Best Healthcare In The World.When it comes to ensuring the well-being of their citizens, some countries like Switzerland, the US, France, Norway, and Belgium, among others, stand out as the most advanced countries in healthcare. These nations have made substantial investments in healthcare infrastructure, medical research, and the training of healthcare professionals, resulting in high-quality and accessible healthcare for their populations.With a strong emphasis on preventive care, advanced technology, and comprehensive health services, these countries have consistently ranked among the best in the world for healthcare. From efficient healthcare delivery to impressive health outcomes, their dedication to providing exceptional medical care has earned them a well-deserved reputation as leaders in the field.  Global Healthcare Rankings: Recognizing Excellence Global healthcare rankings are an essential benchmark for measuring healthcare providers' and facilities' quality and performance worldwide. According to recent financial statistics, the global healthcare market is expected to reach $7,342.61 million by 2030 growing at a CAGR of 21.92%.Additionally, the top-performing healthcare providers like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Johnson &amp; Johnsons (NYSE:JNJ), GE Healthcare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC), and Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), among others, consistently demonstrate strong financial performance, with many reporting high profitability and revenue growth levels. With this in mind, it's clear that global healthcare rankings are an essential tool for patients and healthcare professionals seeking the best possible care and outcomes. Healthcare Investment and Infrastructure: Foundations for Success Businesses in the healthcare industry must remember a few critical foundations for success regarding healthcare investment and infrastructure. Understanding the needs and demands of the healthcare industry is crucial, and staying up to date on the latest trends and technologies and understanding the regulatory landscape and how it affects your business is essential. Story continuesBuilding strong partnerships and collaborations within the healthcare ecosystem is another necessary foundation for success. By partnering with healthcare providers, payers, and other stakeholders, businesses can develop innovative solutions that meet the needs of patients and improve outcomes. Studies show that businesses collaborating with healthcare providers and stakeholders can see a 25% increase in revenue. Finally, investing in the proper infrastructure is crucial to success in the healthcare industry, which includes cutting-edge technology and equipment, well-trained staff, and a robust IT infrastructure. By investing in the right tools and resources, businesses can deliver high-quality care and stay ahead of the competition. Healthcare Accessibility and Affordability: Ensuring Universal Coverage Access to quality healthcare is essential for everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status. Unfortunately, approximately 30 million people in the United States still lack health insurance coverage, leading to severe financial instability and even loss of life. Studies have shown that uninsured individuals are more likely to delay or forgo necessary medical care due to high costs, resulting in more severe health conditions and increased healthcare expenses in the long term. Investing in healthcare infrastructure can yield positive financial outcomes. For instance, a report tells that every dollar invested in hospital construction generates $2.30 in economic activity within the local economy, which creates job opportunities, boosts revenue for local businesses, and enhances property values. Taking a proactive approach through preventive care can also be cost-effective. Chronic diseases like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes account for approximately 75% of healthcare spending in the United States By investing in preventive measures such as vaccination programs, regular health screenings, and disease management initiatives, we can reduce the occurrence of chronic diseases and subsequently lower healthcare costs in the long run. Emerging Trends in Healthcare: Anticipating Future Challenges and Opportunities The healthcare industry is evolving rapidly, and businesses must stay updated on emerging trends and future opportunities. One significant trend is the rise of telemedicine, which allows remote medical care through video conferencing and other technologies. The telemedicine market is projected to reach $396.76 billion by 2027, with a compound annual growth rate of 25.8% from 2020 to 2027. Personalized medicine is another growing trend, tailoring treatments to individual patients based on their genetics and other factors. The global personalized medicine market is expected to reach $3.18 trillion by 2025, with a compound annual growth rate of 10% from 2020 to 2025. To succeed in the changing healthcare landscape, businesses must adapt to these trends and leverage new technologies. However, challenges such as rising healthcare costs, physician shortages, and ensuring patient privacy and security must also be addressed. In 2021, healthcare spending in the United States alone was projected to reach $4.3 trillion, accounting for approximately 18.3% of the country's GDP. With careful planning and a focus on innovation, businesses can navigate these challenges and capitalize on the opportunities presented by the future of healthcare. By investing in telemedicine and personalized medicine, companies can enhance patient outcomes, reduce costs, and maintain the highest standards of care. Financial Success in Global Healthcare Industry: Notable Companies and Key FactorsThe global healthcare industry is a massive market, with some of the largest companies reporting impressive financials. For instance, in 2022, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), one of the most profitable pharmaceutical companies in the world reported a net income of $17.94 billion, while Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) reported a net income of $31.37 billion. Roche, on the other hand, reported a net income of $13.01 billion in the same year. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)'s financial success can be attributed to their ability to develop and market innovative pharmaceutical products that meet the needs of patients and healthcare providers. In the health insurance industry, UnitedHealth Group reported a net income of $20.63 billion in 2022, while Anthem reported a net income of $6.1 billion in 2021. The medical devices and equipment industry, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) reported a net income of $5.03 billion in 2022 , while GE Healthcare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) reported a net income of $1.91 billion in the same year. Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) and GE Healthcare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC)'s financial success can be attributed to their ability to develop and market cutting-edge medical devices and equipment that improve patient outcomes and support healthcare providers.15 Countries With The Best Healthcare In The WorldMonkey Business Images/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology Our methodology for identifying the best healthcare worldwide involved conducting thorough research using sources such as US News, Legatum Prosperity Index, Global Health Security Index, William Russel, and Atlas And Boots, among others.

119,b69a4de4-296a-31ce-af00-902ad94d80e1,JNJ,2023-07-06,Can Eli Lilly's (LLY) Continue its Ride on Obesity Drug Wave?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eli-lillys-lly-continue-ride-135100545.html,1688565060,STORY,"['LLY', 'NVO', 'JNJ']","[Year to date, shares of Eli Lilly LLY have surged 26.1% compared with the industry’s 0.4% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis upside can be attributed to the company’s progress with its pipeline candidates for treating obesity. Lilly is running multiple comprehensive clinical development programs evaluating different drugs for treating obesity in patients, with or without diabetes, which can be administered orally or by injections.Last month, Lilly announced new results from a phase II study that evaluated retatrutide, its investigational triple GIP/GLP-1/glucagon injectable molecule for treating obesity or overweight in patients without diabetes. Data from the study showed that treatment with retatrutide achieved met one of its secondary endpoints, exhibiting a mean weight reduction of up to 24.2% at the end of a 48-week treatment duration. The study also met its primary endpoint of percent change in weight from baseline at 24 weeks, exhibiting a mean weight reduction of up to 17.5%.Management also announced new data from another mid-stage study evaluating its investigational oral once-daily GLP-1 receptor agonist (“GLP-1-RA”) drug, orforglipron. The drug achieved a mean weight reduction up to 14.7%, following a 36-week treatment period in adults with obesity or overweight without diabetes.Though the above results are still early and yet to be dose-optimized for managing side-effects, they also exhibit their potential for chronic weight management in people living with obesity. A continued potential success in late-stage clinical studies could help the company dominate this untapped target market in the long-run. Both retatrutide and orforglipron are currently being evaluated across multiple separate phase III studies for treating various types of patients with obesity.Recently, Lilly announced that it has completed the regulatory submission seeking label expansion for its dual GIP/GLP-1-RA drug tirzepatide to treat obesity or overweight in adults. A final decision is expected by 2023-end. While data from one late-stage study (SURMOUNT-1) released last year showed that treatment with tirzepatide led to mean weight reduction up to 22.5% in patients without diabetes, data from a second late-stage study (SURMOUNT-2) showed that tirzepatide treatment achieved mean reduction up to 15.7% in patients with type 2 diabetes (“T2D”).Story continuesTirzepatide was approved in May 2022 for treating adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (“T2DM”) and is being marketed under the brand name Mounjaro. Since its launch, Mounjaro has showed an impressive initial uptake, recording $568.5 million in revenues in first-quarter 2023.An expansion in the obesity indication would help Lilly rake in billions of dollars from Mounjaro sales.The above developments have helped Lilly dethrone Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ to become the world’s most valuable pharmaceutical company in terms of market capitalization. As of Jul 3, Lilly was valued at $438.0 billion compared to J&amp;J’s market cap of $424.5 billion.Currently, Novo Nordisk NVO is a key player in the diabetes and obesity space.Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide was initially approved by the FDA in 2017 to treat type 2 diabetes and is being marketed under the trade name Ozempic. In 2021, Novo Nordisk received label expansion in the United States for once-weekly semaglutide injections to treat obesity or overweight in adults. Following the label approval, semaglutide became the first drug to receive approval for chronic weight management in adults with general obesity or overweight since 2014. Novo Nordisk markets semaglutide for obesity indication under the brand name Wegovy.Since its launch, sales of Wegovy have been gaining momentum. Wegovy sales were up 124% in first-quarter 2023. Based on the upside, the company raised full-year 2023 sales outlook and profit expectations. To further boost the top line, it is also evaluating a once-daily oral formulation of semaglutide for obesity indication in late-stage studies, with a potential FDA filing expected later this year.Like Lilly, Pfizer PFE is also evaluating pipeline candidates for obesity. Currently, Pfizer is lagging behind Lilly in terms of development for obesity treatments. Last week, Pfizer reported a major setback in its obesity pipeline when it announced its decision to discontinue development of a once-daily oral obesity drug lotiglipron in favor of a twice-daily orally administered danuglipron. This decision was based on data from multiple phase I drug-drug-interaction studies and an ongoing phase II study wherein study participants treated with lotiglipron were shown to have elevated levels of liver enzymes.Pfizer is currently evaluating danuglipron in a phase II study in patients with obesity and T2DM. If this study is successful, management plans to start phase III studies by the year-end.Eli Lilly and Company Price Eli Lilly and Company PriceEli Lilly and Company price | Eli Lilly and Company Quote Zacks RankEli Lilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

If you wish to see the top ones, head straight to the 5 Countries With The Best Healthcare In The World.When it comes to ensuring the well-being of their citizens, some countries like Switzerland, the US, France, Norway, and Belgium, among others, stand out as the most advanced countries in healthcare. These nations have made substantial investments in healthcare infrastructure, medical research, and the training of healthcare professionals, resulting in high-quality and accessible healthcare for their populations.With a strong emphasis on preventive care, advanced technology, and comprehensive health services, these countries have consistently ranked among the best in the world for healthcare. From efficient healthcare delivery to impressive health outcomes, their dedication to providing exceptional medical care has earned them a well-deserved reputation as leaders in the field.  Global Healthcare Rankings: Recognizing Excellence Global healthcare rankings are an essential benchmark for measuring healthcare providers' and facilities' quality and performance worldwide. According to recent financial statistics, the global healthcare market is expected to reach $7,342.61 million by 2030 growing at a CAGR of 21.92%.Additionally, the top-performing healthcare providers like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Johnson &amp; Johnsons (NYSE:JNJ), GE Healthcare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC), and Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), among others, consistently demonstrate strong financial performance, with many reporting high profitability and revenue growth levels. With this in mind, it's clear that global healthcare rankings are an essential tool for patients and healthcare professionals seeking the best possible care and outcomes. Healthcare Investment and Infrastructure: Foundations for Success Businesses in the healthcare industry must remember a few critical foundations for success regarding healthcare investment and infrastructure. Understanding the needs and demands of the healthcare industry is crucial, and staying up to date on the latest trends and technologies and understanding the regulatory landscape and how it affects your business is essential. Story continuesBuilding strong partnerships and collaborations within the healthcare ecosystem is another necessary foundation for success. By partnering with healthcare providers, payers, and other stakeholders, businesses can develop innovative solutions that meet the needs of patients and improve outcomes. Studies show that businesses collaborating with healthcare providers and stakeholders can see a 25% increase in revenue. Finally, investing in the proper infrastructure is crucial to success in the healthcare industry, which includes cutting-edge technology and equipment, well-trained staff, and a robust IT infrastructure. By investing in the right tools and resources, businesses can deliver high-quality care and stay ahead of the competition. Healthcare Accessibility and Affordability: Ensuring Universal Coverage Access to quality healthcare is essential for everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status. Unfortunately, approximately 30 million people in the United States still lack health insurance coverage, leading to severe financial instability and even loss of life. Studies have shown that uninsured individuals are more likely to delay or forgo necessary medical care due to high costs, resulting in more severe health conditions and increased healthcare expenses in the long term. Investing in healthcare infrastructure can yield positive financial outcomes. For instance, a report tells that every dollar invested in hospital construction generates $2.30 in economic activity within the local economy, which creates job opportunities, boosts revenue for local businesses, and enhances property values. Taking a proactive approach through preventive care can also be cost-effective. Chronic diseases like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes account for approximately 75% of healthcare spending in the United States By investing in preventive measures such as vaccination programs, regular health screenings, and disease management initiatives, we can reduce the occurrence of chronic diseases and subsequently lower healthcare costs in the long run. Emerging Trends in Healthcare: Anticipating Future Challenges and Opportunities The healthcare industry is evolving rapidly, and businesses must stay updated on emerging trends and future opportunities. One significant trend is the rise of telemedicine, which allows remote medical care through video conferencing and other technologies. The telemedicine market is projected to reach $396.76 billion by 2027, with a compound annual growth rate of 25.8% from 2020 to 2027. Personalized medicine is another growing trend, tailoring treatments to individual patients based on their genetics and other factors. The global personalized medicine market is expected to reach $3.18 trillion by 2025, with a compound annual growth rate of 10% from 2020 to 2025. To succeed in the changing healthcare landscape, businesses must adapt to these trends and leverage new technologies. However, challenges such as rising healthcare costs, physician shortages, and ensuring patient privacy and security must also be addressed. In 2021, healthcare spending in the United States alone was projected to reach $4.3 trillion, accounting for approximately 18.3% of the country's GDP. With careful planning and a focus on innovation, businesses can navigate these challenges and capitalize on the opportunities presented by the future of healthcare. By investing in telemedicine and personalized medicine, companies can enhance patient outcomes, reduce costs, and maintain the highest standards of care. Financial Success in Global Healthcare Industry: Notable Companies and Key FactorsThe global healthcare industry is a massive market, with some of the largest companies reporting impressive financials. For instance, in 2022, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), one of the most profitable pharmaceutical companies in the world reported a net income of $17.94 billion, while Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) reported a net income of $31.37 billion. Roche, on the other hand, reported a net income of $13.01 billion in the same year. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)'s financial success can be attributed to their ability to develop and market innovative pharmaceutical products that meet the needs of patients and healthcare providers. In the health insurance industry, UnitedHealth Group reported a net income of $20.63 billion in 2022, while Anthem reported a net income of $6.1 billion in 2021. The medical devices and equipment industry, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) reported a net income of $5.03 billion in 2022 , while GE Healthcare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) reported a net income of $1.91 billion in the same year. Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) and GE Healthcare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC)'s financial success can be attributed to their ability to develop and market cutting-edge medical devices and equipment that improve patient outcomes and support healthcare providers.15 Countries With The Best Healthcare In The WorldMonkey Business Images/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology Our methodology for identifying the best healthcare worldwide involved conducting thorough research using sources such as US News, Legatum Prosperity Index, Global Health Security Index, William Russel, and Atlas And Boots, among others.

123,12afa305-c055-3ac7-9d96-cab4ff1ece8d,MDT,2023-07-06,The 3 Most Undervalued Retirement Stocks to Buy Now: June 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-most-undervalued-retirement-stocks-214542515.html,1688075142,STORY,"['XOM', 'MDT', 'HPQ']","[Undervalued retirement stocks steal the spotlight when it comes to constructing a robust retirement portfolio. These stocks present opportunities for capital growth and offer a steady income stream through dividend payments. But what sets the best retirement stocks apart? They can sustain dividends based on long-term earnings.Legendary value investor Ben Graham believed that a company should pay out a consistent portion of its earnings in dividends while retaining enough to support future growth. Traditionally, two-thirds of earnings were earmarked for dividends with the remaining third allocated for reinvestment. However, in today’s landscape with its high capital expenditure requirements, experts suggest a more balanced approach, limiting dividend payments to no more than 50% of earnings. This strategy ensures that companies have ample room for continued dividend growth over the years.So, if you’re seeking retirement stocks that combine value and income potential, focusing on undervalued dividend stocks with sustainable earnings is a snazzy and unique way to secure your financial future.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMedtronic (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) stands tall as a medical device and therapies pioneer, famously known for inventing the pacemaker. For those searching for top-tier retirement stocks, this company is a name worth treasuring. With an impressive $31.7 billion in annual sales and remarkable profitability, this company knows how to reward its investors.The company anticipates organic revenue growth between 4.0% and 4.5% for the upcoming fiscal year. The stock is trading at 17.08 times forward price-to-earnings as I write this.Now, let’s talk dividends. Medtronic dishes out a generous $2.76 per share, covered by both profits and cash flow. Following its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report in May 2023, the company demonstrated its confidence by increasing its annual dividend by 1.5%.Story continuesHere’s where it gets exciting: MDT stock boasts a dazzling 3.2% dividend yield, nearly double that of the S&amp;P 500.Every little bit counts, my friends. These strategic buybacks fuel Medtronic’s unwavering commitment to raising its dividend. In fact, the latest dividend hike marks an incredible 46th consecutive year of payout growth.In a confident declaration, Medtronic’s fiscal Q4 press release underscored its commitment “to returning a minimum of 50% of its free cash flow to shareholders.” This return will be primarily accomplished through dividends with share repurchases playing a secondary role.When you combine Medtronic’s low earnings multiple, enticing dividend yield, conservative dividend payout ratio, and unwavering commitment to buybacks and dividend hikes, you’re looking at one of the cream of the crop retirement stocks that deserves a spot in your portfolio.Exxon Mobil (XOM)Exxon Retail Gas LocationSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is a prominent energy stock known for its stability and profitability. It has consistently generated substantial revenue as an oil and gas company, with a remarkable $400 billion in the previous year alone. Furthermore, it has an impressive free cash flow of $62.1 billion, resulting in a 15.5% margin.What sets Exxon apart is its unwavering commitment to creating value for shareholders. Even during challenging times like the COVID-19 pandemic, Exxon has increased its dividend payout for the past 20 consecutive years.Exxon’s robust financial position is evident in its ability to maintain consistent dividend increases. This is reflected in the company’s payout ratio, which is a healthy 24.4%. This ratio indicates that the company can comfortably afford to continue raising its dividend, which currently offers an attractive 3.5% yield. In other words, Exxon still has room to increase its dividend payout further.In late December, Exxon announced expanding and extending its share repurchase program. From 2023 to 2024, the company plans to buy back up to $35 billion worth of shares. This strategy allows Exxon to significantly reduce its outstanding share count, leading to a substantial increase in dividends per share.Considering Exxon’s remarkable track record of consistently raising dividends over the past two decades, it is highly likely that these payouts will continue to increase. This reassures income-focused investors, particularly retirees who rely on dividend payments. Therefore, Exxon Mobil stands out as one of the best long-term stocks for retirement portfolios.HP (HPQ)HP sign with blue sky and autumn leaves as backdropSource: ShutterstockHP (NYSE:HPQ) is a global powerhouse in imaging and printing products, known for its laser-sharp focus on cutting-edge technologies. This company is firing on all cylinders, with a whopping $63 billion in revenue last year and a mind-blowing $3.9 billion in free cash flow.What makes HP even more alluring for retirement investors is its undervalued status. The company allocated a cool $1 billion of its free cash flow to dividends, resulting in a mouthwatering 3.4% yield. But hold your horses; that’s not all!Here’s the kicker: HP’s dividend payout only accounts for a modest 31.3% of its projected earnings per share of $3.35 this fiscal year. That means the company can continue showering shareholders with its generous dividend while having ample excess cash flow.Speaking of share buybacks, HP didn’t hold back last year. They splurged a massive $4.3 billion on buying back their shares, a hefty 14.5% of their market capitalization. This demonstrates HP’s unwavering commitment to creating value for its loyal shareholders.This strengthens HP’s ability to hike dividends and reduces the number of outstanding shares, resulting in higher dividend-per-share rates.Here’s the icing on the cake: HP has a jaw-dropping track record of increasing dividends for 12 consecutive years. Yes, you heard that right. It’s no wonder HP stands tall as one of the ultimate retirement stocks for the long haul.On the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.Cigna Group (CI) is a stock many investors are watching right now. CI is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is CI's P/B ratio of 1.86. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. CI's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.28. Within the past 52 weeks, CI's P/B has been as high as 2.30 and as low as 1.61, with a median of 1.91.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. CI has a P/S ratio of 0.45. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.73.Finally, investors will want to recognize that CI has a P/CF ratio of 8.63. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 9.66. Over the past 52 weeks, CI's P/CF has been as high as 11.09 and as low as 7.47, with a median of 9.80.Story continuesCNO Financial Group (CNO) may be another strong Insurance - Multi line stock to add to your shortlist.

Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Cigna (CI) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to CI for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Cigna's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Cigna's main business drivers.Headquartered in Bloomfield, CT and formed in 1982, Cigna Corporation has rebranded itself as The Cigna Group. The company was formed as a result of a merger between Connecticut General Life Insurance Company and Insurance Company of North America. Cigna completed its combination with Express Scripts Holding Company by 2018-end. Shares of the new combined company trade on the NYSE under the stock ticker symbol “CI.”The global health company has also announced rebranding of its segments - Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth Health Services.The role of the health benefits provider of the company will be fulfilled by Cigna Healthcare, which will cater to customers and clients through its U.S. Commercial, U.S. Government and International Health businesses. Meanwhile, the newly named Evernorth Health Services will be the pharmacy, care and benefits solutions provider of the company.Till the 2022-end, the company’s reportable segments were as follows:Evernorth Health Services (constitutes 75.7% of adjusted total segment revenues in 2022) includes a broad range of coordinated and point solution health services, including pharmacy services, benefits management, care solutions and data and analytics, which are provided to health plans, employers, government organizations, and health care providers.Cigna Healthcare (24.3%): The segment comprises of Cigna's U.S. Commercial, U.S. Government, and International Health businesses that provide comprehensive medical and coordinated solutions to clients and customers.Story continuesBottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Cigna, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in July 2013 would be worth $3,844.35, or a 284.43% gain, as of July 5, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 175.82% and the price of gold went up 47.81% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for CI.Cigna's revenues have been increasing consistently for the past few years, driven by acquisitions, superior operating performance and a high-quality product portfolio. Business streamlining by divesting its non-core businesses helps it to focus on core growth areas. Increasing membership on the back of a diversified portfolio, wide agent network and superior service are major positives. The company has been resorting to prudent capital deployment moves. For 2023, it expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to be at least $24.70, up 6.1% from 2022. CI's shares have outperformed the industry in a year. However, high leverage can affect its financial flexibility. Also, rising operating costs might dent the company's margins. CI's P/E ratio is currently higher than the industry average. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 6.51%, and there have been 8 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Year to date, technology stocks have been resurgent with solid gains despite increasing economic uncertainty.However, that doesn’t mean these hot stocks are suitable investments. Typically, undervalued stocks hold up well, especially if they exhibit growth.Unlike growth peers priced to perfection, undervalued large-cap stocks are priced for declining earnings and cash flows. Yet, some are large-cap stocks poised for growth with stable compounding earnings. This dynamic leaves opportunities for an upside surprise, skewing the risk-reward in your favor.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsUsing a value screen might unearth some undervalued gems. Here are some top large-caps with high growth potential. The triad is cheap with trailing price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) values below 15x.Their forward price-to-earnings (P/E) is below 10x, and analysts forecast over 10% annual EPS growth over the next five years.United Airlines (UAL)The side of a United Airlines (UAL) plane with ""united"" written above passenger windows. Represents airline stocks.Source: travelview / Shutterstock.comAs we emerge from Covid-19 lockdowns, airlines have experienced solid demand. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) should benefit as a result. Although 2022 saw some revenge travel spending, airlines didn’t fully capitalize on this trend.Heading into last summer, we were emerging from omicron variant fears. Therefore, most consumers opted to take local holidays within the U.S. Also, overseas travel was sluggish, as many countries had just begun lifting their travel restrictions.But this summer, things could be different. Increased international travel could present a boon for United Airlines, hence it’s one of the top undervalued large-cap stocks to buy.Already, the airline reported stellar first-quarter results. Total operating revenue grew 51% year-over-year.It also noted that it was experiencing strong international travel trends in the second quarter. “We are watching the macroeconomic risks carefully, but demand remains strong, especially internationally, where we are growing at twice the domestic rate,” said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby.Story continuesBecause of these strong trends, management reiterated their fiscal year (FY) 2023 diluted EPS guidance of $10-$12. Thus, the stock trades at a forward P/E of 5.3x at current prices.Also, earnings will grow as travel rebounds and surpasses 2019 levels. Airbus says passenger demand will grow at a 3% compound annual growth rate for the next two decades.Cigna Group (CI)Cigna logo displayed on a modern smartphone. CI stock.Source: Piotr Swat / ShutterstockCigna Group (NYSE:CI) is one of the largest U.S.-based management healthcare companies. It operates in two business segments: Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare.Evernorth provides health services, such as pharmacy benefit services, specialty pharmacy, and care services, to employers, health plans, and government organizations. Cigna Healthcare provides comprehensive medical care.Evernorth has been a strong driver of stable growth at scale. Express Scripts, its pharmacy benefits manager business, dispenses over 1.6 billion prescriptions annually and helps drive cost-effective care. For the first quarter of 2023, Evernorth’s revenues increased by 8%, hitting $36.2 billion. Meanwhile, pre-tax earnings were $1.3 billion.Its specialty pharmacy segment has been a source of solid growth. Increased demand for specialty drugs and new-to-market drugs are driving growth. Turning to Cigna Healthcare, revenues were $12.7 billion, up 12% YOY. The segment added about 1.5 million customers bringing total customers to 19.5 million.Given the adjusted FY2023 EPS outlook of $24.70, Cigna is an undervalued large-cap stock to buy. If the company meets expectations, it trades at a cheap forward P/E of 11x.Besides the value, it is a large-cap stock poised for growth in virtual care, Medicare Advantage, and specialty pharmacy. Moreover, the business is strategically diversified in various segments to weather a downturn.In terms of shareholder returns, Cigna has a robust capital deployment plan in place. It expects to generate $50 billion in operating cash flow between 2022 and 2026.Most of this, approximately $36 billion, will be returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.PNC Financial (PNC)PNC bank logo on buildingSource: Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.comAfter the recent banking turmoil, investors have dumped regional banks en masse. Consequently, opportunities in well-run banks have emerged as investors have thrown out the baby with the bath water.After the recent price drop, PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) is one of the best undervalued large-cap stocks to buy in the banking sector.Formed after the Pittsburgh National and Provident National consolidation in 1983, PNC is now the sixth-largest bank in the U.S. by deposits. While it is classified as a regional bank, it’s a super-regional with a coast-to-coast franchise of 2,450 branches.All was going well for PNC until the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the turmoil that followed. Although initially rising rates were viewed as a tailwind for regional banks, they have turned into a headwind. Investors are seriously questioning deposit flight risks and banks’ held-to-maturity portfolios.The latest quarterly report highlighted the strength of PNC’s balance sheet. Regarding its customer deposit portfolio, PNC has nearly $230 billion in consumer deposits and $207 billion in commercial deposits. Overall, PNC has a relatively stable deposit base since 55% of total deposits are FDIC insured. Additionally, The Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 9.2%.Another factor weighing down regional banks is their exposure to commercial real estate, especially office real estate. Rising rates and increasing vacancies from the work-from-home trend are reducing the value of office properties. However, PNC is insulated against this risk. Only 2.7% of its real estate portfolio is in the troubled office segment.Based on balance sheet strength and strong coast-to-coast franchise, PNC is a buy. On March 31, book value and tangible book stood at 104.76 and 76.90, respectively. Therefore, at current levels, PNC is an undervalued large-cap stock to buy, trading at 1.1 times book value.On the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is up 187%-plus year-to-date, while other stocks like Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) are up nearly 474%. Indeed, the momentum is too hot to ignore, but it should also be noted that a cooldown is overdue here.Nonetheless, AI will eventually be a massive sector. It will take substantially more time for that to happen than many people expect. In that time, some up-and-coming companies will challenge the current AI industry bellwethers. Nvidia, for example, is priced for perfection. Not many investors see the long-term threat from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which is rumored to be partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). AMD will likely be neck and neck with Nvidia by the time AI starts to generate substantial sales and profit. Thus, I don’t see NVDA stock as a good bet with its current entry point of&gt;$400.We’ll be using Google’s Bard AI to find semiconductor stocks that are a good bet. Using Bard as a tool and screening their fundamentals can yield great stock-picking results. Let’s start!InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMe: Hi Bard, I am writing an article for InvestorPlace titled “3 Semiconductor Stocks That AI Predicts Will Deliver Triple-Digit Returns in 2024” Can you give me some ideas?Intel (INTC)The Intel (INTC) booth at the CES show in Las Vegas on January 08 2017 , CES is the world's leading consumer-electronics show.Source: Kobby Dagan / Shutterstock.comBard: “Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is a leading provider of microprocessors and other semiconductor products. The company is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for cloud computing, data centers, and artificial intelligence. Intel is also investing heavily in new technologies, such as 5G and artificial intelligence, which could drive significant growth in the future.”Even though Intel is up 27% since my last buy recommendation, it has been quiet recently. But that doesn’t mean it lacks the potential to deliver triple-digit returns in the long run. INTC trades at a depressed valuation, the likes of which haven’t been seen in almost a decade. Thus, it is a no-brainer to snap up the stock before it runs higher.Story continuesWhile competitors like AMD did surpass the company and give it a beating regarding consumer processor chips, Intel is far from dead. For one, Intel’s processors are still top-notch choices for single-core performance. The company has been delivering on their promise of a comeback against AMD by showcasing many chips ahead of schedule. Intel also cut prices on its Arc A750 to just $199, comparable to Nvidia’s RTX 3060, going for $329 officially.We’ll be looking at further appreciation once the gaming sector receives tailwinds again. I won’t delve too much into financials. However, revenue is expected to rebound by 13.4% next year which will make it appeal more to Wall Street. But again, I’m confident that this long-term play can deliver better returns than most semiconductor stocks.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphoneSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comBard: “Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a leading provider of high-performance analog semiconductors. The company’s strong track record of innovation and growth make it well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for analog chips in a variety of applications. Skyworks Solutions also has a strong balance sheet and a dividend yield of over 2%.”Finding semiconductor stocks that provide both growth and value is difficult in this environment –  and Skyworks is no different. You may wonder where the “growth” is since its bottom line has been shrinking since Q4 2021, and the top line declined by 12% YOY in the last two quarters. Skyworks is a risky play because its growth is in the future. But it can deliver double-digit returns if you snap up the stock at its current price.Skyworks is projected to grow its revenue by 6.3% next year and accelerate to 9.3% YOY in 2025. EPS will also bounce back by up to 17.2% YOY in the next two years. The downside risk here is low, and I believe substantial appreciation is ahead once growth returns. The chips supplied by the company to a range of different industries should also insulate it from headwinds in 2024.Qualcomm (QCOM)Source: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.comBard: “Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading provider of mobile processors. The company is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for 5G smartphones and other mobile devices. 5G is the next generation of cellular network technology, and it is expected to drive significant growth in the mobile market. Qualcomm is one of the leading providers of 5G chips, and the company is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this growing market.”While Qualcomm is an excellent pick, despite Bard’s explanation for choosing it being a little old. Qualcomm currently changes hands 14 times forward earnings, and 5Gs tailwinds are still in play. This underappreciated company dominates the 5G and telecommunications space and is a well-known semiconductor player.Semiconductor stocks outside of the AI space are facing a cyclical downturn. QCOM is likely near or at the trough of this downturn, as it is already down over 35% from its peak, and Wall Street’s concerns have been priced in. Still, the consensus analyst price target is not that high, implying a 15% upside.However, I believe there is much higher upside potential. Sales are expected to decline by over 18.8% this year but return to growth in the next two years. This growth is moderating, but further surprises are possible if the handset market recovers.All things considered, this is a passive pick, and there won’t be any triple-digit returns anytime soon (as Bard believes), but the small downside risk makes it worth grabbing because there is a 2.72% dividend yield as a sweetener!On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) is up 45% year-to-date. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is up over 180%. However, many undervalued semiconductor stocks have yet to rally.The AI tide has not lifted all boats. While beneficiaries like Nvidia and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) have had enormous rallies, other semi stocks have lagged.Some underperforming stocks have had idiosyncratic challenges. For instance, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is losing market share in the PC and data center market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMeanwhile, the other factor is a continuing demand slump in end markets. Double ordering and raising inventories to avoid supply issues created a supply glut.Then, demand in some end markets like smartphones and tablets peaked. Unfortunately, the elevated inventory issues that surfaced in 2022 haven’t subsided. Chip inventories are hitting record levels underscoring the weak demand.Because of the demand slump and elevated inventories, select semi-companies in memory, industrial and smartphone end markets are experiencing lower sales. These stocks are yet to recover their steep drawdowns in 2022.However, as demand rebounds from a cyclical bottom, expect these undervalued semiconductor stocks to recover.Microchip Technology (MCHP)Undervalued Semiconductor StocksSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comMicrochip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) is an Arizona-based chip maker that produces and sells smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions for various applications.In fiscal year 2023, industrial, data center &amp; computing and automotive made up 41%, 19% and 17% of revenues, respectively.Although Microchip has had a decent 16% YTD rally, it’s still undervalued. For fiscal year 2023, ending March 31, the company grew EPS 30.6% year-over-year (YOY) to $6.02.Story continuesThe stock trades at 13.6 times trailing earnings. Clearly, the market is not crediting one of the best semiconductor companies for its 130 consecutive quarters of non-GAAP profitability.What makes MCHP stock one of the top semiconductor stocks to buy are its prospects going forward. It has positioned its product portfolio to benefit from 5G, the Internet of Things, data centers, electric vehicles, advanced driver assist systems and sustainability mega-trends.For instance, their Bernstein Conference presentation highlighted 88 Microchip products used in the HKMC IONIQ 6 electric sedan.Over the next five years, management forecasts a 10%-15% organic revenue compounded-annual-growth rate. They expect to convert more than 38% of revenue into free cash flow and return 50% of adjusted FCF to shareholders.Considering the forward P/E is 13 and shareholder returns will increase going forward, MCHP stock is a bargain. Analysts agree it is one of the undervalued semiconductor stocks. They have an average price target of $90, representing a 10% upside.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphoneSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a chip maker that focuses on wireless communication applications.Its specialty is radio frequency semiconductors used in mobile devices like smartphones. Because of its leadership in RF, it counts Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as one of its largest customers.In today’s world, everything from the home, house appliances and vehicles have cellular connectivity. According to Statista, a typical U.S. household has over ten wirelessly connected devices.This trend is increasing the addressable market for Skyworks. Besides, the company is venturing into new markets. For instance, the company is winning contracts to supply onboard charging and digital radio connectivity solutions to EV manufacturers.In terms of its traditional market, 5G adoption is a massive growth opportunity for the stock. The technology improves data rates and expands network capacity, supporting new applications. Also, the company is penetrating the IoT market through several design wins.Over the last year, Skyworks has experienced revenue declines because of the contraction of the global smartphone market. Notably, revenues have declined for two consecutive quarters highlighting the sustained weakness in end markets.Looking ahead to the next quarter, demand is yet to hit a trough. Management expects sales between $1.050 billion and $1.090 billion, a decline from last year’s $1.2 billion.Skyworks’ revenues have always been dependent on Apple’s product cycles. In the aggregate, Apple accounted for 59% and 58% of revenues in FY2021 and FY2022, respectively.The company could benefit from a new iPhone cycle. Also, if Apple includes its chips in the Vision Pro, the company will see incremental revenue growth.Buying SWKS stock here as a play on a new Apple product cycle or the eventual recovery in the smartphone market. The stock is trading at a cheap forward P/E of 11. And you are paid to wait for the recovery, with a healthy 2.4% dividend yield.NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI)Undervalued Semiconductor StocksSource: Lukassek / Shutterstock.comAlthough NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI) is up 20% YTD, it is still a bargain relative to peers.Because of the discount, it makes the undervalued semiconductor stocks list. Besides valuation, it’s also one of the best-positioned semiconductor companies.In terms of its portfolio mix, NXP generates 51% of its revenues from electric vehicles (EV) and ADAS. The company has established partnerships with global OEMs.As a result, growth in its automotive segment is outpacing other segments. For instance, in FY2022, automotive YOY growth was 25.2%. Meanwhile, growth in industrial and mobile was 11.7% and 8.5%, respectively.As EV adoption increases, the Netherlands-based company will be a huge beneficiary. Moreover, its ADAS business will also see increased demand. Since the automotive segment represents over half of revenues and is growing faster, revenues will become less cyclical.In the medium term, the weakness in its industrial and mobile segments has been weighing down the stock. As Q1 2023 results showed, revenue declined -26% and -35%, respectively.In contrast, automotive delivered an outstanding performance, with revenues growing 17%.“NXP is successfully navigating through the cyclical downturn in our consumer-exposed businesses, while we see continued strength in our automotive and core-industrial businesses,” said CEO Kurt Sievers.At a forward P/E of 13, NXPI is among the best semiconductor stocks to buy. It is a secular long term bet on EV adoption and the rise in autonomous driving. And in the meantime, you earn a 2% dividend.On the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NKE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-inc-nke-attracting-investor-130008258.html,1688562008,STORY,['NKE'],"[Nike (NKE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this athletic apparel maker have returned +2.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, which Nike falls in, has gained 5.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nike is expected to post earnings of $0.77 per share, indicating a change of -17.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -27.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.72 points to a change of +15.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -6.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.43 indicates a change of +18.9% from what Nike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -6.5%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nike is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Nike, the consensus sales estimate of $13.07 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3%. The $53.76 billion and $58.36 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5% and +8.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNike reported revenues of $12.83 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.8%. EPS of $0.66 for the same period compares with $0.90 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.59 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.83%. The EPS surprise was -1.49%.Over the last four quarters, Nike surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nike is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points:2023 Q2 earnings for the S&amp;P 500 index are expected to decline -9.7% from the same period last year on -0.5% lower revenues, with margin declines for the 6th consecutive quarter driving the earnings drop.The -9.7% earnings decline in Q2 will be the 3rd consecutive quarter of earnings declines for the S&amp;P 500 index, as it would follow the -3.4% decline in 2023 Q1 and the -5.4% drop in 2022 Q4.Earnings estimates for Q2 have dropped since the quarter got underway, but the magnitude of cuts to estimates has been notably below what we saw in other recent comparable periods. The -9.7% earnings drop in Q2 today is down from -7.2% at the start of the period.Looking at the calendar-year picture, total S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to decline -3.8% on +0.4% higher revenues in 2023. Excluding the Finance sector, full-year 2023 earnings would be down -6.4%, but index earnings would be down only -0.8% on an ex-Energy basis.For 2023 Q2, S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to decline -9.7% from the same period last year on -0.5% lower revenues. This would follow the -3.4% decline in index earnings in the preceding period (2023 Q1) and the -5.4% decline in the last quarter of 2022.In other words, 2023 Q2 is expected to be the third consecutive quarter of declining S&amp;P 500 earnings. The expectation currently is of another earnings decline in Q3 of -1.7%, after which growth turns positive in Q4 and continues in 2024.Story continuesThe long-feared recession doesn't show up in this near-term earnings outlook. A big-picture view of corporate profitability on a long-term basis doesn't leave much room for a recession either.These growth expectations reflect current bottom-up consensus earnings estimates for the individual S&amp;P 500 companies that, in turn, are based on the estimates from individual sell-side analysts that cover those companies.Predicting recessions is beyond the core competence of typical equity research analysts. But they do keep a close eye on the evolving business trends for the companies and industries they follow. Analysts maintain elaborate financial models for the companies in their coverage, which allows them to come up with their earnings, revenues, and other estimates.We at Zacks make it our business to closely monitor how analysts' earnings estimates evolve over time. In fact, our rating system, the Zacks Rank, is based on earnings estimate revisions.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have flagged a notable stabilization in the estimate revisions trend since the start of 2023 Q2, reversing the persistently negative trend that had been in place for almost a year prior.Earnings estimates in the aggregate for the S&amp;P 500 index have come down only a touch since the start of April, with several sectors starting to see modest positive estimate revisions. These sectors include Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Tech, Medical, and Retail.Hard to tell at this stage if the revisions trend will remain on its recent positive trajectory or revert back to its original negative trend. But it is nevertheless a market-friendly development.Sector FocusThe big banks dominate the early phase of each reporting cycle, and the Q2 earnings season will be no different, withJPMorgan JPM, Citigroup C and Wells Fargo WFC coming out with their June-quarter results before the market's open on Friday, July 14th.While Q2 estimates for Citigroup and Wells Fargo have come down, the same for JPMorgan have increased modestly. In terms of year-over-year change, Citigroup's Q2 earnings are expected to be -40.7% below the year-earlier level on +0.2% higher revenues. JPMorgan's Q2 earnings are expected to be +24% above the year-earlier level on +19.9% higher revenues, while the same for Wells Fargo are expected to be up +39.9% and +19.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively.The Finance sector as a whole is expected to show +10.9% earnings growth in Q2 on +6.2% higher revenues, which would follow the +1.3% earnings growth on +11.5% higher revenues in 2023 Q1.The Major Banks industry, which includes JPMorgan and Citigroup and accounts for more than 45% of the sector's total earnings, is expected to bring in +4.1% more earnings in the period on +11.8% higher revenues.Within these banks, the core commercial and consumer banking franchises are expected to show improved profitability, partly offset by continued weakness in investment banking and tough comparisons for the trading businesses. Recent commentary from management teams suggests that reserve bookings should be modest in Q2, though commercial real estate exposure will be driving most of that activity.The sector tracked the broader market earlier in the year, but the emergence of the regional bank crisis in March has weighed on the group ever since. It will be interesting if the coming Q2 earnings reports will help the group close the performance gap to some extent.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

150,50fd36f6-158b-3830-949a-2ae9d1d6e885,WFC,2023-07-06,3 Top Performing S&P 500 Banks in the First Half of 2023,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-performing-p-500-121500558.html,1688559300,STORY,"['JPM', 'USB', '^GSPC', 'C', 'WFC']","[The first half of 2023 turned out to be excellent for the stock markets. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq recorded their best first half since 2019 and 1983, respectively. The Dow Jones relatively lagged, though finishing in the green.Despite a fabulous start to the year, the banking sector was a major laggard. The last six months were terrible for the sector. The S&amp;P 500 Banks Industry Group Index was down 8%, while the S&amp;P 500 Index gained 16.9%. Of the banks that are part of the S&amp;P 500 Index, only – JPMorgan JPM, Wells Fargo WFC and Citigroup C – ended positively in the first half.Here’s how these three big banks have performed in the first half of 2023:Year-to-Date Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchReasons Behind Investor ApathyThe year started on a promising note as the Federal Reserve raised the interest rates to a 15-year high range of 4.25-4.50% in 2022. The higher interest rate regime immensely supported the banks’ top-line growth. However, as the year progressed, the fallout from the central bank’s ultra-aggressive monetary policy started emerging. None of the banks, big or small, were spared.Several issues, including potential recession, waning loan demand, rising funding costs, high levels of fixed-rate mortgage and commercial real estate loans, huge exposure to uninsured deposits in the balance sheet and asset-liability mismatches, turned the situation out of favor for industry. These factors led to the banking crisis and collapse of three banks – Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. These lenders were part of the S&amp;P 500 Index.Heavy deposit outflows, as customers got higher returns from other investment options, turned out to be a major headwind for banks. Though the situation has stabilized since then, investors remain concerned about the stringent capital regulations that might come from the regulators following the bank failures.While the Fed paused the interest rate hike at the June FOMC meeting, the rates remain at a 15-year high of 5-5.25%. Also, the Fed officials left the door open for more hikes later in the year and signaled to keep the rates high for longer. They now see the Fed fund rates peaking at 5.6% in 2023, up from the previous March projection of 5.1%.This is expected to take a further toll on the banks’ top-line performance because of rising funding costs and waning loan demand. Several banks lowered their full-year 2023 revenue guidance after taking into account these recent developments, as the operating environment isn’t likely to change much.Story continuesFundamentally Solid BanksJPMorgan: The largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan, is expected to keep benefiting from higher rates, loan growth, strategic buyouts, business diversification efforts, strong liquidity position and initiatives to expand the branch network in new markets.In May, JPM took over the failed First Republic Bank for $10.6 billion after almost two months of joint efforts with other lenders to save the flagging institution. The deal added deposits of almost $92 billion, roughly $173 billion of loans and $30 billion of securities to the banking behemoth’s balance sheet. The company expects NII to jump nearly 26% to $84 billion this year.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) lender has been an active acquirer of late. These efforts are expected to keep aiding its plan to diversify revenues and expand the fee income product suite and consumer bank digitally. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.By expanding its footprint in newer markets, JPMorgan will be able to improve cross-selling opportunities by increasing its presence in the card and auto loan sectors. The company also launched its digital retail bank Chase in the U.K. in 2021 and continues to expand investment banking and asset management operations in China.JPMorgan has a solid capital deployment plan. Following the clearance of the 2023 stress test, the company intends to increase its dividend by 5% to $1.05 per share. This follows no change in the dividend payout last year. Also, it plans to continue with its previously announced share repurchase program worth $12 billion this year. Driven by a strong capital position and earnings strength, the company is expected to sustain current capital deployments.Wells Fargo: One of the largest banks in the country, Wells Fargo has been grappling with numerous penalties and sanctions, including a cap on the asset position by the Fed subsequent to the revelation of the sales scandal in 2016. Though the bank has taken several steps to overcome these matters, it still has a long list of pending legal cases and remains under close supervision of the regulatory authorities.Wells Fargo’s prudent expense management initiatives support its financials. Cost-saving efforts such as streamlining organizational structure, closing branches and reducing headcount have aided its bottom line. The company delivered gross expense savings aggregating $7.5 billion in 2021 and 2022. WFC expects to continue with these initiatives this year. Management expects non-interest expenses (excluding operating losses) to be $50.3 billion in 2023, down from $57.3 billion in 2022.Wells Fargo, once one of the top mortgage players, is revamping its home lending operation by reducing its mortgage servicing portfolio and exiting the correspondent lending business. As the demand for mortgages and refinancing activities continue to wane due to higher rates, the company is executing this plan to “continue to reduce risk in the mortgage business.”After passing the 2023 stress test process, this Zacks Rank #3 bank announced plans to increase its third-quarter dividend by 17% to 35 cents per share. It also noted that over the four-quarter period beginning third-quarter 2023, there is capacity to repurchase shares. In first-quarter 2023, it repurchased 86.4 million shares and 164 million shares remained under the buyback authorization.Citigroup: As a globally diversified financial services holding company, Citigroup continues to increase its fee-based business mix and shrink non-core assets. The company has been investing in growth opportunities across wealth and commercial banking, treasury and trade solutions, and securities service businesses to grow fee revenues across the Institutional Clients Group segment.C is streamlining operations internationally. In sync with this, the company announced a major strategic action in April 2021 to exit consumer banking across 14 markets in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Mexico. Since then, it has signed deals to divest consumer businesses in nine markets and completed sales in seven markets, including Australia, Bahrain, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and India.  This Zacks Rank #3 company is also winding down its consumer business in China and Korea, whereas, in Russia, it is wrapping up all its business. Further, this May, Citigroup revealed its plan to pursue an IPO of the Mexican business in 2025.Such exits will free up capital and help the company pursue investments in wealth management operations in Singapore, Hong Kong, the UAE and London to stoke growth.

(Nasdaq: CRBU), a leading clinical-stage CRISPR genome-editing biopharmaceutical company, today announced that Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) has made a $25 million equity investment in the company. Pfizer purchased 4,690,431 of Caribou common shares at a price of $5.33 per share, pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement dated June 29, 2023. The purchase by Pfizer closed on June 30, 2023. In conjunction with the investment, Sriram Krishnaswami, PhD, has joined Caribou’s Scientific Advisory Board.“We believe Pfizer’s investment in Caribou highlights the potential of our clinical programs and we are excited to establish this partnership with one of the world’s premier biopharmaceutical companies,” said Rachel Haurwitz, PhD, Caribou’s president and chief executive officer. “We are actively advancing our allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy pipeline and look forward to providing updates from all of our programs over the next six months, including 6-month dose escalation data from our ANTLER Phase 1 clinical trial for CB-010, dose escalation updates on our CaMMouflage Phase 1 clinical trial for CB-011, and submission of an investigational new drug application for CB-012.”“We are encouraged by Caribou’s chRDNA genome-editing technology and the potential of allogeneic cell therapies as a promising off-the-shelf approach to cancer treatment,” said Dr. Krishnaswami. “Pfizer has a long history of supporting early, innovative science in the biotech ecosystem, and we look forward to supporting Caribou as they continue to advance their ANTLER Phase 1 trial for CB-010, as well as their clinical program for CB-011, an allogeneic anti-BCMA cell therapy for multiple myeloma.”Story continuesCaribou will use the proceeds of this investment to advance CB-011, an immune cloaked allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy currently being evaluated in the CaMMouflage Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM). Caribou will maintain full ownership and control of its pipeline of allogeneic CAR-T and CAR-NK cell therapies.The securities sold in this financing were made in a transaction not involving a public offering and have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the common shares, nor shall there be any sale of the common shares in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.About CB-010CB-010 is the lead product candidate from Caribou’s allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy platform and is being evaluated in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r B-NHL). In the ongoing ANTLER Phase 1 trial, Caribou is enrolling second-line patients with large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) comprising four different subtypes of aggressive r/r B-NHL (DLBCL NOS, PMBCL, HGBL, and tFL). CB-010 is an allogeneic anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy engineered using Cas9 CRISPR hybrid RNA-DNA (chRDNA) technology. CB-010 is the first allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy in the clinic, to Caribou’s knowledge, with a PD-1 knockout, a genome-editing strategy designed to improve antitumor activity by limiting premature CAR-T cell exhaustion. To Caribou’s knowledge, CB-010 is also the first anti-CD19 allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy to be evaluated in the second-line setting and has been granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT), Fast Track, and Orphan Drug designations by the FDA. Additional information on the ANTLER trial (NCT04637763) can be found at clinicaltrials.gov.About CB-011CB-011 is the second product candidate from Caribou’s allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy platform and is being evaluated in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM) in the CaMMouflage Phase 1 trial. CB-011 is an allogeneic anti-BCMA CAR-T cell therapy engineered using Cas12a chRDNA technology. To Caribou’s knowledge, CB-011 is the first allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy in the clinic that is engineered to improve antitumor activity through an immune cloaking strategy with a B2M knockout and insertion of a B2M–HLA-E fusion protein to blunt immune-mediated rejection. CB-011 has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA. Additional information on the CaMMouflage trial (NCT05722418) can be found at clinicaltrials.gov.About CB-012CB-012 is the third product candidate from Caribou’s allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy platform and is being evaluated in investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies. To Caribou’s knowledge, CB-012 is the first allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy with both checkpoint disruption, through a PD-1 knockout, and immune cloaking, through a B2M knockout and B2M–HLA-E fusion protein insertion; both armoring strategies are designed to improve antitumor activity. CB-012 is engineered with five genome edits, enabled by Caribou’s patented next-generation CRISPR technology platform, which uses Cas12a chRDNA genome editing to significantly improve the specificity of genome edits.About Caribou’s Novel Next-Generation CRISPR Platform CRISPR genome editing uses easily designed, modular biological tools to make DNA changes in living cells. There are two basic components of Class 2 CRISPR systems: the nuclease protein that cuts DNA and the RNA molecule(s) that guide the nuclease to generate a site-specific, double-stranded break, leading to an edit at the targeted genomic site. CRISPR systems are capable of editing unintended genomic sites, known as off-target editing, which may lead to harmful effects on cellular function and phenotype. In response to this challenge, Caribou has developed CRISPR hybrid RNA-DNA guides (chRDNAs; pronounced “chardonnays”) that direct substantially more precise genome editing compared to all-RNA guides. Caribou is deploying the power of its Cas12a chRDNA technology to carry out high efficiency multiple edits, including multiplex gene insertions, to develop CRISPR-edited therapies.About Caribou Biosciences, Inc.Caribou Biosciences is a clinical-stage CRISPR genome-editing biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing transformative therapies for patients with devastating diseases. The company’s genome-editing platform, including its Cas12a chRDNA technology, enables superior precision to develop cell therapies that are armored to potentially improve antitumor activity. Caribou is advancing a pipeline of off-the-shelf cell therapies from its CAR-T and CAR-NK platforms as readily available treatments for patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Follow us @CaribouBio and visit www.cariboubio.com.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

If you wish to see the top ones, head straight to the 5 Countries With The Best Healthcare In The World.When it comes to ensuring the well-being of their citizens, some countries like Switzerland, the US, France, Norway, and Belgium, among others, stand out as the most advanced countries in healthcare. These nations have made substantial investments in healthcare infrastructure, medical research, and the training of healthcare professionals, resulting in high-quality and accessible healthcare for their populations.With a strong emphasis on preventive care, advanced technology, and comprehensive health services, these countries have consistently ranked among the best in the world for healthcare. From efficient healthcare delivery to impressive health outcomes, their dedication to providing exceptional medical care has earned them a well-deserved reputation as leaders in the field.  Global Healthcare Rankings: Recognizing Excellence Global healthcare rankings are an essential benchmark for measuring healthcare providers' and facilities' quality and performance worldwide. According to recent financial statistics, the global healthcare market is expected to reach $7,342.61 million by 2030 growing at a CAGR of 21.92%.Additionally, the top-performing healthcare providers like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Johnson &amp; Johnsons (NYSE:JNJ), GE Healthcare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC), and Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), among others, consistently demonstrate strong financial performance, with many reporting high profitability and revenue growth levels. With this in mind, it's clear that global healthcare rankings are an essential tool for patients and healthcare professionals seeking the best possible care and outcomes. Healthcare Investment and Infrastructure: Foundations for Success Businesses in the healthcare industry must remember a few critical foundations for success regarding healthcare investment and infrastructure. Understanding the needs and demands of the healthcare industry is crucial, and staying up to date on the latest trends and technologies and understanding the regulatory landscape and how it affects your business is essential. Story continuesBuilding strong partnerships and collaborations within the healthcare ecosystem is another necessary foundation for success. By partnering with healthcare providers, payers, and other stakeholders, businesses can develop innovative solutions that meet the needs of patients and improve outcomes. Studies show that businesses collaborating with healthcare providers and stakeholders can see a 25% increase in revenue. Finally, investing in the proper infrastructure is crucial to success in the healthcare industry, which includes cutting-edge technology and equipment, well-trained staff, and a robust IT infrastructure. By investing in the right tools and resources, businesses can deliver high-quality care and stay ahead of the competition. Healthcare Accessibility and Affordability: Ensuring Universal Coverage Access to quality healthcare is essential for everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status. Unfortunately, approximately 30 million people in the United States still lack health insurance coverage, leading to severe financial instability and even loss of life. Studies have shown that uninsured individuals are more likely to delay or forgo necessary medical care due to high costs, resulting in more severe health conditions and increased healthcare expenses in the long term. Investing in healthcare infrastructure can yield positive financial outcomes. For instance, a report tells that every dollar invested in hospital construction generates $2.30 in economic activity within the local economy, which creates job opportunities, boosts revenue for local businesses, and enhances property values. Taking a proactive approach through preventive care can also be cost-effective. Chronic diseases like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes account for approximately 75% of healthcare spending in the United States By investing in preventive measures such as vaccination programs, regular health screenings, and disease management initiatives, we can reduce the occurrence of chronic diseases and subsequently lower healthcare costs in the long run. Emerging Trends in Healthcare: Anticipating Future Challenges and Opportunities The healthcare industry is evolving rapidly, and businesses must stay updated on emerging trends and future opportunities. One significant trend is the rise of telemedicine, which allows remote medical care through video conferencing and other technologies. The telemedicine market is projected to reach $396.76 billion by 2027, with a compound annual growth rate of 25.8% from 2020 to 2027. Personalized medicine is another growing trend, tailoring treatments to individual patients based on their genetics and other factors. The global personalized medicine market is expected to reach $3.18 trillion by 2025, with a compound annual growth rate of 10% from 2020 to 2025. To succeed in the changing healthcare landscape, businesses must adapt to these trends and leverage new technologies. However, challenges such as rising healthcare costs, physician shortages, and ensuring patient privacy and security must also be addressed. In 2021, healthcare spending in the United States alone was projected to reach $4.3 trillion, accounting for approximately 18.3% of the country's GDP. With careful planning and a focus on innovation, businesses can navigate these challenges and capitalize on the opportunities presented by the future of healthcare. By investing in telemedicine and personalized medicine, companies can enhance patient outcomes, reduce costs, and maintain the highest standards of care. Financial Success in Global Healthcare Industry: Notable Companies and Key FactorsThe global healthcare industry is a massive market, with some of the largest companies reporting impressive financials. For instance, in 2022, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), one of the most profitable pharmaceutical companies in the world reported a net income of $17.94 billion, while Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) reported a net income of $31.37 billion. Roche, on the other hand, reported a net income of $13.01 billion in the same year. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)'s financial success can be attributed to their ability to develop and market innovative pharmaceutical products that meet the needs of patients and healthcare providers. In the health insurance industry, UnitedHealth Group reported a net income of $20.63 billion in 2022, while Anthem reported a net income of $6.1 billion in 2021. The medical devices and equipment industry, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) reported a net income of $5.03 billion in 2022 , while GE Healthcare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) reported a net income of $1.91 billion in the same year. Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) and GE Healthcare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC)'s financial success can be attributed to their ability to develop and market cutting-edge medical devices and equipment that improve patient outcomes and support healthcare providers.15 Countries With The Best Healthcare In The WorldMonkey Business Images/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology Our methodology for identifying the best healthcare worldwide involved conducting thorough research using sources such as US News, Legatum Prosperity Index, Global Health Security Index, William Russel, and Atlas And Boots, among others.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this drugmaker have returned -4.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Pfizer falls in, has gained 3.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $0.61 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -70.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.35 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -49.1%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.34 indicates a change of -0.4% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Pfizer is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.01 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -49.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $68.1 billion and $67.07 billion estimates indicate -32.1% and -1.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $18.28 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -28.8%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $1.62 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.82%. The EPS surprise was +23%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Pfizer is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

156,68a14fb0-49ec-33e0-aaac-107dcc5d910d,PYPL,2023-07-06,25 Most Liberal Cities in the U.S.,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-most-liberal-cities-u-045200413.html,1688619120,STORY,"['AXP', 'PYPL']","[In this article, we are going to discuss the 25 most liberal cities in the U.S. You can skip our detailed analysis of the history of liberalism, the polarization between liberal and conservative communities, the most liberal state in America, the most liberal city in the world, the most progressive American companies and the global D&amp;I market, and go directly to 5 Most Liberal Cities in the U.S. In today’s America, some are proud to call themselves liberal, while others attach negative connotations to the word. Supporters of modern liberalism believe it represents the desire for the government to assist in social and political change, but critics of liberalism often feel that it is a threat to their own way of life.According to a publication by the University of Richmond, the term ‘liberalism’ wasn’t used in a political context until the early 19th century, when ‘liberal’ became a label applied to those who sought a more tolerant and open society – a society whose members would be free to pursue their own ideas and interests with as little interference as possible. This first happened when a faction of the Spanish Cortes of 1810-1811 adopted the name ‘Liberales’. From there, the term spread quickly to France and Great Britain, where the party known as the Whigs evolved, by the 1840’s, into the Liberal Party. Polarization Between Liberal and Conservative Communities:A study at the Pew Research Center has revealed that conservatives would rather live in large houses in small towns and rural areas, ideally among people who share their religious faith. Liberals, on the other hand, prefer a vibrant city setting, with smaller homes, walkable streets, and a diversity of races and ethnicities. According to the report, 41% of the people with consistently conservative views say they would live in a rural area if they could live anywhere in the U.S., while 35% picked a small town. Conversely, 46% of the people with consistently liberal views prefer to live in cities. About 20% of the people from both categories also stated that they’d prefer to live in a suburb. Story continuesThe Most Liberal State in America:The most liberal state in America is Massachusetts and more liberals live in the Old Bay State than anywhere else in the U.S. About 35% of the state’s residents consider themselves liberal and the state has voted Democratic 13 out of 15 times in a presidential election since 1964. According to a report by the Center for Legislative Accountability, Massachusetts lawmakers are the most liberal in the nation. Only 16% of the votes cast by Massachusetts state legislators in 2020 aligned with conservative positions on issues like corporate tax hikes and abortion access etc. The city of Boston is among the most liberal in the country, as you will read below in our list of 25 Most Liberal Cities in America. Most Liberal City in the World: Amsterdam, with its bustling coffee shops and red-light districts, is the most liberal city in the world. The Dutch capital was not only among the first cities in Europe to develop the cultural and political foundations of liberalism, but also acted as an exporter of those beliefs to the rest of Europe and even the new world. Its extensive tolerance and principles of ‘education over prohibition’, make Amsterdam one of the most progressive cities in Europe. The Netherlands was one of the first nations to legalize same-sex marriage and is among the Most LGBTQ Friendly Countries in the World. Most Progressive Companies: A progressive workplace encourages inclusion and diversity, has policies in place that are employee-friendly, focuses on sustainable practices, and provides allowances and incentives that allow its employees to reach their full potential. Companies with an increased level of gender diversity have a significantly higher possibility of outperforming their less diverse counterparts. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a financial technology corporation operating a payment gateway system that supports money transfers worldwide. According to GlobalData, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has a 43.7% female representation in its workforce and 55% of the workforce comprises Asians, Hispanics/Latinos, and African Americans. In June 2020, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) also announced a $530 million commitment to support Black businesses, strengthen minority communities, and fight economic inequality.  American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) also announced in 2020 to spend $1 billion in its diversity, equality and inclusion (DE&amp;I) initiatives. As of March 2022, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has exceeded its commitment and now plans to spend an additional $3 billion towards DE&amp;I initiatives until the end of 2025. Furthermore, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) claims to have maintained 100% pay equity across ethnicities and races in the U.S. for the last two consecutive years. If you wish to read about more progressive American companies, please refer to our article 15 Most Progressive Companies in America. The Global D&amp;I Market:According to Global Industry Analysts, the global market for Diversity &amp; Inclusion (D&amp;I) was estimated at $9.4 billion in 2022, and is projected to reach $24.3 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 12.6% in the forecast period. Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) is the largest segment in this global market and is projected to reach $7 billion by 2030, with a CAGR of 12.1% in the analysis period. Typical ERGs include networks for women, people of color, LGBTQ, veterans, the differently-abled, and young professionals. ERGs provide a number of benefits, including raising cultural awareness among staff, increasing employee satisfaction and retention rates, cultivating an environment of mentorship, and many others. With that said, here is our list of the Most Liberal U.S. Cities. 25 Most Liberal Cities in the U.S.Pixabay/ Public DomainMethodology:To make our list of 25 Most Liberal Cities in the U.S., we have relied on four metrics to determine the meaning of a liberal city. The most liberal cities tend to have substantially higher general expenditures per capita, so we selected the cities with the highest general spending from the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. Then we selected cities with the most ethnic diversity and the best cities for young professionals (since young professionals tend to be more liberal), from Niche. In the end, we also selected cities most inclined towards liberal politics from ‘Representation in Municipal Government’ by Chris Tausanovitch and Christopher Warshaw. Then, similar to the methodology we used for our article – 15 Best Cities to Live in Europe – we picked the cities that appeared in at least three of the aforementioned indexes and assigned a score to these cities based on their rankings in each index. For instance, if we picked the top 40 cities with the highest general spending, the #1 city will get a score of 40/40 = 1 and the #2 city will get a score of 39/40 = 0.975 and so on. The same process was repeated for all the indexes and thus we determined an average score for each city and ranked it accordingly. To keep our list more relevant, we have only mentioned cities with populations of 200,000 and above. 25. New Orleans, LouisianaInsider Monkey Score: 1.39New Orleans is a predominantly liberal city with a heavy democratic influence. With the distinctive social culture, population demographics, voting habits and history of the city, New Orleans is forged into one the most liberal cities in the south, though it is in the relatively conservative state of Louisiana.  24. San Diego, CaliforniaInsider Monkey Score: 1.48San Diego saw a shift in voter registration data between 2004 and 2020. The shift, which started slow and picked up steam in recent election cycles, has transformed San Diego from a reliably red city to the light blue city we see today. Living in San Diego offers residents an urban suburban mix feel, with lots of restaurants, parks, bars and a vibrant craft beer scene. 23. Long Beach, CaliforniaInsider Monkey Score: 1.49Though Long Beach leaned red in last year’s midterm balloting, it has been a Democratic stronghold for decades. Long Beach had a per capita general expenditure of $3,557 in 2020, the 24th highest for a city in America. The city is also one of the most diverse in the country, with a high percentage of foreign born population. 22. Irvine, CaliforniaInsider Monkey Score: 1.51Ranked the 22nd best city for young professionals in America by Niche, the Orange County city also boasts a high foreign-born population of 39.4%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The Irvine city council also voted unanimously in 2020, to repeal a city initiative that denied the LGBTQ community anti-discrimination protection based on their sexual orientation. 21. Pittsburgh, PennsylvaniaInsider Monkey Score: 1.53Pittsburgh is a vibrant city with a high foreign-born and racially diverse population, and the Steel City was also ranked the 10th best city for young professionals in America. After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, the Pittsburgh city council passed bills affirming abortion rights in city limits. 20. Kansas City, MissouriInsider Monkey Score: 1.54Although it is situated in the more conservative state of Missouri, Kansas City is surprisingly a liberal city. Nicknamed ‘The Heart of America’, the city had a per capita general expenditure of 3,987 dollars in 2020. Officials in Kansas City also approved a resolution in May, declaring the city a sanctuary for people seeking or providing gender-affirming care, defying state lawmakers who voted a day earlier to ban such care for minors and restrict it for some adults. 19. St. Paul, MinnesotaInsider Monkey Score: 1.72The state capital of Minnesota, with its rich diversity, a vibrant LGBTQ community and a foreign-born population of 19.1%, is among the most liberal cities in the U.S. The GLBT Host Home Program is a program run by the St. Paul-based organization Avenues for Homeless Youth that provides temporary housing and support to LGBTQ+ youth who are experiencing homelessness. In the 2020 U.S. elections, the largest companies in Minnesota donated millions to political campaigns. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), the biggest company in the state, reportedly donated over $4.4 million in the election campaign.18. Buffalo, New YorkInsider Monkey Score: 1.75One of the most liberal small cities in the U.S., Buffalo is also very much a trailblazer of the early gay rights movement in America, when a community of activists resisted against police brutality in the 70’s and forged their own path in the fight for LGBTQ equality. The City of Light also boasts a high per capita expenditure of $5,618. 17. Atlanta, GeorgiaInsider Monkey Score: 1.77The capital of Georgia is one of the most racially diverse cities in the country, with 48.2% people identifying themselves as black or African American. The city also had a per capita general expenditure of $3,373 in 2020. 16. Los Angeles, CaliforniaInsider Monkey Score: 1.79It comes as no surprise that the City of Angels, with its rich and vibrant diversity, is one the most liberal cities in the country. Los Angeles is also home to several companies that are taking steps to become more progressive and ‘woke’, and one of those is The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Numerous steps towards becoming more inclusive have been taken by The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) recently, including a kiss between two female characters in the movie Lightyear, and casting the African American actress Halle Bailey as Ariel in The Little Mermaid. Back in January 2022, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) also debuted a new look for Minnie Mouse, which saw the beloved character abandoning her red polka-dot dress in favor of a ‘progressive’ blue pantsuit designed by Stella McCartney. 15. Baltimore, MarylandInsider Monkey Score: 1.81The Baltimore metro area is among those with the highest concentration of gay and lesbian coupled households in the U.S. According to a report by the U.S. Census Bureau, around 2% of coupled households in the Baltimore area are either same-sex married couple or same-sex unmarried partner households, about 1.3 times the national average. Baltimore was also the city with the 6th highest per capita general expenditure in 2020, with $6,8999. 14. Miami, FloridaInsider Monkey Score: 1.84Miami is the American city with the second-highest percentage of foreign-born population, with 58.1%. Miami is also one of the few places where the LGBTQ community even has its own chamber of commerce, the Miami-Dade Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce.  13. Arlington, TexasInsider Monkey Score: 1.9The Texas city of Arlington is next on our list of the most liberal cities in America. Known for its cotton ginning and agricultural products, Arlington is also the 5th best city in America for young professionals. With a foreign-born population of 20.9%, Arlington is, in fact, also one of the Most Diverse Cities in the U.S. to Retire In. 12. Philadelphia, PennsylvaniaInsider Monkey Score: 1.92Philadelphia is one of the most diverse cities in the U.S., with an almost equal number of black and white residents, and also a sizable Asian and Hispanic communities.

Austin, TexasInsider Monkey Score: 1.96With its motto ‘Keep Austin Weird’, the Texas city is also one of the Best Cities for Young People in the world. Austin is also home to Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL), which is taking several steps to cultivate inclusion, including its goal to have 25% U.S. workforce and 15% U.S. people leaders who identify as African American or Hispanic, by 2030. 10. Chicago, IllinoisInsider Monkey Score: 2.31Politics in Chicago, through most of the 20th century, was dominated by the Democratic Party and the Windy City was the political base for Barack Obama, who was elected as president in 2008. Chicago also has an extensive LGBTQ history and was the birthplace of the first gay rights organization in America – The Society for Human Rights –  established and recognized in 1924. 9. Minneapolis, MinnesotaInsider Monkey Score: 2.34Minneapolis is among the top 10 most liberal cities in the U.S. in our list and offers its residents a bustling downtown area and serene lakes and parks, with an exceptional live music culture famous for its rich diversity. Governor Tim Waltz signed an executive order in March, protecting the rights of LGBTQ people from Minnesota and other states to receive gender affirming health care. 8. Portland, OregonInsider Monkey Score: 2.59Portland is not only one of the most liberal college towns in the U.S. but also one of the most affordable liberal cities in America. The costs for food, healthcare, utilities etc. all average below or on par with the national average in the City of Roses. The city also had a per capita general expenditure of $2,697 in 2020. 7. Denver, ColoradoInsider Monkey Score: 2.66The capital of Colorado is the 7th most liberal city in the U.S. and sustains a rich cultural diversity with a foreign-born population of 14.2% and a Hispanic/Latino population of 29.4%.

Some executives, interviewed by Yahoo Finance, weighed in on productivity efficiencies the technology is delivering now. Others were concerned about ethical issues — and regulation. For most, all of the above.But they all agreed on one thing: AI is, in fact, a transformational technology.Here's what a few of the execs had to say:Colin Murdoch, chief business officer at Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) DeepMind""The pace of progress on AI is now faster than ever before,"" said Murdoch. ""We’re at the first rung of a very long ladder in terms of AI applications. AI may start as a chatbot, but I believe it has the potential to do so much more, including cure what today is incurable or solve some of the most critical challenges of our time such as the climate crisis.""He added: ""AI helps people leapfrog expensive time-consuming steps to advance scientific discovery and benefit humanity, which is analogous to the transformations we observed during past industrial revolutions.""Dr. Kareem Yusuf, senior VP at IBM (IBM). Dr. Yusuf — who is leading the launch of IBM's generative AI product, ""watsonx"" — is focused on, among other things, increased efficiency via AI.""We're talking about meaningful improvements in productivity,"" said Yusuf. ""In the HR use case we've been seeing 40% improvement in productivity for HR professionals because they are able to dynamically work through a task — opening a job requisition in one place, say, Austin, and another, say, in Toronto. These are different pieces of paper, different policies that need to be activated, and AI can help quickly assemble and bring to the fore.""However, Yusuf is similarly aware of the need to prioritize AI ethics amid this growth and productivity spree.""In the context of business, ethics and transparency are really important,"" he said. ""Do you know where the data that the model has trained on has come from? You cannot hallucinate in the business context as a whole, so that then drives how we do what we do [with AI].""Story continuesRobust community guidelines: a Twitch logo painted on the stairs at an E3 games conference in Los Angeles. (REUTERS/Mike Blake) (Mike Blake / Reuters)Tom Verrilli, chief product officer at Amazon's (AMZN) Twitch Verrilli told Yahoo Finance that AI will be able to solve some of the problems that Yusuf worries about — and this is particularly true when it comes to safety on the internet.""We have a really robust set of community guidelines, and we don't talk about it a lot, but we have a really effective set of machine learning teams who work to spot patterns or bots,"" Verrilli said. ""We have a whole bunch of automated detections to try and keep Twitch safe. At the channel level, it's important that we give creators the tools to build the community they want rather than to impose one on them. We also have auto mode, where, on something like 64 different levels, you can vary what type of content you want to allow a channel.""He added: ""We're really lucky to have millions of community mods because the emotional investment I have in your channel makes me want to protect it as a longtime viewer.""Sita Chantramonklasri, founder at Siam Capital Chantramonklasri, who founded a VC fund focusing on the intersection of sustainability and tech and has made numerous investments in the space, believes there are opportunities at the AI and sustainability crossroads.""The application of AI to climate and sustainability is going to be the difference between whether we do or don't get where we need to be in five years, 10 years, 20 years [in terms of climate change],"" said Chantramonklasri. ""AI is obviously a catchall phrase, but how I'm referring to it here is to describe this transformative technology that has the potential to close the gap on the data we have and the data we need – in some cases, that data's never existed before.""Navrina Singh, CEO at Credo AISingh said that there's a Sword of Damocles that hangs over AI's head, including the many existential risks that experts often focus on. But, she said, overreacting to worst-case scenarios isn't the best way to move forward. Fear of risks can be a ""distraction"" and take the focus away from the hard work of, say, developing regulations.""The learning that we're going to get from solving problems right now is going to better equip us for future problems that systems are going to expose...very quickly,"" she said.Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.2%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.38%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 9.78%.Heading into today, shares of the refiner had gained 7.81% over the past month, outpacing the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 5.94% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.16% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Marathon Petroleum as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be August 1, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Marathon Petroleum to post earnings of $4.77 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 55.04%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $31.93 billion, down 41.14% from the year-ago period.MPC's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $18.78 per share and revenue of $134.26 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -28.21% and -25.39%, respectively.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Marathon Petroleum should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 2.33% lower within the past month. Marathon Petroleum is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Story continuesIn terms of valuation, Marathon Petroleum is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 6.26. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 6.69, so we one might conclude that Marathon Petroleum is trading at a discount comparatively.Investors should also note that MPC has a PEG ratio of 1.04 right now.

163,1b238890-0d73-3054-b2a1-2fb484290c08,MPC,2023-07-06,Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-petroleum-corporation-mpc-attracting-130012850.html,1688562012,STORY,['MPC'],"[Marathon Petroleum (MPC) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this refiner have returned +7.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, which Marathon Petroleum falls in, has lost 18.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Marathon Petroleum is expected to post earnings of $4.77 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -55%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.8%.The consensus earnings estimate of $18.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -28.2%. This estimate has changed -2.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.78 indicates a change of -32% from what Marathon Petroleum is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Marathon Petroleum is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Marathon Petroleum, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $31.93 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -41.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $134.26 billion and $125.37 billion estimates indicate -25.4% and -6.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMarathon Petroleum reported revenues of $35.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -8.6%. EPS of $6.09 for the same period compares with $1.49 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.11%. The EPS surprise was +6.1%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Marathon Petroleum is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marathon Petroleum. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Yahoo Finance Reporter Pras Subramanian breaks down everything you need to know regarding the latest news in the auto and EV market.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Let's also take a look at GM ending the trading day higher after the automaker reported second quarter sales numbers. Earlier, we're looking at gains of just about 1%, an increase of 18%. Pras Subramanian is taking a closer look at this impressive when you take into account some of the demand out there. We were wondering whether or not consumers were going to pull back on some of their spending. It looks like the appetite for new cars is still therePRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah. Strong sales there for Q2. The demand is sort of coming back there for new cars, even at these elevated prices and higher rates, right? So we see here that number is a 19% jump there, year over year powered by GMC trucks, Chevrolet cars and also Cadillac luxury premium brand Cadillac doing well here.GM also sees a 16 million unit SARR, seasonally adjusted annual rate for the year. So that's bigger than before. Much higher than before. Kind of reflecting the trend across other companies, like, we mentioned Toyota and Honda also came out with sales today. They were pretty strong too. So big year for GM, but also I want to touch on EV sales. EV sales of 120% from a year ago. That's the bolt. That's the lyriq. A few Hummer EV sales here.And there but that's good news for GM, as they kind of have a big year coming up with the Equinox EV, the new Silverado coming out this year. EV, so the big year ahead of them for them for EVs in particular,AKIKO FUJITA: We also saw EV makers Tesla and Rivian both surging on Q2 deliveries. What drove some of the gains there. You know Tesla, global story here we saw China numbers yesterday, very strong there for Tesla but around 466,000 deliveries in Q2 easily topping estimates, their price cuts, those massive price cuts from in the US and of course abroad as well as the Tesla Model 3 getting full EV credit status here in the US help gin up sales, there. The question is, can that continue going forward.I also want to touch on Rivian too. They also beat both on the production and delivery numbers there. And also, we reiterated the 50,000 annual production guidance goal for the company. And as well, one, I think Rivian they're going to start delivering 300 or so electric EDD-- delivery trucks for Amazon to Germany later this year.]"

We'll use ROE to examine United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for United Airlines Holdings How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for United Airlines Holdings is:29% = US$1.9b ÷ US$6.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.29 in profit.Does United Airlines Holdings Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, United Airlines Holdings has a better ROE than the average (13%) in the Airlines industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROECompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining United Airlines Holdings' Debt And Its 29% Return On EquityWe think United Airlines Holdings uses a significant amount of debt to maximize its returns, as it has a significantly higher debt to equity ratio of 4.60. So although the company has an impressive ROE, the company might not have been able to achieve this without the significant use of debt.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: United Airlines Holdings may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

177,f7eb18fe-a4cf-35c1-ba9c-86eb12faa47d,UAL,2023-07-06,"U.S. airlines: Delayed, canceled flights highlight holiday weekend",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/u-airlines-delayed-canceled-flights-201237477.html,1688587957,VIDEO,"['DAL', 'LUV', 'AAL', 'UAL']","[The 4th of July weekend saw over 2.8 million Americans travel by plane as airlines struggled to keep up with the demand. A.C. Roman &amp; Associates Founder-CEO Anthony C. Roman, who is also an FAA Licensed Commercial Pilot, discusses investments to improve airlines' infrastructure and how the revised pilot retirement age could weigh on the industry.Video Transcript- July 4th weekend has been a record for travel with TSA screening more than 2.8 million passengers on Friday alone. But many of those flyers, they've been caught up in cancellations and delays. According to FlightAware, over 3,800 flights have been scrubbed, nearly 45,000 have been delayed now. For more on the recent travel chaos, we want to bring in Anthony Roman, a former FAA commercial pilot and also the founder of Roman and Associates Investigative firm.Anthony, it's good to see you here. So there's certainly a lot of finger pointing going on after what we've seen play out over the last week and a half or so. We have Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, he's pointing fingers at the airlines, the airlines are blaming the FAA. I'm curious, just to get your perspective as to why we have seen-- what we have seen the chaos transpire over the last week or so?ANTHONY ROMAN: It's a conglomerate of problems that have come together in an unholy alliance that have created this and it's all forged by the pandemic. And the steep decline in passenger flights during that period of time, it resulted in massive layoffs and early retirements for pilots, for flight attendants, for baggage handlers. Infrastructure investments dropped, so the computer software, the computer hardware, the FAA air traffic control system was slow to modernize to current standards. And there are fewer controllers.In addition to that, the airport infrastructure was not receiving many investments during the pandemic, and all of that is surging now. And you have all of the problems trying to be solved at once. It's going to take several years to do this.Story continues- Anthony, and that's come at a time when we have seen incredible travel demand despite some of these inflated prices with Americans showing they're still willing to shell out that money. So what's the breaking point you think?ANTHONY ROMAN: Well, you know, I think we're close to the breaking point. But the airlines and the FAA have started rapid initiatives to begin solving the problem. And I think over the next year or two, we're going to see progressive improvements in the situation. For example, the FAA has now started to hire many more controllers, accelerate their training, put ground radar at the most important airports so that they can monitor the taxing of aircraft.The airlines have associated themselves with accelerated flight training programs, which have proved to be very, very safe to get pilots into the pipeline much sooner. They're also petitioning the FAA to consider extending the pilot mandatory retirement age to 67 and that would help immensely. You have many, many baby boomer pilots who are reaching that age. I got to tell you. If that retirement segment goes into effect and it's still mandated that they have to retire at 65, the problems will increase.- Anthony, what about the backlash though, and what we've seen play out over the last week or so pales in comparison to the number of flights that Southwest canceled right around the holidays. But United this time around was arguably the most affected, they canceled over 3,000 flights. What is the backlash look like from a consumer perspective, and what these airlines need to do to win back those fliers that they might have lost?ANTHONY ROMAN: Well, the consumers are angry and rightfully so. Some airlines have done a better job at infrastructure investment than others. Delta, one of those examples. One of the largest if not, the largest airline in the world. And that is the foundation of the problem.Now I understand that United has offered all passengers who suffered significant delays and/or cancellations, 30,000 miles in flight points. So we hope that this is a sad that soothes the wound and keeps passengers coming back to United. It is a very clear.- Finally, Anthony, you talked about two key shortages that we're seeing. One with pilots something that's been ongoing, and then the other with air traffic controllers. What does that training entail for air traffic controllers? Is it a recruitment issue or is it about having to get any newer ones up to speed? And what does that timeline look like, how long until we clear the backlog?ANTHONY ROMAN: I think there's sufficient recruiting success for this problem to be managed over the course of a year or two. It takes a long time for air traffic controllers to gain the knowledge, and then the experience to manage the lives of everyone flying above, and the risk of any errors that are fatal for residents on the ground. It's a very serious business, and the FAA takes it as a very serious business. But that'll be a year or two before we start seeing improvement, but it's going to be on a graduated scale.We'll see small improvements over time on a continuous basis. The pilot situation is very, very similar. If the FAA extends the retirement age to 67, I think we'll see the improvement faster. If it remains at 65, then it's going to take a bit longer to start seeing that situation improve.The concerns we do have is young, quickly trained, but well trained pilots in the cockpit that don't have the kind of experience they would have in the elongated training programs of the past. Now that's something that we'll be learning while they're in the cockpit with a senior airman, the captain, and that seems to be working out well.However, there have been some taxi incursions and several of them in a very short period of time. The question is, is that secondary to the accelerated flight training and the shorter period of time with well trained young pilots, without a lot of experience? That's a big question mark. Time will tell.- Either way, it sounds like still a choppier travel experience, at least in the immediate future. Anthony Roman, good to talk to you today. Appreciate the time.]"

Wall Street achieved several milestones in the first half of this year. The broad-market index — the S&amp;P 500 — formed a new bull market during this period. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite recorded their best first-half since 2019 and 1983, respectively. The Dow relatively lagged. Yet, the blue-chip index managed to finish the first half in green.Despite these fabulous performances, we are not out of the woods. On Jun 14, in his post-FOMC meeting statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the central bank has decided to keep the Fed fund rate unchanged at the existing rate of 5-5.25%.However, Powell also mentioned that more rate hikes are likely this year. The Fed’s current “dot-plot” shows that the mean expectation of officials is for another 50-basis point raise in the benchmark interest rate. This implies, two more rate hikes of 25 basis points each within 2023.The terminal interest rate is at present 5.6%, instead of the 5.125%, anticipated after the May FOMC meeting. No rate cut is expected this year. The first cut in interest rate may be delayed till 2025.At present, the CME FedWatch assigned an 87.5% probability to a Fed fund rate hike of 25 basis points in the July FOMC meeting. Only, 12.5% of respondents think the lending rate will remain the same.Stocks in FocusAt this stage, dividend-paying stocks should be in demand as investors try to safeguard their portfolios.

Year to date, technology stocks have been resurgent with solid gains despite increasing economic uncertainty.However, that doesn’t mean these hot stocks are suitable investments. Typically, undervalued stocks hold up well, especially if they exhibit growth.Unlike growth peers priced to perfection, undervalued large-cap stocks are priced for declining earnings and cash flows. Yet, some are large-cap stocks poised for growth with stable compounding earnings. This dynamic leaves opportunities for an upside surprise, skewing the risk-reward in your favor.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsUsing a value screen might unearth some undervalued gems.

Represents airline stocks.Source: travelview / Shutterstock.comAs we emerge from Covid-19 lockdowns, airlines have experienced solid demand. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) should benefit as a result. Although 2022 saw some revenge travel spending, airlines didn’t fully capitalize on this trend.Heading into last summer, we were emerging from omicron variant fears. Therefore, most consumers opted to take local holidays within the U.S. Also, overseas travel was sluggish, as many countries had just begun lifting their travel restrictions.But this summer, things could be different. Increased international travel could present a boon for United Airlines, hence it’s one of the top undervalued large-cap stocks to buy.Already, the airline reported stellar first-quarter results. Total operating revenue grew 51% year-over-year.It also noted that it was experiencing strong international travel trends in the second quarter. “We are watching the macroeconomic risks carefully, but demand remains strong, especially internationally, where we are growing at twice the domestic rate,” said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby.Story continuesBecause of these strong trends, management reiterated their fiscal year (FY) 2023 diluted EPS guidance of $10-$12. Thus, the stock trades at a forward P/E of 5.3x at current prices.Also, earnings will grow as travel rebounds and surpasses 2019 levels.

CI stock.Source: Piotr Swat / ShutterstockCigna Group (NYSE:CI) is one of the largest U.S.-based management healthcare companies. It operates in two business segments: Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare.Evernorth provides health services, such as pharmacy benefit services, specialty pharmacy, and care services, to employers, health plans, and government organizations. Cigna Healthcare provides comprehensive medical care.Evernorth has been a strong driver of stable growth at scale. Express Scripts, its pharmacy benefits manager business, dispenses over 1.6 billion prescriptions annually and helps drive cost-effective care. For the first quarter of 2023, Evernorth’s revenues increased by 8%, hitting $36.2 billion. Meanwhile, pre-tax earnings were $1.3 billion.Its specialty pharmacy segment has been a source of solid growth. Increased demand for specialty drugs and new-to-market drugs are driving growth. Turning to Cigna Healthcare, revenues were $12.7 billion, up 12% YOY. The segment added about 1.5 million customers bringing total customers to 19.5 million.Given the adjusted FY2023 EPS outlook of $24.70, Cigna is an undervalued large-cap stock to buy. If the company meets expectations, it trades at a cheap forward P/E of 11x.Besides the value, it is a large-cap stock poised for growth in virtual care, Medicare Advantage, and specialty pharmacy. Moreover, the business is strategically diversified in various segments to weather a downturn.In terms of shareholder returns, Cigna has a robust capital deployment plan in place. It expects to generate $50 billion in operating cash flow between 2022 and 2026.Most of this, approximately $36 billion, will be returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.PNC Financial (PNC)PNC bank logo on buildingSource: Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.comAfter the recent banking turmoil, investors have dumped regional banks en masse. Consequently, opportunities in well-run banks have emerged as investors have thrown out the baby with the bath water.After the recent price drop, PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) is one of the best undervalued large-cap stocks to buy in the banking sector.Formed after the Pittsburgh National and Provident National consolidation in 1983, PNC is now the sixth-largest bank in the U.S. by deposits. While it is classified as a regional bank, it’s a super-regional with a coast-to-coast franchise of 2,450 branches.All was going well for PNC until the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the turmoil that followed. Although initially rising rates were viewed as a tailwind for regional banks, they have turned into a headwind. Investors are seriously questioning deposit flight risks and banks’ held-to-maturity portfolios.The latest quarterly report highlighted the strength of PNC’s balance sheet. Regarding its customer deposit portfolio, PNC has nearly $230 billion in consumer deposits and $207 billion in commercial deposits. Overall, PNC has a relatively stable deposit base since 55% of total deposits are FDIC insured. Additionally, The Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 9.2%.Another factor weighing down regional banks is their exposure to commercial real estate, especially office real estate. Rising rates and increasing vacancies from the work-from-home trend are reducing the value of office properties. However, PNC is insulated against this risk. Only 2.7% of its real estate portfolio is in the troubled office segment.Based on balance sheet strength and strong coast-to-coast franchise, PNC is a buy. On March 31, book value and tangible book stood at 104.76 and 76.90, respectively. Therefore, at current levels, PNC is an undervalued large-cap stock to buy, trading at 1.1 times book value.On the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This solicitation advances clean energy, while keeping customers safe with reliable power. Developers can bid their unique energy projects or submit proposals to additional categories in the RFP to maximize existing power plant output. These include proposals like adding energy storage to APS’s Agave Solar Plant, developing renewable energy on the Navajo Nation or optimizing existing gas facilities as we transition to a cleaner energy supply.Serving customers: Our resource planners make sure we have the best combination of technologies for customers. All technologies are on the table and will be evaluated to support a diverse and affordable energy mix for Arizona. Project proposals may span from solar, wind and battery energy storage to natural gas resources that can transition to clean hydrogen fuel in the future to other resources that can ramp up quickly during triple-digit temperatures.Transparent and fair: This RFP is focused on projects that will be ready to serve customers as soon as 2026. Each project will be reviewed against a transparent and fair benchmark to ensure customer value. A third-party independent monitor will oversee this process.

An increase in borrowing costs and a resultant rise in interest expenses are likely to adversely impact the earnings of companies operating in this space.The U.S. electric power sector is gradually moving toward cleaner sources of energy to produce electricity.

According to IMARC Group's projections, the market is anticipated to reach $503.3 billion by 2028, indicating a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.11% during the forecast period from 2023 to 2028. Since global transportation demand is increasing rapidly, the International Energy Agency predicts that passenger and freight activity will double the current levels by 2050. While this is a sign of economic prosperity, it goes hand in hand with higher emissions and atmospheric damage. High speed railways are a perfect solution for a swiftly urbanizing world, as rail is considered one of the most energy efficient means of transport. Currently, about 75% of passengers use electric trains, compared to about 60% of the passengers boarding these energy efficient trains in 2000. As a result of this heavy reliance on electricity, the rail sector is the most diverse mode of transport in terms of energy sources. Europe, Japan, and Russia have the highest number of electric trains, while North and South America are largely reliant on diesel. Over the past two decades, there has been a consistent increase in freight rail activity. Currently, the movement of freight by rail is primarily concentrated in China and the United States, with each country accounting for about one-quarter of global rail freight activity. Additionally, Russia holds a prominent share, making up one-fifth of the global freight movement. The transportation of minerals, coal, and agricultural products constitutes the majority of freight rail activity worldwide.Don't Miss: Top 15 Railroad Companies In The WorldThe trade trends from CNBC Supply Chain Heat Map data have consistently demonstrated a decline in inbound freight over the last few months. This reduction in freight has had a negative impact on the earnings of both trucking and rail industries, as their revenue depends on the transportation of goods. According to United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) CEO Carol Tome, a downturn in US retail sales and persistently weak demand in Asia contributed to lower-than-expected freight volume for the company. Similarly, Shelley Simpson, the president of J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT), recently characterized the current state of the industry as a ""freight recession."" During the Q1 earnings call of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), CEO Lance Fritz identified inflation, elevated inventory levels, and sluggish consumer spending as immediate challenges in the industry. On the other hand, CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) surpassed earnings expectations as it experienced a surge in merchandise freight and coal transportation volumes.

The unveiling of its full quarterly report and subsequent first-ever-investor day during the second week of April has undone many of the concerns raised after the previous report and supports the view that it is successfully addressing its operational problems.

This remarkable performance is a testament to the resilience and dynamism of the American economy, even in the face of ongoing global uncertainties.The S&amp;P 500, which tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States, is widely regarded as a reliable barometer of the U.S. economy's health. Its recent surge is a clear indication of investor confidence and a strong signal of economic recovery.Given the solid surge, many stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have gained in double digits. We have highlighted five of them that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), a Momentum Score of B or better and saw positive earnings estimate revisions for the current fiscal year over the past 30 days, suggesting continued outperformance. These include Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL, Palo Alto Networks Inc. PANW, Cummins CMI, Lennar LEN and Trane Technologies TT. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Several factors have contributed to this impressive performance. Let's delve into some of the key drivers behind this surge.Strong Corporate EarningsOne of the primary drivers behind the S&amp;P 500's strong performance is robust corporate earnings. Many companies have reported better-than-expected earnings, reflecting a strong rebound in business activities. This has been particularly evident in sectors such as technology and consumer discretionary, which have seen a significant uptick in demand as the economy continues to recover.Economic IndicatorsPositive economic indicators have also played a crucial role in boosting investor confidence. Recent data shows a steady decline in unemployment rates and a surge in consumer spending, both of which are positive signs for the economy. Additionally, inflation rates have remained relatively stable, alleviating concerns about runaway price increases.Story continuesMonetary PolicyThe Federal Reserve's accommodative monetary policy has also been a significant factor in the S&amp;P 500's strong performance. By keeping interest rates low and continuing its bond-buying program, the Fed has ensured ample liquidity in the market, making it easier for businesses to borrow and invest.Market OptimismFinally, market optimism has played a significant role in the S&amp;P 500's surge. Investors seem to be betting on a strong economic recovery, buoyed by the rapid pace of COVID-19 vaccinations and the easing of pandemic-related restrictions. This optimism is reflected in the increased risk appetite among investors, leading to a surge in equity investments.More Upside in July?If historical patterns are any indication, July is poised to be another strong month for equities. Over the past decade, both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have consistently performed exceptionally well in July, making it the best month of the year for them since 2009. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also fared impressively, ranking as the second-best month in terms of performance.Looking at the numbers, the S&amp;P 500 has experienced an average monthly gain of 3.3% in July, while the Nasdaq has seen an average rally of 4.1%. The Dow's average monthly gain of 2.8% in July is only slightly below its best month of the year, which was November, with a gain of 2.9% since 2009. Importantly, none of these indexes have recorded a decline during the month of July since 2014.Per The Almanac, the month of July is historically the fourth-best month of the year for the S&amp;P 500. Bespoke points out that July recently has been even better. ""Over the last 10 years, performance has been even stronger with the S&amp;P 500 averaging a gain of 3.3% and positive returns 90% of the time, including each of the last eight years.""Best Stocks of S&amp;P 500Royal Caribbean is a cruise company that owns and operates three global brands — Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruises.

197,704d76be-4022-30ad-b8ce-66b5ee9efd22,RCL,2023-07-06,"Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights Royal Caribbean Cruises, Manchester United and Bluegreen Vacations Holding",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-royal-120100000.html,1688558460,STORY,"['RCL', '^GSPC', 'MANU']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – July 5, 2023 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, Manchester United plc MANU and Bluegreen Vacations Holding Corp. BVH.Industry: Leisure &amp; Recreation ServicesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2115941/3-stocks-to-buy-from-the-promising-leisure-recreation-services-industryThe Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry is benefiting from the optimization of business processes, consistent strategic partnerships and digital initiatives. The robust demand for concerts, improving bookings for cruise operators and higher per capita spending at theme parks are supporting the industry. Industry players like Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Manchester United plc and Bluegreen Vacations Holding Corp. are likely to gain in their respective fields owing to the factors mentioned above. However, the industry has been bearing the brunt of high costs and a slow U.S. economy.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry comprises a wide range of recreation providers, such as cruise, entertainment and media owners, golf-related leisure and entertainment venue business, theme park makers, resort operators and event organizers. Some industry players have ski and sports businesses, while some operate health and wellness centers onboard cruise ships and at destination resorts.Many companies are engaged in hospitality and related businesses. A few of the industry participants also provide weight management products and services. These companies primarily thrive on overall economic growth, which fuels consumer demand for products. Demand, which is highly dependent on business cycles, is driven by a healthy labor market, rising wages and a growing disposable income.3 Trends Shaping the Leisure &amp; Recreation Services Industry's FutureRobust Demand Aid Cruise Operators: The cruise industry is benefiting from strong demand for cruising, accelerating booking volumes and the relaxation in COVID-related protocols. However, the closure of cruise operations in China is hurting the industry. The cruise operators' operations are likely to be influenced by the uncertainty related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Geopolitical developments have pushed fuel curves higher. Due to the war, most cruise operators have decided to withdraw all activity in Russia.Story continuesTheme Park Operators &amp; Live Entertainment Companies Bouncing Back: The theme park industry has been benefiting from robust demand. Theme park operators have been gaining from improving visitation. Consumer spending at theme parks continues rising. Live entertainment firms have been benefiting from pent-up demand for live events and robust ticket sales.Concerns of Slowing Global Economy &amp; High Inflation: A slowdown in the global economy is likely to hurt the industry. Concerns about a global slowdown and a possible recession loom large over the stock market. Inflation in the United States is the biggest challenge for the economy. The U.S. consumer inflation rate fell to 4.0% in May 2023, marking the lowest since March 2021 and slightly below market expectations of 4.1%. Yet, numbers are far from the Federal Reserve's ambitious target of 2% for a strong economy. Inflationary cost increases in labor, compensation, healthcare, freight and rent are leading to higher expenses.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry is grouped within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #67, which places it in the top 27% of 252 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is the result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in the group's earnings growth potential. Since Mar 31, 2023, the industry's earnings estimates for 2023 have increased 22.2%.Before we present a few stocks that investors can consider, let's analyze the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms the S&amp;P 500The Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its sector in the past year. Stocks in the industry have collectively increased 29.2% in the past year compared with the broader sector's increase of 10.2%. The S&amp;P 500 has risen 16.4% in the said time frame.ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization), which is a commonly-used multiple for valuing debt-laden leisure service stocks, the industry trades at 53.01X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 19.78X and the sector's 13.09X.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Deckers (DECK) earns a Zacks Rank #3 22 days from its next quarterly earnings release on July 27, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.17 a share.DECK has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.32%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.17 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.16.DECK is just one of a large group of Consumer Discretionary stocks with a positive ESP figure. Marriott International (MAR) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on August 1, 2023, Marriott International holds a #2 (Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $2.56 a share 27 days from its next quarterly update.Marriott International's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 17.2% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.18.Story continuesDECK and MAR's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

203,ef8ff9aa-031b-3eb6-8b5c-e0702dea6e28,MAR,2023-07-06,4 Dividend Stocks to Watch This Summer,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-dividend-stocks-watch-summer-202803119.html,1688070483,STORY,"['HD', 'DKS', 'MAR', 'POOL']","[Summer in America brings long days with beach vacations, barbecues and travel for many families. Americans often spend more on discretionary items during these three months.As a result, it’s a good time to add stocks of companies that benefit from the summer months to your portfolio. For instance, airlines and hotels are often busier from June to August because families take long vacations. Summer is also a time for outdoor hobbies, gardening, sitting by the pool and home renovations.Although these stocks are seasonal picks, they often perform well over the long term, creating value and rising passive income streams. Many of these companies understand dividends matter to investors and increase them annually. Below are four summer dividend stocks to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHome Depot (HD)Home Depot (HD) sign backdropped by blue skySource: Rob Wilson / Shutterstock.comHome Depot (NYSE:HD) is the largest home improvement retailer in the United States. The company owned and operated 2,324 U.S., Canadian and Mexican stores at the end of Q1 2023. It is the leader in selling hardware, building material, lawn and garden products, décor, grills, and home improvement products. Total sales exceeded $157 billion in fiscal 2022 and $155 billion in the last 12 months.The firm operates in an oligopoly with its main competitor, Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW). Combined, the two companies control a large part of the home improvement market. Home Depot grows by selling more items in its enormous stores and adding to the total store count. Consumers and businesses continue to renovate and remodel existing housing stock. Moreover, the number of homes and condominiums rises with increasing population. That said, Home Depot’s sales are sensitive to rising interest and mortgage rates, which cause lower home sales.Home Depot is solidly profitable with excellent free cash flow. This fact has allowed the company to buy back shares and pay a growing dividend. The firm is a Dividend Contender with a 14-year streak. The forward dividend yield is 2.77%, more than the five-year average of 2.35%. The company has increased the dividend at a double-digit rate for the past decade. But the moderate payout ratio of ~46% gives confidence about future growth and dividend safety. In addition, Home Depot earns a dividend quality grade of B+.Story continuesThe company is trading at the lower end of its five-year price-to-earnings (P/E) range because investors are worried about high mortgage rates affecting sales. Hence, it may be an opportune time to buy shares.Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS)Exterior of Dick's Sporting Goods retail store including sign and logo.Source: George Sheldon via ShutterstockDick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) benefits from the summer months. Although the retailer sells items for all sports, it gains from increased consumer activity outdoors during the summer. The retailer operates 863 stores in 47 states. Besides the Dick’s Sporting Goods concept, the firm also owns Golf Galaxy, Moosejaw, Public Lands, Going Going Gone, Top Score and GameChanger. Dick’s Sporting Goods has an 8% market share, making it the leading retailer in its category.Total sales were over $12.368 million in fiscal 2022 and $12.5 million in the last 12 months. Volumes and revenue increase organically by selling more items and adding to the total store count. The firm sells national brands like Nike, Yeti, Peloton, Wilson and so on. In addition, Dick’s is growing its more profitable private label offerings.Dick’s Sporting Goods is a Dividend Challenger with a nine-year streak of increases. The scale has allowed the company to increase the payout by almost 25% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the trailing five years. Dividend safety is excellent, too, with a low payout ratio of around 16%, reasonable leverage and a B+ dividend safety score.Retailers have generally struggled as the pandemic waned, and Dick’s Sporting Goods is no exception. But the P/E ratio has fallen to ~10x, a reasonable value. Investors may want to dip into this stock.Marriott International (MAR)Marriott logo in Milan, Italy. MAR stock.Source: DELBO ANDREA / ShutterstockMarriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) is the largest hotel chain in America and globally. The firm operates thousands of hotel properties in 138 countries. The firm’s brand names include Marriott, St. Regis, W Hotels, Ritz-Carlton, Renaissance, Sheraton, Westin, Four Points, Fairfield and so on.After the decline during the Covid-19 pandemic, revenue has rebounded above 2019 levels. Total revenue was $5.356 million in 2022 and $6.772 million in the trailing 12 months.As the largest hotel operator, Marriott has the advantage of scale. Consequently, it is growing faster than its peers. Future expansion will come from adding more brands, building more hotels, and managing or franchising additional properties for owners. In addition, Marriott has the most extensive loyalty program, which drives repeat hotel stays.Marriott International struggled during the Covid-19 pandemic, and the event triggered a dividend suspension. But before that, the firm was a Dividend Contender. The hotel operator reinstated the dividend in 2022 at an annual rate of $1 per share. The minimal payout ratio of approximately 15% suggests more future dividend increases.The stock is trading at a P/E ratio of ~21x. But burgeoning travel around the world means revenue and profits will probably increase this year. Retail investors should take a look at this stock.Pool (POOL)Yellow pool float, ring floating in a refreshing blue swimming poolSource: ShutterstockThe last stock on our list is Pool Corporation (NASDAQ:POOL), the distributor of pool supplies and related equipment. The company sells chemicals, filters, pumps, lights and parts for building and maintaining pools. It also sells grills, hot tubs, irrigation and outdoor kitchen items.The firm obviously does better during the summer months when pools are open for the season. The firm has proliferated since it was incorporated in 1993. Total revenue was about $6.18 million in 2022 and $5.973 million in the past 12 months.Selling pool-related supplies and equipment is profitable and not capital-intensive. As a result, Pool Corporation is returning cash to shareholders. The firm is a Dividend Contender with 13 years of dividend growth. The forward yield is about 1.2%, more than the five-year average. The payout ratio is also low at 21%, combined with an A+ dividend quality grade.Pool Corporation’s stock price is down from its all-time and 52-week high. The stock typically trades at a premium, but the forward earnings multiple is now below the five-year and 10-year ranges. Hence, we view this stock as a buy now.On the date of publication, Prakash Kolli held a LONG position in HD.

Growing services subscriber base and improving customer engagement are tailwinds for the services business.Apple is expanding service offerings with the new features and enhancements in its upcoming iOS 17, iPadOS 17, macOS Sonoma, watchOS 10, and tvOS 17. Expanding content on Apple TV+ bodes well for Apple.

TPR, Urban Outfitters, Inc. URBN, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. ANF and Stitch Fix, Inc. SFIX.Industry: Retail - Apparel &amp; ShoesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2116122/4-retail-apparel-shoe-stocks-with-potential-amid-industry-woesPlayers in the Zacks Retail - Apparel And Shoes industry have been facing several challenges that are impacting growth and profitability. A tough operating environment, lower discretionary spending due to an overall inflationary landscape and a higher interest rate environment have cooled demand.To navigate troubled waters, industry participants have been directing resources toward digital platforms, accelerating fleet optimization and augmenting the supply chain. Retailers have been focusing on the superior product strategy, the advancement of omnichannel capabilities, prudent capital investments and greater customer reach. Backed by these initiatives, companies like Tapestry, Inc., Urban Outfitters, Inc., Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. and Stitch Fix, Inc. are better placed.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail - Apparel And Shoes industry comprises companies that offer apparel, footwear, accessories, intimates and beauty products, as well as fitness and lifestyle products for use in yoga, training and sports under various brands in domestic and international markets. Quite a few players offer bag collections, including business cases, computer bags and backpacks, leather goods, such as wallets, card cases, travel organizers and belts, and watches, sunglasses, fragrances and ready-to-wear as well as cold-weather accessories.Markedly, companies showcase products to customers directly through their branded retail stores, mobile applications, catalogs and websites. Some industry participants also provide products via department stores, specialty retailers, third-party e-commerce sites and franchisees who operate brand-dedicated stores.Story continues4 Key Trends to Watch in the Retail - Apparel And Shoes IndustryPressure on Margins to Linger: The industry is quite fragmented, with companies vying for a bigger slice of the pie on attributes, such as price, products and speed to market. To address these, a significant number of players in the industry have been investing in strengthening their digital ecosystem and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors bolster sales, they entail high costs.Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks and adopting effective pricing policies.Soft Consumer Activity May Hit Revenues: Elevating prices and geopolitical concerns continue to pose a threat to consumer spending activity. Undoubtedly, the industry's prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. Rising prices have been discomforting family budgets. The Fed's aggressive rate hikes to tame inflation also made things tough for consumers by squeezing disposable income. Consequently, the demand has softened. Per the Commerce Department, sales at clothing &amp; clothing accessories outlets declined 0.2% year over year in May.Brand Enhancement, Capital Discipline: Industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, creating innovative and compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. The launch of newer styles, customization options and refreshed store environments enable them to woo shoppers. Efforts to enhance the brand portfolio via marketing strategies, buyouts, innovations and alliances are likely to keep supporting players in the space.The companies have been taking steps to strengthen their financial position. They have been making every move, from managing the inventory and closing underperforming stores to optimizing capital expenditures and enhancing operational efficiency.Diversification &amp; Digitization Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns and behavior, industry participants have been playing dual in-store and online roles. They are building an omnichannel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at a store, which are worth mentioning.Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers' product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, companies have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Retail - Apparel And Shoes industry is a group within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #201, which places it in the bottom 20% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates drab near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of January 2023, the industry's earnings estimate has declined 29.5%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry vs. Broader MarketThe Zacks Retail - Apparel And Shoes industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has advanced 5.1% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500's increase of 16.5%.

Additionally, strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance.Expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers. Robust Alexa skills and expanding smart home products portfolio are positives.

Driving Nvidia's outperformance is strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute &amp; Networking revenues.A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds. Collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.However, NVDA’s near-term prospects look gloomy due to weakening demand for chips used in gaming and professional visualization end markets.

216,8247c5e2-d624-3d2f-bf99-1224e4866965,CMI,2023-07-06,5 Top-Ranked S&P 500 Stocks to Buy in July,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-top-ranked-p-500-133200749.html,1688563920,STORY,"['PANW', 'TT', 'RCL', 'LEN', '^GSPC', 'LEN-B', '^DJI', 'CMI']","[The S&amp;P 500 wrapped up its best month since October, gaining 6.5% amid various challenges. This remarkable performance is a testament to the resilience and dynamism of the American economy, even in the face of ongoing global uncertainties.The S&amp;P 500, which tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States, is widely regarded as a reliable barometer of the U.S. economy's health. Its recent surge is a clear indication of investor confidence and a strong signal of economic recovery.Given the solid surge, many stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have gained in double digits. We have highlighted five of them that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), a Momentum Score of B or better and saw positive earnings estimate revisions for the current fiscal year over the past 30 days, suggesting continued outperformance. These include Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL, Palo Alto Networks Inc. PANW, Cummins CMI, Lennar LEN and Trane Technologies TT. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Several factors have contributed to this impressive performance. Let's delve into some of the key drivers behind this surge.Strong Corporate EarningsOne of the primary drivers behind the S&amp;P 500's strong performance is robust corporate earnings. Many companies have reported better-than-expected earnings, reflecting a strong rebound in business activities. This has been particularly evident in sectors such as technology and consumer discretionary, which have seen a significant uptick in demand as the economy continues to recover.Economic IndicatorsPositive economic indicators have also played a crucial role in boosting investor confidence. Recent data shows a steady decline in unemployment rates and a surge in consumer spending, both of which are positive signs for the economy. Additionally, inflation rates have remained relatively stable, alleviating concerns about runaway price increases.Story continuesMonetary PolicyThe Federal Reserve's accommodative monetary policy has also been a significant factor in the S&amp;P 500's strong performance. By keeping interest rates low and continuing its bond-buying program, the Fed has ensured ample liquidity in the market, making it easier for businesses to borrow and invest.Market OptimismFinally, market optimism has played a significant role in the S&amp;P 500's surge. Investors seem to be betting on a strong economic recovery, buoyed by the rapid pace of COVID-19 vaccinations and the easing of pandemic-related restrictions. This optimism is reflected in the increased risk appetite among investors, leading to a surge in equity investments.More Upside in July?If historical patterns are any indication, July is poised to be another strong month for equities. Over the past decade, both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have consistently performed exceptionally well in July, making it the best month of the year for them since 2009. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also fared impressively, ranking as the second-best month in terms of performance.Looking at the numbers, the S&amp;P 500 has experienced an average monthly gain of 3.3% in July, while the Nasdaq has seen an average rally of 4.1%. The Dow's average monthly gain of 2.8% in July is only slightly below its best month of the year, which was November, with a gain of 2.9% since 2009. Importantly, none of these indexes have recorded a decline during the month of July since 2014.Per The Almanac, the month of July is historically the fourth-best month of the year for the S&amp;P 500. Bespoke points out that July recently has been even better. ""Over the last 10 years, performance has been even stronger with the S&amp;P 500 averaging a gain of 3.3% and positive returns 90% of the time, including each of the last eight years.""Best Stocks of S&amp;P 500Royal Caribbean is a cruise company that owns and operates three global brands — Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruises.

But if you try your hand at stock picking, your risk returning less than the market. We regret to report that long term The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 23% in three years, versus a market return of about 40%. Furthermore, it's down 10% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Walt Disney In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the three years that the share price fell, Walt Disney's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 5.4% each year. The share price decline of 8% is actually steeper than the EPS slippage. So it seems the market was too confident about the business, in the past.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Walt Disney has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Walt Disney had a tough year, with a total loss of 7.8%, against a market gain of about 13%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 3% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business.

Although Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol 3 did well, it was not enough to drive Disney’s box office performance this year.Disney peer Warner Bros. WBD also had a tough first half of 2023 with poor performances of Shazam! Fury of the Gods and The Flash. However, Comcast CMCSA, Sony and Paramount Global PARA had a better half thanks to Super Mario Bros. Movie, M3gan, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, and Scream VI, respectively.Disney has a strong portfolio of upcoming movies, including Theater Camp, Haunted Mansion, and Poor Things in the second half of the year.The company recently shuffled its upcoming release slate including movies from the Avatar, Marvel, and Star Wars franchises, as reported by a CNBC article. The precise reasons behind these changes remain undisclosed, but the ongoing writers' strike, which has disrupted film and television production, may be a contributing factor.One notable adjustment includes James Cameron's third and fourth Avatar movies, originally slated for 2024 and 2026, respectively. The third installment is now set to release in December 2025, with the fourth film following in 2029.Moreover, Disney has delayed several upcoming Marvel films, such as Captain America: Brave New World, Thunderbolts, Blade, and Fantastic Four. Even the highly anticipated Avengers movies, The Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars, have been postponed until 2026 and 2027, respectively.Moreover, a Star Wars film originally planned for December 2025 has been moved to May 2026, while another Star Wars installment has been added to the schedule for December 2026.

226,7ee9b4b1-0ba0-393c-aa55-5406267e1827,NDAQ,2023-07-06,Fed aims to strike tone of being 'vigilant on inflation' after June pause: Strategist,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/fed-aims-strike-tone-being-193310787.html,1688585590,VIDEO,"['^GSPC', '^DJI', '^IXIC', 'NDAQ']","[The latest FOMC meeting minutes could hint at how the Fed continues to hike interest rates, all while the June jobs report is expected out this Friday. Annex Wealth Management Chief Economist and Strategist Brian Jacobsen joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the outlook for future interest rates in conjunction with U.S. manufacturing data and recession risks.Video Transcript- Minutes from the latest Fed meeting signaling that policymakers are on track to raise rates in July. Here with more on what this means for the market for investors, we want to bring in Brian Jacobsen, Annex Wealth Management chief economist and strategist. Brian, it's good to see you again. So when you take into account what we're learning here from these minutes, what traders are pricing in in terms of the odds of another rate hike at the next meeting in July, what do you think this means for equities?BRIAN JACOBSEN: You know, I think that it means that the Fed, they really don't know what the data will be, so they don't know what they're going to do. Central banking is really a game of credibility. They're very concerned about inflation expectations and making sure that those stay anchored. And so they really want to strike this note of being very vigilant about inflation saying that, hey, we are willing to hike more.Here at Annex in our investment committee, we're not sure that they have a lot more hikes in front of them. And that just is simply because the data is showing that the broader economy is slowing and inflation is very gradually rolling over. It's doing it at a very glacial pace, but it should be good enough where maybe at best, they need to hike one more time and then they can just kind of call it quits for the balance of this year.- And Brian, you know, we know the Fed likes to say often it's not just about one data set, but we do have a big one coming up later this week with the jobs numbers coming out. You know, to what extent is that likely to affect the Fed's decision, and what do you think that number needs to be in order to at least get officials a little more comfortable with the fact that things are, in fact, pulling down on a consistent basis?Story continues- Yeah. And that's just it-- on a consistent basis, right? Want to make it very clear that they are data-dependent, but that doesn't mean data point-dependent. It is really about the broader picture, the whole mosaic of data that they're looking at. And so it's really about getting three months in a row of seeing slowing down of the labor market, making sure that wages aren't growing too rapidly. And then next week with the inflation numbers to see whether or not we are on that trajectory towards eventually getting to 2%.So when it comes to this Friday's number, I think it's really about those wage numbers. It's not necessarily the headline number about how many payrolls expanded, it's not even necessarily the unemployment rate, it's just about is that wage number year on year, month on month at a rate that is consistent with 2% inflation? So anything lower than 3.5% as far as year on year wage gains, I think the Federal Reserve will think that they still are on that path towards their ultimate goal of 2% inflation.- Brian, given the fact that inflation has been so sticky, it's still way too hot for what the Fed would like to see with their 2% inflation target, there has been more and more talk over the last several months that maybe that 2% target should be revised, maybe it should be more like 3% at this point. Is that something that you think maybe should be on the table, or something that the Fed could potentially consider at some point?- You know, that's a good question. And it really that 2% number, it really was pulled out of thin air in a way. Really New Zealand back in the 1990s is the one who kind of set 2% as being that type of inflation target that most developed market central banks have adopted, and there's really no good reason for it. You look at historically, the average is closer to 3%, but they've sort of painted themselves into a corner here.They set 2%, it's an arbitrary number. But if they were to try to move that or modify that now, it would be a very negative signal to the rest of the market as to their ability to actually get to any sort of target. They really shouldn't think about modifying the target until probably at least, say, 5 years down the road when they have gotten to 2%. We think they'll probably get to 2% over the course of the next 2 years, but they should first prove that they can hit that goal before they contemplate whether or not they should modify the goal.- Yeah. And it's sort of along the lines of what we heard from the heads of the major central banks last week when that discussion came up in Portugal. We've got two key pieces of data that was out Monday, show that the US manufacturing sector is in a slump. Demand remains weak. Production is slowing due to lack of work. How long do you expect this trend to last, and is this a sign of what we're likely to see past the summer?- Yeah. Unfortunately, manufacturing is stuck in the mud, and really we're going to be getting the ISM services number tomorrow. We have to see whether or not the service sector strength continues, but we're not expecting that manufacturing is going to stage any sort of rally between now and the rest of the summer. It might be in early 2024 story as far as the manufacturing recovery.Now, markets are forward-looking, and so they're going to try to anticipate when the activity is going to improve. Unfortunately, it does look like the market is expecting that this is perhaps the end of the earnings recession. Earnings for the S&amp;P 500 peaked back at the end of 2022-- and on a quarterly basis, quarter on quarter, they've been declining. Analysts seem to be expecting one more quarter of a decline, and then the beginning of a rebound.That might be a little premature here, which is one of the reasons why we're very focused on trying to participate in the markets, but having the emphasis more on quality equities as opposed to just going sort of with the go-go growth story.- Well, Brian, I guess, what do you think is the more realistic time frame then of that, just in terms of when we will see some improvement on earnings?- Yeah. We're expecting that we're going to see the improvement on earnings mainly towards the end of 2023 here, perhaps early 2024. According to the FOMC minutes that were released, the staff economists are expecting that we're going to see a recession to negative GDP growth rates in the fourth quarter and then the first quarter of 2024. Earnings oftentimes will bottom during those recessions.And so if the market moves about six months ahead of that, we could be positioning ourselves for a decent sustainable recovery for the markets, maybe more towards the fall period, let's say around October or November. But of course, it all depends on how the data rolls in. If the Fed is right with the projection of a recession in the fourth quarter, we think that's a pretty reasonable estimate that right now, there's a few more rain clouds that are beginning to form over the markets.- So what are some of the investing themes you're sticking to in the face of some of those clouds forming?- Yeah. So we want to participate because there is some decent value, especially outside of the biggest tech names that are out there that have been driving the market higher year to date so far. We do like some of the smaller cap names, some of the international names as well in the equity markets, but it's really more about this theme of focusing on quality.And for us, you know, quality is kind of in the eye of the beholder, to us it's really defined based upon whether or not they're able to have resilient margins relative to their peers. So it doesn't really matter which sector they're in. Is it a company that actually is able to ride through what could be a challenging environment by maintaining their margins? Have they already done the cost-cutting necessary in order to ride through any type of perhaps mild recession that we might encounter? And a lot of those names are more in the smaller cap, the mid-cap names, and then also outside of the United States.- Brian, what about fixed income in the bond market? Where are you seeing the most opportunity there as investors are trying to balance or add some sort of balance to their portfolios?- Yeah. Here at Annex, we're looking at it as far as the fixed income profile. It is somewhat of a barbell approach if you think about the cash that you can hold getting a decent amount, but eventually, cash rates will begin to fall once it gets to the point where the Federal Reserve is going to start cutting. That might not be until the end of 2023, maybe early 2024.So you can kind of ride and cash, you can make hay while the sun is shining there. But then as far as with the get a little bit more income, we like the higher quality high yield names. Not necessarily scraping the bottom of the barrel when it comes to credit quality, it's more the creme de la junk, so the things that are the higher quality where it has a short duration, low likelihood of default. And that's how we're trying to sort of balance the safety when it comes to cash, but a little bit more income when it comes to getting that high-yield. Exposure- All right. Brian Jacobsen, Annex Wealth Management chief economist and strategist. Thanks so much for your time.- Thank you.]"

You just know them when you see them. They tend to be large, stable, profitable companies with well-known consumer products that have a long track-record of success. Investors tend to view blue-chips stocks as safe havens for when times get tough. But if that’s the case, why have the three companies below become blue-chip stocks to avoid? Big investors are selling off their shares in these stalwarts. If the so-called smart money is running for the exit, does that mean you should too? Let’s take a closer look to find out if you should also be shedding these blue-chip stocks investors are selling.Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comConsumer products giant Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) had quite a number of billionaire investors heading for the door in the first quarter. According to Whale Wisdom, there was an 84% increase in the number of institutional investors who decided this was on the list of blue-chip stocks to avoid, and closed out their positions in the toothpaste maker over the first three months of the year. Hedge funds sold out at a rate 38% greater than the previous quarter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAmong them was Joel Greenblatt, who is arguably best known for his Magic Formula investing strategy. His Gotham Asset Management actually began dumping Colgate shares in the fourth quarter and ended his position during the next period. Jefferies Group (NYSE:JEF) also sold out despite having just initiated its position in the fourth quarter.Colgate-Palmolive owns a global portfolio of best-selling consumer products including Colgate toothpaste, Palmolive dish soap, SpeedStick deodorant, Murphy oil, Irish Spring soap and Ajax household cleaner. Yet profits have been hurt by inflation, high commodity costs and unfavorable currency exchange rates. About two-thirds of its revenue comes from international markets. Shares are down almost 3% this year compared to a near-13% increase in the S&amp;P 500.Story continuesChevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) sing with ""diesel,"" ""food mart"" and ""car wash"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) is apparently both loved and hated by big money investors. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates recently established a $56 million position in the integrated oil and gas giant. It also remains one of Warren Buffett’s biggest holdings at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A. NYSE:BRK-B).Yet there has been a 25% increase in institutions dumping the stock and even Buffett just trimmed his holdings by 20%. Tiger Management’s Julian Robertson, on the other hand, completely closed out his position in the first quarter.Certainly the oil leader is having a tough time this year as oil prices tumble. West Texas Intermediate crude oil is down to $70 a barrel. That’s a 9% drop from three months ago and 36% below where it was a year ago. As Chevron’s revenue and profit will rise and fall based on oil prices, the stock is down 10% in 2023 as a result.Yet Chevron is in superior financial shape with a strong balance sheet. CEO Mike Wirth says Chevron can still buy back billions of dollars worth of stock even if oil drops to $50 a barrel. And it recently announced it was buying PDC Energy (NYSE:PDC) for $7.6 billion in an all-stock deal. PDC’s assets in Colorado’s DJ Basin are complementary to Chevron’s own and will increase its proved oil equivalent reserves by 10% for less than $7 per barrel. The acquisition will also add $1 billion to Chevron’s annual free cash flow. But, those upsides haven’t been enough for big investors. Chevron is one of those blue-chip stocks to avoid which insiders are selling.Intel (INTC)Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comChipmaker Intel (Nasdaq:INTC) remains a bellwether tech stock despite the numerous troubles it has encountered over the past decade. Indeed, its stock has returned only 39% over the last 10 years at a time when the S&amp;P 500 climbed 171%. The tech-laden Nasdaq 100 was even better, surging more than 400%.Although some 216 institutional investors closed out their positions in the first quarter, according to Whale Wisdom, others like Tweedy Browne dramatically lowered their exposure to the chip stock.Tweedy Browne, of course, was the company that used to execute trades for Benjamin Graham and Buffett. It tends to follow their tenets of value investing that calls for buying companies at a discount to their intrinsic value to increase one’s margin of safety.Many may see that margin narrowing considerably for Intel. The chipmaker is undertaking a major restructuring to eliminate vast inefficiencies and cut costs by up to $10 billion. To challenge Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), Intel will be building a new, world-class foundry business while separating its existing manufacturing operations and chip design business. Each will report financials independently. It’s a whole new way of doing business for Intel, but won’t be a profitable one for a while. By courting new third party customers, the chipmaker hopes to eventually turn that around. That may be too long and too uncertain for investors who may see TSM, Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE:AMD) and GlobalFoundries (Nasdaq:GFS) as competition that is just too far ahead for Intel to catch up.On the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in CL and CVX stock.

Commercial Networks is witnessing healthy traction, driven by strength in commercial air in-flight connectivity (IFC) terminals, satellite networking programs and antenna systems products.

JNPR, Viasat, Inc. VSAT and InterDigital Inc. IDCC.Industry: Wireless EquipmentLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2116005/3-wireless-stocks-set-to-ride-on-solid-consumer-demand-trendsThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is likely to benefit from healthy demand trends with an accelerated pace of 5G deployment and fiber network infrastructure upgrade. However, large-scale investments to support the 5G transition, margin erosion due to price wars, higher customer inventory levels and inflated raw material costs amid a challenging macroeconomic environment and supply chain adversities might erode profitability.Nevertheless, Juniper Networks, Inc., Viasat, Inc. and InterDigital Inc. are expected to profit from the increasing demand for state-of-the-art wireless products with a vast proliferation of IoT, fiber densification and a gradual shift to cloud services.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry primarily comprises companies that provide various networking solutions, wireless telecom products and related services for wireless voice and data communications through scalable modular platforms. Their product portfolio encompasses integrated circuit devices (chips) and system software for wireless voice and data communications, analog and digital two-way radio, satellite telecommunications, wireless networking and signal processing, and end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions.The firms also provide a broad range of routing, switching and security products, video surveillance and machine-to-machine communication components that secure VPN appliances, enable intrusion detection and thwart data theft. Some firms even provide electronic warfare, avionics, robotics, advanced communications and maritime systems to the defense industry.What's Shaping the Future of the Wireless Equipment Industry?Wide Proliferation of IoT: With the exponential growth of mobile broadband traffic and home Internet solutions, demand for advanced networking architecture has increased manifold. This has forced service providers to spend more on routers and switches to upgrade their networks and support the surge in home data traffic. To maintain superior performance standards, there is a continuous need for network tuning and optimization, which creates demand for state-of-the-art wireless products and services.Story continuesMoreover, a faster pace of 5G deployment is expected to augment the scalability, security and universal mobility of the telecommunications industry and propel the wide proliferation of IoT. Expansion of fiber optic networks by carriers to support their 4G LTE and 5G wireless standards, as well as wireline connections, are likely to act as tailwinds.The fiber-optic cable network is vital for backhaul and the last mile local loop, which are required by wireless service providers for 5G deployment. The industry participants are facilitating its customers to move away from an economy-of-scale network operating model to demand-driven operations and seamlessly migrate to 5G by offering easy programmability and flexible automation through steady infrastructure investments.Short-Term Profitability at Stake: Although higher infrastructure investments will eventually help minimize service delivery costs to support broadband competition and wireless densification, short-term profitability has largely been compromised. Margins are likely to be affected by the high cost of first-generation 5G products, profitability challenges in China, the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war and pricing pressure in early 5G deals.Uncertainty regarding chip shortage and supply-chain disruptions leading to a dearth of essential fiber materials, shipping delays and shortages of other raw materials are expected to affect the expansion and rollout of new broadband networks. Extended lead times for basic components are also likely to hurt the delivery schedule and escalate production costs.Further, the high technological obsolescence of most products has escalated operating costs with steady investments in R&amp;D. High customer inventory levels owing to a challenging macroeconomic environment and intense market volatility remain another headwind for the companies.Transition to Cloud Services: The majority of the industry participants offer mission-critical communication infrastructure, devices, accessories, software and services that enable its customers to run businesses with increased efficiency and safety for their mobile workforce. These systems drive demand for additional device sales, software upgrades, infrastructure overhaul and expansion, as well as additional services to maintain, monitor and manage these complex networks and solutions.The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks for constant critical communication operations. The wide proliferation of cloud networking solutions is further resulting in increased storage and computing on a virtual plane. As both consumers and enterprises use the network, there is tremendous demand for quality networking equipment.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish ProspectsThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector.

231,ea2b8599-ba1f-3181-8fad-9fc47bcadc00,CMCSA,2023-07-06,Will Comcast (CMCSA) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comcast-cmcsa-beat-estimates-again-161012509.html,1688573412,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Comcast (CMCSA). This company, which is in the Zacks Cable Television industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.When looking at the last two reports, this cable provider has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 10.06%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Comcast came out with earnings of $0.92 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.80 per share, representing a surprise of 15%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.78 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.82 per share, delivering a surprise of 5.13%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Comcast. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Comcast has an Earnings ESP of +0.22% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on July 27, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

After all, who doesn’t like to receive a regular payment from their investments? However, while attractive, investors need to be careful when they see a stock offering an exceptionally high dividend yield. Oftentimes, a high yield can be a sign of trouble at a company.Management will use high yielding dividends to hold onto shareholders even as the company’s finances deteriorate, and the stock price declines. This is known as a “dividend trap.” Keep in mind that the average dividend yield among companies listed in the S&amp;P 500 index is only 1.66%. Any yield above 3% is viewed as exceptional. Again, it is important for investors to be discerning when deciding whether a company can support its high dividend yield over the long-term. Here are the three most undervalued high-yield stocks to buy now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Hot Healthcare Stocks: Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Source: Mark R. Hake, CFAAlthough it just got clobbered following its latest earnings print, there’s no denying that retail pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NYSE:WBA) is an undervalued, high-yield stock. Walgreens currently pays a quarterly dividend of 48 cents a share, which gives it a dividend yield of 6.76%. Following its latest earnings report and guidance, both of which missed Wall Street consensus forecasts, WBA stock is down 24% year to date and sitting at a 52-week low.Long-term investors who want to buy low, eventually sell high, and then generate income while they wait for a stock to recover, should consider taking a position in WBA stock. Walgreens most recent earnings were hampered by a slowdown in consumer spending and declining sales of medications and treatments related to Covid-19. While the earnings print was disappointing, it was the first time the company has missed analysts’ consensus expectations in three years (since July 2020). Long-term, Walgreens should be fine.Story continuesIcahn Enterprises (IEP)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Icahn Enterprises (IEP).Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comDown 47% on the year and a share price cut in half since May 1, there’s no question that Icahn Enterprises (NASDAQ:IEP) stock is undervalued. With a dividend yield of 29%, the highest among stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index, it’s safe to say that IEP is a high-yield stock. The holding company’s investors clamor for the stock’s $2 a share quarterly payout. Investors who buy $10,000 worth of Icahn Enterprises stock today get themselves a quarterly dividend payout of $716. Not too shabby.Of course, there is a “but” to all of this, which would be a critical report on Icahn Enterprises by infamous short seller Hindenburg Research. In May, Hindenburg accused Carl Icahn of operating a de facto Ponzi Scheme, by using new investor money to pay a dividend set at unsustainable levels. As one would expect, Carl Icahn has come out swinging at the Hindenburg report. But the damage appears to be done to the stock price as well as the reputation of Icahn Enterprises. Nevertheless, Carl Icahn has, so far, refused to lower the dividend payment.Devon Energy (DVN)An image of a hand holding a smartphone displaying the Devon Energy Corporation logo in front of a computer screenSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comU.S. oil company Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) has cut its dividend payment twice this year, decisions that have angered shareholders. However, Devon still pays a quarterly dividend of $1.13 a share, which gives it a yield of nearly 10%. That’s about as generous a payout as investors are likely to find in a solid, well-run company. DVN stock also looks undervalued right now. As U.S. crude oil prices have fallen from a peak of $122 a barrel in June 2022 to under $70 today, Devon Energy’s share price has been dragged lower.Year to date, DVN stock is down nearly 20%. The company’s price-earnings (P/E) ratio currently sits at 5, which is well below the average P/E ratio of 22 among companies listed on the S&amp;P 500. Also, Devon Energy’s stock is now hovering near a 52-week low. This all makes for a good buying opportunity among investors who have the patience to stay with the energy producer until its share price recovers. While they wait, shareholders can enjoy one of the highest dividend yields around.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

With a commitment of billions of dollars, ORCL is aligning its strategy with the goal of expanding its cloud computing service to cater to the growing number of AI companies.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expects total cloud growth for the first quarter, including Cerner, between 28% and 30% at cc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $12.45 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 8.82%.Giants like Oracle, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL are making significant advancements in the field of AI.Microsoft made a significant impact in the field of AI this year by announcing a substantial investment of around $10 billion in OpenAI, the startup responsible for developing advanced AI tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E. Given MSFT's extensive involvement in various technology domains and its position as a leading company based in Redmond, WA, the company's interest in AI is well-founded.Although Google is widely known for its extensive presence in various technology domains, including cloud computing, drones, logistics, search and data, its enthusiasm for the applications of AI knows no bounds. While Google recently participated in Anthropic's significant funding round, it is worth noting that since the beginning of 2021, the company has only engaged in eight transactions in the AI sector involving venture capital-backed startups.Following the introduction of ChatGPT, the advanced chatbox developed by OpenAI in collaboration with Microsoft, there was an increase in educational and training initiatives. Both Microsoft and Google, being major players in the search industry, are expected to adopt a more assertive approach in various AI domains, including education and training.In an effort to gain a competitive advantage over formidable rivals, such as Google and Microsoft, Oracle's cloud division is concentrating on building high-speed networks that can effectively handle the massive volumes of data required for AI systems.It is similar to the advanced capabilities of ChatGPT.

Shaw and Jana Partners. In February, FIS said it would consider a spinoff of the merchant services unit, which processes transactions for companies, after taking a $17.6 billion writedown.The carve-out marks the largest leveraged buyout of 2023, at a time when such deals have become tougher to finance due to expensive and scarcer debt financing, and economic uncertainty.Private equity-led buyouts in the first half of 2023 totaled $202.47 billion globally, down 58% from the year-ago period, Dealogic data shows.FIS plans to use the proceeds from the deal to pay down debt and buy back shares from existing shareholders. The deal is expected to close by the first quarter of 2024.GTCR has also committed an additional investment of up to $1.25 billion in Worldpay to allow the venture to pursue acquisitions. Worldpay will be led by Charles Drucker, its former CEO.LARGE BUYOUTGTCR's offer prevailed over that of Advent International, another buyout firm that was vying for the business, sources previously told Reuters. GTCR plans to finance half of the deal through equity financing and half through borrowing, the sources said.Story continuesAnalysts have said underinvestment and operational missteps led to the unsuccessful integration of Worldpay with FIS, which will be left with net debt of $10 billion after the deal closes. As of the end of March, the company had total debt of $20 billion.The deal values Worldpay at 9.8 times expected fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).Jefferies analysts said the deal amount was $1.8 billion lower than what they had expected. FIS shares were down 2.1% at $58.56 near midday on Thursday.The stake sale on Thursday would leave FIS with a core processing systems business, enabling transactions among banks and other financial institutions, as well as its capital markets unit that serves investment firms.FIS, which started in 1968 and serves big financial services corporations, has cut thousands of jobs since the review began. It plans to cut costs by $1.25 billion in its broader revamp.The merchants business accounts for about 30% of the company's revenue, while FIS's banking technology arm constitutes about 46%, and capital markets the remainder.Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Securities and Centerview Partners advised FIS on the deal.GTCR lined up debt financing from a slew of banks including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Deutsche Bank Securities and UBS Securities.

FIS has signed a definitive agreement to sell a majority stake in its Worldpay Merchant Solutions business to private equity funds managed by GTCR in a transaction valuing Worldpay at $18.5 billion, including $1 billion of consideration contingent on the returns realized by GTCR exceeding certain thresholds.The transaction maximizes shareholder value by immediately securing proceeds based on a $17.5 billion valuation, with opportunity for further upside. This attractive upfront valuation equates to a 9.8-times multiple on expected fiscal 2023 adjusted EBITDA, including estimated dis-synergies and previously unallocated corporate and other costs, which represents a material premium to FIS’ recent valuation of approximately 8-times, and is aligned with leading, scaled payments players. FIS will receive upfront, net proceeds of approximately $11.7 billion while retaining a non-controlling 45% ownership interest in a new standalone joint venture. The transaction was unanimously approved by FIS’ Board of Directors.The agreement will enable greater management focus and operational simplification for both FIS and Worldpay. In addition, the upfront cash proceeds will create immediate capital allocation flexibility. FIS will use proceeds from the sale to pay down debt and return additional capital to shareholders through its existing share repurchase authorization, as well as for general corporate purposes, while maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating. As part of the agreement, GTCR has committed an additional equity capital investment in Worldpay of up to $1.25 billion to pursue inorganic growth opportunities.Story continues""This transaction allows FIS to partially monetize our Merchant Solutions business at an attractive valuation and provides certainty for all stakeholders,"" said FIS CEO and President Stephanie Ferris. ""It also allows us to simplify and drive greater focus on delivering innovative, next-generation financial technology and software solutions. At the same time, Worldpay will become a privately held company and benefit from the resources and expertise of GTCR, which has committed additional capital to allow Worldpay to pursue inorganic growth in the rapidly evolving payments space.""Ferris continued, ""I am grateful to our team for their hard work in preparing for a separation, which has positioned us to execute seamlessly on this transaction. I am also proud that FIS will maintain a meaningful minority stake in Worldpay and participate on the Worldpay Board, allowing us to continue our strong commercial partnership and benefit from continued upside in the business. We are excited to partner with GTCR given its successful history of value creation in collaboration with corporate partners.""""This new separation path positions Worldpay for immediate success, combining the benefits of a well-established global brand and group of talented payments professionals with the energy of an independent startup, all backed by a world-class private equity firm. I’m excited to be working with my former colleagues and GTCR to win in the marketplace and position Worldpay for long-term success,"" said Charles Drucker, incoming Worldpay CEO. ""With the support of GTCR’s resources and expertise, and continuing to partner with FIS, I believe that Worldpay will create and define the future of merchant payment solutions.""Collin Roche, Co-CEO and Managing Director at GTCR, said, ""We are thrilled to be working with Charles and the Worldpay leadership team to build on the company’s culture of innovation, invest in new capabilities and advance its leadership position across channels and geographies. As a firm, we have a long history of investing in the payments sector, and that experience provides us with tremendous confidence in the opportunity for sustained, long-term growth at Worldpay. We look forward to partnering with FIS to deliver value for customers and other stakeholders.""Worldpay, one of the largest global merchant acquirers by transactions with $2 trillion in payments volume in 2022, will remain a leader of commerce solutions to merchants of all sizes. As previously announced, Charles Drucker will become CEO of Worldpay upon close of the transaction.FIS will remain a leading provider of financial technology solutions for financial institutions, capital markets firms, corporates and developers globally. The Company will continue to benefit from its strong brand, extensive domain expertise and portfolio breadth, strong long-term and marquee client relationships, and its global distribution and scale.FIS and Worldpay will enter into commercial agreements, preserving a key value proposition for clients of both businesses and minimizing potential dis-synergies. These agreements will allow Worldpay continued access to FIS products to resell to its clients, as well as access to FIS’ financial institution clients as it continues to scale its bank channel. Similarly, FIS will retain access to Worldpay’s marquee portfolio of commercial clients to resell its embedded finance offerings.Transaction DetailsThe transaction values Worldpay at $18.5 billion, inclusive of $1 billion in additional consideration that is contingent on the returns realized by GTCR exceeding certain thresholds. The upfront valuation of $17.5 billion equates to a 9.8-times multiple on expected fiscal 2023 adjusted EBITDA, including estimated dis-synergies and previously unallocated corporate and other costs. Including the $1 billion of contingent consideration, the multiple on the transaction would increase to approximately 10.4-times. FIS will receive upfront, net proceeds of approximately $11.7 billion at close. On a pro-forma basis for the transaction, FIS expects leverage to be approximately 2.5-times, based on 2023 Adjusted EBITDA upon close.The transaction is expected to close by Q1 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Following the closing of this transaction, FIS’ ownership interest in Worldpay will be reported as income from minority interest.A presentation summarizing today’s announcement will be posted on the company’s investor relations website, www.investor.fisglobal.com.Preview of Anticipated Q2 2023 ResultsPreviewing its second quarter results, FIS expects to be above the mid-point of its guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share.

This company, which is in the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.When looking at the last two reports, this world's biggest hamburger chain has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 9.57%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, McDonald's came out with earnings of $2.63 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.31 per share, representing a surprise of 13.85%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.46 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.59 per share, delivering a surprise of 5.28%.For McDonald's, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesMcDonald's has an Earnings ESP of +0.03% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

This is expected to be July 18, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.68, up 51.35% from the prior-year quarter.

These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 11.68, so we one might conclude that Prologis is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesWe can also see that PLD currently has a PEG ratio of 2.88.

Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.- Facebook parent Meta Platforms on Wednesday launched Threads, a stand-alone microblogging app that takes a direct aim at Twitter as user unrest on that platform has grown since Elon Musk took the company over in October. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on the app that it gained 2 million sign-ups in the first two hours after its release.- JetBlue Airways said it would drop its fight in challenging a U.S. judge's ruling against a partnership with American Airlines, focusing instead on its plan to acquire Spirit Airlines for $3.8 billion, which has also been challenged by the Justice Department.- Wellful, owner of weight-loss company Nutrisystem, on Wednesday said it had acquired Jenny Craig, a defunct weight-loss brand which had shuttered in May after four decades offering personalized meal plans. While Wellful didn't disclose the purchase price, Jenny Craig's intellectual property was acquired for up to $15.5 million, according to court filings.- United Parcel Service and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said negotiations have stalled on a new labor contract, raising the risk of roughly 330,000 workers going on strike next month. The company and the union on Wednesday each accused the other of walking away from contract talks, which have been under way since May. The current deal expires July 31.- Iran attempted to seize two oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz and fired shots at one of them, the U.S. Navy said. In both incidents, the Iranian naval vessels left after the U.S. Navy dispatched a guided-missile destroyer to the scene, according to the U.S.'s Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet.- Most Federal Reserve officials expected they would need to lift interest rates further this year after pausing increases last month, though some wanted to raise rates in June because the economy has not slowed enough.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the railroad industry, head directly to 5 Best Railroad Stocks To Buy Now. In 2022, the global railroad market was worth $307.6 billion. According to IMARC Group's projections, the market is anticipated to reach $503.3 billion by 2028, indicating a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.11% during the forecast period from 2023 to 2028. Since global transportation demand is increasing rapidly, the International Energy Agency predicts that passenger and freight activity will double the current levels by 2050. While this is a sign of economic prosperity, it goes hand in hand with higher emissions and atmospheric damage. High speed railways are a perfect solution for a swiftly urbanizing world, as rail is considered one of the most energy efficient means of transport. Currently, about 75% of passengers use electric trains, compared to about 60% of the passengers boarding these energy efficient trains in 2000. As a result of this heavy reliance on electricity, the rail sector is the most diverse mode of transport in terms of energy sources. Europe, Japan, and Russia have the highest number of electric trains, while North and South America are largely reliant on diesel. Over the past two decades, there has been a consistent increase in freight rail activity. Currently, the movement of freight by rail is primarily concentrated in China and the United States, with each country accounting for about one-quarter of global rail freight activity. Additionally, Russia holds a prominent share, making up one-fifth of the global freight movement. The transportation of minerals, coal, and agricultural products constitutes the majority of freight rail activity worldwide.Don't Miss: Top 15 Railroad Companies In The WorldThe trade trends from CNBC Supply Chain Heat Map data have consistently demonstrated a decline in inbound freight over the last few months. This reduction in freight has had a negative impact on the earnings of both trucking and rail industries, as their revenue depends on the transportation of goods. According to United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) CEO Carol Tome, a downturn in US retail sales and persistently weak demand in Asia contributed to lower-than-expected freight volume for the company. Similarly, Shelley Simpson, the president of J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT), recently characterized the current state of the industry as a ""freight recession."" During the Q1 earnings call of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), CEO Lance Fritz identified inflation, elevated inventory levels, and sluggish consumer spending as immediate challenges in the industry.

The unveiling of its full quarterly report and subsequent first-ever-investor day during the second week of April has undone many of the concerns raised after the previous report and supports the view that it is successfully addressing its operational problems. Demand is also strong.

Yahoo Finance Legal Reporter Alexis Keenan details the timeline of events so far and the damage this could cause to UPS' revenue.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]AKIKO FUJITA: A strike of UPS drivers is looming after Labor negotiations collapsed overnight. Let's bring in Alexis Keenan, who's following the details for us. And Alexis, how big of a scale are we talking about in terms of a potential strike?ALEXIS KEENAN: So this agreement-- potential agreement would cover approximately 330,000 UPS workers, so a massive number of employees there and other workers. So this battle is between the Teamsters Union that represents UPS workers and UPS management. They're blaming each other, saying it's the other side that's frustrating negotiations to renegotiate the collective bargaining agreement that pertains to these workers.Now, the current agreement covering that 330,000 workers, includes package handlers. And it's set to expire at the end of this month on July 31.Now, the union workers, they want higher wages. They want more full-time jobs at the company. They also want better working conditions. And they've already authorized a strike to take place if talks completely break down.Now, there's no further negotiations scheduled. The July 5th deadline had been set by Teamsters President Sean O'Brien, so that the workers would have time to look at the agreement that's being put in front of them or that will be put in front of them and also time to vote.So UPS for their part, they say that these trade negotiations are going to threaten the US economy if this agreement is not reached. Though it's unclear really how much a strike would disrupt US supply chains, given that there are competitors, of course, there to potentially pick up the slack should an agreement not be able to be reached.Now, take a look at the numbers here. For 2022, UPS held the top spot in both revenue as well as market share for parcel delivery. They held 30%-- 37% of that market, over ad FedEx is 33%, followed by USPS with 16% market share, as well as Amazon Logistics with that 12% market share.In separate statements, that kind of don't add up to the truth here. UPS, on one hand, saying that they did not walk away from the negotiating table and that despite the companies historic pay proposals that were put in front of the Teamsters and their management there, that they are refusing to negotiate.On the other hand, you have the union saying that it's UPS that walked away from the table after marathon negotiations that went on for eight weeks. And that the offer that they were presenting didn't address the workers' needs. Is untold how much the tight labor market will give an edge perhaps to the union in these negotiations. But right now, no further negotiations on the table.]"

Supporters of modern liberalism believe it represents the desire for the government to assist in social and political change, but critics of liberalism often feel that it is a threat to their own way of life.According to a publication by the University of Richmond, the term ‘liberalism’ wasn’t used in a political context until the early 19th century, when ‘liberal’ became a label applied to those who sought a more tolerant and open society – a society whose members would be free to pursue their own ideas and interests with as little interference as possible. This first happened when a faction of the Spanish Cortes of 1810-1811 adopted the name ‘Liberales’. From there, the term spread quickly to France and Great Britain, where the party known as the Whigs evolved, by the 1840’s, into the Liberal Party. Polarization Between Liberal and Conservative Communities:A study at the Pew Research Center has revealed that conservatives would rather live in large houses in small towns and rural areas, ideally among people who share their religious faith. Liberals, on the other hand, prefer a vibrant city setting, with smaller homes, walkable streets, and a diversity of races and ethnicities. According to the report, 41% of the people with consistently conservative views say they would live in a rural area if they could live anywhere in the U.S., while 35% picked a small town. Conversely, 46% of the people with consistently liberal views prefer to live in cities. About 20% of the people from both categories also stated that they’d prefer to live in a suburb. Story continuesThe Most Liberal State in America:The most liberal state in America is Massachusetts and more liberals live in the Old Bay State than anywhere else in the U.S. About 35% of the state’s residents consider themselves liberal and the state has voted Democratic 13 out of 15 times in a presidential election since 1964. According to a report by the Center for Legislative Accountability, Massachusetts lawmakers are the most liberal in the nation. Only 16% of the votes cast by Massachusetts state legislators in 2020 aligned with conservative positions on issues like corporate tax hikes and abortion access etc. The city of Boston is among the most liberal in the country, as you will read below in our list of 25 Most Liberal Cities in America. Most Liberal City in the World: Amsterdam, with its bustling coffee shops and red-light districts, is the most liberal city in the world. The Dutch capital was not only among the first cities in Europe to develop the cultural and political foundations of liberalism, but also acted as an exporter of those beliefs to the rest of Europe and even the new world. Its extensive tolerance and principles of ‘education over prohibition’, make Amsterdam one of the most progressive cities in Europe. The Netherlands was one of the first nations to legalize same-sex marriage and is among the Most LGBTQ Friendly Countries in the World. Most Progressive Companies: A progressive workplace encourages inclusion and diversity, has policies in place that are employee-friendly, focuses on sustainable practices, and provides allowances and incentives that allow its employees to reach their full potential. Companies with an increased level of gender diversity have a significantly higher possibility of outperforming their less diverse counterparts. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a financial technology corporation operating a payment gateway system that supports money transfers worldwide. According to GlobalData, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has a 43.7% female representation in its workforce and 55% of the workforce comprises Asians, Hispanics/Latinos, and African Americans. In June 2020, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) also announced a $530 million commitment to support Black businesses, strengthen minority communities, and fight economic inequality.  American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) also announced in 2020 to spend $1 billion in its diversity, equality and inclusion (DE&amp;I) initiatives. As of March 2022, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has exceeded its commitment and now plans to spend an additional $3 billion towards DE&amp;I initiatives until the end of 2025. Furthermore, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) claims to have maintained 100% pay equity across ethnicities and races in the U.S. for the last two consecutive years. If you wish to read about more progressive American companies, please refer to our article 15 Most Progressive Companies in America. The Global D&amp;I Market:According to Global Industry Analysts, the global market for Diversity &amp; Inclusion (D&amp;I) was estimated at $9.4 billion in 2022, and is projected to reach $24.3 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 12.6% in the forecast period. Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) is the largest segment in this global market and is projected to reach $7 billion by 2030, with a CAGR of 12.1% in the analysis period. Typical ERGs include networks for women, people of color, LGBTQ, veterans, the differently-abled, and young professionals. ERGs provide a number of benefits, including raising cultural awareness among staff, increasing employee satisfaction and retention rates, cultivating an environment of mentorship, and many others. With that said, here is our list of the Most Liberal U.S. Cities. 25 Most Liberal Cities in the U.S.Pixabay/ Public DomainMethodology:To make our list of 25 Most Liberal Cities in the U.S., we have relied on four metrics to determine the meaning of a liberal city. The most liberal cities tend to have substantially higher general expenditures per capita, so we selected the cities with the highest general spending from the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. Then we selected cities with the most ethnic diversity and the best cities for young professionals (since young professionals tend to be more liberal), from Niche. In the end, we also selected cities most inclined towards liberal politics from ‘Representation in Municipal Government’ by Chris Tausanovitch and Christopher Warshaw. Then, similar to the methodology we used for our article – 15 Best Cities to Live in Europe – we picked the cities that appeared in at least three of the aforementioned indexes and assigned a score to these cities based on their rankings in each index. For instance, if we picked the top 40 cities with the highest general spending, the #1 city will get a score of 40/40 = 1 and the #2 city will get a score of 39/40 = 0.975 and so on. The same process was repeated for all the indexes and thus we determined an average score for each city and ranked it accordingly. To keep our list more relevant, we have only mentioned cities with populations of 200,000 and above. 25. New Orleans, LouisianaInsider Monkey Score: 1.39New Orleans is a predominantly liberal city with a heavy democratic influence. With the distinctive social culture, population demographics, voting habits and history of the city, New Orleans is forged into one the most liberal cities in the south, though it is in the relatively conservative state of Louisiana.  24. San Diego, CaliforniaInsider Monkey Score: 1.48San Diego saw a shift in voter registration data between 2004 and 2020. The shift, which started slow and picked up steam in recent election cycles, has transformed San Diego from a reliably red city to the light blue city we see today. Living in San Diego offers residents an urban suburban mix feel, with lots of restaurants, parks, bars and a vibrant craft beer scene. 23. Long Beach, CaliforniaInsider Monkey Score: 1.49Though Long Beach leaned red in last year’s midterm balloting, it has been a Democratic stronghold for decades. Long Beach had a per capita general expenditure of $3,557 in 2020, the 24th highest for a city in America. The city is also one of the most diverse in the country, with a high percentage of foreign born population. 22. Irvine, CaliforniaInsider Monkey Score: 1.51Ranked the 22nd best city for young professionals in America by Niche, the Orange County city also boasts a high foreign-born population of 39.4%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The Irvine city council also voted unanimously in 2020, to repeal a city initiative that denied the LGBTQ community anti-discrimination protection based on their sexual orientation. 21. Pittsburgh, PennsylvaniaInsider Monkey Score: 1.53Pittsburgh is a vibrant city with a high foreign-born and racially diverse population, and the Steel City was also ranked the 10th best city for young professionals in America. After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, the Pittsburgh city council passed bills affirming abortion rights in city limits. 20. Kansas City, MissouriInsider Monkey Score: 1.54Although it is situated in the more conservative state of Missouri, Kansas City is surprisingly a liberal city. Nicknamed ‘The Heart of America’, the city had a per capita general expenditure of 3,987 dollars in 2020. Officials in Kansas City also approved a resolution in May, declaring the city a sanctuary for people seeking or providing gender-affirming care, defying state lawmakers who voted a day earlier to ban such care for minors and restrict it for some adults. 19. St. Paul, MinnesotaInsider Monkey Score: 1.72The state capital of Minnesota, with its rich diversity, a vibrant LGBTQ community and a foreign-born population of 19.1%, is among the most liberal cities in the U.S. The GLBT Host Home Program is a program run by the St. Paul-based organization Avenues for Homeless Youth that provides temporary housing and support to LGBTQ+ youth who are experiencing homelessness. In the 2020 U.S. elections, the largest companies in Minnesota donated millions to political campaigns. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), the biggest company in the state, reportedly donated over $4.4 million in the election campaign.18. Buffalo, New YorkInsider Monkey Score: 1.75One of the most liberal small cities in the U.S., Buffalo is also very much a trailblazer of the early gay rights movement in America, when a community of activists resisted against police brutality in the 70’s and forged their own path in the fight for LGBTQ equality. The City of Light also boasts a high per capita expenditure of $5,618. 17.

266,6fd6b8cf-ccc7-3966-8e87-4807eff069d6,MLM,2023-07-06,All You Need to Know About Martin Marietta (MLM) Rating Upgrade to Strong Buy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-martin-marietta-mlm-rating-160006953.html,1688572806,STORY,['MLM'],"[Investors might want to bet on Martin Marietta (MLM), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Martin Marietta is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Martin Marietta imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Martin MariettaFor the fiscal year ending December 2023, this seller of granite, limestone, sand and gravel is expected to earn $15.89 per share, which is a change of 31.7% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Martin Marietta. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 7.1%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Martin Marietta to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The stock pulled back to end the trading session at $74.59, down 0.52% from the previous day’s closing price of $74.98.LPX has gained 38.2% in the three months period compared with the Zacks Building Products - Wood industry’s growth of 16.3%, the Zacks Construction sector’s increase of 22.3% and S&amp;P 500 Index’s growth of 8.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth CatalystsThe price surge can be attributed to positive trends in the U.S. construction sector, driven by increased building permits, housing starts and completions. This highlights favorable market conditions and rising demand, contributing to the surge on prices. The encouraging trends reflect a thriving construction market, presenting opportunities for investors and homebuyers.Louisiana-Pacific's siding unit, which contributed 38% to sales in 2022, increased 26% year over year. In first-quarter 2023, the unit generated flat year-over-year sales. Also, LPX invested $114 million in CapEx for converting Sagola to Siding. Sagola's conversion adds 330 million square feet of siding capacity, bringing total capacity to about 2.3 billion square feet and reducing the OSB capacity to about 4 billion square feet. The company is committed to growing strand Siding revenues in 2023 and beyond. It intends to continue investing in selling and marketing the said business.The company has been making efforts to increase penetration of Siding products in repair/remodel and roll out SmartSide products. It exited the fiber product line to focus more on higher-margin SmartSide strand products. Also, it launched ExpertFinish within the Prefinish product line. The company has been witnessing higher-than-expected demand for Smooth SmartSide and ExpertFinish. The company recently announced the expansion of Siding Capacity with the production restart at Peace Valley.Siding is less sensitive to new housing market cyclicality as more than 50% of Siding Solutions demand comes from other markets like sheds and repair and remodeling. The company believes that the long-term market trends and demographics indicate continued growth in demand for sustainable engineered wood siding in these markets.Louisiana-Pacific and other manufacturers of wood building materials are expected to benefit from strong global trends. The company is focused on improving business by growing the Siding unit and simultaneously reducing cost. The company has been mainly focusing on three areas — increasing the efficiency of mills by improving productivity, run time and quality through overall equipment effectiveness or OEE initiatives; applying best practices to its supply chain; and optimizing infrastructure costs.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksLouisiana-Pacific currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Construction sector are: Dycom Industries, Inc.

269,2bbcbe59-ab94-3056-8ced-45d68d8acc5a,NI,2023-07-06,Dominion (D) Unit's Rate Cut Benefits Virginia Customers,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dominion-d-units-rate-cut-102100470.html,1688638860,STORY,"['D', 'NIMC']","[Dominion Energy’s D unit Dominion Energy Virginia has announced a rate reduction, offering relief for residential and non-residential customers. Effective Jul 1, the average monthly rate for residential customers, who use an average of about 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month, will decrease by nearly $14.This rate reduction is made possible by the bipartisan legislation passed in the 2023 Virginia General Assembly, which eliminated $7 in monthly charges. The law also allowed Dominion Energy Virginia to seek regulatory approval to spread fuel costs over a multi-year period, which lowers the monthly fuel charge by an additional $7.The reduction in monthly utility bills is a welcome change as it directly reduces the financial burden on consumers, providing immediate relief and increasing disposable income. Moreover, lower rates contribute to energy affordability, ensuring that residents and businesses can access essential services without straining their budgets.Over the past 15 years, Dominion Energy Virginia has consistently maintained stable residential rates, keeping them 20% below national and 39% below regional averages. Despite stable rates, Dominion Energy's unit has been delivering reliable, affordable and increasingly clean energy to its customers.Rate Cuts by UtilitiesWe are familiar with rate increase filing by utilities, but rate cut is not a rare phenomenon. Utilities do apply to the commission asking for approval for rate decline, which benefits its customers.The utilities do not profit from fuel costs, so when the fuel prices fall, the utility rate declines. In addition to fuel costs, implementation of cost efficiency measures, long-term investment made in infrastructure and usage of new technologies, modern equipment and machinery reduces operating and maintenance expenses for the utilities, which enables them to lower rates for customers.The reduction of rates also benefits the utilities. This allows the companies to retain and attract new customers, which expands demand and revenues. Other utilities are also making applications for rate declines.NextEra Energy’s NEE unit Florida Power and Light Company (“FPL”) received state regulators’ approval to decrease fuel costs beginning in July. After the approval, an average 1,000 kWh residential customer bill will now be $8 less in July than in April. Depending on the rate class, business client bills will decline between 2% and 5% in July from the present rates.Story continuesPrice PerformanceOver the past month, shares of Dominion have gained 0.1% compared with the industry’s 0.2% rally. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksDominion Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

An increase in borrowing costs and a resultant rise in interest expenses are likely to adversely impact the earnings of companies operating in this space.The U.S. electric power sector is gradually moving toward cleaner sources of energy to produce electricity. Most of the companies have pledged to deliver 100% clean energy and achieve the zero-emission target in the coming years.Furthermore, the government is assisting in increasing the use of renewable energy through tax credits. It is also helping operators to achieve the long-term objective of carbon neutrality by 2050.Per a U.S. Energy Information Administration report, the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise 23% in 2023 and 25% in 2024.In this blog, we run a comparative analysis on two Zacks Utility— Electric Power companies — Pinnacle West Capital Corporation PNW and NiSource Inc.

This implies year-over-year bottom-line decrease of 4.2% and revenue growth of 2.1%.The consensus mark for NI’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $1.6 per share on revenues of $5.8 billion. This indicates year-over-year bottom-line growth of 8.8% and a revenue decline of 1.1%.Story continuesPrice PerformanceIn the past month, shares of PNW and NI have risen 2.9% and 1.7%, respectively. Both the companies have outperformed the industry’s average growth of 1.6% in the same time frame. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchReturn on Equity (ROE)ROE is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. The current ROE for Pinnacle West Capital and NiSource is 7.5% and 11.1%, respectively, compared with the industry’s 4.9%.Debt PositionThe debt-to-capital ratio is a vital indicator of the financial position of a company. It shows the amount of debt used to run a business. Currently, Pinnacle West Capital and NiSource have a debt-to-capital of 57.89% and 59.12%, respectively, compared with the industry’s 58.1%.The times interest earned (TIE) ratio for PNW is 2.8, and the same for NI is 3.2. Since both the companies have a TIE ratio exceeding one, it indicates that they have enough financial flexibility to meet their near-term debt obligations.Dividend YieldUtility companies generally distribute dividends and increase shareholders’ value. Currently, the dividend yield for Pinnacle West Capital is 4.23% and the same for NiSource is 3.65%. The dividend yields of these companies are better than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 Composite’s average of 1.43%.OutcomeBoth Pinnacle West Capital and NiSource are evenly matched and good picks for your portfolio. They have the potential to improve further from their current position and serve the needs of their growing customer base. However, our choice at this moment is PNW, given its better debt position, higher dividend yield and better price performance than NI.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The proposal, aiming to define a brace to include advanced technologies like the MyoPro, could potentially lead to a positive outcome for Myomo's classification request.The proposed rule suggests that the existing Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes, L8701 and L8702, be classified as a brace.If this rule is finalized without any changes to reimbursement practices, Myomo's MyoPro could be reimbursed in a lump-sum manner by CMS, aligning with the payment approach adopted by private health insurers.Looking AheadBefore the proposed rule becomes official, a 60-day public comment period is required. This period allows stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, and industry experts, to provide feedback and insights to CMS. Additionally, CMS plans to disclose the fee for the MyoPro HCPCS codes at an upcoming public meeting, expected to be held in late 2023 or early 2024.A Long-Awaited MilestoneMyomo's CEO, Paul R. Gudonis, expressed his satisfaction with this progress, describing the proposed rule as the culmination of a multi-year endeavor to secure the appropriate classification for the MyoPro as a brace. The company intends to collaborate with CMS and other stakeholders in the orthotics and prosthetics industry to support the proposed rule's enactment, as it holds the promise of advancing health equity and enabling Medicare beneficiaries to access MyoPro.Story continuesMedical Robotics Market ProspectsAccording to a comprehensive research report by Market Research Future, the global market for medical robotics is poised for significant growth.

Despite the ongoing macro headwinds, the preference for UroLift over other outpatient BPH treatments continued to be driven by strong clinical results.Moreover, the underlying performance in densely populated geographies like Asia buoys optimism. However, mounting expenses and a competitive space are worrisome for TFX.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 5.2% against the 9.8% growth of the industry and the 15.7% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The global provider of med-tech products has a market capitalization of $11.20 billion. The company has an earnings yield of 5.57% against the industry’s -6.35%. Teleflex surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average earnings surprise of 3.26%. Let’s delve deeper.TailwindsImpressive Performance Across Product Category: Teleflex had a strong start to 2023 with continued momentum across its broad business. Vascular Access delivered a solid performance across the portfolio, with the business getting back to growth post the tough COVID-19 comparisons experienced in 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWithin Interventional Access, TFX benefitted from the strength of its largest product categories, including complex catheters, balloon pumps and OnControl. Among larger franchises in the Anesthesia business, the performances of hemostatic products, regional anesthesia and endotracheal tubes were noteworthy in the first quarter.In the Surgical business, metal ligation clips and instrument revenues increased by double digits year over year. Broad-based strength across the OEM portfolio is also encouraging, with double-digit growth in all product categories.Strong Prospects of Urolift: Within Interventional Urology, TFX witnessed growth for UroLift in the hospital setting in the first quarter. The end market for UroLift in the United States is expected to continuously improve throughout 2023.Story continuesMeanwhile, Teleflex made considerable progress in the geographic expansion of UroLift with entry into several new markets in 2022, including Japan and China. The company will spend 2023 training surgeons, building its presence in key cities and continuing to engage with the Chinese Urological Society to build acceptance.Business in Asia Holds Long-Term Potential: From a geographic perspective, Asia continues to be an important growth driver for Teleflex. In the first quarter of 2023, the company experienced strength across the region, with all of them posting a solid performance.China continued to be a significant contributor with very high single-digit growth in the quarter. Although the surgical procedure activity in China has not yet reached normal COVID-19 levels following the termination of the zero-COVID-19 policy in late 2022, the company noticed improvement as the quarter went on.DownsidesQ1 Negatives: In the first quarter, Teleflex’s SG&amp;A expenses rose 13%, while R&amp;D expenses increased 14.1%. During the first quarter earnings update, management stated that through the first two months of the quarter, patient flow declined by another 3.7%. Foreign exchange and a competitive environment remain a concern.Increasing Competition: Teleflex competes with companies, ranging from small start-up enterprises to larger and more established companies that have access to significantly greater financial resources. Major competitors include Medtronic and Becton, Dickinson and Company. Per TFX, it competes primarily based on clinical superiority and innovative features that enhance patient benefit, product reliability, performance, customer and sales support and cost-effectiveness.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for TFX’s 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has remained constant at $13.29 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.94 billion.

Developments associated with RPC Inc. RES, TechnipFMC FTI and Vertex Energy VTNR also made it to the headlines.Overall, it was a mixed seven-day period for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures increased 2.1% to close at $70.64 per barrel but natural gas prices dropped 1.6% to end at $2.80 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).In particular, the crude price action flipped to the positive once again, with government data revealing a large dent in supplies.Meanwhile, natural gas found itself on the opposite side of expectations for comfortable temperatures and, therefore, lighter heating or cooling demand.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.  Natural gas exporter Cheniere Energy entered into a long-term supply agreement with ENN Natural Gas Co., Ltd., a China-based energy company. The 20-year agreement facilitates long-term collaboration between the two companies.Per the terms of the contract, Cheniere Marketing, a subsidiary of Cheniere, will provide ENN LNG (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. — a wholly-owned subsidiary of ENN Natural Gas — with 1.8 million tons of liquefied natural gas annually on a free-on-board basis. The purchase price will be indexed to the Henry Hub price, a widely recognized benchmark for natural gas prices in the United States.Cheniere Marketing is set to begin deliveries in mid-2026 and increase its supply to 0.9 million tons per annum (mtpa) in 2027. Delivery of the remaining 0.9 mtpa is subject to the completion of the first train of the Sabine Pass Liquefaction Expansion Project and begin upon the commencement of commercial operations of Train Seven. (Cheniere Inks LNG Supply Deal With China's ENN Natural Gas)2. Transocean recently announced a 16-well binding award for its Transocean Equinox rig in Australia, adding approximately $184 million to firm backlog. This contract, excluding mobilization and demobilization costs, is set to span 380 days. Furthermore, the award comes with additional options that could extend the harsh environment semisubmersibles rig's operations in Australia until 2028.For investors, the growth in backlog is of utmost importance as it directly influences Transocean's sales, earnings and cash flows. As the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) offshore driller secures new contracts, its financial outlook is strong, creating a positive trajectory for the company and its stakeholders.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The awarded project is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2025, following the rig's previously announced commitment of five wells over 300 days with a major operator in Australia, set to begin in the first quarter of 2024. These continued commitments reflect the confidence placed in Transocean's capabilities and the demand for its services in the region. (Transocean Announces $184 Million Addition to Backlog)3.  Oilfield services provider RPC announced that it acquired Spinnaker Oilwell Services, LLC, expanding its oilfield cementing service business. Per the deal, RPC paid $79.5 million for Spinnaker’s equity. The purchasing price comprised $77 million in cash, the assumption of $500,000 of capital lease liabilities and a $2-million payoff. The acquisition will be in effect from Jul 1, 2023.Based in Oklahoma City, OK, Spinnaker is a leading oilfield cementing service provider in the Permian and Mid-Continent basins.

This project marks OMV's first iEPCI endeavor as an operator in the region.The Berling gas development project, operated by OMV, is a notable venture on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. TechnipFMC has been entrusted with the responsibility of designing and installing the subsea production systems, controls, pipelines and umbilicals for this development. This comprehensive scope of work underscores the company's expertise in providing end-to-end solutions for complex offshore projects.OMV’s award of the iEPCI contract to TechnipFMC follows a six-month integrated Front End Engineering and Design (iFEED) study. This study optimized the field layout and enhanced the project's cost efficiency by confirming the suitability of thermally insulated pipe-in-pipe technology for the tieback's flowline. Through iFEED, TechnipFMC demonstrated that iEPCI provides an effective solution to expedite project delivery. (TechnipFMC Clinches iEPCI Contract From OMV (Norge) AS)5.   Vertex Energy, a prominent producer and marketer of refined products, has achieved a significant milestone with respect to its renewable diesel project. The company recently announced the completion of its initial commercial sales transactions of renewable diesel from its state-of-the-art production facility at the Mobile Refinery in Alabama. In the first series, VTNR successfully sold approximately 110,000 barrels of renewable diesel to Idemitsu Apollo Renewable Corporation, a subsidiary of Idemitsu Kosan.The company's commitment to renewable fuels and its strategic focus on reducing carbon emissions highlight its position as a leader in transitioning from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources.As part of its decarbonization efforts and commitment to energy security, Vertex Energy has embraced renewable sources in addition to conventional fuels. As part of that endeavor, the company acquired a refinery in Mobile, AL in 2022 and initiated a renewable diesel conversion project. As such, the sales of renewable diesel align with Vertex Energy's commitment to renewable energy and mark a significant step toward its long-term growth strategy. This will also enable it to capture the projected growth in demand for low-carbon and sustainable alternatives.

Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi joins the Live show to discuss three unloved stocks to watch as we continue into the second half of 2023, including Occidental Petroleum, AT&amp;T, and Cisco Systems.Video Transcript- According to Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, just seven stocks fueled most of the S&amp;P 500's 15% year to date advance. We know all about the most loved stocks, but what about the ones longing for some affection here, waiting for somebody to swipe right on them. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi. Hey, weekend mood Brian Sozzi has his three picks for the months ahead here.- It's so messed up.- You look good.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, one of my picks was the shirt I'm wearing. This is just great.- I like it.BRIAN SOZZI: This is great. Strong buy on my slim fit shirt. But let's get to some stock picks here. Real cool piece from our Seana Smith, our senior anchor in the afternoon and yours truly, now on our homepage looking at how the markets have really had a really strong first half, double digit gains led by in large part a lot of those big cap tech stocks, AI names.But if you look into this piece, there are a bunch of stocks that the market absolutely hated. First on the list, that is AT&amp;T. First half or year to date performance down 13%. Investors really concerned about slow collections, people paying their bills late because of economic troubles.But the people we have talked to are starting to warm up a little bit on AT&amp;T seeing perhaps a little bit of an economic turn in the back half of the year. The company's cash flow position may be improving a little. That might have people returning to AT&amp;T, which has had a really tough three or four years or so.Next stock, which a little bit surprising here guys, that is Occidental Petroleum, Warren Buffett's favorite stock. But more of this stock last year surprisingly, despite Buffett's big buys, shares down about 8% year to date because of the pullback in oil prices, which have been driven by fears about China demand and a US recession. But as you get some more OPEC supply cuts as was announced earlier this week, you could see oil prices start to turn higher. Perhaps that Buffett stock, Buffett's favorite stock starts to get a bid.Story continuesAnd the last but not the least, Cisco. Shares up 7% year to date. So it's been doing well. It just has relatively lagged the broader double digit gain in the S&amp;P 500. I think investors should go back to a name like Cisco. Look, the company, what they just reported a couple of months ago, they will see double digit sales. They will see a more streamlined organization after some layoffs, and maybe a lot better fundamentally-- just a better fundamental business than a lot of people expected.- This is really interesting. And you wrote about non-tech companies not faring well. CVS Health, another one you mentioned, is down 26% in this story. Were there other kind of weak spots right now that even within their own weakness, investors could perhaps look for a type of bounce back at all from what you were seeing in the data?BRIAN SOZZI: Well, I-- see, there are names. There are striking underperformers. You mentioned CVS Health, Walgreens also been an underperformer. Those stocks with gain-- with losses of over 20%, it's hard to warm up to them. Where is the catalyst for CVS, CVS Health? Maybe is it a really strong flu season in the fall? Unclear.So I don't think you want to go out there and try to throw darts at some of these names. You have to look for clear catalyst. Cisco, a clear catalyst, improving business model, improving cash flow at AT&amp;T. There has to be a reason to get involved with these names.Out of all of the three names we mentioned, Occidental Petroleum looks very intriguing. Again, these are not names I'm saying to buy. That's not what we do here at Yahoo Finance. But again, there is a fundamental setup to get excited by name-- with Occidental Petroleum. And if Buffett is throwing billions at it, who am I to argue with Warren Buffett?- Right. And is there a case for Occidental to pay for my child's college?[LAUGHTER]- And year's out. And year's out.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, if Warren Buffett-- Warren Buffett invest for eternity. So who are we to argue with Warren Buffett's track record. If he likes this stock, why shouldn't we?- Yeah, he's probably got Tony Stark's arc reactor somewhere.BRIAN SOZZI: I think he has the same shirt too as me.- He does, actually. We've seen that.BRIAN SOZZI: Slim fit.- He was probably wearing it at the annual shareholder meeting.- Sozzi.BRIAN SOZZI: It's good to see you guys. It's a real pleasure.- Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi joining us here today.]"

DXCM recently announced that its next-generation Dexcom G7 Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) System received Health Canada’s approval for people with all types of diabetes aged two years and above. The Dexcom G7 has been built on the performance of Dexcom CGM, which has been clinically proven to lower A1C, reduce hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and improve time in range.Although approved by Health Canada, Dexcom G7 is not yet available for purchase. Dexcom Canada is working to make Dexcom G7 available to diabetic Canadians by the end of 2023.Dexcom is also currently working with its insulin pump partners to integrate Dexcom G7 into current and future automated insulin delivery systems.With the latest regulatory approval, DexCom is expected to solidify its foothold in the global CGM business.Significance of the ApprovalPer Dexcom’s estimates, diabetes affects more than 3 million Canadians, which requires around-the-clock management of glucose levels and daily treatment decisions to manage the disease. Dexcom believes that Health Canada’s approval of the G7 CGM will provide access to an innovative technology that simplifies diabetes management. It has also been shown to significantly (by up to 42%) reduce hospitalizations and emergency room visits due to hypoglycemia.Per an expert familiar with the use of CGM for diabetes management, following the approval of Dexcom G7 in Canada, patients will likely have a new, simple-to-start and easy-to-use tool in their diabetes management toolbox to effectively manage their diabetes and make important health decisions backed by health data and proven results.Dexcom’s management believes that the next-generation Dexcom G7 with its greater accuracy, a simplified user experience, proven results and extensive digital connectivity will likely support greater quality of life and improved outcomes for diabetics.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global CGM device market size was valued at $7,816.8 million in 2022 and is expected to reach $11.2 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 4.4%. Factors like the rising cases of diabetes and the increasing adoption of CGM devices are likely to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the latest regulatory approval is expected to provide a significant boost to DexCom’s business globally.Notable DevelopmentsLast month, DexCom announced that the Dexcom G6 Real-Time CGM System is the only CGM to connect to the Omnipod 5 AID System, thus helping users to protect against high and low glucose levels.In April, DexCom announced its first-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered a solid uptick in its overall top line, both on a reported and organic basis. It also recorded robust growth in U.S. and international revenues in the quarter.

The two are some of the most traded high-quality arabica beans in the market.For the eight months of the current October-to-September coffee year, the Brazilian Natural exports are down 9.8%, the ICO said. For the Colombian Milds, it was the 11th straight month of lower exports.Meanwhile, exports of robusta beans, a type widely used to make instant coffee or to be blended in low-end ground &amp; roast brands, increased 6.8% in May.ICO said interest rate hikes and high borrowing costs in Europe and the United States were partly to blame for the switch to cheaper coffees. Higher rates ""limit how big purchasing budgets can be, with buyers focusing on more competitive origins and shying away from the more expensive growths,"" the organization said.Robusta beans are the only ones showing higher traded volumes in the 2022/23 season so far when compared to the previous three seasons.The situation has caused a surge on robusta prices and pressured prices for arabica beans. ICO said that the difference between prices for arabica and robusta beans is the smallest since October 2020.""Arbitrage, as measured between the London and New York futures markets, contracted by 22.6% to 50.31 cents/lb in June 2023 as the Robusta growth rate outstripped the New York Market,"" the ICO said.

With its substantial financial reserves, we believe that Capital One is well-positioned to navigate future economic uncertainty. Additionally, we believe this current market and credit cycle is fundamentally different than prior ones due to stronger consumer balance sheets, excess savings, strong wage growth and strong employment environment.

The proof lies in their trading record this year. That has created some screaming buys elsewhere in the market. These are stocks to buy now and in the future on a further dip.Consider this.The Nasdaq is up roughly 30% so far on the year and the S&amp;P 500 is up roughly 15%. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 are up just 2% and 5%, respectively.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOutside of mega-cap tech — which has been driving the gains in the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 —  broad participation has been lacking. Although those measures have shown improvement, it’s left many stocks out of favor. That’s despite many names being of high quality with strong businesses.Let’s look outside of tech to find some stock market opportunities and search for stocks that are screaming buys.Screaming Buys (on a Dip): PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comPepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) is a well-known, blue-chip name that investors have come to depend upon over the years. Shares recently hit all-time highs in mid-May, but the stock has struggled for upside traction since.The stock pulled back about 9%, bounced, and is now starting to see some more selling pressure. Will PepsiCo retest the lows? I don’t know, but if it does it will be one of the screaming buys on many investors’ watchlists.The stock currently pays out a 2.75% dividend yield. That dividend has not only been paid, but has been raised for 51 consecutive years. Most recently, management raised the dividend by 10% in May.Estimates call for mid-single-digit revenue growth this year and next, alongside high-single-digit earnings growth both years as well. PepsiCo is about as consistent as they come — whether that’s revenue growth, earnings power, or the dividend.The firm clearly dominates in the food and beverage space, and it’s become a solid buy-the-dips candidate.Stocks to Buy Now: Ulta Beauty (ULTA)Orange Ulta Beauty (ULTA) logo on storefrontSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comStory continuesUlta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) was one of the top retail stocks through late 2022 and much of 2023. Unlike tech, retail stocks have badly struggled for most of this year. However, Ulta was a standout exception.From the October low to the recent high, shares rallied almost 50%. Amid the move, it strung together seven straight monthly gains and hit all-time highs.Then the stock began a pullback going into earnings, and fell more than 13% in a single session after the report. Shares ultimately suffered a peak-to-trough decline of almost 28%. All this for a stock that gave a slight boost to its prior revenue outlook (although it was still a bit short of consensus expectations) and provided a minor trim to its margin outlook while maintaining its earnings outlook.This hot stock has fallen out of favor. If we retest the recent lows, the valuation may be too compelling to take a pass on again.High-Risk, High-Growth Stocks: PagerDuty (PD)Top stock trades for PDSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpiderPagerDuty (NYSE:PD) is a high-risk, high-growth stock. However, it’s not a high-risk stock in the sense that most investors assume. Instead, this name continues to show relative weakness at a time where many growth stocks are hitting multi-week and multi-month highs. This risk isn’t related to the business, but rather, a lack of demand for its stock. If growth names fall out favor in Q3, it’s hard to imagine PD stock performing well.Despite having a great product, the company lacks a strong salesforce. I say this because the company’s dollar-based net retention (or DBNR) has been so strong, yet management had to trim its revenue outlook. According to the company, “For more than two years, we have consistently achieved dollar-based net retention (DBNR) above 120%”.On June 1, the company delivered a top- and bottom-line beat, but its outlook disappointed investors. That has the stock down about 37.5% from the recent highs and up just 13% from the fourth-quarter low at a time when many growth stocks are gaining momentum.That said, forecasts for the firm are strong, and the company has swung to profitability as it continues to gain momentum in its business.

Notably, if exa-cel is approved in Europe or the United States, it will trigger a $200 million milestone payment which we expect the company to receive in the fourth quarter of 2023.CRISPR is rapidly leveraging its CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing platform to make therapies for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies, cancer, diabetes and other diseases. Currently, it has no marketed drug in its portfolio. Its lead pipeline candidate is exa-cel.Exa-cel is an investigational, autologous, ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy, developed to treat SCD or TDT. The completion of the BLA filing for exa-cel is a milestone as it is the first regulatory filing for a CRISPR-based treatment within a decade of the CRISPR platform’s discovery.In June 2023, CRSP and VRTX announced that the FDA has accepted its BLAs for exa-cel to treat SCD and TDT. Furthermore, The FDA granted priority review to the BLA filing for exa-cel in SCD indication, while the exa-cel filing in TDT indication has been accepted for a standard review by the agency. Final decisions on the BLAs for exa-cel in SCD and TDT indications are expected by Dec 8, 2023 and Mar 30, 2024, respectively.Unlike standard reviews that require a time of 12 months for completion, priority reviews shorten the FDA's review timeline to eight months.The BLA submission is supported by data from the ongoing phase III studies, CLIMB-111 and CLIMB-121, and an ongoing long-term follow-up study, CLIMB-131.Story continuesBoth SCD and TDT have significant unmet medical needs and if successfully developed and commercialized, exa-cel can provide a huge boost to CRISPR Therapeutics’ prospects. The company, along with Vertex, has also initiated two new phase III studies evaluating exa-cel in pediatric patients with TDT and SCD.Vertex and CRISPR also filed similar submissions on exa-cel in Europe and the U.K. in December 2022 that were validated by the respective regulatory authorities in January 2023.Apart from exa-cel, ViaCyte (now acquired by Vertex) and CRISPR are developing stem-cell therapies for diabetes. VRTX is currently enrolling study participants in a phase I/II study evaluating VCTX211, a stem-derived candidate for type I diabetes indication. This March, Vertex signed another agreement with CRSP to accelerate the development of the former’s hypoimmune cell therapies for type I diabetes.Besides its collaboration with Vertex, the company is also developing two gene-edited allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy candidates, CTX110 and CTX130, targeting hematological and solid tumor cancers in separate early-to-mid-stage studies. In May 2023, CRISPR announced that it has started separate phase I/II studies on new CAR-T candidates, which are CTX112 (targeting CD19-positive B-cell malignancies) and CTX131 (targeting relapsed or refractory solid tumors).CRISPR Therapeutics AG Price and ConsensusCRISPR Therapeutics AG Price and ConsensusCRISPR Therapeutics AG price-consensus-chart | CRISPR Therapeutics AG QuoteZacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCRISPR currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the biotech sector are ADMA Biologics, Inc.

286,d2977059-b490-33ed-b7b2-3f573ba1d733,NSC,2023-07-06,Norfolk Southern says other companies should share blame in fiery Ohio derailment,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/norfolk-southern-says-other-companies-221047445.html,1688595047,STORY,['NSC'],"[OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Norfolk Southern says the owner of the rail car that caused the fiery Ohio derailment in February failed to properly maintain it in the years before the crash, and the railroad wants to make sure that company and the owners of the other cars involved help pay for the costs.The railroad filed a complaint Friday against all the car owners and shippers connected to the hazardous chemicals that spilled in the Feb. 3 derailment. As part of that, Norfolk Southern said GATX didn't follow the car manufacturer's recommendations for taking care of the plastic pellet car that has been blamed for the derailment.The National Transportation Safety Board said in its preliminary report that the likely cause of the crash was a bearing on that car overheated. Its final report detailing everything that contributed won’t be done until at least next year. The derailment forced thousands of people to evacuate their homes near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border and sent a towering plume of black smoke over the town of East PalestineThe railroad said everyone involved in shipping hazardous chemicals bears some responsibility under federal regulations in making sure they get to their destination safely. Norfolk Southern, like most railroads, doesn't actually own most of the cars it hauls, and it said the car owner and shippers are responsible for maintaining them even though railroad workers inspect and repair them along the way if they find defects.The problem Norfolk Southern identified with the plastic pellet car is that it sat idle for more than a year and a half in 2017 and 2018 and again for more than six months in 2018 and 2019. The manufacturer says railcars need to be moved at least one car length ever six months to keep the grease on the bearings from degrading, which can happen over long periods of time or during extreme weather. The railroad said the car was based on the Gulf Coast near New Orleans, which experiences hurricanes and flooding.Story continuesBut GATX leases its railcars to companies that use them to ship their products, so it may not have even had control over the car at the time. The NTSB pointed out in documents released as part of its investigative hearing that the railroad doesn't track car movements within its railyards, so it also may not be clear whether this car wasn't moved when it wasn't in use.GATX said in a statement that ""throughout our 125-year history, the safety of our employees, our customers, our environment and the communities in which we operate has always been our highest priority. We will vigorously defend the company against baseless claims made by Norfolk Southern.”Norfolk Southern's move to make sure other companies pay part of the nearly $400 million estimated cost of the derailment isn't a surprise. It previously said it would likely do that as well as pursuing reimbursement from its insurers.Railroad spokesman Thomas Crosson said this legal move doesn’t signal a change in Norfolk Southern’s commitment to cleaning up the mess. Rather, Crosson said this complaint “seeks to ensure that others responsible for the safe transport of freight, such as railcar owners and shippers of the material being transported, contribute resources to the effort.”The railroad also defended the decision to blow open five tank cars containing vinyl chloride and burn that chemical three days after the derailment because officials were concerned those cars might explode. Residents are concerned about the potential health implications of that move and the other chemicals that spilled.Norfolk Southern said the railroad's hazardous materials experts who were helping firefighters deal with the derailment feared that the pressure inside the cars could be building. The fact that one car appeared to heat up on its own and another car violently vented some pressurized gas even after the fire near those cars had been extinguished troubled first responders.The company that shipped the vinyl chloride, OxyVinyls, told the NTSB last month that its experts believed the chemical remained stable.“Norfolk Southern’s lawsuit is a meritless disinformation campaign masquerading as a legal filing,” OxyVinyls spokeswoman Celina Cardenas said. “Norfolk Southern’s recommendation to simultaneously detonate the railcars containing our product — contrary to the available information about the railcars’ condition or the product properties — appears to have been needlessly rushed to prioritize Norfolk Southern’s rail line operations.”It will be up to the courts to decide how much responsibility all of the companies involved will bear. In addition to the companies involved in the vinyl chloride and plastic pellet cars, Norfolk Southern sued the companies responsible for three other tank cars that breached.]"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the railroad industry, head directly to 5 Best Railroad Stocks To Buy Now. In 2022, the global railroad market was worth $307.6 billion. According to IMARC Group's projections, the market is anticipated to reach $503.3 billion by 2028, indicating a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.11% during the forecast period from 2023 to 2028. Since global transportation demand is increasing rapidly, the International Energy Agency predicts that passenger and freight activity will double the current levels by 2050. While this is a sign of economic prosperity, it goes hand in hand with higher emissions and atmospheric damage. High speed railways are a perfect solution for a swiftly urbanizing world, as rail is considered one of the most energy efficient means of transport. Currently, about 75% of passengers use electric trains, compared to about 60% of the passengers boarding these energy efficient trains in 2000. As a result of this heavy reliance on electricity, the rail sector is the most diverse mode of transport in terms of energy sources. Europe, Japan, and Russia have the highest number of electric trains, while North and South America are largely reliant on diesel. Over the past two decades, there has been a consistent increase in freight rail activity. Currently, the movement of freight by rail is primarily concentrated in China and the United States, with each country accounting for about one-quarter of global rail freight activity. Additionally, Russia holds a prominent share, making up one-fifth of the global freight movement. The transportation of minerals, coal, and agricultural products constitutes the majority of freight rail activity worldwide.Don't Miss: Top 15 Railroad Companies In The WorldThe trade trends from CNBC Supply Chain Heat Map data have consistently demonstrated a decline in inbound freight over the last few months. This reduction in freight has had a negative impact on the earnings of both trucking and rail industries, as their revenue depends on the transportation of goods. According to United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) CEO Carol Tome, a downturn in US retail sales and persistently weak demand in Asia contributed to lower-than-expected freight volume for the company. Similarly, Shelley Simpson, the president of J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT), recently characterized the current state of the industry as a ""freight recession."" During the Q1 earnings call of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), CEO Lance Fritz identified inflation, elevated inventory levels, and sluggish consumer spending as immediate challenges in the industry. On the other hand, CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) surpassed earnings expectations as it experienced a surge in merchandise freight and coal transportation volumes. Similarly, Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) also reported robust performance in merchandise and coal sectors. Story continuesWhile the railroad and freight industry is experiencing mixed performance, its significance as a lucrative part of the economy cannot be overlooked. Some of the best stocks to buy in the railroad sector include Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC), Canadian Pacific Kansas City Limited (NYSE:CP), and CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX). Our Methodology We selected the following railroad stocks based on the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock.

288,d0677224-da1b-3905-83c1-39849fae877d,NSC,2023-07-06,Ohio presses Biden for disaster relief for East Palestine,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ohio-presses-biden-disaster-relief-172636071.html,1688577996,STORY,['NSC'],"[A Norfolk Southern train at the Port of Cleveland in Ohio. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)The state of Ohio is asking President Joe Biden to declare East Palestine the site of a major disaster or emergency because of uncertainty over how the health of area residents will be impacted in the future.A Norfolk Southern train derailed in East Palestine on Feb. 3. Several days following the derailment, NS and state and local officials decided to vent a tank car carrying vinyl chloride over concern that the car was in danger of exploding.Ohio’s request comes as NS (NYSE: NSC) has filed a complaint against some rail car owners and manufacturers involved in the accident as a means to recoup costs.“Because of the unique nature of this incident the State is still working to identify current needs and evaluate the future impacts this disaster will have on individuals and the community. The incident had immediate physical and mental health effects on the community … . However, the long-term health impacts are unknown,” said a Monday letter from Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine.Although NS has pledged to help the community in Ohio, that aid is not certain, DeWine said.“While Norfolk Southern has willingly stepped in to provide much needed assistance to the community, this assistance is not guaranteed moving forward and could terminate for a variety of reasons,” DeWine said. If NS is found to not be liable for the damage in East Palestine or new leadership takes over management of Norfolk Southern and decides to terminate assistance, he continued, then state and local governments will have to step in.Asking Biden to declare East Palestine a disaster area means that the state views the incident as “of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and the affected local governments, and that supplementary federal assistance is necessary,” DeWine said.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is still investigating the circumstances that led to the derailment. The federal agency held a two-day public hearing in East Palestine to examine factors that may have contributed to the incident. No deaths or injuries were reported, but the derailment forced the temporary evacuation of an area around the site.Story continuesNS sues rail car owners over derailmentSeparately, NS filed a complaint against rail car owners Friday in an ongoing lawsuit being heard in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio on the derailment.NS says it wants to ensure that others involved in the incident, such as rail car owners and rail shippers whose cars carrying hazardous materials derailed, bear some responsibility in the industry’s response to the incident.“From the beginning, Norfolk Southern has committed to making things right in East Palestine and the surrounding areas. We are investing in the community and remediating the site, while working to create long-term funds to support real estate values, healthcare, and water testing,” NS told FreightWaves in a statement about the complaint. “This third-party complaint does not change that commitment but seeks to ensure that others responsible for the safe transport of freight, such as railcar owners and shippers of the material being transported, contribute resources to the effort.”Defendants in the complaint include chemical companies Oxy Vinyls and Dow Chemical, rail car manufacturer and lessor GATX (NYSE: GATX), rail car lessor Trinity Industries (NYSE: TRN), GATX subsidiary and rail car lessor General American Marks Co., rail car lessor SMBC Rail Services, and rail car manufacturer and lessor Union Tank Car Co.“The responsibility for safe transport is shared among several interested parties, including the manufacturers of the railcars and safety devices, the owners and lessees of the railcars, the manufacturers and shippers of the material being transported, and the railroad,” attorneys representing NS said in the Friday filing.The rail carrier added that “federal environmental laws require that all responsible parties contribute to the cleanup costs.” A federal provision “ensures that all industry participants bear the environmental cost of potentially hazardous goods, which balances the benefits of industrial manufacturing with the protection of public resources. In this instance, the responsible parties include, among others, the owners of the railcars that were carrying chemicals and the shippers of the chemicals released in the derailment.”NS also said some rail car owners failed to ensure that their cars were being properly maintained — a task that is not solely within the railroad’s purview. This includes ensuring that a rail car or a rail car component’s design and modification complies with federal regulations, which is NS’ complaint against Oxy Vinyls, GATX and Trinity, and that bearings are being properly maintained, which is NS’ complaint against General American Marks.In response to NS’ complaint, OxyVinyls, which is affiliated with Oxy Chemical and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY), rejected NS’ allegation.“Norfolk Southern’s lawsuit is a meritless disinformation campaign masquerading as a legal filing. Testimony from multiple witnesses at the recent NTSB Investigative Hearing in East Palestine revealed that Norfolk Southern and its contractors ignored OxyVinyls’ experience with its products and withheld essential information from the East Palestine Fire Chief,” OxyVinyl told FreightWaves in a statement.“Norfolk Southern’s recommendation to simultaneously detonate the railcars containing our product — contrary to the available information about the railcars’ condition or the product properties — appears to have been needlessly rushed to prioritize Norfolk Southern’s rail line operations. We will continue to support the Federal agencies investigating the incident, which are focused on evaluating the facts.”GATX told FreightWaves, “GATX takes all safety-related events seriously. Throughout our 125-year history, the safety of our employees, our customers, our environment and the communities in which we operate has always been our highest priority. We will vigorously defend the company against baseless claims made by Norfolk Southern.”Said Jack Todd, vice president of public affairs for Trinity: “Trinity is aware of Norfolk Southern’s meritless filing. For more than 45 years, Trinity has proudly supplied the rail industry with safe and reliable railcars. Trinity railcars are built to approved standards and regulations and perform as designed. The allegations made by Norfolk Southern are baseless, and we will vigorously defend ourselves.”SMBC declined to comment on pending litigation.Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inboxClick here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:Witness testifies freight car involved in NS train derailment was not inspectedNTSB examines communication gaps at East Palestine train derailment hearingFederal regulators plan broad safety review of all Class I railroadsThe post Ohio presses Biden for disaster relief for East Palestine appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Is Coca-Cola Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$11.4bUS$12.4bUS$13.3bUS$13.9bUS$14.4bUS$14.8bUS$15.3bUS$15.7bUS$16.0bUS$16.4bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.54%Est @ 3.11%Est @ 2.81%Est @ 2.60%Est @ 2.45%Est @ 2.35% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$10.7kUS$10.9kUS$10.9kUS$10.7kUS$10.3kUS$10.0kUS$9.6kUS$9.2kUS$8.8kUS$8.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$100bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$16b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$353bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$353b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$182bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$281b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$60.6, the company appears about fair value at a 6.8% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Coca-Cola as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Coca-ColaStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Beverage market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Coca-Cola, there are three relevant factors you should look at:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Coca-Cola , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Future Earnings: How does KO's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

297,8247c5e2-d624-3d2f-bf99-1224e4866965,IR,2023-07-06,5 Top-Ranked S&P 500 Stocks to Buy in July,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-top-ranked-p-500-133200749.html,1688563920,STORY,"['PANW', 'TT', 'RCL', 'LEN', '^GSPC', 'LEN-B', '^DJI', 'CMI']","[The S&amp;P 500 wrapped up its best month since October, gaining 6.5% amid various challenges. This remarkable performance is a testament to the resilience and dynamism of the American economy, even in the face of ongoing global uncertainties.The S&amp;P 500, which tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States, is widely regarded as a reliable barometer of the U.S. economy's health. Its recent surge is a clear indication of investor confidence and a strong signal of economic recovery.Given the solid surge, many stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have gained in double digits. We have highlighted five of them that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), a Momentum Score of B or better and saw positive earnings estimate revisions for the current fiscal year over the past 30 days, suggesting continued outperformance. These include Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL, Palo Alto Networks Inc. PANW, Cummins CMI, Lennar LEN and Trane Technologies TT. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Several factors have contributed to this impressive performance. Let's delve into some of the key drivers behind this surge.Strong Corporate EarningsOne of the primary drivers behind the S&amp;P 500's strong performance is robust corporate earnings. Many companies have reported better-than-expected earnings, reflecting a strong rebound in business activities. This has been particularly evident in sectors such as technology and consumer discretionary, which have seen a significant uptick in demand as the economy continues to recover.Economic IndicatorsPositive economic indicators have also played a crucial role in boosting investor confidence. Recent data shows a steady decline in unemployment rates and a surge in consumer spending, both of which are positive signs for the economy. Additionally, inflation rates have remained relatively stable, alleviating concerns about runaway price increases.Story continuesMonetary PolicyThe Federal Reserve's accommodative monetary policy has also been a significant factor in the S&amp;P 500's strong performance. By keeping interest rates low and continuing its bond-buying program, the Fed has ensured ample liquidity in the market, making it easier for businesses to borrow and invest.Market OptimismFinally, market optimism has played a significant role in the S&amp;P 500's surge. Investors seem to be betting on a strong economic recovery, buoyed by the rapid pace of COVID-19 vaccinations and the easing of pandemic-related restrictions. This optimism is reflected in the increased risk appetite among investors, leading to a surge in equity investments.More Upside in July?If historical patterns are any indication, July is poised to be another strong month for equities. Over the past decade, both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have consistently performed exceptionally well in July, making it the best month of the year for them since 2009. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also fared impressively, ranking as the second-best month in terms of performance.Looking at the numbers, the S&amp;P 500 has experienced an average monthly gain of 3.3% in July, while the Nasdaq has seen an average rally of 4.1%. The Dow's average monthly gain of 2.8% in July is only slightly below its best month of the year, which was November, with a gain of 2.9% since 2009. Importantly, none of these indexes have recorded a decline during the month of July since 2014.Per The Almanac, the month of July is historically the fourth-best month of the year for the S&amp;P 500. Bespoke points out that July recently has been even better. ""Over the last 10 years, performance has been even stronger with the S&amp;P 500 averaging a gain of 3.3% and positive returns 90% of the time, including each of the last eight years.""Best Stocks of S&amp;P 500Royal Caribbean is a cruise company that owns and operates three global brands — Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruises.

Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Trane Technologies (TT) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to TT for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Trane Technologies' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Trane Technologies' main business drivers.Founded in 1885 and headquartered in Swords, Ireland, Trane Technologies is a designer, manufacturer, seller and servicer of climate control products for heating, ventilation, air conditioning and transport solutions. The company distributes its products through branch sales offices, dealers and distributors in the United States and through subsidiary sales and service companies in other parts of the world. Trane generated around 72% of its revenues from the United States and rest from more than 100 other countries. With no customer accounting for more than 10% of revenues, the company’s business does not depend on any single customer of group of customers.As of Dec 31, 2022, Trane Technologies had roughly 39,000 employees in around 60 countries including roughly 14,000 outside of the United States. Roughly 25.7% of the company’s global employees are women and 37.4% of employees in the United States are racially and ethnically diverse. In 2022, 30.2% of new hires were women worldwide and 50.5% of new hires in the United States were racially and ethnically diverse. Trane continues to invest in research, development and other activities that it feels are necessary for improving its competitive position. It focuses on reduction of production cost, development of new products, enhancement of existing products and development of custom solutions for customers.Story continuesThe company operates three regional segments which are also its reportable segments- Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific. The Americas segment serves North American and Latin American customers with residential and commercial heating and cooling systems, energy services and solutions, building controls, and transport refrigeration systems and solutions. The segment generated $12.64 billion of revenues in 2022 (79% of total revenues). The EMEA segment serves customers in Europe, Middle East and Africa with heating and cooling systems, services and solutions for commercial buildings, and transport refrigeration systems and solutions. The segment generated $2.03 billion of revenues in 2022 (13% of total revenues). The Asia Pacific segment offers heating and cooling systems, services and solutions for commercial buildings, and transport refrigeration systems and solutions in the Asia Pacific region. The segment generated $1.32 billion of revenues in 2022 (8% of total revenues).Bottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Trane Technologies, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in July 2013 would be worth $3,416.12, or a gain of 241.61%, as of July 5, 2023, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 175.82% and gold's return of 47.81% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for TT.Trane Technologies remains focused on improving the quality of its products and services and operating efficiencies to achieve sustained improvement in earnings and cash flow. It prioritizes improving its business operating system and innovation through business transformation initiatives and prudent investments. Trane has a track record of repurchasing shares and paying dividends consistently. Such moves instil investor confidence and positively impact the company's bottom line. Partly due to these tailwinds, the stock has appreciated in the past year. On the flip side, product and service diversity puts Trane in the face of fierce competition in terms of price, quantity, delivery, service, support, technology and innovation. The company’s business experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenues. Lower liquidity remains a concern.The stock is up 9.42% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 3 higher, for fiscal 2023. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

299,5a1d5b89-f83c-3327-b08f-422f78ea3ab5,SRE,2023-07-06,SDG&E ADDS TWO MORE ENERGY STORAGE FACILITIES TO STRENGTHEN SUMMER GRID RELIABILITY AND ADVANCE CLEAN ENERGY GOALS,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sdg-e-adds-two-more-105000176.html,1688640600,STORY,['SRE'],"[In recent years, SDG&amp;E has more than doubled its utility-owned energy storage capacity SAN DIEGO, July 6, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- As part of its commitment to help bolster summer grid reliability and advance California's 100% clean energy goal, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric (SDG&amp;E) has completed two additional utility-owned energy storage facilities totaling 171 megawatts (MW), enough to power almost 130,000 homes for four hours.Aerial Photo of the Westside Canal Energy Storage ProjectB-Roll Package + Photos Available for Download HereThe 131MW Westside Canal project located in Imperial Valley – home to a high concentration of solar, wind, and geothermal generation facilities – is the largest storage asset in SDG&amp;E's utility-owned energy storage portfolio; the 40MW Fallbrook project, located in Northern San Diego County, is the second largest in its portfolio. SDG&amp;E's energy storage portfolio is expected to reach 345 MW of power capacity by the end of the year, sufficient to meet over 15% of its customers' load on a typical day and 7% on a system peak day. These energy storage assets participate in the energy markets managed by the California Independent System Operator, allowing CAISO to store and dispatch clean energy from the facilities to meet electricity demand as needed.""The beauty of energy storage is it can help California solve two problems simultaneously. It can soak up surplus renewable energy during the day, so solar and wind farms don't have to cut off production when demand on the grid is low,"" said SDG&amp;E's Vice President of Energy Innovation Miguel Romero. ""By extending the availability of clean energy to peak evening hours, energy storage can also help California achieve its clean energy goals by reducing reliance on conventional power plants to meet peak electricity demand.""In recent years, as wind and solar generation capacity has soared in California, renewable generation facilities have had to increasingly curtail, or scale back, energy production to keep the grid balanced. At times, California has had to pay neighboring states to take its oversupply of solar energy in order to avoid overloading the grid.Story continuesIn recent years, California has also experienced repeated grid emergencies during record heat waves, which pushed the grid to the brink due to energy demand exceeding supply.""With our state experiencing more frequent climate extremes such as record heat waves and droughts, it is essential to invest in innovations like energy storage to make sure we can continue to power the world's 4th largest economy reliably,"" said CAISO President and CEO Elliot Mainzer. ""The rapid growth of energy storage in California in recent years gives me optimism about our state's future and its capacity to respond to climate change.""Westside Canal consists of more than 800 cubes of stacked lithium-ion batteries which stretch across roughly 16 acres of land. It began commercial operation in June. Like Westside Canal, the Fallbrook energy storage project is also made up of stacks of lithium-ion batteries tightly packed inside metal cubes. The Fallbrook project began commercial operation in May. Both facilities are equipped with safety features, remote monitoring, and automation technologies. When smoke or other anomalies are detected, the units will automatically shut down.The completion of these projects follows two other utility-owned storage projects SDG&amp;E has brought online in recent years. The company finished the Top Gun Energy Storage Facility (30MW) in the Miramar area of San Diego in 2021 and the Kearny Energy Storage Facility (20MW) in the Kearny Mesa area of San Diego in 2022.SDG&amp;E is an innovative energy delivery company that provides clean, safe and reliable energy to better the lives of the people it serves in San Diego and southern Orange counties. The company is committed to creating a sustainable future by increasing energy delivered from low or zero-carbon sources; accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles; and investing in innovative technologies to ensure the reliable operation of the region's infrastructure for generations to come.

KBR touched a new 52-week high of $65.76 on Jul 3. The stock pulled back to end the trading session at $65.68, up 1% from the previous day’s closing price of $65.06.KBR has gained 30% in the past six months compared with the Zacks Engineering - R and D Services industry’s 21.7% growth, the Zacks Construction sector’s increase of 25.1% and the S&amp;P 500 Index’s growth of 15.5%.Despite the ongoing uncertainties in the global market, KBR is benefiting from consistent contract wins that are boosting its backlog and solid performance of the Government Solutions (GS) segment.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn Jul 3, the company settled a decade-old legacy lawsuit concerning the cross-leveling of materials and equipment procurement as well as inventory management under the LOGCAP III contract in Iraq, between the years 2007 and 2011. This settlement has most likely contributed to inducing bullish sentiments among the investors, resulting in the company’s share price to touch a 52-week high.Let’s delve deeper into the factors favoring this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.Factors Driving KBR’s GrowthImpressive Q1 Results: KBR reported strong results in first-quarter 2023, wherein earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.5% and 4.9%, respectively. The top and the bottom lines grew year over year by 0.6% and 8.1%, respectively. Both metrics gained on strong underlying growth and margin expansion as well as excellent bookings in the reported quarter.Solid Backlog Level: KBR’s ongoing contract wins enables it to gain growth momentum in the long run. The company’s determination to lower emissions, product diversification, energy efficiency and more sustainable technologies and solutions have been driving growth. As of Mar 31, 2023, the backlog and option level of KBR was $20.9 billion, compared with $19.8 billion at 2021-end. Also, it received $3.1 billion in bookings and options in highly strategic areas with a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.4x.Strong GS Segment Performance: The GS business of KBR has been banking on contract growth in logistics and engineering and take-away wins, alongside new work awarded under the company’s portfolio of well-positioned contracting vehicles. Strength in its overseas logistics and mission support programs on the back of higher military exercise activities, increased outsourcing of sustainment activities by the military and the ramp up of new wins enables growth.As of Mar 31, 2023, nearly 71% of the backlog represents work in GS. The upside was attributable to favorable defense, space and military budgets, which resulted in increased demand for its GS services. Further, the company expects growth across all its key markets in the United States, the UK and Australia, driven by continued opportunities across the lifecycle of projects.Story continuesKey PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the same sector are Eagle Materials Inc.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about General Electric (GE).GE currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.63, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.63 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60% and 13.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for GEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for GECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for GE here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying GE, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is GE Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for GE, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.4% over the past month to $2.02.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for GE. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for GE with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Industry players like Chubb Limited CB, The Progressive Corporation PGR,  Kinsale Capital Group Limited (KNSL) RLI Corporation RLI and NMI Holdings (NMIH) are poised to grow despite a rise in catastrophic activities. Given an active catastrophe environment, the policy renewal rate should accelerate. Also, the increasing adoption of technology and the emergence of insurtech will help in the smooth functioning of the industry players.Though the industry is witnessing a rate increase, the magnitude has decreased in the last nine quarters. Nonetheless, an improvement in surplus and accelerated economic activities set the stage for a better M&amp;A environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance industry comprises companies that provide commercial and personal property insurance, and casualty insurance products and services. Such insurance helps to safeguard property in case of any natural or man-made disasters. Liability coverages are also provided by some industry players. The insurance coverage offered also includes automobiles, professional risk, marine, excess casualty, aviation, personal accident, commercial multi-peril, and professional indemnity and surety. Premiums are the primary source of revenues for these insurers. These companies invest a portion of premiums to meet their commitments to policyholders. Though the Fed paused rate hikes recently, it indicated increases in the year ahead. An improving rate environment is a boon for insurers, especially long-tail insurers.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Property and Casualty Insurance IndustryImproved pricing to help navigate claims: Catastrophes are a concern for insurers due to the high degree of losses incurred. Insurers implement price hikes to ensure uninterrupted claims payment. Global commercial insurance prices rose for 22 straight quarters, per Marsh Global Insurance Market Index. Better pricing will help insurers write higher premiums and address claims payment prudently. Per Deloitte Insights, trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving better than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023. Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase sixfold to $722 billion by 2030. China and North America should account for more than two-thirds of the global market, per the report. Analysts at Swiss Re Institute predict premium to grow 7.5% in 2023 and 5.5% in 2024.Catastrophe loss induces volatility in underwriting profits: The P&amp;C insurance industry is susceptible to catastrophe events, which drag down underwriting profits. The latest report published by CSU states that the 2023 hurricane season may have 15 named storms, including seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes. Catastrophic events weigh on the underwriting profitability of insurers. Nonetheless, analysts at Swiss Re Institute expects combined ratio to improve to 100% in 2023 and 98.5% in 2024. The first quarter of 2023 witnessed economic losses from catastrophes of about $63 billion, per a report from Aon. However, exposure growth, better pricing, prudent underwriting and favorable reserve development will help withstand the blow. Also, frequent occurrences of natural disasters should accelerate the policy renewal rate.Merger and acquisitions: Consolidation in the property and casualty industry is likely to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geography. Buying businesses along the same lines will also continue as players look to gain market share and grow in their niche areas. With a sturdy capital level, the industry is witnessing a number of mergers, acquisitions and consolidations.Increased adoption of technology: The industry is witnessing increased use of technology like blockchain, artificial intelligence, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation that expedite business operations and save cost. The industry has also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — creating competition for incumbent players. The focus of insurtech is mainly on the property and casualty insurance industry. Accelerated digitalization has become the need of the hour and insurers continue to invest heavily in technology to improve basis points, scale and efficiencies. As insurtechs use the latest technologies and concepts that the incumbents are just beginning to experiment with, there remains a huge market risk. Also, it poses cyber threats.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates poor prospects in the near term. The Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #171, which places it in the bottom 32% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Earnings estimates have decreased 12.4% quarter to date.Before we present a few property and casualty stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 and SectorThe Property and Casualty Insurance industry has outperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as its sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively risen 17.9% in a year compared with the Finance sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s increases of 8.7% and 15.7%, respectively.One-Year Price PerformanceCurrent ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), which is commonly used for valuing insurance stocks, the industry is currently trading at 1.44X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 5.96X and the sector’s 3.25X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.6X, as low as 0.97X and at the median of 1.39X.Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio (TTM)Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio (TTM)5 Property and Casualty Insurance Stocks to Keep an Eye onWe are recommending one Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, two Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks and two Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks from the P&amp;C Insurance industry.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.2%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.38%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 9.78%.Heading into today, shares of the oil refiner had gained 7.47% over the past month, outpacing the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 5.94% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.16% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Valero Energy as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be July 27, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Valero Energy to post earnings of $5.60 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 50.7%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $35.58 billion, down 31.11% from the year-ago period.VLO's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $22.19 per share and revenue of $143.07 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -23.9% and -18.89%, respectively.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Valero Energy should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

This compares with a 6.4% gain for mid-cap stocks via the S&amp;P MidCap 400 and 3.4% for small-cap stocks and the S&amp;P SmallCap 600.Of the 503 stocks in the S&amp;P 500, four have managed to double in 2023: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsApproximately 184 stocks in the index have double-digit returns in 2023. Conversely, 102 stocks have double-digit losses halfway through 2023. As of June 27, 286 of the index components are in positive territory for the year. That leaves 217 in negative territory. I’ve been tasked with recommending three large-cap stocks to buy that are on sale. I’ll be sure to select three of the 102 companies in the red in 2023.  Hopefully, I will have enough options to choose three names from three sectors. Here goes.    Estee Lauder (EL)An Estee Lauder retail store at Elements Shopping Mall in Hong Kong.Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.comEstee Lauder (NYSE:EL) has the worst performance of the three in 2023, down 23.7%. As a result of this correction, it is trading where it did in July 2020, precisely three years ago. In early June, Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh lowered his rating on EL stock from Outperform to Perform, but more importantly, removed his $250 price target. “We are downgrading EL shares to Perform from Outperform and removing our prior $250 PT,” StreetInsider reported. “Following the company’s report in early May, recent developments on the consumer and beauty fronts, and another leg down in shares, we spent time revisiting our investment views on EL. Based on our work, we now see a less favorable risk/reward scenario. … “In contrast to the past, EL is no longer a beat and raise story, in our view, which suggests increased risk to the company’s-premium-multiple.”That’s not good news for a company consistently delivering for its shareholders. It has an annualized total return of 15.94% over the past 15 years, 525 basis points higher than the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY). Story continuesDespite the downgrade, 21 of the 31 analysts that cover EL stock rate it as Overweight or an outright Buy, with a median target price of $240. Estee Lauder’s trailing 12-month free cash flow is $1.05 billion [cash flow]. That’s just 1.5% of its market cap. I consider anything below 4% to be expensive.  While I’m not suggesting that it’s about to return to its December 2021 all-time highs of around $365, I believe it can reach $250 by the end of calendar 2024. The analyst estimate for 2024 is $5.28 a share. That might not be as high as their earnings from 2022 and 2021, but it still would be one of the best annual EPS numbers in its history. Bank of America (BAC)The logo of Bank of America (BAC) in modern office building in Beverly Hills, CaliforniaSource: Tero Vesalainen/ShutterstockHow bad could owning Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock be if it is Berkshire Hathaway’s  (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) largest equity holding, accounting for 7.8% of the holding company’s $370 billion stock portfolio?I get the investor resistance to buying BAC. It’s down 0.4% over the past five years, more than 61 percentage points worse than the S&amp;P 500. Warren Buffett continues to hold BAC because he knows the bank will go on another heater at some point in the future, just as it did between March 2020 and January 2022, when it gained 150%, 47 percentage points better than the index. While you wait for the next heater to arrive, you’ll get paid 5.21% annually — the combination of dividend and buyback yields — easing the pain of a sometimes lethargic stock.There’s no question Buffett factors the shareholder yield into his decision to hold Bank of America. He’s on record supporting both dividends and share repurchases when used judiciously.       Speaking of Warren Buffett, Bank of America announced on June 27 that it would expand into nine new markets across four states by 2026. One of those markets is Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett lives. Other markets include Boise, Birmingham, New Orleans, and others.These markets already engage with the bank through its Merrill Lynch subsidiary, making them a natural fit for expansion. However, like a good retailer, it’s always repositioning its branch locations to best serve its customers efficiently and cost-effectively. As a result, it is closing two branches for everyone it opens. Digital is the future for Bank of America. Trading at 0.89x book value, it’s cheaper than it’s been since 2015.  Bath &amp; Body Works (BBWI)A Bath &amp; Bodyworks storefrontSource: ShutterstockThere is no question that Bath &amp; Body Works (NYSE:BBWI) greatly benefited from the pandemic and work-from-home policies. Americans were buying hand soap like there was no tomorrow–online and off. The downside is that when it returned to more normal buying patterns, investors fled the stock, moving on to the next great buying opportunity. BBWI stock is down more than 50% from its all-time high of $82 in November 2021. In Q1 2023, the company generated revenue of $1.40 billion, 4% lower than a year earlier but 61% higher than in Q1 2019, before the pandemic, when it was part of L Brands. It was separated from Victoria’s Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO) in August 2021. In terms of operating income in the first quarter, it earned $181 million, down from $280 million a year earlier but slightly ahead of its Q1 2019 operating profit of $155 million. The company is in the early stages of implementing cost-optimization initiatives that will get it back to 18% operating margins before the pandemic. With a PEG ratio of 1.09, I have no problem recommending Bath &amp; Body Works for the long haul. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

UDR is well-poised to benefit from a diversified portfolio, with a superior product mix of A/B quality properties in urban and suburban communities in both coastal and Sunbelt locations.The company’s efforts to diversify its portfolio with respect to geographies and price points limit its exposure to volatility and concentration risks, alongside assuring stable cash flows. Moreover, in recent quarters, UDR has been experiencing strong pricing power, as evidenced by blended lease rate growth. For 2023, management expects year-over-year same-store revenue growth (on a cash basis) of 5.5-7.5%. Our estimate for the same indicates a year-over-year rise of 5.9%.UDR is also leveraging technological investments and process enhancements to drive innovation and margin expansion. Its Next Generation Operating Platform allows the company to electronically interact with and provide service to residents and prospects throughout its diversified portfolio. These efforts are likely to give UDR a competitive edge over its peers. For 2023, management expects year-over-year same-store NOI growth (on a cash basis) of 6-8.5%. We estimate the same to increase 6.5% year over year.The company maintains a healthy balance sheet position with ample liquidity. It exited the first quarter of 2023 with $957.4 million of liquidity. UDR’s debt maturity schedule is well-laddered, with a weighted average year to maturity of 6.3 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.25%. Also, 88.4% of its NOI is unencumbered.Recently, UDR announced the formation of a $510 million joint venture with LaSalle, which will lead to the REIT receiving $250 million in cash proceeds. With enough financial flexibility, UDR is well-poised to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Solid dividend payouts are the biggest enticements for REIT investors, and UDR remains committed to that. It has increased its dividend five times in the last five years, and the five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 3.77%.Moreover, backed by healthy operating fundamentals, we expect the FFO as adjusted (FFOA) to improve 7.9% in 2023. Given our FFOA growth projections and UDR’s solid financial position, the latest dividend hike seems sustainable and well-covered by cash flow from operations. Such efforts boost investors’ confidence in the stock.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 12.7% in the past six months compared with its industry's increase of 6.5%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, the struggle to lure renters is likely to persist as supply volumes are expected to remain elevated in a number of its markets. With the ongoing construction standing at a high level, a sizeable number of apartment deliveries are expected in the upcoming period.Moreover, UDR faces stiff competition from other housing alternatives, such as rental apartments, condominiums and single-family homes. Such a competitive landscape limits the company’s ability to increase the rent, thereby restricting its growth momentum to some extent.Furthermore, a high-interest rate is a concern for UDR. Elevated rates imply high borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Our estimate for 2023 interest expenses indicates a year-over-year rise of 12.7%. Moreover, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Invitation Homes Inc. INVH and BRT Apartments Corp. BRT. While Invitation Homes currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), BRT Apartments sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Invitation Homes’ current-year FFO per share has been revised 1.1% north over the past month to $1.78.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BRT Apartments’ 2023 FFO per share has been revised 33.6% north in the past two months to $1.55.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

311,0630abee-e2d4-345c-b74b-a213cc093aee,VNO,2023-07-06,What In The World Is Going On At Vornado Realty?,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-going-vornado-realty-174905261.html,1688579345,STORY,['VNO'],"[Throughout 2022 and much of 2023, one of the worst performers in the universe of real estate investment trusts (REITs) has been the office subsector. Office REITs were just returning to close to their pre-COVID-19 levels in 2021 when they were smacked with inflation, Federal Reserve interest rate hikes and major city workforces that decided it was better to work from home than commute to an office every day.Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE: VNO) is a New York-based diversified REIT that owns and operates approximately 38 million square feet of commercial office buildings and some street retail establishments in New York, Chicago and San Francisco. About 88% of its portfolio’s net operating income (NOI) is derived from properties in New York City. It’s been trading on the New York Stock Exchange for over 60 years and has a market cap of $3.73 billion.Vornado Realty also owns and operates advertising signage in the Penn District and Times Square areas of New York City, including a six-story-high, 330-foot-wide high-resolution 4K LED sign on Broadway, the largest 4K LED sign in the world.Check out:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. With as little as $100, average investors are becoming landlords thanks to this Jeff Bezos-backed startup.Elon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin. Here's how to invest in the city's growth before he floods it with new tech workers.Vornado Realty also owns several other mixed-use buildings in New York City that contain offices, restaurants, fitness centers, outdoor gardens and lounges.Vornado Realty has a 32.4% interest in Alexander’s Inc. (NYSE: ALX), a REIT that owns six properties in the New York City metropolitan area.Vornado Realty’s tenants are largely higher quality and include Bloomberg, Bank of America Corp., Fidelity Investments, Capital One, Amazon.com Inc. and Aetna Inc. Its retail clients include Whole Foods Market, T-Mobile, Harry Winston Inc., Nike Inc., The Walt Disney Co. and Forever 21.Story continuesBefore the onset of COVID-19, Vornado Realty traded near $53. With the onset of the pandemic, shares plunged to $22, and since rebounding to $43 by June 2021, it has been on a downward spiral. Six weeks ago, it was trading at lows near $12, but as office REITs began to rebound, Vornado was able to slowly climb back up to about $15.Over the past six trading days, Vornado has taken off, recently closing near $18 per share. Perhaps it’s time to ask: What in the world is going on at Vornado Realty with all of this volatility?On June 30, various news wires reported that traders were circulating a rumor by Activist Insight that a large activist investor may be getting involved in Vornado Realty, either by trying to join the board of directors and calling for Vornado to explore a takeover or to take the company private.Vornado Realty, which closed on June 29 at $17.22, exploded on the news, climbing to $18.55 before settling the day at $18.14 — a gain of 5.34% to cap off a week in which it rose 24.85%.Some BackgroundOn April 27, Vornado Realty announced it was suspending its dividend payments on common shares until the end of 2023. That same day, Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Goldfarb downgraded Vornado Realty from Neutral to Underweight and lowered his price target from $16 to $11. But Vornado Realty also announced that its board was authorizing the repurchase of up to $200 million of Vornado common stock.On May 1, the dividend suspension became clearer as Vornado Realty announced first-quarter operating results, which disappointed the Street. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.60 per share was a 24% decline from the first quarter of 2022 and missed estimates by $0.02. First-quarter revenue of $445.92 was slightly higher than the first quarter of 2022 but missed the analyst estimates of $451.57.Two days later, Piper Sandler maintained its Underweight position on Vornado Realty but lowered the price target for the second time in four days, from $11 to $10. At the end of May, Morgan Stanley also maintained an Underweight position on Vornado Realty and dropped the price target from $13 to $12.But Vornado Realty has recently taken steps to improve its portfolio. It’s refurbishing two office buildings, Penn 1 and Penn 2, near Penn Station, hoping to increase workers’ travel frequency by improving the commuting and desirability of these offices. The renovations will allow commuters to walk from the train platforms into the buildings without having to go onto the street.Chairman Steven Roth recently noted, “I don’t think anyone understands the ‘Wow’ we are about to unveil.”The project will cost Vornado Realty $1.2 billion, but it expects the end results to increase rents. One renovated building has already lifted rents to $100 per square foot. The two buildings offer amenities such as a restaurant, food market, giant TV screens showing sports and access to health, fitness and medical services.The short interest on Vornado Realty is high at 12.52%, but the price jump this past week likely sent many of the short sellers scurrying to close their positions. Part of the reason for Vornado Realty’s big week is the sale of a 49.9% stake in 245 Park Ave. by SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG) because it impressed upon Wall Street that despite recent talk of work-from-home killing the office REITs, there is still considerable interest in owning office buildings in New York City.Vornado Realty’s rally may be unsustainable, but it seems apparent that the worst could be behind it. The share price near $18 is still only one-third of what it was a few years ago. Investors may want to look for a near-term pullback after last week’s big run-up in price.Looking for something more innovative? The rising cost of homeownership is driving up the demand for tiny homes, which is why more than 170,000 people are already on the waitlist for Boxabl's modular tiny house.

U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin decided in May that the airlines must end their Northeast Alliance, or NEA, which began in 2021, because it violates U.S. antitrust law.“Despite our deep conviction in the procompetitive benefits of the NEA, after much consideration, JetBlue has made the difficult decision not to appeal the court’s determination ... and has instead initiated the termination of the NEA, beginning a wind down process that will take place over the coming months,” New York-based JetBlue said in a statement. “We will now turn even more focus to our proposed combination with Spirit.”Shortly after JetBlue's announcement, American said it respects JetBlue’s decision ""to focus on its other antitrust and regulatory challenges,"" but it will press ahead with its own appeal in the case.A JetBlue Airbus A320 taxis to a gate after landing, Oct. 26, 2016, as an American Airlines jet is seen parked at its gate at Tampa International Airport in Tampa, Fla. (AP Photo/Chris O'Meara) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)JetBlue's decision to choose a purchase of Spirit over a geographically limited deal with American grew more likely in recent weeks, as JetBlue declined to say whether it would appeal the Northeast Alliance ruling.While the deal with American helped JetBlue grow in one region of the country, buying Spirit would let JetBlue grow quickly to nearly 10% of the nationwide air-travel market. That would make JetBlue much closer in size to United, Delta, Southwest — and American.Story continuesLast month, JetBlue and American asked Judge Sorokin to let them keep selling tickets on each other’s flights, an arrangement called code-sharing, and offering reciprocal frequent-flyer benefits. The judge has not ruled on the request, but those features of the NEA will now go away.Meanwhile, a trial has been scheduled for October in the Justice Department's lawsuit against the JetBlue-Spirit merger. The government argues that consumers will suffer if Spirit — the nation’s biggest discount airline — is eliminated.Savanthi Syth, an airline analyst for Raymond James &amp; Associates, said JetBlue’s withdrawal from the deal with American marginally improves its chances to buy Spirit. She said JetBlue could point to the decision — and a conditional agreement to sell Spirit's operation at LaGuardia Airport in New York — as signs that it is trying to ease concerns about reduced competition.]"

With 78% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 3.2% last week. One-year return to shareholders is currently 9.9% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Sherwin-Williams. View our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Sherwin-Williams?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Sherwin-Williams does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Sherwin-Williams' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Sherwin-Williams. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.2% of shares outstanding. The Sherwin-Williams Company 401(K) Plan is the second largest shareholder owning 7.6% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 6.5% of the company stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 22 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Sherwin-WilliamsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Sherwin-Williams Company in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$207m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 14% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Sherwin-Williams. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Sherwin-Williams better, we need to consider many other factors.

It is worth considering Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), which belongs to the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry.This mining company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 20.32%.For the last reported quarter, Freeport-McMoRan came out with earnings of $0.52 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.47 per share, representing a surprise of 10.64%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.40 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.52 per share, delivering a surprise of 30%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Freeport-McMoRan. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Freeport-McMoRan currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.74%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

The optimal mineral content, purities and impurities, and water source are the main noticeable things for kidney patients to choose their Kidney-friendly bottled water brands.

A significant factor for kidney patients is TDS level. MediNexus stated that kidney patients should drink water with a TDS level below 100.Water flows through the veins like a life-giving river for heart patients. A healthy heart is an aquifer for vitality. To keep your heart healthy and wealthy, mineral-enriched and contaminated-free bottled water is the nourishing and supporting key. According to a recent meta-data analysis by the National Library of Medicine, bottled water rich in magnesium is the best to control CHD (Coronary Heart Disease). The magnesium level should be 4 to 11 mg per Liter, and calcium should be 94 - 146 mg per Liter for the significant protective effect against cardiovascular problems. Water pH levels between 8-9 make it ionized, which is best for controlling stress and cholesterol for heart patients.This article is a comprehensive spotlight for the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the healthiest bottled water brands in 2023.

REGN have lost 13.3% in the last three months compared with the industry’s decline of 5.2%.The ride has been rough for this big biotech company of late. Last week, the FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) to the company’s biologics license application seeking approval for the 8 mg dose strength of aflibercept for the treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD), diabetic macular edema (DME) and diabetic retinopathy (DR).Regeneron has reported that the cause of the CRL is only an ongoing review of inspection findings at a third-party filler. The company reaffirmed that the CRL was not levied due to issues with the clinical efficacy or safety, trial design and labeling or drug substance manufacturing of aflibercept 8 mg. Furthermore, the company also stated that the FDA had not requested any additional clinical data or studies for the drug candidate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, the CRL still disappointed investors and shares fell. Regeneron is looking to bolster its portfolio with the approval of a higher dose of its blockbuster drug aflibercept. A regulatory application has also been submitted for treating wet AMD and DME in the European Union (EU) and Japan.We note that a 2 mg dose of aflibercept is already approved under the brand name Eylea for various ophthalmology indications.Eylea had been a consistent performer for Regeneron, but sales in the last two quarters were under pressure due to increasing competition from Roche’s RHHBY Vabysmo.In the first quarter, sales in the United States were $1.4 billion, down 6% year over year, primarily due to an increase in sales-related deductions.Hence, REGN is desperate to get aflibercept 8 mg approved to offset this loss.In January 2022, Roche won FDA approval for Vabysmo (faricimab-svoa) to treat wAMD and DME. Roche has designed Vabysmo to block pathways involving Ang-2 and VEGF-A. The European Commission also approved Vabysmo (faricimab) for these indications.Story continuesPlease note that Regeneron co-developed Eylea with the HealthCare unit of Bayer AG BAYRY. Regeneron records net product sales of Eylea in the United States and Bayer records net product sales of Eylea outside the United States. Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with sales of Eylea outside the United States.Meanwhile, Regeneron’s top line is being boosted by its share of profits/losses in connection with global sales of Dupixent. Its partner, Sanofi SNY, records global net product sales of Dupixent. Dupixent maintains its dominant position, driven by continued strong demand in the approved indications, atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis.Regeneron also records net product sales of Praluent in the United States and Sanofi records net product sales of Praluent outside the United States and pays the company a royalty on such sales.Regeneron is also looking to diversify in the lucrative oncology space with Libtayo (cemiplimab-rwlc), indicated in certain patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma, advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and advanced non-small cell lung cancer.Regeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

331,c3cb6f99-68d3-3566-81bc-eb72225bf602,UNP,2023-07-06,Is Union Pacific Corporation's (NYSE:UNP) ROE Of 56% Impressive?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/union-pacific-corporations-nyse-unp-120027086.html,1688644827,STORY,['UNP'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Union Pacific is:56% = US$7.0b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.56 in profit.Does Union Pacific Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Union Pacific has a higher ROE than the average (21%) in the Transportation industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Union Pacific's Debt And Its 56% Return On EquityUnion Pacific clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.70. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

Progesterone levels should be elevated several days after ovulation to allow implantation to occur, this is known as the implantation window. The Proov Confirm PdG test is intended for the detection of pregnanediol glucuronide (PdG, the major urine metabolite of progesterone) in urine and can be used as an aid for confirmation of ovulation.  It measures PdG levels in the urine over four key days — the ""implantation window"" — to help assess if ovulation was successful.""I created Proov after my own battle with infertility because I wanted other women to have more information and options than what I had at the time,"" said Proov founder and CEO, Amy Beckley, PhD. ""We are thrilled to collaborate with Quest to broaden access to Proov Confirm so even more women can access insights to help them realize their dream of raising a family.""Story continuesThe Proov Confirm home collection kit can be purchased now on questhealth.com for $29. It involves a urine test, similar to an at-home pregnancy test, with results visible to the eye in 5-10 minutes. In addition, users can also download the free Proov Insight app to receive reminders to test, gain help in interpreting results and personalize an action plan. The test may be appropriate for women who have been trying to conceive but without success.

A new Ameriprise Financial survey of financial advisors who work with high-net-worth clients estimated that about 2 out of 3 own a second home — and one-third of those who don’t already say they’re interested in acquiring one in the future.I’m a Real Estate Agent: Buy Real Estate in These 10 Cities To Be Rich in 10 YearsLearn: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Here’s a look at why second homes are a popular investment for the wealthy and why the average American might consider investing in a second home, as well.Why Wealthy Americans Own Second HomesMost high-net-worth individuals that own second homes purchased their home as a vacation residence rather than as a source of rental income, the Ameriprise Financial survey found.“The data uncovered that the vast majority (81%) of affluent clients primarily use second homes as a vacation destination or a place to get away from the stresses of everyday life,” said Marcy Keckler, senior vice president of financial advice strategy at Ameriprise Financial. “Other common reasons were better weather (49%), rental income (41%) and having a venue for gatherings (25%) with family and friends.”Read: 10 Places To Live Abroad So Cheap You Could Quit Your JobFinancial Benefits of Owning a Second HomeAlthough many wealthy Americans didn’t purchase their second homes for financial reasons, there are financial incentives for making this investment.“Historically, real estate has been a strong investment as the value of property is often higher at the time of a potential sale compared to the time of purchase,” Keckler said. “While there are exceptions to this, such as in the Great Recession, there can be strong value if you’re able to lock in your interest rate now and pay off the mortgage over time.”One of the common financial reasons for purchasing a second home among high-net-worth individuals is that they plan to eventually move into the home full-time during retirement — the survey found that 33% of high-net-worth clients that currently own a second home plan to make it their primary residence in the future.Story continues“There can be an advantage to purchasing a second home before you’re done working so that you can pay off the mortgage before you officially retire,” Keckler said. “This strategy can make it easier to weather future economic downturns by eliminating or reducing a significant monthly expense.”Why the Average American Might Consider Purchasing a Second HomeYou don’t have to be a member of the 1% to benefit from owning a second property. However, it depends on your individual circumstances to determine whether or not investing in a second home is a wise investment for you.“A financial advisor can help investors at all asset levels evaluate whether owning a second property is a good choice for them,” Keckler said. “Together, you can prioritize a second home in the context of your lifestyle and financial goals today and in retirement.”If you do want to purchase a second home, there are various ways to achieve it. The survey found that financial advisors most often recommend leveraging the second home as an investment property (46%) and utilizing securities-based lending solutions to finance a purchase without selling investments at an inopportune time (40%).“Seasoned financial advisors can also help investors account for the variances in cash flow needed to visit and maintain the property over time,” Keckler added.Reasons Buying a Second Home Might Not Be the Best Option for YouBuying a second home won’t always make financial sense.“There are two common reasons a second home may not be a good investment for people right now,” Keckler said. “(1) The economic environment is not ideal for a home purchase and (2) expenses to maintain a second property [may be more than you can afford].”Taking the Current Economic Environment Into AccountAmong the wealthy individuals who want to purchase a second home in the future, 42% said they are delaying this purchase.“The primary reason is the current economic environment,” Keckler said. “Half (51%) of advisors who say their clients want a second home are waiting for mortgage rates to decline, and 47% report clients are spending more time looking for a good deal on a property.”Expenses You Need To Be Prepared ForOwning a second home requires upkeep, and it’s important to not underestimate these expenses.“Most second homes are located in a separate city from investors’ primary homes, making the need to hire out more maintenance and repair services necessary,” Keckler said.If you’re interested in purchasing a second home, she recommends adding the following expenses to your budget:Home watch services: “If your property will be vacant for a portion of the year, hiring a home watch service may be necessary,” Keckler said. “Home watch services can routinely check on the property and evaluate potential damage following a severe weather event, such as a hurricane, tornado or wildfire. Adding liability insurance may also be needed to cover the potential risk of giving someone else access to your home.”Hazard insurance: “If you live in a seasonal area, evaluate whether you need additional insurance or maintenance to handle extreme weather conditions,” Keckler said. “For example, you may need flood insurance or be required to put up hurricane shutters annually if you live in a tropical place like Florida.”Furniture, utilities and essential expenses: “Plan for ongoing expenses like utilities, home insurance, essentials such as laundry detergent, brooms, dishes, etc., and one-time expenses like furniture.”Lifestyle expenses: “Many investors envision a specific way of living as part of their dream for owning a vacation home,” Keckler said. “Before you jump in on a property purchase, factor lifestyle expenses into your budget. For example, if your second home is on the water, you may desire to own kayaks, paddleboards, a boat or a dock.”Travel expenses: “Account for airfare, gas, hotel stays and other travel expenses you may incur to visit the property.”Rental expenses: “If you plan to rent out your home, earmark money to pay for cleaning expenses between visits and additional maintenance to replace broken or worn items frequently used by guests,” Keckler said. “Add liability insurance to cover potential damage that may be caused by a guest. And before you start renting, check with your homeowner association (HOA) if you have one to see if additional items apply before you host your first guest.”More From GOBankingRates22 Side Gigs That Can Make You Richer Than a Full-Time JobCan Millennials Afford To Retire If They Never Own a Home?3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement12 Steps To Finding a Business Idea That Will Make You RichThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Two-Thirds of Wealthy Americans Now Own a Second Home: Here’s Why Everyone Should Consider This Investment]"

In it, you'll also get to see how the pandemic impacted the world's major road networks and their revenues. If you want to skip the details, read 5 Most Profitable Toll Roads In The World.The most profitable toll roads in the world are defined by their toll cost, net income, operating expenses, and annual revenue. A toll, conceptually distinct from a tax, is a user fee that necessitates payment only when an individual utilizes the facility. The toll system focuses on the provision of superior and safer transportation arteries, overcoming congestion, and giving dependable trip durations, among other benefits. Although, there's a pervasive misunderstanding that our roads and bridges, once constructed, need no further spending. But this notion overlooks the substantial costs associated with maintenance, upgrades, and eventual replacement. The public often underestimates the financial implications associated with infrastructural sustainability. The capability of any state to bear the burden of renewing half-a-century-old interstates is questionable, at best, and the federal government's capacity to subsidize such efforts is similarly constrained. Hence, the fiscal sustenance for infrastructural development in the upcoming decades is predicated on either future toll revenues or fresh tax impositions. Moreover, Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) allows for the automated collection of toll payments from drivers, unlike the previous methods of manual toll collection. The system identifies the vehicle and deducts the toll fee from the driver's account, eliminating the need for cars to stop and manually pay a toll. ETC uses technologies like Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), dedicated short-range communications (DSRC), infrared, or video imaging technology to identify vehicles and complete the transaction. In this respect, Conduent Inc (NASDAQ:CNDT) is a major American company that provides transportation solutions like electronic toll collection. With a current market cap of $736 million, Conduent Inc (NASDAQ:CNDT) aims to help clients reduce congestion and time spent idling with its electronic tolling advances. Conduent Inc (NASDAQ:CNDT) also provides end-to-end electronic tolling systems designed to increase operational efficiencies at every turn.Story continuesCisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) is another leading networking company best known as a manufacturer and vendor of networking equipment. Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) has a market cap of $211.17 billion as of current and also provides software and offers related services. Improving public safety, increasing operational efficiency, and optimizing traffic management with connected roadways are the primary goals of Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO).Likewise, another company named Trimble Inc (NASDAQ:TRMB) provides advanced location-based solutions such as GPS systems to optimize transportation networks, including toll roads. Trimble Inc (NASDAQ:TRMB) has a current market cap of $12.972 billion and is focused on delivering smart transportation solutions to reduce out-of-route (OOR) miles and fuel costs across a fleet. Trimble Inc (NASDAQ:TRMB) aims to make transportation sustainable and systematized. The Pandemic Took A Toll On The Toll SystemThe 5,881 miles network, along with 331 toll facilities across the U.S., is an infrastructure asset for the nation. However, the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and a broad-spectrum curtailment of economic operations mandated by governmental directives gave a bow to transportation activity and, subsequently, its funding avenues. Revenue streams like motor fuel taxes plummeted, and transit farebox collections recorded an alarming contraction of 50 to 90 percent from their expected levels. According to WSP, the Washington State Department of Transportation, for instance, faced a projected monthly deficit of $100 million during the pandemic, a 38 percent shortfall from the year before. The Colorado Department of Transportation also faced a drop of $250 million in 2020. The impact was equally harrowing on the urban transit infrastructure, as exemplified by the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which confronts a projected loss of $800 million in sales tax revenue, $50 million in farebox revenue, and a further $25 million in express lanes revenue for the year 2020.In the aftermath of the initial shock, a considerable resurgence of pre-pandemic VMT (vehicle miles traveled) levels was noted in 2022 because of halted consumer travel demand. The proliferation of e-commerce and the intensified need for delivery services, in particular, contributed to the resurgence of commercial traffic, bolstering toll road usage.Which Is The Most Expensive Toll Road In The World?The Pennsylvania Turnpike, with an expanse of 360 miles, is the most expensive toll road in the world. Commercial vehicles, such as trucks, are particularly hard-hit, often incurring costs exceeding $200, depending on their route specifics. While passenger vehicles encounter lower rates, around $100, the Pennsylvania Turnpike still holds the record as the costliest toll road in the world. Several factors contribute to the high cost of tolls, i.e., the financial burden of constructing, maintaining, and operating these extensive road networks. Therefore, authorities aim to recover these expenditures through toll collection. Tolls also help manage traffic congestion and provide a funding mechanism for future infrastructure projects to maintain roadway quality.It's worth noting that the high toll rates on the Pennsylvania Turnpike are because of the infrastructural investment that the Turnpike represents. For instance, toll charges help fund the replacement of bridges, the addition of lanes, and other improvements aimed at ensuring the roadway meets modern safety standards and can handle high traffic volumes. That said, the U.S. has the highest toll revenue in the world because of the traffic volume. Other countries with hefty traffic inflow are way behind in terms of what they generate from toll roads each year. Which Country Has The Most Expensive Toll Roads?Research shows that Switzerland has the most expensive toll roads, as its average toll cost is $26.52, closely followed by Austria ($16.31). Unlike many countries that charge based on distance traveled or on a per-user basis, Switzerland mandates the acquisition of an annual 'vignette' or pass. This necessity applies to all motorists intending to traverse the country's expressways and motorways. The vignette places a significant initial financial burden on travelers and, in effect, increases the average toll cost per user.The country also imposes additional charges for specific sections of its tunneling system. As these stretches of tunnel, critical in navigating Switzerland's mountainous terrain, often have no feasible alternatives, road users face an inevitable added expense.However, in terms of annual revenue generated by toll roads, Switzerland is way behind the U.S. owing to its limited transportation needs. So if our parameter is annual revenue, the United States has the most expensive toll roads. But if individual toll prices are to be taken into account, Switzerland takes the lead with its costly tickets.15 Most Profitable Toll Roads In The World15 Most Profitable Toll Roads In The WorldOur Methodology We ranked the most profitable toll roads in the world according to their 2018 annual revenue in ascending order. The primary data sources for this study are IBTTA (International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association), ASECAP, S&amp;P Global, New York City Council Financial Division, and The News Daily, among others. Based on our research, we've discovered that 14 out of the 15 most profitable toll roads are all in the US.Based on our finding of major tolls' annual revenue, here are the most profitable toll roads in the world:15. Oklahoma Turnpike, USAnnual Revenue: $317 millionThe Oklahoma Turnpike system of toll roads spans approximately 605 miles throughout the Oklahoma state. Its extensive network connects urban centers and bolsters regional accessibility. Based on financial reports and calculated usage, the Turnpike's annual toll revenue is around $317 million, which reflects the high volume of vehicular traffic it accommodates.14. Delaware River–Turnpike Toll Bridge, USAnnual Revenue $335 million The Delaware River - Turnpike Toll Bridge contributes substantially to the regional economy, as it generates an estimated annual toll revenue of $335 million. This bridge covers an area of 6,751 feet and links Bristol, Pennsylvania, and Burlington Township, New Jersey. The heavily tolled bridge facilitates extensive vehicular traffic on the I-276 as its strategic location enhances inter-state commerce.13. Central Florida Expressway, USAnnual Revenue: $442 million The Central Florida Expressway Authority (CFX) oversees 125 miles of tolled expressways, integral to the region's transportation infrastructure. These roadways crisscross the four counties of Orange, Lake, Seminole, and Osceola. As a result, CFX smartly manages traffic demand and provides funding for roadway enhancements. Central Florida Expressway earns a substantial annual toll revenue of $442 million. 12. Express Toll Lanes (I-95), USAnnual Revenue: $724 millionThe I-95 Express Toll Lanes in Northern Virginia make an approximate revenue of $724 million, drawn from high traffic volume. When combined with dynamic pricing strategies that adjust tolls based on real-time traffic conditions to maintain free-flowing travel, I-95 proves to be one of the most profitable toll roads in the world. 11. Bay Area Bridge Tolls, USAnnual Revenue: $727 million The San Francisco Bay Area bridges, a network including seven state-owned toll bridges, collectively generate $727 million in annual revenue. The toll road's revenue represents a crucial funding source for the region's infrastructure, as it also includes the iconic Golden Gate Bridge. The income eventually funds maintenance and supports critical seismic retrofit projects.10. New York State Thruway, USAnnual Revenue: $736 millionThe New York State Thruway is the 496-mile artery that runs across the Empire State and generates $736 million in annual toll revenues. Examining the financial health, we note that Thruway's FY2021 operating revenues surpass those of FY2019, which demonstrates the steady demand for its use and the impact of astute rate increases. 9. Hardy Toll Road, USAnnual Revenue: $740 million The Hardy Toll Road is a 21.6-mile highway traversing from Interstate 45 (just below the Harris County line) to Interstate 610 in central Houston. Despite its relatively short length, the toll road makes $740 million in toll revenue per year, which makes it one of the most expensive highways.  8. Melbourne's CityLink Tollway, AustraliaAnnual Revenue: $780 millionMelbourne's CityLink tollway is an expansive network of toll roads that interconnects the Tullamarine, West Gate, and Monash Freeways. The toll road is 22 kilometers long and generates an estimated annual toll revenue of $780 million. Such a considerable revenue stream shows the operational sustainability of the tollway system and the country's busy commuter roads. Also, Sydney is now said to be one of the most tolled jurisdictions in the world.7. Dallas North Tollway, USAnnual Revenue: $841 million The Dallas North Tollway (DNT) is a 30.2 miles long road system running from Interstate 35E near downtown Dallas to U.S. Highway 380 in Frisco, Texas. The toll road's annual revenue is $841 million, and its strategic placement in a rapidly expanding urban corridor of North Texas has made it one of the most expensive highways. 6. Florida's Turnpike, USAnnual Revenue: $1 billionFlorida's Turnpike starts from north Miami and ends in Wildwood. Annually, this 312-mile-long toll road makes $1 billion in toll revenues. According to IBTTA, the Turnpike experienced a 13.7% rise in operating revenues in Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 compared to FY 2021. Interestingly, this growth also represents a 4.8% increase when contrasted with FY 2019 and subtly indicates a progressive recovery and stronger performance, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. Click to continue reading  5 Most Profitable Toll Roads In The World.Suggested ArticlesTop 15 Railroad Companies In The World20 Biggest Electric Vehicle Companies in the World15 Most Profitable Car Companies in the WorldDisclosure: None. 15 Most Profitable Toll Roads In The World is originally published on Insider Monkey. ]"

This is just great.- I like it.BRIAN SOZZI: This is great. Strong buy on my slim fit shirt. But let's get to some stock picks here. Real cool piece from our Seana Smith, our senior anchor in the afternoon and yours truly, now on our homepage looking at how the markets have really had a really strong first half, double digit gains led by in large part a lot of those big cap tech stocks, AI names.But if you look into this piece, there are a bunch of stocks that the market absolutely hated. First on the list, that is AT&amp;T. First half or year to date performance down 13%. Investors really concerned about slow collections, people paying their bills late because of economic troubles.But the people we have talked to are starting to warm up a little bit on AT&amp;T seeing perhaps a little bit of an economic turn in the back half of the year. The company's cash flow position may be improving a little. That might have people returning to AT&amp;T, which has had a really tough three or four years or so.Next stock, which a little bit surprising here guys, that is Occidental Petroleum, Warren Buffett's favorite stock. But more of this stock last year surprisingly, despite Buffett's big buys, shares down about 8% year to date because of the pullback in oil prices, which have been driven by fears about China demand and a US recession. But as you get some more OPEC supply cuts as was announced earlier this week, you could see oil prices start to turn higher. Perhaps that Buffett stock, Buffett's favorite stock starts to get a bid.Story continuesAnd the last but not the least, Cisco. Shares up 7% year to date. So it's been doing well. It just has relatively lagged the broader double digit gain in the S&amp;P 500. I think investors should go back to a name like Cisco. Look, the company, what they just reported a couple of months ago, they will see double digit sales. They will see a more streamlined organization after some layoffs, and maybe a lot better fundamentally-- just a better fundamental business than a lot of people expected.- This is really interesting. And you wrote about non-tech companies not faring well. CVS Health, another one you mentioned, is down 26% in this story. Were there other kind of weak spots right now that even within their own weakness, investors could perhaps look for a type of bounce back at all from what you were seeing in the data?BRIAN SOZZI: Well, I-- see, there are names. There are striking underperformers. You mentioned CVS Health, Walgreens also been an underperformer. Those stocks with gain-- with losses of over 20%, it's hard to warm up to them. Where is the catalyst for CVS, CVS Health? Maybe is it a really strong flu season in the fall? Unclear.So I don't think you want to go out there and try to throw darts at some of these names. You have to look for clear catalyst. Cisco, a clear catalyst, improving business model, improving cash flow at AT&amp;T. There has to be a reason to get involved with these names.Out of all of the three names we mentioned, Occidental Petroleum looks very intriguing. Again, these are not names I'm saying to buy. That's not what we do here at Yahoo Finance. But again, there is a fundamental setup to get excited by name-- with Occidental Petroleum. And if Buffett is throwing billions at it, who am I to argue with Warren Buffett?- Right. And is there a case for Occidental to pay for my child's college?[LAUGHTER]- And year's out. And year's out.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, if Warren Buffett-- Warren Buffett invest for eternity. So who are we to argue with Warren Buffett's track record. If he likes this stock, why shouldn't we?- Yeah, he's probably got Tony Stark's arc reactor somewhere.BRIAN SOZZI: I think he has the same shirt too as me.- He does, actually. We've seen that.BRIAN SOZZI: Slim fit.- He was probably wearing it at the annual shareholder meeting.- Sozzi.BRIAN SOZZI: It's good to see you guys. It's a real pleasure.- Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi joining us here today.]"
