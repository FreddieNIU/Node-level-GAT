But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. For example, the The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) share price is up 82% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 20% (not including dividends).So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Charles Schwab In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During three years of share price growth, Charles Schwab achieved compound earnings per share growth of 5.6% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 22% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Charles Schwab's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Charles Schwab the TSR over the last 3 years was 88%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Charles Schwab shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 1.6% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 25%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 14% for each year. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Charles Schwab better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Charles Schwab  you should be aware of.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

If you want to see more of the biggest IT companies in the world, go directly to 5 Biggest IT Companies in the World.According to market research firm Gartner, Information Technology or IT, ""is the common term for the entire spectrum of technologies for information processing, including software, hardware, communications technologies and related services.""Given the growth in the computer, smartphone, and internet industry over the past three decades, the IT sector is the biggest sector in the market today. In terms of one of the most popular ETFs that track the S&amp;P 500, the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO), the IT sector is largest sector by ETF weight with the sector accounting for 26.4% of the ETF as of 9/30/22. That compares to 15.1% in the healthcare sector and 11.7% in the consumer discretionary for the ETF, which are the second and third heaviest weight sectors.Many of the world's largest companies are also IT companies. Microsoft, for example makes software for computers to process information while Apple make smartphone hardware and software.IT Sector GrowthIn the last three decades, the IT sector has benefited from Moore's Law and the emergence of the internet. With Moore's law, semiconductors have become cheaper and smaller over time, allowing more people to afford computers and smartphones. With the emergence of the internet, more websites/apps have reached the scale needed to produce useful services for people with computers and smartphones. With more services, the internet, computers, and smartphones become more useful.Given the cycle, computer hardware companies have benefited from more demand and computer software companies have benefited from more potential customers. Similarly, smartphone companies have sold a lot more smartphones and internet/app companies have benefited from having more potential users.Although Moore's law was just a rule of thumb and is no longer possible due to physics, computers and smartphones are now cheap enough that most of the world can afford them. With future economic growth, potential subsidies, and satellite internet, it may be possible for anyone in the world to afford a computing device and connect to the internet if they choose to a decade or two from now.Story continuesIn addition to more users that could fuel more growth in the IT sector, the sector could also benefit from the emergence of new technologies.McKinsey writes, ""The emergence of cloud and 5G, for example, exponentially increases compute power and network speeds that can enable greater innovation. Developments in the metaverse of augmented and virtual reality open the doors to virtual R&amp;D via digital twins, for example, and immersive learning. Advances in AI, machine learning, and software 2.0 (machine-written code) bring a range of new services and products, from autonomous vehicles to connected homes, well within reach.""2022Given high inflation, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times in 2022 alone. As a result, the federal funds rate is now 3.75% to 4%, which is considered by many economists as 'restrictive' that could slow economic growth.Given that many analysts think the U.S central bank will raise rates further, the potential for a recession has increased substantially.Given the uncertainty, tech stocks have declined substantially and it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Biggest IT Companies in the World, we took the 15 largest companies by market capitalization in the IT sector from the S&amp;P 500 as of 11/5.15 Biggest IT Companies in the World15. salesforce.com, inc.

Specifically, we decided to study Qorvo's  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Qorvo How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Qorvo is:16% = US$686m ÷ US$4.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.16.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Qorvo's Earnings Growth And 16% ROEAt first glance, Qorvo seems to have a decent ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 18%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the impressive net income growth of 54% seen over the past five years by Qorvo. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Qorvo's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 26% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Qorvo's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Qorvo Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Given that Qorvo doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Qorvo's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

5,69f710fb-bae7-37a7-bb5a-e634c95bbf5e,TMO,2022-11-07,An Intrinsic Calculation For Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) Suggests It's 36% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-thermo-fisher-scientific-130039652.html,1667739639,STORY,['TMO'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.10bUS$9.78bUS$12.2bUS$13.9bUS$15.4bUS$16.6bUS$17.6bUS$18.5bUS$19.2bUS$19.9bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x1Est @ 14.05%Est @ 10.43%Est @ 7.9%Est @ 6.12%Est @ 4.88%Est @ 4.01%Est @ 3.4% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% US$7.6kUS$8.5kUS$10.0kUS$10.6kUS$11.0kUS$11.1kUS$11.0kUS$10.8kUS$10.5kUS$10.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$101bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$20b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.0%– 2.0%) = US$404bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$404b÷ ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$205bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$307b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$496, the company appears quite undervalued at a 36% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Thermo Fisher Scientific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.978. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Thermo Fisher Scientific, we've put together three additional aspects you should assess:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, long term Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. (NYSE:MMC) shareholders have enjoyed a 93% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 39% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 0.7% , including dividends .Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies managed to grow its earnings per share at 13% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 14% per year. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies' TSR for the last 5 years was 110%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 0.7% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 16% per year, is even more impressive. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies   you should know about.Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies is not the only stock insiders are buying.

If we get the California domino to fall, then Texas happens and Georgia, and then now we've got some scale to make it work.”A recent poll from the Public Policy Institute of California indicates that a majority of voters oppose neither proposition, potentially eliminating a crucial stepping stone in gambling expansion. The study found that among likely voters, 67% would vote no on Prop 27, 57% would vote no on Prop 26, and 48% of those likely voters think sports betting in general would be a “bad thing.”""It does not look good at all for either one,” Kathy Fairbanks, a spokesperson for the Yes on 26/No on 27 campaign, told Yahoo Finance.Tribal powerThe Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on sports betting in 2018, leaving the activity’s legality up to individual states.Since then, 35 states and Washington D.C. have legalized sports betting. The market has grown rapidly, with sports betting producing nearly $3.1 billion in Gross Gaming Revenue through the first half of this year, a 66% year-over-year increase, according to the American Gaming Association.Story continuesThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.At the same time, California’s strong denial of Proposition 27 is proving a clear statement: In some states, tribes have more power than publicly-traded companies.Tribes are the main gambling operators in California. Legislation largely limits other forms of gaming outside of card table operators and horse racing tracks.The stories of Proposition 26 and Proposition 27’s failures center around tribes defending that position while outside national gambling operators like FanDuel (PDYPY), DraftKings (DKNG), BetMGM (MGM), and Penn Entertainment (PENN) attempt to penetrate the market.Prop 26 was approved first and would allow tribes to offer sports gambling on their premises. The tribes argue this is a more responsible solution for sports gambling, in part because in-person wagering helps solidify the verification process and ensure minors aren’t gambling online.Prop 27 specifically allows for mobile sports gambling operations outside of tribal lands. This would open the state up for any operators and severely impact the tribe's current monopoly on traditional casino revenues.May 7, 2022; Louisville, KY; Vishal Singh and Andrew Gansalves check the betting sheets before the 148th running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs. Photo: Jamie Rhodes-USA TODAY SportsUnless the tribes, which believe they have the pulse of voter sentiment in California, join forces with the operators, a continued stalling in the state could hamper sports gambling expansion across the country. California, unlike some other states, requires this type of legalization to be passed at the polls not by state legislators.“We've got to defeat 27,” Fairbanks said, admitting that Prop 27 failing is more important than Prop 26 passing. “That is far and away our No.1 priority.”Prop 27 is 'one way to help states solve problems'Gambling operators in support of Prop 27 argue that the expected hundreds of million dollars in state tax revenue from their operations can be used towards funding “mental health treatment and solutions to homelessness and addiction.”“Especially entering a bear market where we'll probably be in deficits soon as a state, creating a safe and regulated online sports betting market marketplace is one way to help states solve problems,” Nathan Click, a spokesperson for the Yes on 27 campaign, told Yahoo Finance.Prop 27 would bring a 10% tax rate on sport bets placed, after subtracting other expenses. New York’s deal is far more lucrative, with a 51% tax rate, while Pennsylvania charges operators 36%.Opposers of Prop 27 say it’s more than just about the money. Prop 27 leveraged three tribes backing the legislation to run ad campaigns with statements such as “the act supports every California tribe.”More than 50 tribes and organizations across the state don’t support the legislation. Mark Macarro, chairman of the Pechanga tribe, told PlayCA in October that tribes aren’t interested in working with sportsbooks to legalize mobile sports gambling.Fans wait to enter stadium next to BetMGM sportsbook before the game between the Washington Nationals and the New York Mets at Nationals Park in DC on April 7, 2022. (Photo: Brad Mills-USA TODAY Sports)“To investors, California might be an opportunity, but to tribes it is home,"" Jacob Mejia, the Pechanga Band of Indians vice president for public affairs said. “It has always been home. It will always be home, and they must respect the single industry that has uplifted tens of thousands of Native Americans out of abject poverty. As long as that continues to be ignored, California will remain closed for sports betting. California is not a profit center.”Thus lies a potential conundrum for gambling operators after election day. DraftKings CEO Jason Robins has already called for another run at the ballots in 2024. He and other companies have already invested heavily in eventual legalization in California and seem intent on returning.While things can change, sentiment that tribes would join forces and change the narrative in 2024 doesn’t appear optimistic.""We have to respect the will of the voters,” Meija said. ""We have to discern what they're saying. To many of us they're confirming what we've said for years and that is voters don't support online sports betting. And so tribal leaders will have conversations about what is next and we'll see.”Josh is a reporter and producer for Yahoo Finance.Click here for politics news related to business and moneyRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 2.1%, which is fairly typical for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Microchip Technology Microchip Technology's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. However, prior to this announcement, Microchip Technology's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 33.5%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 27%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendMicrochip Technology Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.698 in 2012 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.31. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 6.5% over that duration. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Microchip Technology has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 20% per annum. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future.Microchip Technology Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 biggest insurance companies in the world.The global insurance industry is among the biggest industries in the world and is in fact among the five biggest industries in the world. The insurance industry has faced massive pressure from the global pandemic which enveloped the world in 2020 and has been aiming to recover since, with premiums declining to a growth rate of just 1.2% as compared to an average growth of 4% per year in the previous decade. Profits fell by around 15% when compared to the previous year with the Asia Pacific region being the worst-affected, declining by 36% with the rest of the world not faring much better.However, most governments went into recovery mode to stimulate their economy and 2021 ended up being a good year for most insurance companies according to a report by McKinsey &amp; Company in 2022 especially considering global insurance gross premiums. Despite the optimism, it is important to note that the insurance industry has been facing issues even before the pandemic. The industry has been facing headwinds on revenue growth driven by pricing pressures, slow organic demand and finally, low interest rates. The last issue should not be relevant any longer considering how interest rates have been at record-highs during 2022 and are expected to remain high in 2023 as governments attempt to combat record inflation even as threats of a recession loom.biggest insurance companies in the worldIakov Filimonov/Shutterstock.comAccording to a Deloitte report looking at insurance outlook for 2023, the industry currently stands at crossroads to long-term success. While most insurance companies have shown remarkable resilience not to mention flexibility in terms of global challenges such as the aforementioned pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there are still several additional challenges that the company will have to counter such as increasing inflation, the threat of a recession, climate change and of course, the ever-changing geopolitical scenario which affects global operations. To be able to combat these issues and concerns, insurance companies will have to continue building on what they've achieved in 2021 especially in terms of technological developments, with Deloitte suggesting that such companies shouldn't just engage in basic technological transition but should integrate with it fully and realize the benefits that such an integration would have to offer. Further improvements can be made in terms of in ""proactively anticipating and fulfilling distributor and policyholder expectations; and broaden their historical focus from risk and cost reduction to prioritize greater levels of experimentation and risk-taking that drives ongoing innovation, competitive differentiation, and profitable growth.""Story continuesThe Global Fortune 500 list has 40 insurance companies, one of the highest number of entries from any industry. The 15 biggest insurance companies in the world recorded close to $1.8 trillion in revenue, $98 billion in profits, and holder over $12.7 trillion in assets while providing employment to more than $2 million. To rank the biggest insurance companies in the world, we used Fortune 500 Global to determine the revenue, profits, assets and employees of each company.

One motorcyclist reportedly told Nikkei Asia he had to wait 20 minutes before getting any fuel.Gas stations in other big Vietnamese cities such as Hanoi, HCM City and the Mekong Delta have also shuttered, state-run Vietnam News Agency reported Monday. The government has ordered an official inspection of the closed businesses to check for violations of their trading agreements, the report said.Refinery issues and rising costs are hitting distributors, which has hampered deliveries and squeezed supplies, the Nikkei report said. There is a lack of refineries in the southern part of Vietnam, where Ho Chi Minh City is situated.Vietnam's minister for industry and trade, Nguyễn Hồng Diên, said Saturday that supply of gas is dwindling as Europe steps up it buying of petroleum products, the VNA reported. He cited the high rate of exchange for foreign currency needed to buy gas imports and a lack of access to that currency to make payments.At the same time, fuel distributors have had their profits squeezed in the face of government price controls, given they've been unable to pass on rising costs to the consumer, Nikkei Asia reported. That's minimized the incentive to supply gas stations.Oil prices have trended higher this year as sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine war squeeze supply, though they fell back after topping $120 as worries about demand emerged. But Brent crude, the international benchmark, has risen about 17% since its September low after OPEC+ slashed production quotas.Story continuesEuropean importers are competing more closely with Asian buyers for supplies of oil and oil products as they search for alternatives to deliveries from Russia. The European Union's embargo on seaborne Russian crude is scheduled to take effect in December, and the US is leading a separate effort to bring in a price cap on the country's oil exports.The problems at Vietnamese refineries kicked off at the start of the year, when production at the Nghi Son refinery in the north had to be cut, after it failed to obtain sufficient funds to import crude oil.In mid-October, the Vietnamese government urged two refineries to boost production to full capacity in order to meet domestic demand. In response, PetroVietnam, the nations largest state-run oil giant, has said it will increase the operation rate at its refinery from 107% to 109%, Nikkei Asia reportedVietnam isn't the only country struggling from tight supplies of fuel. The US is currently facing a diesel shortage, and experts have said a knock-on effect on truckers could eventually impact food deliveries.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

In addition, as more information about the company’s planned advertising-supported subscription tier has become available, investors began to express growing confidence in this tool to revitalize growth in 2023.”9.

PayPal has been one of the more high-profile victims of the market’s brutal ruthlessness over the past few months, and the stock fell by over two-thirds between its peak in July to the beginning of March this year. As we progressed PayPal through the Mayar Checklist Process, we identified a business with a leadership position in a structurally growing market.The company benefits from certain network effects and faces several competitive threats at the same time. As the business profited from the move to online retail during the pandemic, as well as from the stimulus cheques handed out in the US, the stock price soared to absurd levels. As so often happens, however, the market had overcorrected by February and this quarter was offering prospective shareholders prices that assumed essentially zero growth in the business. When life gives you irrational sellers, make lemonade!”8. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99    ServiceNow, Inc.

Alibaba operates shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall and owns 33% of Ant Group, which operates Alipay, China’s largest third-party online payment provider.

The company earns 80% gross margins and grows 20% organically. Plus, virtually all of its revenue is recurring. We see Salesforce as a great business that we’ve admired from afar for a long time. More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles.

It can be a challenging career for newcomers, and the early struggles to find success means only 4 in 10 new real estate professionals are confident about having a long-term career in real estate, according to Realtor.com®'s new #ThrivePastFive study.Only 4 in 10 new agents are confident about a long-term real estate careerRealtor.com® recently surveyed more than 2,000 agents to gain insights into their top challenges, what separates new and experienced agents, and what it takes to find success in those critical early years, and is translating it into insights specifically to help new agents succeed. Having a great mentor and cash reserves, as well as spending money on marketing, and making a full-time commitment during those first few years in real estate are vital for an agent's long-term success, according to the study results.There are many different reasons why so many decided on a real estate career, from it being a flexible career option for those seeking balance and autonomy, to the clients, the lifestyle it provides, and the income potential. Despite it being a hot career choice for many, real estate is not easy, and every agent faces different challenges, from a lack of knowledge and training at the start of a career to growing a client base and understanding how to effectively convert leads, and too many agents don't make it past year five.""In a shifting and ultra-competitive marketplace, with twice as many real estate agents than listings, having insights from experienced agents – 80% of whom are confident about making it long term as an agent – about what works best to power business growth has never been more valuable,"" said Donna August, vice president of B2B Marketing at Realtor.com®. ""With 25 years experience helping agents succeed, Realtor.com® is committed to developing tools and insights to help agents who are just starting out, so they can thrive and find success in their early years.""Story continuesLead generation a top pain point With home inventories rising but still near four-decade lows, it's no surprise that generating new client leads is hands down the top challenge today for agents of all experience levels. In fact, 60% of all agents cited finding new leads as a challenge, and the figure rose to 70% among new agents, those with less than two years experience.One of the most effective real estate lead generation strategies is to build a strong client network, which can take years for a new agent to grow. Only one-quarter of new agents reported having a network of buyers and sellers that they feel confident about, and nearly half (45%) said they struggle with developing a new client each week; comparatively, 70% of the most experienced agents surveyed – or those with 11+ years in real estate – are creating between one to four new client relationships each week.Other top lead generation challenges for agents of all experience levels are converting leads to clients, poor lead quality, competition from other local agents, high costs per lead, getting a lead too late, low connection rates and the time/effort in managing clients is too high. Beyond lead generation, new agents also struggle with non-serious buyers, whereas experienced agents' struggle with big listings sites that compete with them as brokers.Knowledge gaps that threaten successNewer agents wish they had more knowledge of lead gen, transaction processes and marketing, whereas experienced agents wish they knew more about social media marketing, online ad campaigns that convert and search engine optimization. When it comes to why many agents likely don't succeed, new agents perceive their struggles are because of a lack of training and startup cash, while the most experienced agents responded it was likely because new agents underestimate the time commitment and the learning curve.Contributing factors to a new agent's successWith so many challenges facing new agents, finding success can seem daunting, but a portion of survey respondents are finding it's absolutely possible. When looking at the characteristics of successful new agents – those who average more than 7 transactions a year – the majority, 9 in 10, work full-time. While most agents surveyed work full time (83%), as new agents work to establish themselves, they are three times more likely to work part time compared to their more experienced counterparts, 24% versus 8% for the most experienced agents. Nearly half (47%) spend more than $3,000 a year on marketing, and nearly 7 in 10 spend money on online leads every month. Two-thirds of successful new agents also had someone to mentor them, as well as had back up funds when they first started out in real estate.How much to spend on marketingThe old adage ""you've got to spend money to make money"" rings true for agent success; 64% of experienced agents spent $3,000 or more annually, whereas 70% of new agents spend less than $3,000 annually. Nearly 9 in 10 agents pay for marketing costs themselves. New agents are most likely to receive marketing support from their brokerage, 15% versus 9% for experienced agents. Only about one third of new agents spend $50 or more a month on internet leads, whereas experienced agents are most likely to spend between $50-499 a month on internet leads.Top channels to find the most successWith a greater network of past clients, more experienced agents find online marketing success with calling on past clients via email marketing. Newer agents tend to have more social media experience, which is likely why 82% of new agents rely on social media and lean into creating their own content. Among the different social platforms, Facebook is the platform of choice among survey participants, with 63% of all agents using it to generate leads, and Instagram comes in at a distant second at 28%.Despite the popularity of social media, new agents struggle to convert it into leads, and social media ranked No. 5 for lead gen after networking/referrals, email marketing, digital advertising, and internet leads. Among all agents, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat ranked among the social media sites for lowest lead gen (with less than 5% getting any leads from these sources).While 6 in 10 agents of all experience levels ranked the tried and true method of networking and word of mouth the highest for offline marketing channels, newer agents also ranked open houses (44%) as a top channel. For the most experienced agents, more than half (55%) call on past contacts/leads as a secondary offline marketing tactic, followed by direct mail and open houses.MethodologyFrom May 2022 – Aug 2022, Realtor.com® surveyed agents of various years of experience online.

Align grew its revenue at an impressive rate over the last 10-plus years, and the firm's clear aligners have permanently reshaped the orthodontics industry.Align now faces tough-to-compete against periods and a rapid slowdown in consumer spending. The company fell short of Q3 estimates in late October and its earnings outlook is fading alongside its stock price.Align BasicsAlign’s advanced clear aligner system has shaken up the orthodontics space over the last 20-plus years, as people look for viable alternatives to traditional metal braces. Align works hand-in-hand with dentists and orthodontists who help customers through the entire process from start to finish. ALGN’s success has inspired competitors to enter the market, including SmileDirectClub SDC.Align has helped doctors treat roughly 14 million patients with its Invisalign system, and it has expanded its reach to include wider digital services. On top of that, ALGN has slowly found success with younger customers who might have otherwise used traditional metal braces.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTougher Conditions AheadALGN posted 60% revenue growth in 2021 and it averaged 25% sales growth during the five-year stretch between FY16 and FY20. Align now faces very difficult to compete against periods of growth, including the covid rebound surge that saw customers spend big on everything from homes to straightening their teeth.Align missed our Zacks EPS estimates by 38% on October 26, as its revenue fell 12% YoY. Inflation, rising interest rates, currency headwinds, and other broad-based economic factors are tugging at ALGN’s expansion and margins. These factors are also making consumers far less willing to shell out money to straighten their teeth during these times of economic uncertainty.Align’s FY22 revenue is projected to fall roughly 5% YoY to $3.77 billion, based on Zacks estimates. The company’s adjusted earnings are expected to tumble 35% to $7.32 per share. ALGN’s consensus earnings estimates tumbled once again following its Q3 report to help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now.Story continuesBottom LineThe company’s Medical - Dental Supplies industry is in the bottom 17% of over 250 Zacks industries right now and ALGN lands an overall “D” VGM grade. Align stock, like many others, soared too high too fast during the post-lockdown surge. ALGN is now down around 75% from its 2021 peaks and closed regular trading Friday at $180.93 a share.Some investors might want to keep Align on their watchlists with it now trading at 26.2X forward earnings. This nearly matches the Medical Products space that it had previously traded at a huge premium to and comes in below its decade-long median.Still, Align shares have been prone to wild up-and-down moves even before Covid-19.

Julian Emanuel noted that “the Fed basically came out sounding more hawkish than expected” and that rising bond yields and a strong dollar led to a major sell-off in the “yield-sensitive growth sector”. Here are some comments from Julian Emanuel about what he sees for equities moving into 2023:“When you think about a year like this year, the ups, the downs, the rollercoasters, centered around these macro relationships… You’re likely to get a new bear market low at some point in the next six to twelve months. But given the volatility that we see and the potential for a cessation in the uptrend in yields, sometime as the Fed backs away-they will eventually back away- you could actually get a good market next year because history says that post-midterms tend to be very good for stocks among other reasons.”Julian Emanuel thinks that “there’s a bit more room in terms of value outperformance” and is bullish on “financials, healthcare, and energy”. Julian Emanuel said that “growth is arguably still overvalued relative to value” and that “as a long-term investor, you need to be prepared to buy down another 10% and then another 10% after that.”As of November 4, the S&amp;P 500 has dropped 22.3% year to date, the Nasdaq has shed 35% of its value since the beginning of the year, and the Dow is down 12.38% for the year.

As we progressed PayPal through the Mayar Checklist Process, we identified a business with a leadership position in a structurally growing market.The company benefits from certain network effects and faces several competitive threats at the same time. As the business profited from the move to online retail during the pandemic, as well as from the stimulus cheques handed out in the US, the stock price soared to absurd levels. As so often happens, however, the market had overcorrected by February and this quarter was offering prospective shareholders prices that assumed essentially zero growth in the business.

More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Suggested Articles:11 Best Mineral Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Momentum Stocks To Invest In11 Safe Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsDisclosure.

If you want to skip our analysis of the retail market, you can skip this article and head on to the 5 Largest Retailers in the US in 2022.The US retail market has continued to grow in recent years and was estimated to occupy a market size of $6.9 trillion in 2022. The country is home to some of the biggest retail stores in the world, with companies like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) operating in the country. In 2021, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions of the US FED spurred growth in sales of all the retail stores in the country as consumers continued to spend freely in a low-interest rate environment. However, the outlook for big retailers in 2022 has changed as the FED has continued to raise interest rates amidst high inflation. The high rates are expected to slow down the economy and deteriorate the consumer sentiment in the country as people are likely to focus on increasing their savings in the coming months.Contrary to the expectations, the consumer spending is still very robust. Nearly seventy percent of the US economy is consumer spending and the US GDP registered an annualized 2.6% growth during the third quarter. This is why many retail companies have seen an increase in their sales in the current year. However, discount retail stores like Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) and Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) are positive on their outlook for the coming quarters since they are also experiencing a rise in their store traffic as people started to search for discounted prices.Largest Retailers in the US in 2022Niloo / Shutterstock.comEven though the consumer price inflation still hovers around 8%, the overall retail sales has been growing at double digit rates during third quarter. Amazon.com (AMZN), one of the biggest retailers in the US, registered a topline growth rate of 15% during the third quarter, however, the online retail giant guided for an increase of only 5% for the fourth quarter. So, experts and companies are expecting a significant slowdown in retail spending, but we have yet to see this in the reported numbers.Story continuesOur MethodologyWe have picked the top 15 largest retailers in the United States and have ranked them from #15 to #1 in order of their market capitalization.15 Largest Retailers in the US in 202215.

The company has the biggest market share in the US, accounting for 20% of the sales in the country. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

(NASDAQ:WBA) stake during Q2, discussed its reasoning for stepping to the sidelines in the fund's Q1 2022 investor letter:We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm's US retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer's impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam's Club). However, given management's decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company's progress.11.

(NASDAQ:ROST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:Ross Stores is one of our longest-tenured holdings. Its profits have gyrated wildly since the beginning of the pandemic, first from store closures and shutdowns, then from the pent-up demand for apparel, and more recently, from the economic uncertainty. Adding to that, Ross is finding that consumers' spending trends in terms of mix and categories have been more difficult to predict than usual, resulting in some mismatches between its merchandise assortment and what shoppers want. This doesn't appear to be a Ross-specific issue, as other apparel retailers have reported similar problems. We attribute this to the unusual post-pandemic environment, and while we don't have a crystal ball as to when this will normalize, we believe it will.10. The Kroger Co.

Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG)Market Cap: $55.89 billionDollar General (NYSE:DG) is the largest retailer in the US in terms of store count operating over 18 thousand stores in 47 states across the United States. Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) primary customer base is low to middle-income families, with a majority of the company's customers earning less than $50,000/year. A majority of the firm's products (over 80%) are sold at prices under $5.The company reported revenue of $34.2 billion during the fiscal year 2022, an increase of 1.4% compared to $33.7 billion in the fiscal year 2021. The consumables category accounted for approximately 77% of the company's net sales.Here's what LRT Capital Management said about Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:Executive SummaryAt LRT Capital Management we are continuously searching the market for great investment opportunities. Our favorite finds are companies with moats and growth opportunities that justify a higher price than what the stock is trading for. One of our holdings (approximately 1.5% of our long exposure) is Dollar General (DG), so today, we wanted to tell you a bit about this great company.Company OverviewDollar General is a discount retailer with the largest brick-and-mortar presence in the United States by store count. The company's largest concentration of stores can be found in the southern, southwestern, midwestern, and eastern parts of the United States.10 Dollar General was founded in 1939 by J.L. Turner, who originally named the company ""J.L. Turner and Son, Wholesale"".  As the name suggests, the company began its life as a wholesaler, but quickly turned to a retailer of general store goods. By the early 1950s, the company had annual sales of $2 million per year,12 which is the equivalent of $22.95 million in 2021 dollars when adjusted for inflation.The first Dollar General store opened on June 01, 1955 in Springfield Kentucky. The simple concept was that no item in the store would cost more than one dollar. The company changed its name to Dollar General Corporation in 1968 when Dollar General became publicly traded. At the time of its initial public offering, the business generated more than $40 million in annual sales. The company's common stock was publicly traded from 1968 until July 2007, when it was taken private by KKR. The company went public again in November 2009, under the ticker DG.Today, Dollar General is an evolved, and phenomenal business with more room for growth. Annual sales reached a record $33.7 billion in fiscal year 2021 after consecutively growing the top line for many years. The company's main products are every-day necessities and consumables purchased by lower income consumers on tight budgets…7. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Market Cap: $72.67 billionTarget Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is the 7th largest retailer in the US, operating 1,938 stores in the country. The company offers a diverse range of products across various categories, including beauty, food and beverage, apparel and accessories, and home furnishings and décor. The company has an employee base of over 400 thousand people across 50 states in the United States.The company has been able to grow its sales significantly during the previous year, as it reported revenue of $104.6 billion in 2021, up 13% compared to $92.4 billion in 2020. Earlier in October, Target and Apple announced a collaboration under which Target will have more locations for Apple products, allowing consumers to buy more of the company's offerings during the holiday season.Ensemble Capital shared its stance on Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:Speaking on their earnings call, Target's CEO Brian Cornell said that spending on items such as kitchen appliances, TVs and outdoor furniture – products that consumers splurged on while stuck at home – has declined sharply. While they had expected there to be a shift from spending on goods to services as America exited pandemic lifestyles, they didn't anticipate the speed and magnitude of the shift. On the other hand, they saw luggage sales grow by an astounding 50%, along with robust growth in ""going out"" categories such as sunscreen, beauty products, and even toys as families return to hosting large birthday parties for their children. So, despite Target seeing increasing foot traffic and higher spending overall, they got caught with the wrong inventory relative to what customers wanted to buy. What this means for investors is that it is incorrect to say that the consumer is weak, despite weakness in some consumer facing companies. Rather what people are spending money on is changing rapidly, which is good or bad for a given company based on what they sell. Importantly, with demand shifting from items that were in short supply, there is good reason to think that inflation in these categories will moderate. Indeed, Target stated that their plan was to put their excess inventory on sale, something that consumers haven't seen a lot of over the past two years. But as demand for COVID era goods moderates, demand for activities such as travel has surged, driving up inflation in airline tickets and hotel rooms. This illustrates the way that the shock waves from the pandemic have scrambled the typical economic cycle such that even at a time when all signs point to the biggest summer travel season in history, investors are worried that we are headed into, or are already in, a recession.6. The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX)Market Cap: $82.14 billionThe TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) is a major off-price retailer of clothing, home goods, and other items operating 4,689 stores worldwide. It offers a broad range of branded items at discounted prices via its strategic purchases of inventory from its 21,000 suppliers worldwide. The store typically offers products at a discount in the range of 20%-60% compared to other retailers. The United States is a key geographic location for the company, and in the fiscal year 2022, the region contributed to 79% of the company's overall sales.The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) had a record growth in sales during the fiscal year 2022 as it reported sales of $48.5 billion, up 51% from $32.1 billion in 2021. However, the sales have started to normalize in the current year, and the company's net sales declined by 2% YoY in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.The ClearBridge Investments Large Cap Value Strategy liked the potential post-pandemic customer surge to The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX), as revealed in the fund's Q4 2021 investor letter:The pandemic created opportunities for us to be more aggressive in a variety of areas of the market. We were opportunistic throughout the year, for example, in positioning the portfolio to benefit from a flush consumer eager to return to spending and traveling. New positions included TJX, an off-brand retailer with a large presence in the US and Europe that should continue to benefit from the contraction of many traditional retailers, particularly as consumer spending resumes. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Largest Retailers in the US in 2022. Suggested Articles:15 Best Strong Buy Stocks to Invest In11 Best Advertising Stocks To Buy NowLargest Airlines in the World in 2022Disclosure: None. 15 Largest Retailers in the US in 2022 is originally published on Insider Monkey. ]"

Shareholders not resident in Sweden who wish to accept the Offer (as defined below) must make inquiries concerning applicable legislation and possible tax consequences. Shareholders should refer to the offer restrictions included in the section titled ""Important information"" at the end of this announcement and in the offer document, which has been published on the Offer website (www.smokefree-offer.com). Shareholders in the United States should also refer to the section entitled ""Special notice to shareholders in the United States"" at the end of this announcement.On May 11, 2022, Philip Morris Holland Holdings B.V.1 (""PMHH""), an affiliate of Philip Morris International Inc. (""PMI""), announced a recommended public offer to the shareholders of Swedish Match AB (""Swedish Match"") to tender all shares in Swedish Match2 to PMHH (the ""Offer""). On October 20, 2022, PMHH increased the price in the Offer from SEK 106 to SEK 116 in cash per share, and announced that it will not further increase the price in the Offer. On October 25, 2022, PMHH announced that it had received all necessary approvals from authorities and that this condition for completion of the Offer had been satisfied. PMHH has decided to waive the acceptance level condition3 and to complete the Offer and acquire all shares in Swedish Match that have been tendered in the Offer. PMHH has also decided to further extend the acceptance period until November 25, 2022, and informs the Swedish Match shareholders that the price in the Offer for shares tendered during the further extended acceptance period will be reduced to SEK 115.07 in cash per share due to the resolved dividend payment by Swedish Match of SEK 0.93 per share for shareholders of record as of November 14, 2022. Since the Offer is now unconditional, shareholders who have accepted the Offer, or will accept the Offer, have no right to withdraw acceptances.The shares tendered in the Offer at the end of the acceptance period (which expired on November 4, 2022) amount to in aggregate 1,255,945,656 shares in Swedish Match, corresponding to approximately 82.59 percent4 of the share capital and the voting rights in Swedish Match.Story continuesThe completion of the Offer has been conditional upon, inter alia, the Offer being accepted to such extent that PMHH becomes the owner of shares representing more than 90 percent of the total number of outstanding shares in Swedish Match (on a fully diluted basis)5 (the ""acceptance level condition""). As set forth in the offer document regarding the Offer made public on June 28, 2022 (the ""Offer Document""), and as further advertised in the press release issued by PMHH on October 28, 2022, PMHH had reserved the right to waive, in whole or in part, one or more of the conditions set out in the Offer Document (including, with respect to the acceptance level condition, in order to complete the Offer at a lower level of acceptance).PMHH has decided to waive the acceptance level condition and to complete the Offer. Accordingly, as all other conditions for completion of the Offer have been satisfied, the Offer is declared unconditional and PMHH will acquire all shares in Swedish Match that have been tendered in the Offer. Settlement for shares tendered in the Offer up to and including November 4, 2022, is expected to be initiated, around November 11, 2022.""We are pleased that 82.59% of Swedish Match shareholders, including - we believe - the top 10 shareholders, have tendered their shares at the best and final price of SEK 116 per share. This achievement of a high controlling stake should allow us to harness the strategic potential of the transaction, including anticipated revenue synergies,"" said Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer of PMI.""We are today extending the acceptance period until November 25 to allow those shareholders who have not tendered - including outstanding index funds - additional time to accept the offer, while waiving the 90% acceptance condition to provide certainty to those shareholders who have already tendered. Our objective is to delist the shares of Swedish Match from the stock market after reaching an ownership of more than 90%; we therefore encourage the remaining retail and other institutional shareholders to tender in the extended time.""""We look forward to welcoming Swedish Match’s employees and leading oral nicotine portfolio into the PMI family to create a global smoke-free champion, notably bringing IQOS and ZYN together in both the U.S. and international markets. We will be working together to create value as we accelerate towards our shared vision of a smoke-free future.""Following the expected settlement of the shares already tendered on November 11, 2022, PMI expects to consolidate Swedish Match’s results from this date onwards.To provide the remaining shareholders of Swedish Match who have not tendered their shares time to accept the Offer, the acceptance period will be further extended until November 25, 2022 at 17.00 (CET). Settlement for shares tendered in the Offer during the further extended acceptance period is expected to be initiated, around December 2, 2022. Due to the resolved dividend payment by Swedish Match of SEK 0.93 per share with record date for the payment on November 14, 2022, and expected date for payment through Euroclear Sweden on November 17, 2022, the price in the Offer for shares tendered during the further extended acceptance period will, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer6, be reduced accordingly to SEK 115.07 in cash per share.

PMHH will announce any extension of the acceptance period and/or postponement of the settlement date by a press release in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.Prior to the announcement of the Offer, neither PMHH nor any closely related companies or closely related parties owned or otherwise controlled any shares in Swedish Match or other financial instruments that give financial exposure to Swedish Match’s shares, nor has PMHH or any closely related companies or closely related parties acquired any shares in Swedish Match or other financial instruments that give financial exposure to Swedish Match’s shares outside the Offer. To the extent permissible under applicable law or regulations, PMHH and its affiliates may acquire, or take measures to acquire, shares in Swedish Match in other ways than through the Offer. Information about such acquisitions of shares, or measures to acquire shares, will be disclosed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.Since the Offer is now unconditional, shareholders who have accepted the Offer, or will accept the Offer, have no right to withdraw acceptances.PMHH will continue to strive towards an ownership in Swedish Match of more than 90 percent of the total number of shares in Swedish Match7 and thereafter initiate compulsory redemption of the remaining shares in Swedish Match under the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen (2005:551)), as well as promote a delisting of Swedish Match’s shares from Nasdaq Stockholm. For further information on the implications of PMHH’s ownership of less than 90 percent of the total number of registered shares in Swedish Match, PMHH refers shareholders of Swedish Match to the description thereof included in the section of the Offer Document entitled ""Important notice to shareholders in the United States of America"".For administrative questions regarding the Offer, please contact your bank or the nominee registered as holder of your shares.The information was submitted for publication on November 7, 2022 at 7.30 a.m. (CET).Information about the Offerwww.smokefree-offer.comImportant informationThis press release has been published in Swedish and English.

In the United States, the Offer will also be made in accordance with certain provisions of the United States federal securities laws, to the extent applicable, including Section 14(e) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Regulation 14E thereunder (""Regulation 14E""); provided that PMHH has requested, and the Division of Corporation Finance of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") has granted, relief exempting the Offer from certain requirements of Regulation 14E in order to align aspects of the Offer in which Swedish laws and market practice conflict with U.S. federal securities laws. Accordingly, the disclosure and procedures regarding the Offer, including with respect to withdrawal rights, the Offer timetable, notices of extensions, announcements of results, settlement procedures (including as regards to the time when payment of the consideration is rendered), and waivers of conditions, may be different from requirements or customary practices in relation to U.S. domestic tender offers. Holders of the shares of Swedish Match domiciled or resident in the United States (the ""U.S. Holders"") are encouraged to consult with their advisers regarding the Offer.Swedish Match’s financial statements and all financial information included herein, or any other documents relating to the Offer, have been or will be prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and may not be comparable to the financial statements or financial information of companies in the United States or other companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Offer is made to the U.S. Holders on the same terms and conditions as those made to all other shareholders of Swedish Match to whom the Offer is being made. Any information documents, including the offer document, are being disseminated to U.S. Holders on a basis comparable to the method pursuant to which such documents are provided to Swedish Match’s other shareholders.The U.S. Holders should consider that the price for the Offer is being paid in SEK and that no adjustment will be made based on any changes in the exchange rate.It may be difficult for U.S. Holders to enforce their rights and any claims they may have arising under the U.S. federal or U.S. state securities laws in connection with the Offer, since Swedish Match and PMHH are located in countries other than the United States, and some or all of their officers and directors may be residents of countries other than the United States. U.S. Holders may not be able to sue Swedish Match or PMHH or their respective officers or directors in a non-U.S. court for violations of U.S. securities laws. Further, it may be difficult to compel Swedish Match or PMHH and/or their respective affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction or judgment of a U.S. court.To the extent permissible under applicable law or regulations, and in reliance on relief granted by the SEC exempting the Offer from certain of the requirements of Rule 14e-5 under Regulation 14E, PMHH and its affiliates or its brokers and its brokers’ affiliates (acting as agents for PMHH or its affiliates, as applicable) may from time to time and during the pendency of the Offer, and other than pursuant to the Offer, directly or indirectly purchase or arrange to purchase shares of Swedish Match outside the United States (or securities that are convertible into, exchangeable for, or exercisable for such shares). These purchases may occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices, and information about such purchases will be disclosed by means of a press release or other means reasonably calculated to inform U.S. Holders of such information, to the extent required by applicable laws and regulations. In addition, affiliates to the financial advisers to PMHH may also engage in ordinary course trading activities in securities of Swedish Match, which may include purchases or arrangements to purchase such securities as long as such purchases or arrangements comply with applicable laws and regulations. Any information about such purchases will be announced in Swedish and in an English translation available to the U.S. Holders through relevant electronic media, including the Offer website at www.smokefree-offer.com, if, and to the extent, such announcement is required under applicable Swedish or U.S. law, rules, or regulations.The receipt of cash pursuant to the Offer by a U.S. Holder may be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and under applicable U.S. state and local, as well as foreign and other, tax laws. Each shareholder is urged to consult an independent professional adviser regarding the tax consequences of accepting the Offer. Neither PMHH nor any of its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, or agents or any other person acting on their behalf in connection with the Offer shall be responsible for any tax effects or liabilities resulting from acceptance of this Offer.NEITHER THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY U.S. STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED THE OFFER, MADE ANY COMMENT UPON THE MERITS OR FAIRNESS OF THE OFFER, MADE ANY COMMENT UPON THE ADEQUACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THIS PRESS RELEASE, OR MADE ANY COMMENT ON WHETHER THE CONTENT OF THIS PRESS RELEASE IS CORRECT OR COMPLETE. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE IN THE UNITED STATES.For the purposes of this press release, ""United States"" and ""U.S."" mean the United States of America, including its territories and possessions and all states of the United States of America and the District of Columbia.1A Dutch private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap), with corporate registration number 20028955 and corporate seat in Bergen op Zoom, the Netherlands, indirectly wholly owned by PMI.2Excluding any treasury shares held by Swedish Match (currently 4,285,810 shares).3As set forth in the Offer Document, PMHH had reserved the right to waive, in whole or in part, one or more of the conditions set out in the Offer Document (including, with respect to the acceptance level condition, in order to complete the Offer at a lower level of acceptance). PMHH further reminded shareholders in its press release issued on October 28, 2022, that it might (but was not obligated to) reduce the acceptance level condition after the expiration of the acceptance period, and complete the Offer at a lower level of acceptance. By announcing a waiver of the acceptance level condition today, PMHH is effectively reducing the acceptance level condition from 90 percent to 50.01 percent of the total number of registered shares in Swedish Match, such that the acceptance level condition for completion of the Offer has now been satisfied.4Excluding any treasury shares held by Swedish Match (currently 4,285,810 shares).5Excluding any treasury shares held by Swedish Match (currently 4,285,810 shares).6According to the terms and conditions of the Offer, as set out in the Offer Document, if prior to settlement of the Offer, Swedish Match (i) distributes dividends or (ii) in any other way distributes or transfers value to its shareholders, the consideration in the Offer will be reduced accordingly. As the payment of the dividend, expected on November 17, 2022, takes place before settlement of shares tendered in the Offer during the further extended acceptance period, expected around December 2, 2022, the SEK 0.93 dividend payment will not be received by PMHH, but by the shareholder registered as of the record date on November 14, 2022.7Excluding any treasury shares held by Swedish Match (currently 4,285,810 shares).View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221106005080/en/ContactsPhilip Morris InternationalFor additional information:Investor Relations: New York: +1 (917) 663 2233Lausanne: +41 (0)58 242 4666Email: InvestorRelations@pmi.comMedia Relations: David FraserLausanne: +41 (0)58 242 4500Email: David.Fraser@pmi.com]"

47,5b770630-e40b-38bc-b6ce-08176ac1fb05,PM,2022-11-07,Investment expert Anthony Saglimbene says value stocks in these shockproof sectors could help protect your portfolio,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investment-expert-anthony-saglimbene-says-161121222.html,1667751081,STORY,"['AMP', 'PM', 'CVS']","[Markets were volatile again last week, rocked by the Fed’s latest rate hike and the intention to keep rates high as it battles to curb inflation.For investors, the immediate result means trying to cope with an uncertain economic climate and an unpredictable market. Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist of the trillion-dollar asset manager Ameriprise, has cast his eye on the situation, and is ready with advice on how investors can succeed.First, Saglimbene believes that stocks have already priced in the strong chance of a recession next year, noting that the market is normally a leading indicator, by about five months. At the same time, he also believes that the near-term will offer solid opportunities for investors.“Typically, October, November, and December is the best three-month period for the market for the year. This is a typically strong period and after such a big drop in the market this year, it wouldn't surprise me if markets just rally through the rest of the year,” Saglimbene explained.Heading into 2023, however, Saglimbene sees valuations declining. In his view, a combination of high inflation and rising interest rates will put headwinds in the way of growth and profits. The proper course for investors, he says, is to move into value stocks in defensive sectors, such as healthcare and consumer staples sectors.We’ve followed that lead and found two stocks in the TipRanks database – one healthcare and one consumer staples – that could support Saglimbene’s thesis. So, let’s get into the details and see why they could make good additions to a portfolio right now.CVS Health Corporation (CVS)We’ll start in the healthcare sector, which Saglimbene has described as, “a better kind of tweener — it has some growth and has some defense,” and take a look at American healthcare giant CVS Health.The company provides pharmacy services, telehealth treatment, prescription coverage for chronic diseases, and health insurance products and related services. These are offered via several segments: Pharmacy Services, Retail or Long-Term Care, Health Care Benefits, and Corporate/Other. As of the end of last year, the company handled roughly 9,900 retail locations and 1,200 MinuteClinic spots, as well as LTC pharmacies, onsite pharmacies and online retail pharmacy websites. The fact this is an industry giant is evident from the employee count which numbers ~216,000.Story continuesIn a year in which stocks have been put through the wringer, CVS has mostly avoided the carnage. While the shares are down by 2% year-to-date, that is a far better look than the S&amp;P 500’s 21% decline.Strong earnings have helped support the stock and the company beat expectations when it reported Q3 results last week. Revenue rose by 10% year-over-year to of $81.2 billion, coming in $4.42 billion above the consensus estimate. On the bottom-line, adj. EPS of $2.09 beat the analysts’ $1.99 forecast. Even better, for the third time this year, the company raised its adj. EPS guidance for the full year from the range between $8.40 to $8.60 to between $8.55 to $8.65. Consensus had $8.55.Assessing the company’s prospects, J.P. Morgan’s Lisa Gill expects CVS to keep on delivering. The 5-star analyst writes, “We are positive on the company’s integrated healthcare model (retail pharmacy, PBM, health plan, specialty, retail clinics) and believe the company’s broad suite of services, strong clinical capabilities, and continuity of care across care settings position it well to benefit from changing market dynamics over the longer term, including new reimbursement models (the shift to value-based care) and the ‘retailization’ of healthcare. We view CVS as a partner of choice, which should lead to a greater share of spend across its various channels over time and positively contribute to overall enterprise profitability.”To this end, Gill has an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on the shares, backed by a $125 price target, suggesting 12-month upside of 25%. (To watch Gill’s track record, click here)None of Gill’s colleagues have an issue with her prognosis; the stock claims a unanimous 12 positive reviews which naturally all coalesce to a Strong Buy consensus rating. The forecast calls for one-year returns of 21%, considering the average price target stands at $120.08. (See CVS stock forecast on TipRanks)Philip Morris (PM)For the next stock on our list, we’ll look at Philip Morris, a leader in the tobacco industry. Its products are consumer staples – but it’s also the classic ‘sin stock,’ a defensive niche. This fits with Saglimbene’s comments on the sector: “Staples are really expensive, but I think tactically — which when we look at our window of time is six to 12 months — you want to be a little bit more defensive... Staples traditionally move higher when markets are coming down…” So let’s look under the hood of Philip Morris, and see just what defensive attributes it brings.To start with, the company has recognized the increasing social pressures against smoking, and how that will impact its chief product lines. Philip Morris is moving to adapt by shifting toward alternative products, especially those that are smokeless. These include vapes, heated tobacco lines, and even oral nicotine pouches. They are all marketed as safer, less smelly, and less intrusive than smoking – addressing many of the social issues against cigarettes – while at the same time helping customers to quit smoking – without losing them as customers.We can look at PM’s recent 3Q22 report to gauge how well the company is performing at these goals. For the third quarter, the adjusted EPS came in at $1.53, some distance ahead of the Street’s call for $1.36.Total revenue in Q3 was reported at $8.03 billion, higher than both Q1 and Q2 of this year – but slipping 1.1% y/y, although still coming in $730 million higher than the analysts’ prediction. The company finished the quarter with over $5.3 billion in cash, up from $4.5 billion in the year-ago period.Along with earnings, Philip Morris also announced that it had raised its quarterly dividend payment by 1.6%, or 2 cents, to $1.27 per share. This marked the third dividend increase in the last three years. At the new rate, the payment annualizes to $5.08 per common share and gives a yield of 5.7%. That yield is more than 2.5x higher than the market average, and about 2/3 the current rate of inflation. These attributes, combined with a 14-year history of reliable payments, make the dividend an attractive defensive feature for investors seeking to protect their portfolios.Philip Morris is part of Morgan Stanley analyst Pamela Kaufman’s coverage universe, and she takes a bullish stand on the stock. Kaufman is especially impressed by the company’s move into smokeless heated tobacco products, such as the upcoming new iQOS line. She writes, “[We] expect PM to launch IQOS in the US in spring 2024. PM's impending entry into the US offers an attractive growth opportunity as the US is one of the world's largest tobacco profit pools (~$20 billion in 2021), with ~31 million smokers. IQOS will benefit from PM's early mover advantage in the heat-not-burn (HNB) category in the US, its reduced risk tobacco product designation (MRTP) from the FDA, and PM's extensive marketing learnings from other markets. IQOS has a demonstrated track record of success across markets, generating $9 billion in revenue in 2021.”In-line with her outlook, Kaufman rates PM shares as Overweight (Buy), backed by a $109 price target to indicate the stock has room for 21% growth in the coming year. (To watch Kaufman’s track record, click here.)With 4 Buy ratings set recently, against 2 Holds, Philip Morris gets a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus. The $105 average price target suggests a 17% one-year gain from the current trading price of $89.98.

Bloomberg News reported in July, that Elliott was building a stake but was opposed to a PMI deal at the original offer of 106 Swedish crowns ($9.73) per share.PMI launched its bid for the maker of tobacco and oral nicotine products in May before raising the offer to 116 crowns last month after Swedish Match shares consistently traded above the original bid price.United States-based PMI does not currently trade in its home market, but Swedish Match has been expanding fast in America.Swedish Match controls about half the world's market for snus - a moist, smoke-free snuff - but one of its fastest-growing products is its tobacco-free “ZYN” nicotine pouches.($1 = 10.8952 Swedish crowns)(Reporting by Maria Ponnezhath in Bengaluru and Marie Mannes in GdanskEditing by David Goodman)]"

The move is part of a larger plan by the central bank to push up borrowing costs in a bid to cool the economy and bring down price inflation. The latest increases have brought the benchmark lending rate to 4%, further battering growth stocks at the market as investors flee from riskier bets towards safe havens in the value sector. Some of the top growth stocks that have seen their share price decline as inflation heats up and rates rise include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). These stocks have declined by 39%, 34%, and 45% year-to-date respectively. However, the underlying fundamentals of the firms remain solid, creating attractive valuations in the growth domain that shrewd investors can take advantage of to reap the rewards as the market recovers from the present crisis. Our MethodologyWe scanned the database of 895 hedge funds maintained by Insider Monkey and picked the 14 most popular growth stocks among these elite funds.14 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsSource:unsplashBest Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds14.

We had 16 investments detracting over 100bps each with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our second largest detractor, costing the Fund 254bps.NVIDIA’s stock was hit even harder, down 44.4%, impacted by concerns over the health of the consumer, dramatic declines in crypto, and COVID-related lockdowns in China.

In addition, as more information about the company’s planned advertising-supported subscription tier has become available, investors began to express growing confidence in this tool to revitalize growth in 2023.”9.

PayPal has been one of the more high-profile victims of the market’s brutal ruthlessness over the past few months, and the stock fell by over two-thirds between its peak in July to the beginning of March this year. As we progressed PayPal through the Mayar Checklist Process, we identified a business with a leadership position in a structurally growing market.The company benefits from certain network effects and faces several competitive threats at the same time. As the business profited from the move to online retail during the pandemic, as well as from the stimulus cheques handed out in the US, the stock price soared to absurd levels. As so often happens, however, the market had overcorrected by February and this quarter was offering prospective shareholders prices that assumed essentially zero growth in the business. When life gives you irrational sellers, make lemonade!”8. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99    ServiceNow, Inc.

Alibaba operates shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall and owns 33% of Ant Group, which operates Alipay, China’s largest third-party online payment provider. Shares of Alibaba rose during the quarter, driven by an increasing focus on improving capital allocation, an improving regulatory environment, and government stimulus targeting Chinese consumers.

(NYSE:CRM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has become a dominant global player in sales, customer service, commerce and marketing software over the past 20 years. The company earns 80% gross margins and grows 20% organically. Plus, virtually all of its revenue is recurring. We see Salesforce as a great business that we’ve admired from afar for a long time. More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Suggested Articles:11 Best Mineral Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Momentum Stocks To Invest In11 Safe Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsDisclosure.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Netflix’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for Netflix What's The Opportunity In Netflix?Great news for investors – Netflix is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $353.19, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that Netflix’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Netflix?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Netflix's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 46%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since NFLX is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on NFLX for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy NFLX. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

If you want to skip our analysis of the retail market, you can skip this article and head on to the 5 Largest Retailers in the US in 2022.The US retail market has continued to grow in recent years and was estimated to occupy a market size of $6.9 trillion in 2022. The country is home to some of the biggest retail stores in the world, with companies like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) operating in the country. In 2021, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions of the US FED spurred growth in sales of all the retail stores in the country as consumers continued to spend freely in a low-interest rate environment. However, the outlook for big retailers in 2022 has changed as the FED has continued to raise interest rates amidst high inflation. The high rates are expected to slow down the economy and deteriorate the consumer sentiment in the country as people are likely to focus on increasing their savings in the coming months.Contrary to the expectations, the consumer spending is still very robust. Nearly seventy percent of the US economy is consumer spending and the US GDP registered an annualized 2.6% growth during the third quarter. This is why many retail companies have seen an increase in their sales in the current year. However, discount retail stores like Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) and Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) are positive on their outlook for the coming quarters since they are also experiencing a rise in their store traffic as people started to search for discounted prices.Largest Retailers in the US in 2022Niloo / Shutterstock.comEven though the consumer price inflation still hovers around 8%, the overall retail sales has been growing at double digit rates during third quarter.

The company has the biggest market share in the US, accounting for 20% of the sales in the country. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) has been taking several initiatives to improve efficiencies and embarked on a cost-saving program in 2015. The company initially set out to save $1 billion in a 3-year period, but in May 2022, the company revised its target to $3.5 billion in annual savings by the end of fiscal 2024.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) generated an EPS of $5.01 in the fiscal year 2022, recording a substantial increase of 117.6% compared to $2.30 in the fiscal year 2021.

(NASDAQ:WBA) stake during Q2, discussed its reasoning for stepping to the sidelines in the fund's Q1 2022 investor letter:We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm's US retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer's impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam's Club). However, given management's decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company's progress.11. Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST)Market Cap: $32.28 billionRoss Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) is a leading fashion and clothing retailer in the US, running over 1,700 stores. The company provides a wide range of branded products at discounted prices. The company's low-price products target the middle-class population. Ross Stores, Inc.

The company is the second-biggest price retailer in the US, as per Bank of America Global Research. Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) revenue saw a substantial growth of 51% YoY as it posted a revenue of $18.9 billion during the fiscal year 2022.Here is what Madison Mid Cap Fund has to say about Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:Ross Stores is one of our longest-tenured holdings. Its profits have gyrated wildly since the beginning of the pandemic, first from store closures and shutdowns, then from the pent-up demand for apparel, and more recently, from the economic uncertainty. Adding to that, Ross is finding that consumers' spending trends in terms of mix and categories have been more difficult to predict than usual, resulting in some mismatches between its merchandise assortment and what shoppers want. This doesn't appear to be a Ross-specific issue, as other apparel retailers have reported similar problems. We attribute this to the unusual post-pandemic environment, and while we don't have a crystal ball as to when this will normalize, we believe it will.10. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)Market Cap: $32.97 billionThe Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is considered the second-biggest grocer in the United States in terms of market share. The company operates 2,726 supermarkets under several names in the country.

The company has a strong operational history and has been in existence since 1883.Earlier in October, The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) announced a merger deal with Albertsons.

However, the company is poised for further growth as consumers have come under pressure from persistent inflation and are now heading towards discount stores. A new report from Placer.ai stated that the traffic on dollar stores is set to increase as consumers start to adopt a more ""value-focused mindset"".Here is what Madison Funds specifically said about Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) reported strong results on the heels of rolling out the $1.25 price point initiative at all Dollar Tree stores nationwide.

The consumables category accounted for approximately 77% of the company's net sales.Here's what LRT Capital Management said about Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:Executive SummaryAt LRT Capital Management we are continuously searching the market for great investment opportunities. Our favorite finds are companies with moats and growth opportunities that justify a higher price than what the stock is trading for. One of our holdings (approximately 1.5% of our long exposure) is Dollar General (DG), so today, we wanted to tell you a bit about this great company.Company OverviewDollar General is a discount retailer with the largest brick-and-mortar presence in the United States by store count. The company's largest concentration of stores can be found in the southern, southwestern, midwestern, and eastern parts of the United States.10 Dollar General was founded in 1939 by J.L. Turner, who originally named the company ""J.L. Turner and Son, Wholesale"".  As the name suggests, the company began its life as a wholesaler, but quickly turned to a retailer of general store goods. By the early 1950s, the company had annual sales of $2 million per year,12 which is the equivalent of $22.95 million in 2021 dollars when adjusted for inflation.The first Dollar General store opened on June 01, 1955 in Springfield Kentucky. The simple concept was that no item in the store would cost more than one dollar. The company changed its name to Dollar General Corporation in 1968 when Dollar General became publicly traded. At the time of its initial public offering, the business generated more than $40 million in annual sales. The company's common stock was publicly traded from 1968 until July 2007, when it was taken private by KKR. The company went public again in November 2009, under the ticker DG.Today, Dollar General is an evolved, and phenomenal business with more room for growth. Annual sales reached a record $33.7 billion in fiscal year 2021 after consecutively growing the top line for many years. The company's main products are every-day necessities and consumables purchased by lower income consumers on tight budgets…7. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Market Cap: $72.67 billionTarget Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is the 7th largest retailer in the US, operating 1,938 stores in the country. The company offers a diverse range of products across various categories, including beauty, food and beverage, apparel and accessories, and home furnishings and décor. The company has an employee base of over 400 thousand people across 50 states in the United States.The company has been able to grow its sales significantly during the previous year, as it reported revenue of $104.6 billion in 2021, up 13% compared to $92.4 billion in 2020. Earlier in October, Target and Apple announced a collaboration under which Target will have more locations for Apple products, allowing consumers to buy more of the company's offerings during the holiday season.Ensemble Capital shared its stance on Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:Speaking on their earnings call, Target's CEO Brian Cornell said that spending on items such as kitchen appliances, TVs and outdoor furniture – products that consumers splurged on while stuck at home – has declined sharply. While they had expected there to be a shift from spending on goods to services as America exited pandemic lifestyles, they didn't anticipate the speed and magnitude of the shift. On the other hand, they saw luggage sales grow by an astounding 50%, along with robust growth in ""going out"" categories such as sunscreen, beauty products, and even toys as families return to hosting large birthday parties for their children. So, despite Target seeing increasing foot traffic and higher spending overall, they got caught with the wrong inventory relative to what customers wanted to buy. What this means for investors is that it is incorrect to say that the consumer is weak, despite weakness in some consumer facing companies. Rather what people are spending money on is changing rapidly, which is good or bad for a given company based on what they sell. Importantly, with demand shifting from items that were in short supply, there is good reason to think that inflation in these categories will moderate. Indeed, Target stated that their plan was to put their excess inventory on sale, something that consumers haven't seen a lot of over the past two years. But as demand for COVID era goods moderates, demand for activities such as travel has surged, driving up inflation in airline tickets and hotel rooms. This illustrates the way that the shock waves from the pandemic have scrambled the typical economic cycle such that even at a time when all signs point to the biggest summer travel season in history, investors are worried that we are headed into, or are already in, a recession.6. The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX)Market Cap: $82.14 billionThe TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) is a major off-price retailer of clothing, home goods, and other items operating 4,689 stores worldwide. It offers a broad range of branded items at discounted prices via its strategic purchases of inventory from its 21,000 suppliers worldwide. The store typically offers products at a discount in the range of 20%-60% compared to other retailers. The United States is a key geographic location for the company, and in the fiscal year 2022, the region contributed to 79% of the company's overall sales.The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) had a record growth in sales during the fiscal year 2022 as it reported sales of $48.5 billion, up 51% from $32.1 billion in 2021. However, the sales have started to normalize in the current year, and the company's net sales declined by 2% YoY in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.The ClearBridge Investments Large Cap Value Strategy liked the potential post-pandemic customer surge to The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX), as revealed in the fund's Q4 2021 investor letter:The pandemic created opportunities for us to be more aggressive in a variety of areas of the market. We were opportunistic throughout the year, for example, in positioning the portfolio to benefit from a flush consumer eager to return to spending and traveling. New positions included TJX, an off-brand retailer with a large presence in the US and Europe that should continue to benefit from the contraction of many traditional retailers, particularly as consumer spending resumes. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Largest Retailers in the US in 2022. Suggested Articles:15 Best Strong Buy Stocks to Invest In11 Best Advertising Stocks To Buy NowLargest Airlines in the World in 2022Disclosure: None. 15 Largest Retailers in the US in 2022 is originally published on Insider Monkey. ]"

The study was designed to assess safety, tolerability and optimal dose of olpasiran in adults with established ASCVD to reduce Lp(a).1 These data were presented during the Nov. 6 Late-Breaking Science Session of the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2022 in Chicago, Illinois, and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine.OCEAN(a)-DOSE is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-finding study of olpasiran in 281 patients with established ASCVD and Lp(a) levels &gt;150 nmol/L. Patients were randomized to one of four doses of olpasiran (10 mg Q12 weeks, 75 mg Q12 weeks, 225 mg Q12 weeks or 225 mg Q24 weeks) or placebo, given subcutaneously.2 Across cohorts, the median baseline Lp(a) concentration was 260.3 nmol/L. Patients who received 75 mg or higher every 12 weeks had a 95% or greater reduction in Lp(a) compared to placebo at week 36. At these doses (75 mg or higher), more than 98% of patients achieved an Lp(a) level of 125 nmol/L or less at week 36.2 Overall, the rates of adverse events were similar in the olpasiran and placebo arms. The most common treatment-related adverse events were injection site reactions, primarily pain.2""Epidemiological research has shown us that Lp(a) is an independent risk factor and is primarily genetically determined. It has been estimated that up to 20% of people worldwide are living with elevated levels, which are linked to a higher risk for heart disease, stroke and the potential significant burden on patients with cardiovascular disease,""5 said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""Our Phase 2 data for olpasiran presented at AHA continue to demonstrate a significant reduction in Lp(a) and provide strong evidence supporting its potential for patients with ASCVD. We look forward to studying this treatment further in Phase 3 clinical trials, which we expect to begin enrolling in December 2022.""Story continuesAt week 36, Lp(a) increased by a mean of 3.6% in the placebo arm, whereas there were substantial reductions of Lp(a) levels in all of the olpasiran arms. Placebo-adjusted mean percent reductions were 70.5% for 10 mg every 12 weeks, 97.4% for 75 mg every 12 weeks, 101.1% for 225 mg every 12 weeks and 100.5% for 225 mg every 24 weeks .2""Currently, there are no approved medicines that can consistently achieve marked or sustained reductions in Lp(a) concentration,"" said Michelle L. O'Donoghue M.D., MPH, Senior Investigator, TIMI Study Group at Brigham and Women's Hospital and OCEAN(a)-DOSE trial Global Principal Investigator. ""RNA interference with olpasiran is a promising treatment approach that led to a profound and sustained reduction in Lp(a) concentration in this Phase 2 study.""About Lp(a)Lp(a) is genetically determined3-5 and a presumed independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although an agreed upon threshold for elevated Lp(a) is not firmly established, approximately 20% of adults have Lp(a) &gt;125 nmol/L (or approximately 50 mg/dL).3 Evidence has emerged from pathophysiological, epidemiologic, and genetic studies on the potential role of elevated Lp(a) in contributing to myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease.5About OCEAN(a)           The OCEAN(a) (Olpasiran Trials of Cardiovascular Events And LipoproteiN(a) Reduction) clinical program for Amgen's investigational olpasiran is designed to treat patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and elevated Lp(a) levels to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.The OCEAN(a)-DOSE trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-finding Phase 2 study in 281 patients with ASCVD and Lp(a) &gt;150 nmol/L. Patients were randomly assigned to one of four active subcutaneous doses of olpasiran (10 mg Q12 weeks, 75 mg Q12 weeks, 225 mg Q12 weeks or 225 mg Q24 weeks) or placebo. The primary endpoint is percent change from baseline in Lp(a) at 36 weeks. A secondary endpoint is percent change from baseline in Lp(a) at 48 weeks.A prespecified exploratory endpoint was the percent change in Lp(a) from baseline at each scheduled visit for the 225 mg Q24 week dose group.About AmgenAmgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics.

Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.The scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates.

They would have to rise by more than 200,000 bags though,"" said a Europe-based trader at a global trade house.Certified stocks are a strong driver of ICE coffee prices because, unlike other factors, they are visible to all on a daily basis and many algorithmic funds are pre-programmed to buy when they fall and sell when they rise.The coffee crop in Brazil, responsible for around 40% of global arabica production, could grow by as much as 10% in 2023 due to favourable weather in recent months, analysts say.Story continuesThat should push prices for exchange-grade Brazilian coffee, known as 'semi-washed', down to levels where it becomes economical to deliver the beans to ICE - a market of last resort at times when there is excess supply.Traders said physical prices for Brazilian semi-washed coffee dipped in September to levels where exchange deliveries became economical, but the fall was short-lived, hence just 250,000 bags are at or heading to exchange depots to be certified this year.Next year, those numbers could swell if the favourable weather in Brazil holds up and demand remains depressed due to the economic downturn.""Demand is very, very quiet. No one wants to buy, roasters are stepping out the market. Whoever (has) coffee wants to get out so the only natural buyer is (exchange participants),"" said another Europe-based trader.(Reporting by Maytaal Angel and Marcelo Teixera; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)]"

(NYSE:ZTS) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 30.1x P/E ratio. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.With earnings growth that's inferior to most other companies of late, Zoetis has been relatively sluggish. It might be that many expect the uninspiring earnings performance to recover significantly, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. If not, then existing shareholders may be very nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for Zoetis peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Zoetis.Is There Enough Growth For Zoetis?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Zoetis' is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 5.2%. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 45% overall rise in EPS, aided somewhat by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Shifting to the future, estimates from the eleven analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 10.0% each year over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.5% each year, which is not materially different.In light of this, it's curious that Zoetis' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.The Bottom Line On Zoetis' P/EGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Story continuesOur examination of Zoetis' analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.Plus, you should also learn about this   1 warning sign we've spotted with Zoetis.If you're unsure about the strength of Zoetis' business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

This decrease was primarily driven by higher supply costs as a result of the previously announced unplanned outage at W.A.

Total liquidity was $2.8 billion, which was approximately $88 million higher than at the end of 2021.NRG Strategic DevelopmentsAstoriaOn September 9, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive purchase agreement to sell land and related assets from the Astoria site, within the East region of operations, for initial proceeds of $212 million, subject to purchase price adjustments and certain other indemnifications. As part of the transaction, NRG will enter into an agreement to lease the land back for the purpose of operating the Astoria facility through the planned April 30, 2023 retirement date. The operating lease agreement is expected to end six months after the facility's actual retirement date. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2022 and is subject to various closing conditions.As a result of the agreement for the Astoria sale mentioned above, and the planned withdrawal and cancellation of the proposed Astoria redevelopment project, the Company recorded an impairment of $43 million in the third quarter of 2022.W.A. Parish Unit 8 Extended OutageIn May 2022, W.A. Parish Unit 8 came offline as a result of damage to certain components of the steam turbine/generator. Based on management's current assessment of necessary restoration efforts, the Company continues to target the return to service of the unit by the end of the second quarter of 2023.Growth PlanAt its June 2021 Investor Day, NRG provided its five-year roadmap to grow through its integrated home strategy. In 2021 and 2022, the Company focused on ‘optimizing its core’ and staging for growth through its test and learn pilot programs. During this time, the Company enhanced its business model and go-to-market strategies. In 2023, the Company expects to enter its next phase of growth, ‘grow from core,’ through executing identified investment and strategic partnerships, while evaluating incremental vertical integration and partnership opportunities. Consistent with its strategic and capital allocation priorities, the Company expects to allocate approximately $220 million for growth-related projects in 2023.Narrowing 2022 Guidance and Initiating 2023 GuidanceNRG is narrowing its 2022 Adjusted EBITDA as well as narrowing and adjusting down the 2022 FCFbG guidance, and is initiating guidance for the 2023 fiscal year. 2022 FCFbG guidance has been reduced as a result of increasing natural gas and coal inventories, which is expected to be partially reversed in 2023, and the impact of higher commodities prices on working capital.Table 4: Adjusted EBITDA and FCFbG Guidance20222023(In millions)Revised GuidanceGuidanceAdjusted EBITDAa$1,950 - $2,050$2,270 - $2,470Cash provided by Operating Activities$1,230 - $1,330$1,925 - $2,125FCFbG$950 - $1,050$1,520 - $1,720a. Non-GAAP financial measure; see Appendix Table A-8 for GAAP Reconciliation to Net Income that excludes fair value adjustments related to derivatives. The Company is unable to provide guidance for Net Income due to the impact of such fair value adjustments related to derivatives in a given year.2022 Capital Allocation UpdateAs announced on December 6, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors authorized $1 billion for share repurchases. The program began in 2021 with $39 million in share repurchases completed in December of that year, an incremental $564 million was completed through October 31, 2022, resulting in a balance of $397 million under the current program expected to be completed by the end of 2022.On October 21, 2022, NRG announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend on the Company's common stock of $0.35 per share, or $1.40 per share on an annualized basis. The dividend is payable on November 15, 2022, to stockholders of record as of November 1, 2022.2023 Capital AllocationThe Company is announcing its expected 2023 capital allocation plan, consistent with its capital allocation priorities and 2021 Investor Day roadmap. The Board of Directors approved $600 million incremental share repurchases program, to be completed in 2023; an 8% increase in its annual dividend to $1.51 per share beginning in the first quarter of 2023; $331 million in growth and other spend; and $628 million to be allocated at a future date.The Company remains committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet, continues to work to achieve investment-grade credit metrics, and expects to grow into its target investment grade metrics, primarily through the realization of Direct Energy run-rate earnings and other growth initiatives.The Company's share repurchase program and common stock dividend are subject to maintaining satisfactory credit metrics, available capital, market conditions, and compliance with associated laws and regulations. The timing and amount of any shares of NRG’s common stock that are repurchased under the share repurchase authorization will be determined by NRG’s management based on market conditions and other factors. NRG will only repurchase shares when management believes it would not jeopardize the company’s ability to maintain satisfactory credit ratings.Earnings Conference CallOn November 7, 2022, NRG will host a conference call at 9:00 a.m. Eastern (8:00 a.m. Central) to discuss these results.

(NYSE:NEE) shares over the last 12 months. This is reassuring as this suggests that insiders have increased optimism about the company's prospects.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for NextEra Energy NextEra Energy Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when insider James Robo bought US$5.0m worth of shares at a price of US$77.26 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$78.80. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed. In this case we're pleased to report that the insider purchases were made at close to current prices.NextEra Energy insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that NextEra Energy insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$262m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About NextEra Energy Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded NextEra Energy shares in the last quarter. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. With high insider ownership and encouraging transactions, it seems like NextEra Energy insiders think the business has merit. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing NextEra Energy. For example, NextEra Energy has 2 warning signs (and 1 which is potentially serious) we think you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The top-eight EV markets in the US are all in coastal states, and represent 50.5% of total EV registrations in 2022. The greater Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas* alone account for nearly one-third of total share of the US EV market.While the 22 heartland states** represent 27.1% of total US vehicle retail sales through August, their representation in EV adoption has remained stagnant from 2021 into this year—at a tepid 15.5% share. Only Colorado and Nevada (and to a minuscule extent, Utah) outpunch their overall retail share in EV representation, according to S&amp;P Global Mobility data.Coastal dominanceIt is no surprise that California, a leader in green initiatives and EV adoption, dominates the top of share rankings. Greater Los Angeles (18.9% share of total EV sales), the San Francisco Bay Area (10.8%), and San Diego (3.3%) saw no change in their top-five position year-over-year when comparing rankings for calendar year to date (CYTD: January–August) 2022 versus 2021, while Sacramento improved its position from the previous year.Additionally, of the 13 markets that increased share for CYTD 2022 versus 2021, most were in the ""smile"" states***, including Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, and Houston. Only Chicago, Las Vegas, Missoula, and Salt Lake City represented share gains in big cities of ""Heartland"" states. Not all coastal markets are guaranteed share gains; New York and Boston registered slight EV share declines this year.Story continues""BEV market share control on the two coasts is attributed to their higher mix of early adopters compared to buyers in middle America,"" said Tom Libby, associate director of Loyalty Solutions and Industry Analysis at S&amp;P Global Mobility. ""Their demographic profile is more in sync with the traditional BEV buyer than the middle-American profile.""But Libby sees potential in EV growth in top heartland markets: ""More acceptance and much broader consumer awareness is resulting in a natural progression of adoption from the coasts to the Heartland.""A chicken-and-egg scenario might also be in play. The coastal cities have worked harder at creating charging infrastructures, as well as incentives for homeowners to install charging equipment in their garages.""There is no doubt that the lack of charger availability is an influence in midwestern states, but it is not the factor,"" said James Martin, associate director of consulting for S&amp;P Global Mobility. ""An equally strong factor is the availability of product in form factors that customers are willing to purchase.""There was no real option in terms of family friendly, moderately priced CUVs,"" Martin added. ""And some models, such as the Hyundai Kona EV, were initially not available in midwestern states – based on OEMs deciding to focus on Section 177 (CARB) states where automakers could accumulate credits. Now automakers are beginning to produce more mainstream electric vehicles. Availability of these vehicles will most likely be a factor in spurring installation of more charging infrastructure.""With the BIL and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) laws passed, more nationwide tax incentives will be available. The state receiving the most funds of the initial USD900-million tranche will be Texas—even though its major city with the most market share is Dallas, with a mere 2.4% chunk of the EV market (8,591 EVs retailed through August). Texas may be gambling that more charging infrastructure will spur EV demand in the state.Heartland buyer profilesIs there any difference in the buyer profile between coastal and heartland America?Yes and no.According to S&amp;P Global Mobility loyalty analytics data, which tracks buyers' return-to-market behavior, there is little difference in the demographic and psychographic profile of those moving into battery-electric vehicles.Comparing inflow movement into BEVs from coastal market share leaders (Los Angeles, New York, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle) versus inland market share gainers (Atlanta, Austin, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Missoula, Salt Lake City) shows few differences in the buyer cohorts. There are just more of those types of people in Coastal and Smile states.Caucasian buyers with high household incomes dominate both regions' adopter bases. The only difference is that the central markets skew more toward a slightly younger demographic.Year-over-year comparisons between the two regions show similar results; both reflect the largest declines in share from Caucasian buyers and the highest gain from Asian-American buyers. The jump in inflow from Asian-American buyers signals the early adoption of this technology was not a passing phase.""The typical Asian-American new-vehicle buyer is younger than that of any other ethnicity, including African-American and Hispanic,"" Libby said. ""Through the first eight months of 2022, 48% of Asian-American buyers were age 18-44. Younger buyers typically are more open to new ideas and products; their brand loyalty typically is lower than that of most other age groups.""Is there a difference in brand preference between coastal and heartland buyers? Tesla's dominance remains unchanged because it controls over 65% of all BEV conquest share in both areas. The brand's public perception as the preminent BEV manufacturer solidified its position as the first choice of buyers willing to move from an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle to a BEV.However, the year-over-year change in conquest share shows that demand for Tesla appears to be slowing down in the heartland markets. Both Kia and Hyundai were the leaders in market share gain, improving their position by more than 2 percentage points – even though the budget-conscious Hyundai Ioniq5 is sold in only 39 states. Mercedes-Benz, Rivian, and Ford were the other brands to appear among the top-five largest heartland gainers for CYTD 2022 versus 2021.The increased interest in the Korean brands coincides with a decrease among more established BEV manufacturers. However, that may not necessarily represent a drop in demand. For instance, Volkswagen has seen sizeable registration declines in 2022 for its ID.4—mostly owing to supply chain snarls and market allocations to more EV-friendly regions. However, VW's new ID.4 assembly line in Tennessee went live in October, and the automaker says it has 20,000 unfilled reservations and a plant capacity of 7,000 units per month.Acceptance of BEVs is moving inward in America, albeit at a slower pace than expected. Libby believes it will take time before electrification is fully embraced in the heartland.""The adoption of BEVs is a long-term process that needs to reach an inflection point similar to the adoption, or acceptance, of Asian-sourced vehicles in the US,"" Libby says. ""That inflection point is when the product becomes generally accepted and it usually occurs when volume and exposure reach a level that influences all the reluctant outliers.""* Given their fluid geography and county boundaries, ""Greater Los Angeles"" includes the contiguous Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties. ""San Francisco Bay Area"" includes the Bay Area of San Mateo, Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, Solano, Napa, Sonoma, and Marin counties.** For this calculation, S&amp;P Global Mobility analysts categorized heartland states as Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.*** Smile States are categorized as starting in California in the west, swinging through the Sun Belt and Southern coastal states, then swinging up the Atlantic coast to Virginia.About S&amp;P Global Mobility (www.spglobal.com/mobility)At S&amp;P Global Mobility, we provide invaluable insights derived from unmatched automotive data, enabling our customers to anticipate change and make decisions with conviction.

They would have to rise by more than 200,000 bags though,"" said a Europe-based trader at a global trade house.Certified stocks are a strong driver of ICE coffee prices because, unlike other factors, they are visible to all on a daily basis and many algorithmic funds are pre-programmed to buy when they fall and sell when they rise.The coffee crop in Brazil, responsible for around 40% of global arabica production, could grow by as much as 10% in 2023 due to favourable weather in recent months, analysts say.Story continuesThat should push prices for exchange-grade Brazilian coffee, known as 'semi-washed', down to levels where it becomes economical to deliver the beans to ICE - a market of last resort at times when there is excess supply.Traders said physical prices for Brazilian semi-washed coffee dipped in September to levels where exchange deliveries became economical, but the fall was short-lived, hence just 250,000 bags are at or heading to exchange depots to be certified this year.Next year, those numbers could swell if the favourable weather in Brazil holds up and demand remains depressed due to the economic downturn.""Demand is very, very quiet. No one wants to buy, roasters are stepping out the market. Whoever (has) coffee wants to get out so the only natural buyer is (exchange participants),"" said another Europe-based trader.(Reporting by Maytaal Angel and Marcelo Teixera; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)]"

Some analysts cut their initial estimates by nearly 4 million bags as trees have taken longer to recover from 2021's frosts and drought. Coffee prices in August and September traded between $2.17 and $2.21 per pound, over 70% higher than two years ago.The surge in prices gave Brazilian farmers an opening to default on contracts so they could sell beans on the spot market, earning a higher price that outweighs any liability for a default.Several major exporters such as Sucafina, Olam, Louis Dreyfus and COFCO, as well as co-ops including No. 1 exporter Cooxupe, are legally battling farmers for compensation over contract defaults, according to court documents seen by Reuters.Sucafina, Olam, Dreyfus and COFCO did not respond to requests for comment. Cooxupe declined to comment.""We've been told to have less exposure with (Brazilian farmers). It's going to be one or two years until traders forget"" and start buying forward again, said a trader at a large international commodities trading company, asking not to be named.WIDER IMPACT OF DEFAULTSForward selling by farmers and exporters from top exporter Brazil is an important feature of the market. Advance sales help reduce market fluctuations because they allow farmers to sell throughout the year, not just during harvest.Lawyer Cristiano Zauli from Cristiano Zauli Advogados law firm, who assists traders in cases against Brazilian farmers, said he had filed around 50 lawsuits this year against about 100 last year, seeking compensation from coffee producers who have failed to deliver.Story continuesHe said he had obtained court orders to seize coffee at farms, similar to last year when harsh frosts damaged around 15% of Brazil's coffee crop and pushed prices to multi-year highs.Traders said this year's wave of defaults caused the ICE futures price to spike in late September ahead of the front month contract expiry, and could do so again ahead of the December contract expiry on Dec. 19.Traders who buy coffee a year or two in advance usually hedge purchases by taking short futures positions. When futures rise, they take a loss on that position, but can offset it with a similar rally in physical coffee prices.However, when farmers default, traders do not have the physical coffee to sell to offset the futures market. Instead, traders cover short positions by buying more futures, magnifying wild swings in the market.That's what happened in September, when Arabica coffee futures rose from around 2.16 cents per pound to 2.32 cents late in the month, a 7% increase.A lawyer working for one of the five largest coffee exporters in Brazil said the defaults concerned less than 10% of Brazil's total forward contracts. That would still be a significant amount since Brazil produces about 35% of the world's coffee.(Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Bernadette Baum)]"

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.43bUS$6.45bUS$6.47bUS$6.55bUS$6.61bUS$6.70bUS$6.80bUS$6.91bUS$7.03bUS$7.16bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x11Analyst x4Analyst x2Est @ 1%Est @ 1.29%Est @ 1.5%Est @ 1.64%Est @ 1.74%Est @ 1.81% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.4% US$6.0kUS$5.7kUS$5.4kUS$5.1kUS$4.8kUS$4.6kUS$4.4kUS$4.2kUS$4.0kUS$3.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$48bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.4%– 2.0%) = US$165bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$165b÷ ( 1 + 6.4%)10= US$89bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$137b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$482, the company appears about fair value at a 7.7% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Lockheed Martin as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.863. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

If you want to see more of the biggest aerospace companies in the world, go directly to 5 Biggest Aerospace Companies in the World.In the last few decades, the aerospace industry has grown substantially thanks to increasing commercial air travel and increasing defense spending.In the next few decades, the commercial aerospace industry is expected to grow substantially.According to a global market forecast from Airbus in 2022, there are expected to be around 39,500 new passenger and freighter aircraft deliveries over 2022 to 2041. While global GDP is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 2.6% from 2019 to 2041, passenger traffic is expected to grow by a CAGR of 3.6% during that span. Freight traffic is expected to increase at a CAGR of 3.2% during the same time period.As the world economy expands, demand for passenger air travel is expected to rise. As world trade increases, demand for air cargo is expected to rise too.Similarly, the defense aerospace industry is also expected to grow. According to PwC estimates, the industry is expected to grow modestly in 2022 before growing faster in 2023.SpaceAerospace companies are increasingly moving into space as well.In terms of space, space satellites have already offered substantial benefits such as GPS, weather reports, and also fast communication.Lockheed Martin VP of Commercial Civil Space Lisa Callahan describes the benefits,GPS is about a $300 billion per year business here on Earth, and since its inception it’s estimated to have generated $1.4 trillion in the US alone. Just look at the rideshare industry, which is a $60 billion business annually, and all thanks to space assets providing those GPS signals. Weather is very similar, with the US weather satellite market worth $162 billion a year, with space assets totaling about 77 percent of that. So space is really playing a huge role in the economy here on Earth.Story continuesIn terms of the future, there will likely be substantial more benefits for the economies and companies that succeed in terms of commercializing space. Space tourism and satellite internet are industries that have already begun, and economically harnessing solar energy, mining asteroid resources, and colonizing Mars look increasingly achievable in the future.Given that leading aerospace companies have the technology and expertise to make those industries possible, they could potentially realize substantial economic benefits if they successfully commercialize their opportunity.Given the distances to space, realizing the potential of space is extremely difficult and there is no guarantee of success. Successfully lowering costs to space, and ensuring safety are both very important.2022Given the pandemic, commercial air travel decreased substantially in 2020 and many commercial aircraft manufacturers have not fully recovered from the decreasing airplane orders. With the high inflation, the Federal Reserve has also increased the benchmark federal funds rate to 3.75% to 4% from around 0% in the beginning of the year. According to the Fed's current projections, the rates could rise to 4.5% to 4.75% in 2023.With the higher rates, the global economic growth is expected to slow substantially and aerospace companies, like many other companies, could face near term headwinds as a result.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Pixabay/Public DomainMethodologyFor our list of 15 Biggest Aerospace Companies in the World, we took the top 15 companies by revenue from flightglobal.com's Top 100 aerospace companies ranked by revenue.For our 2021 aerospace revenue, we used data from flightglobal.com.15 Biggest Aerospace Companies in the World15.

This systematic review observed that use of GARDASIL led to reductions in the rates of high-grade (precancerous) and low-grade cervical lesions, as well as reductions in certain non-cervical HPV-related diseases and HPV infection in women and men. The systematic review included 138 peer-reviewed studies, published between March 1, 2016, and March 31, 2020. It details the impact and effectiveness of GARDASIL through immunization programs in 23 countries, across Africa, Asia, Europe, Australia, South America and North America and builds on a prior review of real-world data published in 2016. The previous real-world analysis was based on 58 peer-reviewed studies published between Jan. 1, 2007, and Feb. 29, 2016, across Australia/New Zealand, Europe and North America. Studies examining GARDASIL 9® (Human Papillomavirus 9-valent Vaccine, Recombinant) were not included in this review.In the U.S., GARDASIL1 is indicated for use in females 9 through 26 years of age for the prevention of cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal cancers caused by HPV types 16 and 18; genital warts caused by HPV types 6 and 11; and precancerous or dysplastic lesions caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18. GARDASIL is also approved for use in males 9 through 26 years of age for the prevention of anal cancer caused by HPV types 16 and 18, for the prevention of anal dysplasia and precancerous lesions caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18, and for the prevention of genital warts caused by HPV types 6 and 11. GARDASIL is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity, including severe allergic reactions to yeast, or after a previous dose of GARDASIL.Story continues""Since its first authorization in 2006, GARDASIL has been widely used in national immunization programs all around the world, which has enabled researchers to study the impact of HPV vaccination in a broad range of populations and settings,"" said Ravinder Dhawan, vice president, head of center for observational and real-world evidence, Merck Research Laboratories. ""These real-world data from more than one hundred published studies show decreases in vaccine-type HPV infections and related diseases and are an important reminder that we need to do more to expand vaccination to males and females as part of the global fight to lessen the incidence of certain HPV-related diseases and cancers.""1 GARDASIL is no longer marketed in the United States. GARDASIL 9 was approved in the United States in 2014.In addition to the inclusion of real-world data from more countries compared to the previous review published in 2016, longer-term effects of HPV vaccination were also observed, including reductions in certain types of cervical high-grade (precancerous) lesions. Studies included in this review reported reductions in vaccine-targeted low-grade and high grade (precancerous) cervical lesions in females. The greatest reductions were observed in younger age groups (14-17 years), with up to 73 percent reduction in CIN3+ (cervical pre-cancerous lesions) among vaccinated females. Consistent with the previous review, declines in the incidence of anogenital warts continue to be observed within vaccine-targeted female age groups, with larger decreases (up to 88%) observed in younger age groups.Sixteen studies reporting on non-cervical disease endpoints were also evaluated in this review. There is no routinely recommended screening for the detection of non-cervical HPV-related diseases and cancers. Findings in non-cervical disease included:Consistent decreases observed in vaccine-type HPV infection rates in females among age groups targeted by national immunization programs, of up to 96%.A consistent overall decrease in prevalence of anal infection in men was reported with variability observed by HPV-type. A significant reduction in high-grade anal pre-cancers (AIN) was observed among vaccinated versus unvaccinated men who have sex with men in one study. In years one and two after vaccination, statistical significance in the estimate was observed (HR 0.42 [95% CI: 0.22-0.82, p=0.01] and HR 0.50 [95% CI: 0.26-0.98, p=0.05], respectively). Year three results were not significant, potentially due to loss of follow-up participants in the longer-term study.About the systematic reviewA 2016 review of real-world data previously captured both the effectiveness and impact data of GARDASIL since 2007-2016. This updated systematic literature review identified studies published from March 2016 through March 2020 that met the pre-specified criteria for assessment of the real-world impact of HPV vaccination on HPV-related precancerous and dysplastic cervical lesions, genital warts and HPV infection. The literature search was expanded to include peer-reviewed observational studies between January 2007 and March 2020 on additional endpoints of oral and anal HPV infections, oropharyngeal and anal lesions and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP). The review identified 138 studies from 23 countries with varying degrees of HPV vaccination coverage, among populations of different ages and used different study methods and disease endpoints. A majority of the countries used GARDASIL; some countries utilized the bivalent HPV vaccine in addition to GARDASIL.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Boeing The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.61bUS$8.28bUS$9.88bUS$9.45bUS$9.24bUS$9.15bUS$9.14bUS$9.19bUS$9.28bUS$9.40bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x9Analyst x5Analyst x4Est @ -2.24%Est @ -0.97%Est @ -0.09%Est @ 0.53%Est @ 0.97%Est @ 1.27% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4% US$4.3kUS$7.2kUS$8.0kUS$7.1kUS$6.5kUS$6.0kUS$5.5kUS$5.2kUS$4.9kUS$4.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$59bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$9.4b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.4%– 2.0%) = US$176bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$176b÷ ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$86bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$145b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$160, the company appears quite undervalued at a 34% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Boeing as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.063. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Boeing, we've put together three fundamental factors you should assess:Risks: Take risks, for example - Boeing has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does BA's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

If you want to see more of the biggest aerospace companies in the world, go directly to 5 Biggest Aerospace Companies in the World.In the last few decades, the aerospace industry has grown substantially thanks to increasing commercial air travel and increasing defense spending.In the next few decades, the commercial aerospace industry is expected to grow substantially.According to a global market forecast from Airbus in 2022, there are expected to be around 39,500 new passenger and freighter aircraft deliveries over 2022 to 2041. While global GDP is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 2.6% from 2019 to 2041, passenger traffic is expected to grow by a CAGR of 3.6% during that span. Freight traffic is expected to increase at a CAGR of 3.2% during the same time period.As the world economy expands, demand for passenger air travel is expected to rise. As world trade increases, demand for air cargo is expected to rise too.Similarly, the defense aerospace industry is also expected to grow. According to PwC estimates, the industry is expected to grow modestly in 2022 before growing faster in 2023.SpaceAerospace companies are increasingly moving into space as well.In terms of space, space satellites have already offered substantial benefits such as GPS, weather reports, and also fast communication.Lockheed Martin VP of Commercial Civil Space Lisa Callahan describes the benefits,GPS is about a $300 billion per year business here on Earth, and since its inception it’s estimated to have generated $1.4 trillion in the US alone. Just look at the rideshare industry, which is a $60 billion business annually, and all thanks to space assets providing those GPS signals. Weather is very similar, with the US weather satellite market worth $162 billion a year, with space assets totaling about 77 percent of that. So space is really playing a huge role in the economy here on Earth.Story continuesIn terms of the future, there will likely be substantial more benefits for the economies and companies that succeed in terms of commercializing space. Space tourism and satellite internet are industries that have already begun, and economically harnessing solar energy, mining asteroid resources, and colonizing Mars look increasingly achievable in the future.Given that leading aerospace companies have the technology and expertise to make those industries possible, they could potentially realize substantial economic benefits if they successfully commercialize their opportunity.Given the distances to space, realizing the potential of space is extremely difficult and there is no guarantee of success. Successfully lowering costs to space, and ensuring safety are both very important.2022Given the pandemic, commercial air travel decreased substantially in 2020 and many commercial aircraft manufacturers have not fully recovered from the decreasing airplane orders. With the high inflation, the Federal Reserve has also increased the benchmark federal funds rate to 3.75% to 4% from around 0% in the beginning of the year. According to the Fed's current projections, the rates could rise to 4.5% to 4.75% in 2023.With the higher rates, the global economic growth is expected to slow substantially and aerospace companies, like many other companies, could face near term headwinds as a result.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Pixabay/Public DomainMethodologyFor our list of 15 Biggest Aerospace Companies in the World, we took the top 15 companies by revenue from flightglobal.com's Top 100 aerospace companies ranked by revenue.For our 2021 aerospace revenue, we used data from flightglobal.com.15 Biggest Aerospace Companies in the World15.

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.95bUS$3.21bUS$3.72bUS$4.21bUS$4.56bUS$4.86bUS$5.11bUS$5.33bUS$5.51bUS$5.68bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x11Analyst x6Analyst x3Est @ 8.46%Est @ 6.52%Est @ 5.16%Est @ 4.2%Est @ 3.54%Est @ 3.07% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$2.8kUS$2.8kUS$3.1kUS$3.3kUS$3.3kUS$3.3kUS$3.3kUS$3.2kUS$3.1kUS$3.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$31bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.7b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.0%) = US$126bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$126b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$66bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$98b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$523, the company appears about fair value at a 18% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Northrop Grumman as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.899. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Northrop Grumman, there are three pertinent factors you should further research:Risks: Take risks, for example - Northrop Grumman has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does NOC's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?""

But given the volatility that we see and the potential for a cessation in the uptrend in yields, sometime as the Fed backs away-they will eventually back away- you could actually get a good market next year because history says that post-midterms tend to be very good for stocks among other reasons.”Julian Emanuel thinks that “there’s a bit more room in terms of value outperformance” and is bullish on “financials, healthcare, and energy”. Julian Emanuel said that “growth is arguably still overvalued relative to value” and that “as a long-term investor, you need to be prepared to buy down another 10% and then another 10% after that.”As of November 4, the S&amp;P 500 has dropped 22.3% year to date, the Nasdaq has shed 35% of its value since the beginning of the year, and the Dow is down 12.38% for the year.

Sports betting is one factor in Rupert Murdoch's proposal to recombine Fox with News Corp, according to people familiar with the deal's logic.Independent directors within both media companies are evaluating the proposal, which would be subject to approval by a majority of non-family shareholders.The Murdochs' early foray into sports betting has been slow-going. The sports betting app Fox Bet is available in four states, with just 0.2% share of the U.S. market, according to researcher Vixio. A free version called Fox Bet Super 6 has attracted some 6 million users whom Fox hopes to eventually convert to betters.The growth of Fox Bet has stagnated since Flutter acquired Stars Group, the company that helped launch Fox Bet and owns and operates the app.Fox claimed that Flutter failed to provide reasonable resources behind Fox Bet, a claim Flutter said the arbitrator rejected, finding that Flutter had agreed to commit ""commercially reasonable"" resources behind the offering.However, Fox retains the right to acquire up to 50% of the Stars Group's U.S. operations, which includes Fox Bet, though it would need to obtain necessary sports betting licenses.(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski; Editing by Leslie Adler, David Gregorio, Muralikumar Anantharaman and Diane Craft)]"

(NYSE:CRM) is one of the best growth stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Oakmark Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has become a dominant global player in sales, customer service, commerce and marketing software over the past 20 years. The company earns 80% gross margins and grows 20% organically. Plus, virtually all of its revenue is recurring. We see Salesforce as a great business that we’ve admired from afar for a long time. More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Suggested Articles:11 Best Mineral Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Momentum Stocks To Invest In11 Safe Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsDisclosure.

99,6f1c84cc-d294-3b64-baae-62e63ebc5cd9,PYPL,2022-11-07,Return Trends At PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) Aren't Appealing,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/return-trends-paypal-holdings-nasdaq-110009017.html,1667818809,STORY,['PYPL'],"[If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on PayPal Holdings is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$3.8b ÷ (US$76b - US$43b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, PayPal Holdings has an ROCE of 12%. That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 12%. See our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for PayPal Holdings compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for PayPal Holdings.What Does the ROCE Trend For PayPal Holdings Tell Us?While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has employed 95% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 12%. 12% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that PayPal Holdings has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.Story continuesOn a side note, PayPal Holdings' current liabilities are still rather high at 57% of total assets. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.In Conclusion...To sum it up, PayPal Holdings has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. In light of this, the stock has only gained 1.6% over the last five years for shareholders who have owned the stock in this period. So to determine if PayPal Holdings is a multi-bagger going forward, we'd suggest digging deeper into the company's other fundamentals.One more thing, we've spotted   2 warning signs  facing PayPal Holdings that you might find interesting.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

To skip our analysis of the recent market trends and activity, you can go directly to 5 Best Freight Stocks to Buy Now.The transportation industry creates value by moving goods and people and comprises multiple components such as airlines, railways, trucking, light vehicles, and maritime shipping, among others.According to a report published by Deloitte, during the past two years, the transportation chain was severely impacted due to the pandemic. In addition to lockdowns and sickness, supply of goods was also disrupted. As a result, capacity on container vessels decreased and container rates skyrocketed. Similarly, airfreight demand also picked up. The disruption in global supply chain raised awareness for local sourcing to avoid disruptions. According to the report, there will be no major capacity-related issues in the upcoming 3 years as the capacity is increasing.The railroad network, one of the most important components of the transportation industry in the United States, has been under scrutiny from railroad workers. In September, railroads and workers’ unions reached a tentative agreement to avert a national rail strike. On October 10, the third largest railroad union rejected its deal which has once again renewed the possibility of a nationwide strike.The transportation industry and the freight stocks that are part of this industry have not fared well in the recent past. The Dow Jones Transportation Average index, a 20-stock, price weighted index that represents stock performance of large, well-known transportation industry stocks, was down year-to-date by nearly 23%, as of October 13, 2022.Global markets have been going through a rough patch with fears of a recession due to inflation and aggressive monetary policies implemented by central banks. The Consumer Price Index increased 0.4% in September against the 0.3% estimate, while headline inflation was up by 8.2%, more than the 8.1% estimates. The higher-than-expected inflation figures have raised concerns about another 75-bps interest rate hike by the Fed in December.Story continues10 Best Freight Stocks to Buy NowMethodologyWe took the 20 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Transportation Average index.

103,927e24b4-a8d8-3b4c-ba03-fc566e01b176,TGT,2022-11-07,An Intrinsic Calculation For Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) Suggests It's 37% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-target-corporation-nyse-110041336.html,1667818841,STORY,['TGT'],"[Does the November share price for Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Target The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.47bUS$3.82bUS$5.02bUS$5.35bUS$5.53bUS$5.68bUS$5.83bUS$5.96bUS$6.10bUS$6.23bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 2.76%Est @ 2.53%Est @ 2.36%Est @ 2.25%Est @ 2.17% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.3% US$2.3kUS$3.4kUS$4.2kUS$4.2kUS$4.1kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.5kUS$3.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$36bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.3%– 2.0%) = US$147bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$147b÷ ( 1 + 6.3%)10= US$80bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$116b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$160, the company appears quite undervalued at a 37% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Target as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.844. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Target, there are three additional elements you should assess:Risks: As an example, we've found 4 warning signs for Target that you need to consider before investing here.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for TGT's future outlook?

If you want to skip our analysis of the retail market, you can skip this article and head on to the 5 Largest Retailers in the US in 2022.The US retail market has continued to grow in recent years and was estimated to occupy a market size of $6.9 trillion in 2022. The country is home to some of the biggest retail stores in the world, with companies like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) operating in the country. In 2021, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions of the US FED spurred growth in sales of all the retail stores in the country as consumers continued to spend freely in a low-interest rate environment. However, the outlook for big retailers in 2022 has changed as the FED has continued to raise interest rates amidst high inflation. The high rates are expected to slow down the economy and deteriorate the consumer sentiment in the country as people are likely to focus on increasing their savings in the coming months.Contrary to the expectations, the consumer spending is still very robust. Nearly seventy percent of the US economy is consumer spending and the US GDP registered an annualized 2.6% growth during the third quarter. This is why many retail companies have seen an increase in their sales in the current year. However, discount retail stores like Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) and Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) are positive on their outlook for the coming quarters since they are also experiencing a rise in their store traffic as people started to search for discounted prices.Largest Retailers in the US in 2022Niloo / Shutterstock.comEven though the consumer price inflation still hovers around 8%, the overall retail sales has been growing at double digit rates during third quarter. Amazon.com (AMZN), one of the biggest retailers in the US, registered a topline growth rate of 15% during the third quarter, however, the online retail giant guided for an increase of only 5% for the fourth quarter. So, experts and companies are expecting a significant slowdown in retail spending, but we have yet to see this in the reported numbers.Story continuesOur MethodologyWe have picked the top 15 largest retailers in the United States and have ranked them from #15 to #1 in order of their market capitalization.15 Largest Retailers in the US in 202215.

Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm's US retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer's impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam's Club). However, given management's decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company's progress.11.

Its profits have gyrated wildly since the beginning of the pandemic, first from store closures and shutdowns, then from the pent-up demand for apparel, and more recently, from the economic uncertainty. Adding to that, Ross is finding that consumers' spending trends in terms of mix and categories have been more difficult to predict than usual, resulting in some mismatches between its merchandise assortment and what shoppers want. This doesn't appear to be a Ross-specific issue, as other apparel retailers have reported similar problems. We attribute this to the unusual post-pandemic environment, and while we don't have a crystal ball as to when this will normalize, we believe it will.10. The Kroger Co.

The consumables category accounted for approximately 77% of the company's net sales.Here's what LRT Capital Management said about Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:Executive SummaryAt LRT Capital Management we are continuously searching the market for great investment opportunities. Our favorite finds are companies with moats and growth opportunities that justify a higher price than what the stock is trading for. One of our holdings (approximately 1.5% of our long exposure) is Dollar General (DG), so today, we wanted to tell you a bit about this great company.Company OverviewDollar General is a discount retailer with the largest brick-and-mortar presence in the United States by store count. The company's largest concentration of stores can be found in the southern, southwestern, midwestern, and eastern parts of the United States.10 Dollar General was founded in 1939 by J.L. Turner, who originally named the company ""J.L. Turner and Son, Wholesale"".  As the name suggests, the company began its life as a wholesaler, but quickly turned to a retailer of general store goods. By the early 1950s, the company had annual sales of $2 million per year,12 which is the equivalent of $22.95 million in 2021 dollars when adjusted for inflation.The first Dollar General store opened on June 01, 1955 in Springfield Kentucky. The simple concept was that no item in the store would cost more than one dollar. The company changed its name to Dollar General Corporation in 1968 when Dollar General became publicly traded. At the time of its initial public offering, the business generated more than $40 million in annual sales. The company's common stock was publicly traded from 1968 until July 2007, when it was taken private by KKR. The company went public again in November 2009, under the ticker DG.Today, Dollar General is an evolved, and phenomenal business with more room for growth. Annual sales reached a record $33.7 billion in fiscal year 2021 after consecutively growing the top line for many years. The company's main products are every-day necessities and consumables purchased by lower income consumers on tight budgets…7. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Market Cap: $72.67 billionTarget Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is the 7th largest retailer in the US, operating 1,938 stores in the country. The company offers a diverse range of products across various categories, including beauty, food and beverage, apparel and accessories, and home furnishings and décor. The company has an employee base of over 400 thousand people across 50 states in the United States.The company has been able to grow its sales significantly during the previous year, as it reported revenue of $104.6 billion in 2021, up 13% compared to $92.4 billion in 2020. Earlier in October, Target and Apple announced a collaboration under which Target will have more locations for Apple products, allowing consumers to buy more of the company's offerings during the holiday season.Ensemble Capital shared its stance on Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:Speaking on their earnings call, Target's CEO Brian Cornell said that spending on items such as kitchen appliances, TVs and outdoor furniture – products that consumers splurged on while stuck at home – has declined sharply. While they had expected there to be a shift from spending on goods to services as America exited pandemic lifestyles, they didn't anticipate the speed and magnitude of the shift. On the other hand, they saw luggage sales grow by an astounding 50%, along with robust growth in ""going out"" categories such as sunscreen, beauty products, and even toys as families return to hosting large birthday parties for their children. So, despite Target seeing increasing foot traffic and higher spending overall, they got caught with the wrong inventory relative to what customers wanted to buy. What this means for investors is that it is incorrect to say that the consumer is weak, despite weakness in some consumer facing companies. Rather what people are spending money on is changing rapidly, which is good or bad for a given company based on what they sell. Importantly, with demand shifting from items that were in short supply, there is good reason to think that inflation in these categories will moderate. Indeed, Target stated that their plan was to put their excess inventory on sale, something that consumers haven't seen a lot of over the past two years. But as demand for COVID era goods moderates, demand for activities such as travel has surged, driving up inflation in airline tickets and hotel rooms. This illustrates the way that the shock waves from the pandemic have scrambled the typical economic cycle such that even at a time when all signs point to the biggest summer travel season in history, investors are worried that we are headed into, or are already in, a recession.6. The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX)Market Cap: $82.14 billionThe TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) is a major off-price retailer of clothing, home goods, and other items operating 4,689 stores worldwide.

(NYSE:TJX) had a record growth in sales during the fiscal year 2022 as it reported sales of $48.5 billion, up 51% from $32.1 billion in 2021. However, the sales have started to normalize in the current year, and the company's net sales declined by 2% YoY in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.The ClearBridge Investments Large Cap Value Strategy liked the potential post-pandemic customer surge to The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX), as revealed in the fund's Q4 2021 investor letter:The pandemic created opportunities for us to be more aggressive in a variety of areas of the market. We were opportunistic throughout the year, for example, in positioning the portfolio to benefit from a flush consumer eager to return to spending and traveling. New positions included TJX, an off-brand retailer with a large presence in the US and Europe that should continue to benefit from the contraction of many traditional retailers, particularly as consumer spending resumes. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Largest Retailers in the US in 2022. Suggested Articles:15 Best Strong Buy Stocks to Invest In11 Best Advertising Stocks To Buy NowLargest Airlines in the World in 2022Disclosure: None. 15 Largest Retailers in the US in 2022 is originally published on Insider Monkey. ]"

If you want to skip our analysis of the retail market, you can skip this article and head on to the 5 Largest Retailers in the US in 2022.The US retail market has continued to grow in recent years and was estimated to occupy a market size of $6.9 trillion in 2022. The country is home to some of the biggest retail stores in the world, with companies like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) operating in the country. In 2021, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions of the US FED spurred growth in sales of all the retail stores in the country as consumers continued to spend freely in a low-interest rate environment. However, the outlook for big retailers in 2022 has changed as the FED has continued to raise interest rates amidst high inflation. The high rates are expected to slow down the economy and deteriorate the consumer sentiment in the country as people are likely to focus on increasing their savings in the coming months.Contrary to the expectations, the consumer spending is still very robust. Nearly seventy percent of the US economy is consumer spending and the US GDP registered an annualized 2.6% growth during the third quarter. This is why many retail companies have seen an increase in their sales in the current year. However, discount retail stores like Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) and Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) are positive on their outlook for the coming quarters since they are also experiencing a rise in their store traffic as people started to search for discounted prices.Largest Retailers in the US in 2022Niloo / Shutterstock.comEven though the consumer price inflation still hovers around 8%, the overall retail sales has been growing at double digit rates during third quarter. Amazon.com (AMZN), one of the biggest retailers in the US, registered a topline growth rate of 15% during the third quarter, however, the online retail giant guided for an increase of only 5% for the fourth quarter. So, experts and companies are expecting a significant slowdown in retail spending, but we have yet to see this in the reported numbers.Story continuesOur MethodologyWe have picked the top 15 largest retailers in the United States and have ranked them from #15 to #1 in order of their market capitalization.15 Largest Retailers in the US in 202215.

One of our holdings (approximately 1.5% of our long exposure) is Dollar General (DG), so today, we wanted to tell you a bit about this great company.Company OverviewDollar General is a discount retailer with the largest brick-and-mortar presence in the United States by store count. The company's largest concentration of stores can be found in the southern, southwestern, midwestern, and eastern parts of the United States.10 Dollar General was founded in 1939 by J.L. Turner, who originally named the company ""J.L. Turner and Son, Wholesale"".  As the name suggests, the company began its life as a wholesaler, but quickly turned to a retailer of general store goods. By the early 1950s, the company had annual sales of $2 million per year,12 which is the equivalent of $22.95 million in 2021 dollars when adjusted for inflation.The first Dollar General store opened on June 01, 1955 in Springfield Kentucky. The simple concept was that no item in the store would cost more than one dollar. The company changed its name to Dollar General Corporation in 1968 when Dollar General became publicly traded. At the time of its initial public offering, the business generated more than $40 million in annual sales. The company's common stock was publicly traded from 1968 until July 2007, when it was taken private by KKR. The company went public again in November 2009, under the ticker DG.Today, Dollar General is an evolved, and phenomenal business with more room for growth. Annual sales reached a record $33.7 billion in fiscal year 2021 after consecutively growing the top line for many years. The company's main products are every-day necessities and consumables purchased by lower income consumers on tight budgets…7. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Market Cap: $72.67 billionTarget Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is the 7th largest retailer in the US, operating 1,938 stores in the country. The company offers a diverse range of products across various categories, including beauty, food and beverage, apparel and accessories, and home furnishings and décor. The company has an employee base of over 400 thousand people across 50 states in the United States.The company has been able to grow its sales significantly during the previous year, as it reported revenue of $104.6 billion in 2021, up 13% compared to $92.4 billion in 2020. Earlier in October, Target and Apple announced a collaboration under which Target will have more locations for Apple products, allowing consumers to buy more of the company's offerings during the holiday season.Ensemble Capital shared its stance on Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:Speaking on their earnings call, Target's CEO Brian Cornell said that spending on items such as kitchen appliances, TVs and outdoor furniture – products that consumers splurged on while stuck at home – has declined sharply. While they had expected there to be a shift from spending on goods to services as America exited pandemic lifestyles, they didn't anticipate the speed and magnitude of the shift. On the other hand, they saw luggage sales grow by an astounding 50%, along with robust growth in ""going out"" categories such as sunscreen, beauty products, and even toys as families return to hosting large birthday parties for their children. So, despite Target seeing increasing foot traffic and higher spending overall, they got caught with the wrong inventory relative to what customers wanted to buy. What this means for investors is that it is incorrect to say that the consumer is weak, despite weakness in some consumer facing companies. Rather what people are spending money on is changing rapidly, which is good or bad for a given company based on what they sell. Importantly, with demand shifting from items that were in short supply, there is good reason to think that inflation in these categories will moderate. Indeed, Target stated that their plan was to put their excess inventory on sale, something that consumers haven't seen a lot of over the past two years. But as demand for COVID era goods moderates, demand for activities such as travel has surged, driving up inflation in airline tickets and hotel rooms. This illustrates the way that the shock waves from the pandemic have scrambled the typical economic cycle such that even at a time when all signs point to the biggest summer travel season in history, investors are worried that we are headed into, or are already in, a recession.6. The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX)Market Cap: $82.14 billionThe TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) is a major off-price retailer of clothing, home goods, and other items operating 4,689 stores worldwide. It offers a broad range of branded items at discounted prices via its strategic purchases of inventory from its 21,000 suppliers worldwide. The store typically offers products at a discount in the range of 20%-60% compared to other retailers. The United States is a key geographic location for the company, and in the fiscal year 2022, the region contributed to 79% of the company's overall sales.The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) had a record growth in sales during the fiscal year 2022 as it reported sales of $48.5 billion, up 51% from $32.1 billion in 2021. However, the sales have started to normalize in the current year, and the company's net sales declined by 2% YoY in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.The ClearBridge Investments Large Cap Value Strategy liked the potential post-pandemic customer surge to The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX), as revealed in the fund's Q4 2021 investor letter:The pandemic created opportunities for us to be more aggressive in a variety of areas of the market. We were opportunistic throughout the year, for example, in positioning the portfolio to benefit from a flush consumer eager to return to spending and traveling. New positions included TJX, an off-brand retailer with a large presence in the US and Europe that should continue to benefit from the contraction of many traditional retailers, particularly as consumer spending resumes. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Largest Retailers in the US in 2022. Suggested Articles:15 Best Strong Buy Stocks to Invest In11 Best Advertising Stocks To Buy NowLargest Airlines in the World in 2022Disclosure: None. 15 Largest Retailers in the US in 2022 is originally published on Insider Monkey. ]"

(NASDAQ:ADI) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 39.3x P/E ratio. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Analog Devices could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for Analog Devices peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Analog Devices will help you uncover what's on the horizon.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?Analog Devices' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 20%. The last three years don't look nice either as the company has shrunk EPS by 8.7% in aggregate. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 27% per year over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.5% per annum, which is noticeably less attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that Analog Devices' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Analog Devices' P/EGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.As we suspected, our examination of Analog Devices' analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.You should always think about risks. Case in point, we've spotted   3 warning signs for Analog Devices  you should be aware of.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

It can be a challenging career for newcomers, and the early struggles to find success means only 4 in 10 new real estate professionals are confident about having a long-term career in real estate, according to Realtor.com®'s new #ThrivePastFive study.Only 4 in 10 new agents are confident about a long-term real estate careerRealtor.com® recently surveyed more than 2,000 agents to gain insights into their top challenges, what separates new and experienced agents, and what it takes to find success in those critical early years, and is translating it into insights specifically to help new agents succeed. Having a great mentor and cash reserves, as well as spending money on marketing, and making a full-time commitment during those first few years in real estate are vital for an agent's long-term success, according to the study results.There are many different reasons why so many decided on a real estate career, from it being a flexible career option for those seeking balance and autonomy, to the clients, the lifestyle it provides, and the income potential. Despite it being a hot career choice for many, real estate is not easy, and every agent faces different challenges, from a lack of knowledge and training at the start of a career to growing a client base and understanding how to effectively convert leads, and too many agents don't make it past year five.""In a shifting and ultra-competitive marketplace, with twice as many real estate agents than listings, having insights from experienced agents – 80% of whom are confident about making it long term as an agent – about what works best to power business growth has never been more valuable,"" said Donna August, vice president of B2B Marketing at Realtor.com®. ""With 25 years experience helping agents succeed, Realtor.com® is committed to developing tools and insights to help agents who are just starting out, so they can thrive and find success in their early years.""Story continuesLead generation a top pain point With home inventories rising but still near four-decade lows, it's no surprise that generating new client leads is hands down the top challenge today for agents of all experience levels. In fact, 60% of all agents cited finding new leads as a challenge, and the figure rose to 70% among new agents, those with less than two years experience.One of the most effective real estate lead generation strategies is to build a strong client network, which can take years for a new agent to grow. Only one-quarter of new agents reported having a network of buyers and sellers that they feel confident about, and nearly half (45%) said they struggle with developing a new client each week; comparatively, 70% of the most experienced agents surveyed – or those with 11+ years in real estate – are creating between one to four new client relationships each week.Other top lead generation challenges for agents of all experience levels are converting leads to clients, poor lead quality, competition from other local agents, high costs per lead, getting a lead too late, low connection rates and the time/effort in managing clients is too high. Beyond lead generation, new agents also struggle with non-serious buyers, whereas experienced agents' struggle with big listings sites that compete with them as brokers.Knowledge gaps that threaten successNewer agents wish they had more knowledge of lead gen, transaction processes and marketing, whereas experienced agents wish they knew more about social media marketing, online ad campaigns that convert and search engine optimization. When it comes to why many agents likely don't succeed, new agents perceive their struggles are because of a lack of training and startup cash, while the most experienced agents responded it was likely because new agents underestimate the time commitment and the learning curve.Contributing factors to a new agent's successWith so many challenges facing new agents, finding success can seem daunting, but a portion of survey respondents are finding it's absolutely possible. When looking at the characteristics of successful new agents – those who average more than 7 transactions a year – the majority, 9 in 10, work full-time. While most agents surveyed work full time (83%), as new agents work to establish themselves, they are three times more likely to work part time compared to their more experienced counterparts, 24% versus 8% for the most experienced agents. Nearly half (47%) spend more than $3,000 a year on marketing, and nearly 7 in 10 spend money on online leads every month. Two-thirds of successful new agents also had someone to mentor them, as well as had back up funds when they first started out in real estate.How much to spend on marketingThe old adage ""you've got to spend money to make money"" rings true for agent success; 64% of experienced agents spent $3,000 or more annually, whereas 70% of new agents spend less than $3,000 annually. Nearly 9 in 10 agents pay for marketing costs themselves. New agents are most likely to receive marketing support from their brokerage, 15% versus 9% for experienced agents. Only about one third of new agents spend $50 or more a month on internet leads, whereas experienced agents are most likely to spend between $50-499 a month on internet leads.Top channels to find the most successWith a greater network of past clients, more experienced agents find online marketing success with calling on past clients via email marketing. Newer agents tend to have more social media experience, which is likely why 82% of new agents rely on social media and lean into creating their own content. Among the different social platforms, Facebook is the platform of choice among survey participants, with 63% of all agents using it to generate leads, and Instagram comes in at a distant second at 28%.Despite the popularity of social media, new agents struggle to convert it into leads, and social media ranked No. 5 for lead gen after networking/referrals, email marketing, digital advertising, and internet leads. Among all agents, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat ranked among the social media sites for lowest lead gen (with less than 5% getting any leads from these sources).While 6 in 10 agents of all experience levels ranked the tried and true method of networking and word of mouth the highest for offline marketing channels, newer agents also ranked open houses (44%) as a top channel. For the most experienced agents, more than half (55%) call on past contacts/leads as a secondary offline marketing tactic, followed by direct mail and open houses.MethodologyFrom May 2022 – Aug 2022, Realtor.com® surveyed agents of various years of experience online.

This will take the dividend yield to an attractive 2.5%, providing a nice boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Snap-on Snap-on's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. However, prior to this announcement, Snap-on's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 6.6%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 37%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendSnap-on Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2012, the dividend has gone from $1.36 total annually to $5.68. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 15% over that duration. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. We are encouraged to see that Snap-on has grown earnings per share at 11% per year over the past five years. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting.We Really Like Snap-on's DividendOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for Snap-on that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

If you want to see more of the biggest IT companies in the world, go directly to 5 Biggest IT Companies in the World.According to market research firm Gartner, Information Technology or IT, ""is the common term for the entire spectrum of technologies for information processing, including software, hardware, communications technologies and related services.""Given the growth in the computer, smartphone, and internet industry over the past three decades, the IT sector is the biggest sector in the market today. In terms of one of the most popular ETFs that track the S&amp;P 500, the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO), the IT sector is largest sector by ETF weight with the sector accounting for 26.4% of the ETF as of 9/30/22. That compares to 15.1% in the healthcare sector and 11.7% in the consumer discretionary for the ETF, which are the second and third heaviest weight sectors.Many of the world's largest companies are also IT companies. Microsoft, for example makes software for computers to process information while Apple make smartphone hardware and software.IT Sector GrowthIn the last three decades, the IT sector has benefited from Moore's Law and the emergence of the internet. With Moore's law, semiconductors have become cheaper and smaller over time, allowing more people to afford computers and smartphones. With the emergence of the internet, more websites/apps have reached the scale needed to produce useful services for people with computers and smartphones. With more services, the internet, computers, and smartphones become more useful.Given the cycle, computer hardware companies have benefited from more demand and computer software companies have benefited from more potential customers. Similarly, smartphone companies have sold a lot more smartphones and internet/app companies have benefited from having more potential users.Although Moore's law was just a rule of thumb and is no longer possible due to physics, computers and smartphones are now cheap enough that most of the world can afford them. With future economic growth, potential subsidies, and satellite internet, it may be possible for anyone in the world to afford a computing device and connect to the internet if they choose to a decade or two from now.Story continuesIn addition to more users that could fuel more growth in the IT sector, the sector could also benefit from the emergence of new technologies.McKinsey writes, ""The emergence of cloud and 5G, for example, exponentially increases compute power and network speeds that can enable greater innovation. Developments in the metaverse of augmented and virtual reality open the doors to virtual R&amp;D via digital twins, for example, and immersive learning. Advances in AI, machine learning, and software 2.0 (machine-written code) bring a range of new services and products, from autonomous vehicles to connected homes, well within reach.""2022Given high inflation, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times in 2022 alone. As a result, the federal funds rate is now 3.75% to 4%, which is considered by many economists as 'restrictive' that could slow economic growth.Given that many analysts think the U.S central bank will raise rates further, the potential for a recession has increased substantially.Given the uncertainty, tech stocks have declined substantially and it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Biggest IT Companies in the World, we took the 15 largest companies by market capitalization in the IT sector from the S&amp;P 500 as of 11/5.15 Biggest IT Companies in the World15. salesforce.com, inc.

As we progressed PayPal through the Mayar Checklist Process, we identified a business with a leadership position in a structurally growing market.The company benefits from certain network effects and faces several competitive threats at the same time. As the business profited from the move to online retail during the pandemic, as well as from the stimulus cheques handed out in the US, the stock price soared to absurd levels. As so often happens, however, the market had overcorrected by February and this quarter was offering prospective shareholders prices that assumed essentially zero growth in the business.

The company earns 80% gross margins and grows 20% organically. Plus, virtually all of its revenue is recurring. We see Salesforce as a great business that we’ve admired from afar for a long time. More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Suggested Articles:11 Best Mineral Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Momentum Stocks To Invest In11 Safe Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsDisclosure.

If you want to see more of the biggest IT companies in the world, go directly to 5 Biggest IT Companies in the World.According to market research firm Gartner, Information Technology or IT, ""is the common term for the entire spectrum of technologies for information processing, including software, hardware, communications technologies and related services.""Given the growth in the computer, smartphone, and internet industry over the past three decades, the IT sector is the biggest sector in the market today. In terms of one of the most popular ETFs that track the S&amp;P 500, the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO), the IT sector is largest sector by ETF weight with the sector accounting for 26.4% of the ETF as of 9/30/22. That compares to 15.1% in the healthcare sector and 11.7% in the consumer discretionary for the ETF, which are the second and third heaviest weight sectors.Many of the world's largest companies are also IT companies. Microsoft, for example makes software for computers to process information while Apple make smartphone hardware and software.IT Sector GrowthIn the last three decades, the IT sector has benefited from Moore's Law and the emergence of the internet. With Moore's law, semiconductors have become cheaper and smaller over time, allowing more people to afford computers and smartphones. With the emergence of the internet, more websites/apps have reached the scale needed to produce useful services for people with computers and smartphones. With more services, the internet, computers, and smartphones become more useful.Given the cycle, computer hardware companies have benefited from more demand and computer software companies have benefited from more potential customers. Similarly, smartphone companies have sold a lot more smartphones and internet/app companies have benefited from having more potential users.Although Moore's law was just a rule of thumb and is no longer possible due to physics, computers and smartphones are now cheap enough that most of the world can afford them. With future economic growth, potential subsidies, and satellite internet, it may be possible for anyone in the world to afford a computing device and connect to the internet if they choose to a decade or two from now.Story continuesIn addition to more users that could fuel more growth in the IT sector, the sector could also benefit from the emergence of new technologies.McKinsey writes, ""The emergence of cloud and 5G, for example, exponentially increases compute power and network speeds that can enable greater innovation. Developments in the metaverse of augmented and virtual reality open the doors to virtual R&amp;D via digital twins, for example, and immersive learning. Advances in AI, machine learning, and software 2.0 (machine-written code) bring a range of new services and products, from autonomous vehicles to connected homes, well within reach.""2022Given high inflation, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times in 2022 alone. As a result, the federal funds rate is now 3.75% to 4%, which is considered by many economists as 'restrictive' that could slow economic growth.Given that many analysts think the U.S central bank will raise rates further, the potential for a recession has increased substantially.Given the uncertainty, tech stocks have declined substantially and it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Biggest IT Companies in the World, we took the 15 largest companies by market capitalization in the IT sector from the S&amp;P 500 as of 11/5.15 Biggest IT Companies in the World15. salesforce.com, inc.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 insurance companies in USA.The United States is the biggest insurance market in the world by far by premium volume, making up around 40% of the total global premiums written. The history of the insurance industry in the country is vast and rich, with Benjamin Frankling himself also forming a mutual insurance company known as the Philadelphia Contributorship in 1752 and is actually the oldest still operating insurance carrier in the country. There are three types of insurance sectors operating in the United States: property/casualty, life/annuity and private health insurance. Property/casualty insurance deals with insurance pertaining to home, commercial and auto insurance. Meanwhile, life/annuity deals with life insurance in addition to annuity products. However, we'd first like to discuss health insurance in the United States.Biggest Insurance Companies in the Worldaustin-distel-jpHw8ndwJ_Q-unsplashPrivate health insurance in the United States is extremely interesting; it is the only developed country in the world to not have social healthcare which is where private insurance comes in. In the U.S., healthcare is often tied to employment with employers providing health insurance to their employees rather than the government. Instead of a basic right, health coverage is a privilege or incentive in the country. While there have been attempts to nationalize healthcare in the country, they have not been successful at all. If you are not insured in the U.S., then only luck can help you out in most cases. Hospitals often overbill people significantly and even normal prices in the U.S. for procedures, medicine, surgeries and hospital charges are much higher than in most other countries. Hospitals overcharge so that they can then negotiate with insurers who can make the hospitals reduce their bills. On the other hand, the average uninsured person neither has the time nor the wherewithal to challenge hospitals and are stuck paying incredibly expensive bills which can cripple their financial situation. Of course, there are many companies which earn billions of dollars at the expense of the health of the average person and many of these make our list of the top insurance companies in the U.S. as well.Story continuesThe property/casualty sector in the insurance industry makes up around 53% of the total premiums underwritten while life/annuity accounted for 47%. Healthcare insurance is incorporated within these two sectors and not measured separately. Net premiums in 2021 were $1.4 trillion according to the Insurance Information Institute while providing employment to more than 2.8 million people, according to the Department of Labor. However, the insurance industry's outlook isn't as rosy considering that the world seems to be imminently heading into a recession while inflation is seeing record highs in many countries in 2022. This is leading to challenge of generating profits from underwriting exists in such an economic situation and the requirement of the top insurance companies in the USA needing to adapt the latest technology and overhaul their systems to improve efficiency and cut costs where possible.There are 74 insurance companies included in the Fortune 500 2022 list. This shows the importance of the industry to the biggest economy in the world, recording $1.84 trillion in revenue in 2021 with profits of around $125 billion. The assets held by these giants are worth around $9.6 trillion providing employment to around 1.5 million people. To determine our ranking for the top insurance companies in the USA, we considered revenue, profits, assets and the number of employees each company has. We assigned 30% weightage to the first two criteria and 20% weightage to the next two. Using multiple criteria allows us to come up with more accurate rankings rather than just ranking a company based on its revenue alone. We also excluded Berkshire Hathaway from our calculation as while it is involved in insurance, it is primarily a financial services and investment company. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the giants of the insurance industry, starting with number 15:15.

Sports betting is one factor in Rupert Murdoch's proposal to recombine Fox with News Corp, according to people familiar with the deal's logic.Independent directors within both media companies are evaluating the proposal, which would be subject to approval by a majority of non-family shareholders.The Murdochs' early foray into sports betting has been slow-going. The sports betting app Fox Bet is available in four states, with just 0.2% share of the U.S. market, according to researcher Vixio. A free version called Fox Bet Super 6 has attracted some 6 million users whom Fox hopes to eventually convert to betters.The growth of Fox Bet has stagnated since Flutter acquired Stars Group, the company that helped launch Fox Bet and owns and operates the app.Fox claimed that Flutter failed to provide reasonable resources behind Fox Bet, a claim Flutter said the arbitrator rejected, finding that Flutter had agreed to commit ""commercially reasonable"" resources behind the offering.However, Fox retains the right to acquire up to 50% of the Stars Group's U.S. operations, which includes Fox Bet, though it would need to obtain necessary sports betting licenses.(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski; Editing by Leslie Adler, David Gregorio, Muralikumar Anantharaman and Diane Craft)]"

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Walt Disney Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.67bUS$8.98bUS$12.2bUS$14.6bUS$16.4bUS$17.9bUS$19.1bUS$20.2bUS$21.1bUS$21.9bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x8Analyst x4Analyst x1Est @ 12.2%Est @ 9.13%Est @ 6.99%Est @ 5.48%Est @ 4.43%Est @ 3.7% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$6.2kUS$7.8kUS$9.8kUS$10.9kUS$11.4kUS$11.6kUS$11.5kUS$11.3kUS$11.0kUS$10.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$102bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$22b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.0%) = US$404bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$404b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$196bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$298b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$99.6, the company appears quite undervalued at a 39% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Walt Disney as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.076. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 80% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Colgate-Palmolive, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Colgate-Palmolive?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Colgate-Palmolive already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Colgate-Palmolive, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Colgate-Palmolive. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.3% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.8% and 5.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 24 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Colgate-PalmoliveThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Colgate-Palmolive Company in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$62m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 20% stake in Colgate-Palmolive. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Colgate-Palmolive .Ultimately the future is most important.

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 biggest insurance companies in the world.The global insurance industry is among the biggest industries in the world and is in fact among the five biggest industries in the world. The insurance industry has faced massive pressure from the global pandemic which enveloped the world in 2020 and has been aiming to recover since, with premiums declining to a growth rate of just 1.2% as compared to an average growth of 4% per year in the previous decade. Profits fell by around 15% when compared to the previous year with the Asia Pacific region being the worst-affected, declining by 36% with the rest of the world not faring much better.However, most governments went into recovery mode to stimulate their economy and 2021 ended up being a good year for most insurance companies according to a report by McKinsey &amp; Company in 2022 especially considering global insurance gross premiums. Despite the optimism, it is important to note that the insurance industry has been facing issues even before the pandemic. The industry has been facing headwinds on revenue growth driven by pricing pressures, slow organic demand and finally, low interest rates. The last issue should not be relevant any longer considering how interest rates have been at record-highs during 2022 and are expected to remain high in 2023 as governments attempt to combat record inflation even as threats of a recession loom.biggest insurance companies in the worldIakov Filimonov/Shutterstock.comAccording to a Deloitte report looking at insurance outlook for 2023, the industry currently stands at crossroads to long-term success. While most insurance companies have shown remarkable resilience not to mention flexibility in terms of global challenges such as the aforementioned pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there are still several additional challenges that the company will have to counter such as increasing inflation, the threat of a recession, climate change and of course, the ever-changing geopolitical scenario which affects global operations. To be able to combat these issues and concerns, insurance companies will have to continue building on what they've achieved in 2021 especially in terms of technological developments, with Deloitte suggesting that such companies shouldn't just engage in basic technological transition but should integrate with it fully and realize the benefits that such an integration would have to offer. Further improvements can be made in terms of in ""proactively anticipating and fulfilling distributor and policyholder expectations; and broaden their historical focus from risk and cost reduction to prioritize greater levels of experimentation and risk-taking that drives ongoing innovation, competitive differentiation, and profitable growth.""Story continuesThe Global Fortune 500 list has 40 insurance companies, one of the highest number of entries from any industry. The 15 biggest insurance companies in the world recorded close to $1.8 trillion in revenue, $98 billion in profits, and holder over $12.7 trillion in assets while providing employment to more than $2 million. To rank the biggest insurance companies in the world, we used Fortune 500 Global to determine the revenue, profits, assets and employees of each company. We then assigned 40% weightage to their ranking based on revenue and profits each, while 20% weightage was assigned to assets and employees. Based on this, we came up with a more accurate overall list of the biggest insurance companies in the world which isn't dependent on just one specific criterion.

If you want to see more of the biggest IT companies in the world, go directly to 5 Biggest IT Companies in the World.According to market research firm Gartner, Information Technology or IT, ""is the common term for the entire spectrum of technologies for information processing, including software, hardware, communications technologies and related services.""Given the growth in the computer, smartphone, and internet industry over the past three decades, the IT sector is the biggest sector in the market today. In terms of one of the most popular ETFs that track the S&amp;P 500, the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO), the IT sector is largest sector by ETF weight with the sector accounting for 26.4% of the ETF as of 9/30/22. That compares to 15.1% in the healthcare sector and 11.7% in the consumer discretionary for the ETF, which are the second and third heaviest weight sectors.Many of the world's largest companies are also IT companies. Microsoft, for example makes software for computers to process information while Apple make smartphone hardware and software.IT Sector GrowthIn the last three decades, the IT sector has benefited from Moore's Law and the emergence of the internet. With Moore's law, semiconductors have become cheaper and smaller over time, allowing more people to afford computers and smartphones. With the emergence of the internet, more websites/apps have reached the scale needed to produce useful services for people with computers and smartphones. With more services, the internet, computers, and smartphones become more useful.Given the cycle, computer hardware companies have benefited from more demand and computer software companies have benefited from more potential customers. Similarly, smartphone companies have sold a lot more smartphones and internet/app companies have benefited from having more potential users.Although Moore's law was just a rule of thumb and is no longer possible due to physics, computers and smartphones are now cheap enough that most of the world can afford them. With future economic growth, potential subsidies, and satellite internet, it may be possible for anyone in the world to afford a computing device and connect to the internet if they choose to a decade or two from now.Story continuesIn addition to more users that could fuel more growth in the IT sector, the sector could also benefit from the emergence of new technologies.McKinsey writes, ""The emergence of cloud and 5G, for example, exponentially increases compute power and network speeds that can enable greater innovation. Developments in the metaverse of augmented and virtual reality open the doors to virtual R&amp;D via digital twins, for example, and immersive learning. Advances in AI, machine learning, and software 2.0 (machine-written code) bring a range of new services and products, from autonomous vehicles to connected homes, well within reach.""2022Given high inflation, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times in 2022 alone. As a result, the federal funds rate is now 3.75% to 4%, which is considered by many economists as 'restrictive' that could slow economic growth.Given that many analysts think the U.S central bank will raise rates further, the potential for a recession has increased substantially.Given the uncertainty, tech stocks have declined substantially and it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Biggest IT Companies in the World, we took the 15 largest companies by market capitalization in the IT sector from the S&amp;P 500 as of 11/5.15 Biggest IT Companies in the World15. salesforce.com, inc.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for McDonald's The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$7.44bUS$8.83bUS$9.02bUS$9.97bUS$10.6bUS$11.2bUS$11.7bUS$12.1bUS$12.5bUS$12.9bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 6.78%Est @ 5.34%Est @ 4.33%Est @ 3.63%Est @ 3.13%Est @ 2.79% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$6.9kUS$7.6kUS$7.2kUS$7.4kUS$7.4kUS$7.2kUS$7.0kUS$6.7kUS$6.5kUS$6.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$70bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$13b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.0%) = US$233bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$233b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$112bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$182b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$275, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at McDonald's as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.096. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For McDonald's, we've compiled three important aspects you should further research:Risks: To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with McDonald's .Future Earnings: How does MCD's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.4% in the week, snapping a four-week winning streak. The S&amp;P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite shed 3.4% and 5.7%, respectively, breaking a two-week winning run.Treasury yields continued to rise in the apprehension of an economic slowdown, with the U.S. 10-year benchmark yield marking its 13th weekly gain in the last 14 weeks. Investors remained concerned about economic data, which is still not convincing enough for the Fed to contemplate going slow on its rate hikes.Moreover, Fed Chair Jerome Powell asked the market on Wednesday to stop obsessing over how fast the rates were rising and focus instead on the levels they were reaching. Interpreting this as a pushback from the recent dovish signs from the Fed, markets fell.Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market.

To skip our analysis of the recent market trends and activity, you can go directly to 5 Best Freight Stocks to Buy Now.The transportation industry creates value by moving goods and people and comprises multiple components such as airlines, railways, trucking, light vehicles, and maritime shipping, among others.According to a report published by Deloitte, during the past two years, the transportation chain was severely impacted due to the pandemic. In addition to lockdowns and sickness, supply of goods was also disrupted. As a result, capacity on container vessels decreased and container rates skyrocketed. Similarly, airfreight demand also picked up. The disruption in global supply chain raised awareness for local sourcing to avoid disruptions. According to the report, there will be no major capacity-related issues in the upcoming 3 years as the capacity is increasing.The railroad network, one of the most important components of the transportation industry in the United States, has been under scrutiny from railroad workers. In September, railroads and workers’ unions reached a tentative agreement to avert a national rail strike. On October 10, the third largest railroad union rejected its deal which has once again renewed the possibility of a nationwide strike.The transportation industry and the freight stocks that are part of this industry have not fared well in the recent past. The Dow Jones Transportation Average index, a 20-stock, price weighted index that represents stock performance of large, well-known transportation industry stocks, was down year-to-date by nearly 23%, as of October 13, 2022.Global markets have been going through a rough patch with fears of a recession due to inflation and aggressive monetary policies implemented by central banks. The Consumer Price Index increased 0.4% in September against the 0.3% estimate, while headline inflation was up by 8.2%, more than the 8.1% estimates. The higher-than-expected inflation figures have raised concerns about another 75-bps interest rate hike by the Fed in December.Story continues10 Best Freight Stocks to Buy NowMethodologyWe took the 20 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Transportation Average index.

(NYSE: NI) today announced actions it plans to take based on its previously announced business review, an extension to its long-term growth plan, and a 2040 net zero goal that puts it among the industry leaders, as it positions itself for a future of continued top-tier financial performance, safety and sustainability. The company will share details at an Investor Day event today at the New York Stock Exchange.NiSource Inc. (NYSE: NI) is one of the largest fully-regulated utility companies in the United States, serving approximately 3.2 million natural gas customers and 500,000 electric customers across six states through its local Columbia Gas and NIPSCO brands. NiSource’s approximately 7,500 employees are focused on safely delivering reliable and affordable energy to our customers and communities we serve. NiSource is a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability - North America Index.Business review identifies performance improvement opportunities and strategic initiatives to strengthen the companyThe business review initiated in February 2022 has identified opportunities to drive value to all stakeholders while maintaining service that is affordable for customers. Acting on the review, the company intends to sell a minority interest in its NIPSCO business.""Our commitment to Indiana remains unchanged. This financial mechanism will have no impact on NIPSCO's strategic direction in the state or on our commitment to our customers,"" said Lloyd Yates, president and CEO. ""A minority sale provides a financially efficient opportunity to strengthen our balance sheet and provides flexibility to finance our growth investments as we continue to invest in and serve our customers.""In addition to strengthening the balance sheet, the proposed minority sale, when completed, is expected to minimize future external capital market needs and is expected to eliminate all equity needs until at least 2025, at which time a modest ATM program is expected to be put in place to maintain credit metrics as growth investments continue.The review also identified opportunities to optimize NiSource's cost profile and approach to work. These opportunities will increase productivity through improved processes and technology while enhancing safety, customer service, employee experience, and will reduce the company's overall cost profile.Story continuesThe scope of the business review included: benchmarking of other utilities, assessments of legislative and regulatory support for long term investments in each of NiSource's states, robust analysis of options to optimally finance the growth plan (including portfolio optimization), and strategic merger and acquisition opportunities. The review concluded that the company's existing diverse portfolio of businesses best positions NiSource for long-term value creation. Among the strengths cited were the company's record of regulatory execution, significant scale and geographic diversity across six constructive Midwestern-centric states, and the advantage of having both electric and gas businesses.Extension to growth planThe extended growth plan announced today is expected to produce a sustainable annual growth rate of 6-8% in net operating earnings per diluted share from 2021 through 2027. This growth rate is among the best as compared to premium valued utilities. The plan includes approximately $15 billion in investments from 2023 through 2027, including renewable energy and infrastructure modernization, driving reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, enhanced safety and reliable service.""Backed by a strengthened balance sheet and a long runway of investment opportunities, our growth plan provides a compelling, best-in-class, 9-11% total shareholder return proposition,"" Yates said. ""We intend to move forward on the near and long-term opportunities uncovered by our thorough and open-minded business review. This new long-term, sustainable growth plan provides more moderate and predictable impacts to customer bills, while continuing to support our strong focus on safety, reliability and sustainability.""Net zero 2040 goalNiSource continues to advance its sustainability plan by announcing a net zero goal which places it among the industry leaders: reaching net zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. Achieving this goal will require supportive regulatory and legislative policies, favorable stakeholder environments and advancement of technologies that are not currently economical to deploy.The goal is the next step on a path that has already resulted in a reduction of approximately 58% in Scope 1 emissions since 2005, on the way to an interim target of 90% by 2030. The company intends to retire its last coal-fired generating units by 2026-2028, replaced by generation that is more sustainable, reliable and lower-cost. NiSource has also made significant cuts in methane emissions, with a target of 50% by 2025, driven by replacement of aging gas infrastructure.""Sustainability is a core value for NiSource, and our net zero by 2040 goal continues our record of leadership through action in this area,"" Yates said. ""As we develop innovative, new pathways to reduce emissions – including hydrogen, renewable natural gas and emerging technologies – we will continue our ongoing infrastructure modernization, renewable electric generation investments and other strategies responsible for the significant reduction in emissions we have already achieved.""A link to the webcast of today's Investor Day event is available on the company's website at nisource.com/InvestorDay2022.  About NiSourceNiSource Inc.

145,927bad11-b73b-357d-b4c8-ad0ddd23c0a0,NI,2022-11-07,Here's Why NiSource (NYSE:NI) Has Caught The Eye Of Investors,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-nisource-nyse-ni-100128263.html,1667815288,STORY,['NIMC'],"[Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like NiSource (NYSE:NI). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for NiSource How Fast Is NiSource Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Investors and investment funds chase profits, and that means share prices tend rise with positive earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So for many budding investors, improving EPS is considered a good sign. It's an outstanding feat for NiSource to have grown EPS from US$0.55 to US$1.64 in just one year. When you see earnings grow that quickly, it often means good things ahead for the company. This could point to the business hitting a point of inflection.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Our analysis has highlighted that NiSource's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. EBIT margins for NiSource remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 17% to US$5.4b. That's a real positive.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for NiSource's future profits.Story continuesAre NiSource Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since NiSource has a market capitalisation of US$11b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. To be specific, they have US$47m worth of shares. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. While their ownership only accounts for 0.4%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to NiSource, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$13m.The NiSource CEO received total compensation of just US$252k in the year to December 2021. That's clearly well below average, so at a glance that arrangement seems generous to shareholders and points to a modest remuneration culture. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Should You Add NiSource To Your Watchlist?NiSource's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. The sweetener is that insiders have a mountain of stock, and the CEO remuneration is quite reasonable. The sharp increase in earnings could signal good business momentum. Big growth can make big winners, so the writing on the wall tells us that NiSource is worth considering carefully. Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for NiSource (1 is significant)  you should be aware of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Most Undervalued Stocks to Buy Now.Evercore ISI Analyst: “Post-Midterms Tend To Be Very Good For Stocks”On November 3, senior managing director at Evercore ISI, Julian Emanuel, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed the market volatility we have had in 2022 and what he sees for stocks ahead. Julian Emanuel noted that “the Fed basically came out sounding more hawkish than expected” and that rising bond yields and a strong dollar led to a major sell-off in the “yield-sensitive growth sector”. Here are some comments from Julian Emanuel about what he sees for equities moving into 2023:“When you think about a year like this year, the ups, the downs, the rollercoasters, centered around these macro relationships… You’re likely to get a new bear market low at some point in the next six to twelve months. But given the volatility that we see and the potential for a cessation in the uptrend in yields, sometime as the Fed backs away-they will eventually back away- you could actually get a good market next year because history says that post-midterms tend to be very good for stocks among other reasons.”Julian Emanuel thinks that “there’s a bit more room in terms of value outperformance” and is bullish on “financials, healthcare, and energy”. Julian Emanuel said that “growth is arguably still overvalued relative to value” and that “as a long-term investor, you need to be prepared to buy down another 10% and then another 10% after that.”As of November 4, the S&amp;P 500 has dropped 22.3% year to date, the Nasdaq has shed 35% of its value since the beginning of the year, and the Dow is down 12.38% for the year.

If you want to see more of the biggest aerospace companies in the world, go directly to 5 Biggest Aerospace Companies in the World.In the last few decades, the aerospace industry has grown substantially thanks to increasing commercial air travel and increasing defense spending.In the next few decades, the commercial aerospace industry is expected to grow substantially.According to a global market forecast from Airbus in 2022, there are expected to be around 39,500 new passenger and freighter aircraft deliveries over 2022 to 2041. While global GDP is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 2.6% from 2019 to 2041, passenger traffic is expected to grow by a CAGR of 3.6% during that span. Freight traffic is expected to increase at a CAGR of 3.2% during the same time period.As the world economy expands, demand for passenger air travel is expected to rise. As world trade increases, demand for air cargo is expected to rise too.Similarly, the defense aerospace industry is also expected to grow. According to PwC estimates, the industry is expected to grow modestly in 2022 before growing faster in 2023.SpaceAerospace companies are increasingly moving into space as well.In terms of space, space satellites have already offered substantial benefits such as GPS, weather reports, and also fast communication.Lockheed Martin VP of Commercial Civil Space Lisa Callahan describes the benefits,GPS is about a $300 billion per year business here on Earth, and since its inception it’s estimated to have generated $1.4 trillion in the US alone. Just look at the rideshare industry, which is a $60 billion business annually, and all thanks to space assets providing those GPS signals. Weather is very similar, with the US weather satellite market worth $162 billion a year, with space assets totaling about 77 percent of that. So space is really playing a huge role in the economy here on Earth.Story continuesIn terms of the future, there will likely be substantial more benefits for the economies and companies that succeed in terms of commercializing space. Space tourism and satellite internet are industries that have already begun, and economically harnessing solar energy, mining asteroid resources, and colonizing Mars look increasingly achievable in the future.Given that leading aerospace companies have the technology and expertise to make those industries possible, they could potentially realize substantial economic benefits if they successfully commercialize their opportunity.Given the distances to space, realizing the potential of space is extremely difficult and there is no guarantee of success. Successfully lowering costs to space, and ensuring safety are both very important.2022Given the pandemic, commercial air travel decreased substantially in 2020 and many commercial aircraft manufacturers have not fully recovered from the decreasing airplane orders. With the high inflation, the Federal Reserve has also increased the benchmark federal funds rate to 3.75% to 4% from around 0% in the beginning of the year. According to the Fed's current projections, the rates could rise to 4.5% to 4.75% in 2023.With the higher rates, the global economic growth is expected to slow substantially and aerospace companies, like many other companies, could face near term headwinds as a result.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Pixabay/Public DomainMethodologyFor our list of 15 Biggest Aerospace Companies in the World, we took the top 15 companies by revenue from flightglobal.com's Top 100 aerospace companies ranked by revenue.For our 2021 aerospace revenue, we used data from flightglobal.com.15 Biggest Aerospace Companies in the World15.

If you want to see more of the biggest aerospace companies in the world, go directly to 5 Biggest Aerospace Companies in the World.In the last few decades, the aerospace industry has grown substantially thanks to increasing commercial air travel and increasing defense spending.In the next few decades, the commercial aerospace industry is expected to grow substantially.According to a global market forecast from Airbus in 2022, there are expected to be around 39,500 new passenger and freighter aircraft deliveries over 2022 to 2041. While global GDP is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 2.6% from 2019 to 2041, passenger traffic is expected to grow by a CAGR of 3.6% during that span. Freight traffic is expected to increase at a CAGR of 3.2% during the same time period.As the world economy expands, demand for passenger air travel is expected to rise. As world trade increases, demand for air cargo is expected to rise too.Similarly, the defense aerospace industry is also expected to grow. According to PwC estimates, the industry is expected to grow modestly in 2022 before growing faster in 2023.SpaceAerospace companies are increasingly moving into space as well.In terms of space, space satellites have already offered substantial benefits such as GPS, weather reports, and also fast communication.Lockheed Martin VP of Commercial Civil Space Lisa Callahan describes the benefits,GPS is about a $300 billion per year business here on Earth, and since its inception it’s estimated to have generated $1.4 trillion in the US alone. Just look at the rideshare industry, which is a $60 billion business annually, and all thanks to space assets providing those GPS signals. Weather is very similar, with the US weather satellite market worth $162 billion a year, with space assets totaling about 77 percent of that. So space is really playing a huge role in the economy here on Earth.Story continuesIn terms of the future, there will likely be substantial more benefits for the economies and companies that succeed in terms of commercializing space. Space tourism and satellite internet are industries that have already begun, and economically harnessing solar energy, mining asteroid resources, and colonizing Mars look increasingly achievable in the future.Given that leading aerospace companies have the technology and expertise to make those industries possible, they could potentially realize substantial economic benefits if they successfully commercialize their opportunity.Given the distances to space, realizing the potential of space is extremely difficult and there is no guarantee of success. Successfully lowering costs to space, and ensuring safety are both very important.2022Given the pandemic, commercial air travel decreased substantially in 2020 and many commercial aircraft manufacturers have not fully recovered from the decreasing airplane orders. With the high inflation, the Federal Reserve has also increased the benchmark federal funds rate to 3.75% to 4% from around 0% in the beginning of the year. According to the Fed's current projections, the rates could rise to 4.5% to 4.75% in 2023.With the higher rates, the global economic growth is expected to slow substantially and aerospace companies, like many other companies, could face near term headwinds as a result.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Pixabay/Public DomainMethodologyFor our list of 15 Biggest Aerospace Companies in the World, we took the top 15 companies by revenue from flightglobal.com's Top 100 aerospace companies ranked by revenue.For our 2021 aerospace revenue, we used data from flightglobal.com.15 Biggest Aerospace Companies in the World15.

158,1381386e-af2c-371a-affb-fe1de50f1ca2,PGR,2022-11-07,Can The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) Performance Keep Up Given Its Mixed Bag Of Fundamentals?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/progressive-corporation-nyse-pgr-performance-120141049.html,1667822501,STORY,['PGR'],"[Progressive's (NYSE:PGR) stock up by 6.9% over the past three months. However, we decided to study the company's mixed-bag of fundamentals to assess what this could mean for future share prices, as stock prices tend to be aligned with a company's long-term financial performance. In this article, we decided to focus on Progressive's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Progressive How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Progressive is:5.8% = US$857m ÷ US$15b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.06.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Progressive's Earnings Growth And 5.8% ROEWhen you first look at it, Progressive's ROE doesn't look that attractive. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 11%. Progressive was still able to see a decent net income growth of 7.1% over the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesWe then compared Progressive's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 12% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is PGR worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether PGR is currently mispriced by the market.Is Progressive Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Progressive has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 50%, meaning that it is left with only 50% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.Additionally, Progressive has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 40% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 23% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.ConclusionIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Progressive's performance. Although the company has shown a fair bit of growth in earnings, the reinvestment rate is low. Meaning, the earnings growth number could have been significantly higher had the company been retaining more of its profits and reinvesting that at a higher rate of return. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 insurance companies in USA.The United States is the biggest insurance market in the world by far by premium volume, making up around 40% of the total global premiums written. The history of the insurance industry in the country is vast and rich, with Benjamin Frankling himself also forming a mutual insurance company known as the Philadelphia Contributorship in 1752 and is actually the oldest still operating insurance carrier in the country. There are three types of insurance sectors operating in the United States: property/casualty, life/annuity and private health insurance. Property/casualty insurance deals with insurance pertaining to home, commercial and auto insurance. Meanwhile, life/annuity deals with life insurance in addition to annuity products. However, we'd first like to discuss health insurance in the United States.Biggest Insurance Companies in the Worldaustin-distel-jpHw8ndwJ_Q-unsplashPrivate health insurance in the United States is extremely interesting; it is the only developed country in the world to not have social healthcare which is where private insurance comes in. In the U.S., healthcare is often tied to employment with employers providing health insurance to their employees rather than the government. Instead of a basic right, health coverage is a privilege or incentive in the country. While there have been attempts to nationalize healthcare in the country, they have not been successful at all. If you are not insured in the U.S., then only luck can help you out in most cases. Hospitals often overbill people significantly and even normal prices in the U.S. for procedures, medicine, surgeries and hospital charges are much higher than in most other countries. Hospitals overcharge so that they can then negotiate with insurers who can make the hospitals reduce their bills. On the other hand, the average uninsured person neither has the time nor the wherewithal to challenge hospitals and are stuck paying incredibly expensive bills which can cripple their financial situation. Of course, there are many companies which earn billions of dollars at the expense of the health of the average person and many of these make our list of the top insurance companies in the U.S. as well.Story continuesThe property/casualty sector in the insurance industry makes up around 53% of the total premiums underwritten while life/annuity accounted for 47%. Healthcare insurance is incorporated within these two sectors and not measured separately. Net premiums in 2021 were $1.4 trillion according to the Insurance Information Institute while providing employment to more than 2.8 million people, according to the Department of Labor. However, the insurance industry's outlook isn't as rosy considering that the world seems to be imminently heading into a recession while inflation is seeing record highs in many countries in 2022. This is leading to challenge of generating profits from underwriting exists in such an economic situation and the requirement of the top insurance companies in the USA needing to adapt the latest technology and overhaul their systems to improve efficiency and cut costs where possible.There are 74 insurance companies included in the Fortune 500 2022 list. This shows the importance of the industry to the biggest economy in the world, recording $1.84 trillion in revenue in 2021 with profits of around $125 billion. The assets held by these giants are worth around $9.6 trillion providing employment to around 1.5 million people. To determine our ranking for the top insurance companies in the USA, we considered revenue, profits, assets and the number of employees each company has. We assigned 30% weightage to the first two criteria and 20% weightage to the next two. Using multiple criteria allows us to come up with more accurate rankings rather than just ranking a company based on its revenue alone. We also excluded Berkshire Hathaway from our calculation as while it is involved in insurance, it is primarily a financial services and investment company. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the giants of the insurance industry, starting with number 15:15.

(NASDAQ:ADP)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-automatic-data-130011765.html,1667826011,STORY,['ADP'],"[Does the November share price for Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing Is Automatic Data Processing Fairly Valued?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.39bUS$4.43bUS$5.15bUS$5.08bUS$5.37bUS$5.59bUS$5.79bUS$5.96bUS$6.12bUS$6.28bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.15%Est @ 3.5%Est @ 3.04%Est @ 2.72%Est @ 2.5% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$4.1kUS$3.9kUS$4.2kUS$3.8kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.6kUS$3.4kUS$3.3kUS$3.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$37bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.0%) = US$123bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$123b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$61bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$98b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$237, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Automatic Data Processing as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.017. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

If you want to see more of the biggest IT companies in the world, go directly to 5 Biggest IT Companies in the World.According to market research firm Gartner, Information Technology or IT, ""is the common term for the entire spectrum of technologies for information processing, including software, hardware, communications technologies and related services.""Given the growth in the computer, smartphone, and internet industry over the past three decades, the IT sector is the biggest sector in the market today. In terms of one of the most popular ETFs that track the S&amp;P 500, the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO), the IT sector is largest sector by ETF weight with the sector accounting for 26.4% of the ETF as of 9/30/22. That compares to 15.1% in the healthcare sector and 11.7% in the consumer discretionary for the ETF, which are the second and third heaviest weight sectors.Many of the world's largest companies are also IT companies. Microsoft, for example makes software for computers to process information while Apple make smartphone hardware and software.IT Sector GrowthIn the last three decades, the IT sector has benefited from Moore's Law and the emergence of the internet. With Moore's law, semiconductors have become cheaper and smaller over time, allowing more people to afford computers and smartphones. With the emergence of the internet, more websites/apps have reached the scale needed to produce useful services for people with computers and smartphones. With more services, the internet, computers, and smartphones become more useful.Given the cycle, computer hardware companies have benefited from more demand and computer software companies have benefited from more potential customers. Similarly, smartphone companies have sold a lot more smartphones and internet/app companies have benefited from having more potential users.Although Moore's law was just a rule of thumb and is no longer possible due to physics, computers and smartphones are now cheap enough that most of the world can afford them. With future economic growth, potential subsidies, and satellite internet, it may be possible for anyone in the world to afford a computing device and connect to the internet if they choose to a decade or two from now.Story continuesIn addition to more users that could fuel more growth in the IT sector, the sector could also benefit from the emergence of new technologies.McKinsey writes, ""The emergence of cloud and 5G, for example, exponentially increases compute power and network speeds that can enable greater innovation. Developments in the metaverse of augmented and virtual reality open the doors to virtual R&amp;D via digital twins, for example, and immersive learning. Advances in AI, machine learning, and software 2.0 (machine-written code) bring a range of new services and products, from autonomous vehicles to connected homes, well within reach.""2022Given high inflation, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times in 2022 alone. As a result, the federal funds rate is now 3.75% to 4%, which is considered by many economists as 'restrictive' that could slow economic growth.Given that many analysts think the U.S central bank will raise rates further, the potential for a recession has increased substantially.Given the uncertainty, tech stocks have declined substantially and it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 15 Biggest IT Companies in the World, we took the 15 largest companies by market capitalization in the IT sector from the S&amp;P 500 as of 11/5.15 Biggest IT Companies in the World15. salesforce.com, inc.
