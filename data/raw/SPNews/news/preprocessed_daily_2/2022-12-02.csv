Shares have added about 8.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Verisk due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts. Verisk's Q3 Earnings Match EstimatesVerisk Analytics reported mixed third-quarter 2022 results, wherein earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same.Adjusted earnings per share (excluding 26 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.46 meet the consensus mark but grew 1.4% on a year-over-year basis. The upside was backed by growth in the Insurance segment and a lower average share count.Revenues of $745.3 million missed the consensus estimate by 1.6% and decreased 1.8% year over year on a reported basis but increased 4.8% on an organic constant-currency (cc) basis. The revenue decline was primarily due to the sale of the environmental health and safety business (3E), and Verisk Financial Services.Segmental PerformanceThe Insurance segment’s revenues totaled $610.1 million, up 9.4% year over year on a reported basis and 5.3% on an organic cc basis.Within the segment, underwriting and rating revenues of $436.2 million rose 11.7% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic cc basis. The upside was primarily driven by an annual increase in prices derived from the continued enhancements of the content of solutions within the industry-standard insurance programs and the sale of expanded solutions to the existing customers in commercial and personal lines. In addition, extreme event and life solutions contributed to growth.Claims revenues amounted to $173.9 million, improving 3.9% on a reported basis and 2.4% on an organic cc basis. The top line was primarily driven by growth in claims analytics solutions and in repair cost estimation solutions.Story continuesThe Energy and Specialized Markets segment’s revenues of $135.2 million decreased 18.5% year over year on a reported basis but increased 2.5% on an organic cc basis. The fall in revenues was primarily due to the sale of the 3E business that closed on Mar 11, 2022, and the suspension of commercial operations in Russia. However, organic cc growth was driven by modest growth in research revenues.Operating ResultsAdjusted EBITDA of $383.5 million increased 1.2% on a reported basis and 6% on an organic cc basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 51.5% from 49.9% in the prior-year quarter.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowVerisk exited third-quarter 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $276.8 million compared with $480.7 million at the end of the prior-year quarter. Long-term debt was $2.34 billion, flat with the prior-year quarter’s level. Verisk generated $280.2 million of cash from operating activities, while capex was $65.8 million. Free cash flow was $214.4 million.Share Repurchase &amp; Dividend PayoutDuring the quarter, Verisk paid out a total cash dividend of $48.6 million. It bought back 1.6 million shares at an average price of $187.08 for a total cost of $300 million. As of Sep 30, 2022, VRSK had $407.5 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -19.96% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Verisk has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Verisk has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerVerisk belongs to the Zacks Business - Information Services industry. Another stock from the same industry, S&amp;P Global (SPGI), has gained 13.5% over the past month.

As we head into the end of the year, there's another tech name that investors should pay attention today, as it just landed on Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White's list of the 25 best stocks to own this month. Specifically, computer hardware concern Western Digital Corp (NASDAQ:WDC) stands at number three of the best performing stocks in December.According to White's data, Western Digital stock has averaged a December gain of 9.4% over the past 10 years, and has finished with a positive monthly eight of those times. A comparable move from WDC's current perch of $36.30 would put the equity just shy of $40, or levels not seen since the stock's mid-November breakout.Best of December WDC December 012022On the charts, Western Digital stock has had a rough go of it in recent months.

WDC, Thoughtworks Holding Inc. TWKS and DASAN Zhone Solutions, Inc DZSI.4 Toxic Stocks Hazardous Moreso Amid Volatile TimesThe U.S. equity markets have witnessed extreme volatility this year amid the Fed's hawkish stance, the Russia-Ukraine war and inflationary concerns. With the fourth successive 75 basis point increase early this month, the Fed has vowed to continue its aggressive rate hike policy to curb high inflation.Amid exacerbated supply chain issues, stubborn inflation and aggressive rate hikes, worries of an economic slowdown may induce further bouts of volatility. At this critical juncture, it's as important to get rid of fundamentally weak toxic stocks as it is to invest in attractively valued companies possessing fundamental strength.Toxic companies are usually characterized by huge debt loads and are vulnerable to external shocks. These stocks might illusively scale lofty heights in a given time period but the good show doesn't last for these overblown toxic stocks. This is because their current price is not justified by their fundamental strength. Accurately identifying such bloated stocks and getting rid of them at the right time can protect your portfolio.Overpricing of these toxic stocks can be attributed to either an irrational enthusiasm surrounding them or some serious fundamental drawbacks. If you own such bubble stocks for an inordinate period, you are bound to see massive erosion of wealth.Nonetheless, if you can precisely spot such toxic stocks, you may gain by resorting to an investing strategy called short selling. This strategy allows one to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls. While short selling excels in bear markets, it typically loses money in bull markets.So, just like identifying stocks with growth potential, pinpointing toxic stocks and offloading them at the right time is crucial to guard one's portfolio against big losses or make profits by short-selling them. Emergent Biosolutions, Western Digital Corp., Thoughtworks Holding Inc. and DASAN Zhone Solutions, Inc are a few such toxic stocks.Story continuesHere are four of the 23 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen:Emergent Biosolutions: Headquartered in Gaithersburg, Emergent BioSolutions is a global specialty biopharmaceutical company that aims to offer specialized products to healthcare providers and governments to fulfil unmet medical needs and combat emerging public health threats.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EBS' 2022 earnings per share implies a year-over-year decline of 149%.

The stock price declines during the Russian invasion brought a lot of good prices to the market. Out of all the possibilities we considered, we picked the stocks of Celanese (CE).Celanese is the world’s largest producer of acetic acid and its chemical derivatives, including vinyl acetate monomers and emulsions. Their applications are used in a wide range of industries, such as automotive tobacco, coatings, construction, energy, telecommunications, food, and medical. Celanese recently closed the acquisition of a large part of DuPont’s business, which will make Celanese an even bigger player in the industry while reducing the cyclicality of it business. The acquisition is quite large and should deliver significant value to shareholders that in our view is not at all presently reflected in the share price. Celanese is a business that stands more or less aside from the main interests of most investors, but it is a company with very high returns on capital, strong free cash flow, and historically very efficient resource allocation.”9.

Steel prices have soared this year making Nucor a beneficiary as a leading producer of structural steel and steel bars, among other steel and iron-produced components.We can see from the nearby decade chart that steel and iron prices have skyrocketed over the last year in correlation with 40-year high inflation. The producer price index (PPI) for Iron and Steel has begun to settle over the last few months as inflation cools slightly and the economy slows.  Still, the higher prices have helped Nucor post unprecedented earnings growth. Investors may be wondering if NUE stock would be a good addition to their portfolio in December and beyond.  U.S. Bureau of Labor StatisticsImage Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor StatisticsGrowth &amp; Outlook  NUE’s Q3 earnings beat the Zacks consensus for a fourth consecutive quarter. Nucor’s CEO Leon Topalian said the company has already achieved a record-breaking year for earnings per share through the first three quarters, believing it will set a new record for full-year earnings in 2022.NUE’s earnings are expected to rise a stellar 27% YoY to $29.49 per share. Fiscal 2023 earnings are projected to drop -56% after a very tough-to-follow year. It is also important to note that Nucor’s FY22 and FY23 earnings estimates have slightly declined over the last 90 days.Sales are forecasted to follow the same trend, by climbing 12% this year but dropping -21% in FY23 to $32.18 billion. The FY23 projections still represent 42% growth from pre-pandemic levels of $22.58 billion in 2019 sales.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPerformance &amp; Valuation NUE is up an impressive +31% in 2022 vs. the S&amp;P 500’s -15% and its peer group’s +4%, which includes notable competitors United States Steel X and Steel Dynamics STLD.More impressive, NUE’s total return over the last two years is an outstanding +102% to easily top the benchmark and its peer group’s +50%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMonitoring Nucor's valuation will be important as steel prices decline. NUE trades at 5X forward earnings. This is slightly above the industry average of 3.9X but NUE has been a leader in the industry. NUE shares also trade at a discount to its decade-long high of 41.4X and the median of 15.9X. We can see from the chart below NUE’s valuation is a discount to the S&amp;P 500’s 18.8X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEven better, NUE’s cash flow per share, which calculates the amount of incoming cash vs. the amount of outgoing cash, is noticeably better than its industry at 26.8X vs. its peer’s 4.7X.This is an indicator that the company is in good financial health and made great use of its historically profitable market environment. Nucor’s cash on hand at the end of the third quarter was $3.51 billion which, as of now, would represent a 34% increase from 2021.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line Nucor currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has an overall “A” VGM grade. While earnings estimates have slightly declined over the last quarter NUE still trades at a significant discount relative to its past in terms of price to earnings.The company has also made good use of its profitability from higher steel prices by adding cash to its balance sheet. This may continue to reward investors who hold the stock as Nucor offers a respectable 1.33% annual dividend yield which has increased in each of the last five years.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have lost about 6.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Unum due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Unum Group Q3 Earnings Top, Revenues Lag EstimatesUnum Group’s third-quarter 2022 operating net income of $1.51 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.9% and our estimate of $1.41. The bottom line increased about 46.6% year over year.The quarterly results reflected continued strong operating performance, core business premium trends nearing long-term growth expectations, improved core operations sales, premium growth and continued favorable benefits experience.Operational UpdateTotal operating revenues of Unum Group were $3 billion, flat year over year as higher premium income and other income were offset by lower net investment income. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.7% and was almost in line with our estimate.Premium increased 1.6% from the prior-year quarter to $2.4 billion and was in line with our estimate. Total benefits and expenses decreased 4.4% year over year to $2.4 billion, largely attributable to lower benefits and changes in reserves for future benefits.Quarterly Segment UpdateUnum U.S.: Premium income was $1.6 billion, up 3.9% year over year. The figure was almost in line with our estimate. Adjusted operating income was up more than threefold year over year to $275 million, attributable to higher income in the group disability line as well as group life and accidental death and dismemberment line.Unum International: Premium income of $173.3 million decreased 4.6% year over year.  This compares unfavorably with our estimate of $193 million. Adjusted operating income was $29.9 million, up 9.1% year over year. The Unum U.K. line of business’ premium income was £129.4 million, up 12.1% from the year-ago quarter due to in-force block growth and higher sales in the group life product line. Adjusted operating income, in local currency, of £23.6 million was up 28.3% from a year ago.The benefit ratio was 78.6, which improved 60 basis points (bps) primarily due to inflation-linked experience for its group life and group long-term disability products, partially offset by higher claim incidence in its supplemental product line. Persistency increased in group long-term disability, group life business and supplemental line of business.Colonial Life: Premium income increased 0.6% from the prior-year figure to $423.3 million on account of higher sales in prior periods, partially offset by lower overall persistency. The figure compared unfavorably with our estimate of $428.4 million.Sales increased 3.2% from the year-ago figure to $115.9 million. Adjusted operating income increased 12.9% from the prior-year period to $90.4 million.Persistency was 78.3%, which improved 60 bps year over year.The benefit ratio improved 910 bps year over year to 46.8, driven by favorable claim experience across all products.Closed Block: Premium income decreased 6% year over year to $235.5 million due to policy terminations and maturities, partially offset by rate increases. This compares unfavorably with our estimate of $247.3 million. Adjusted operating income was $34.1 million, which decreased 68.9% year over year.Corporate: The segment incurred an operating loss of $49.5 million, wider than a loss of $45.4 million in the year-earlier quarter.Story continuesCapital ManagementAs of Sep 30, 2022, the weighted average risk-based capital ratio for Unum Group’s traditional U.S. insurance companies was approximately 415%.Unum Group exited the quarter with liquidity worth $1.1 billion.Book value per share was down 20% year over year to $43.49 as of Sep 30, 2022.Unum Group bought back 1.2 shares for $$42.6 million, taking the year-to-date tally to 4.2 shares bought for $137.5 million.Guidance RetainedUnum Group expects positive operating trends in core business in 2022, with solid premium growth and improving claim experience as impacts from COVID-19 lessen. Unum Group projects an increase in after-tax adjusted operating income per share of 40% to 45%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.VGM ScoresAt this time, Unum has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Unum has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerUnum belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry. Another stock from the same industry, Amerisafe (AMSF), has gained 5.5% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended September 2022.Amerisafe reported revenues of $74.88 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.4%.

12,b8ed5819-5ec6-35ba-a584-c485cbea1ecd,PVH,2022-12-02,PVH Corp. (NYSE:PVH) Is Going Strong But Fundamentals Appear To Be Mixed : Is There A Clear Direction For The Stock?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pvh-corp-nyse-pvh-going-104445434.html,1669977885,STORY,['PVH'],"[PVH (NYSE:PVH) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 41% over the last month. But the company's key financial indicators appear to be differing across the board and that makes us question whether or not the company's current share price momentum can be maintained. Specifically, we decided to study PVH's  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for PVH How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PVH is:9.4% = US$453m ÷ US$4.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.09 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.PVH's Earnings Growth And 9.4% ROEWhen you first look at it, PVH's ROE doesn't look that attractive. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 21%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 6.8% seen by PVH over the last five years is not surprising. We believe that there also might be other aspects that are negatively influencing the company's earnings prospects. Such as - low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesSo, as a next step, we compared PVH's performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 14% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for PVH? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is PVH Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?PVH's low LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 1.7% (implying that it retains the remaining 98% of its profits) comes as a surprise when you pair it with the shrinking earnings. This typically shouldn't be the case when a company is retaining most of its earnings. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.In addition, PVH has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 1.4% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that PVH's future ROE will rise to 13% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that the performance shown by PVH can be open to many interpretations. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

It’s a brand-driven growth plan. So it’s about unlocking the full potential of our brands. And the brands, both Calvin and Tommy, the brands are the most valuable assets we have. So when we look at over time over the next few years in housing this, it’s about giving us complete control of those brands.”While Wall Street was quick to get behind signs of strength at the company, Larsson still has some work to do to win over hearts and minds.Ike Boruchow, an analyst at Wells Fargo, noted that bringing the licenses in house would help revenues, but said the impact on earnings before interest and taxes was “less clear.”“While PVH is doing an admirable job to manage through the tough macro backdrop  — i.e. costs cuts, improvements in the North American business — we believe the space will remain in a difficult place for the foreseeable future,” Boruchow said.In the third quarter, PVH was hit by a $417 million pretax write-down in goodwill, but adjusted earnings per share totaled $2.60 and were 45 cents better than the $2.15 projected by analysts.Revenues declined 2.2 percent to $2.28 billion, which would have been an increase of 7 percent in constant currencies.The quarter was strong enough for PVH to boost its EPS projection for the year to $8.25 a share, up from $8.]"

However, both metrics declined year over year.Results gained from the continued momentum in its core brands — Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger — along with pricing actions. However, the ongoing macroeconomic challenges, particularly in Europe, and continued COVID impacts in Asia remained headwinds.That said, management remains on track with its PVH+ Plan, which aims at product strength and consumer engagement, direct-to-consumer, digital enhancement and improving its supply-chain capabilities, which are likely to result in substantial cost efficiencies and better productivity.Q3 HighlightsPVH Corp reported adjusted earnings of $2.60 per share, down 2.6% from the year-ago quarter's $2.67. However, the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.13. On a GAAP basis, the company reported a loss of $2.88 per share against earnings of $3.89 in the prior-year quarter.In the fiscal third quarter, revenues fell 2% year over year (up 7% on a cc basis) to $2,281 million. This is mainly due to the impacts of the Ukraine war, such as Russia store closures, the cessation of wholesale shipments to Russia and Belarus, and a reduction in wholesale shipments to Ukraine. However, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,232 million.On the flip side, the company witnessed growth across all regions and in its Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brand businesses. Strength in its international businesses, as well as improvements in North America, particularly in the direct-to-consumer business, acted as other upsides.Direct-to-consumer revenues fell 5% year over year in the quarter, whereas Wholesale revenues plunged 2%. Revenues in the digital channel declined roughly 12% in the quarter under review.The company's gross profit amounted to $1,274.2 million, down 5.3% year over year. The gross margin contracted 180 bps to 55.9% due to higher costs and increased promotions, which more than offset gains from price increases. This also includes unfavorable currency impacts of 40 bps.Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2% year over year to $1,068.3 million. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes totaled $220 million compared with $266 million in the prior-year quarter. This mainly resulted from reduced expenses in the prior-year period due to store closures in certain regions. The metric also included $30 million of adverse foreign currency impacts.Story continuesPVH Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  PVH Corp.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. We are pleased to share that we delivered financial performance in the third quarter ahead of the guidance we provided for both the top and bottom line on a non-GAAP basis. Top line results exceeded our expectations on a reported and constant currency basis and underlying growth, excluding the impact of currency and the Russia-Ukraine exit was plus 9% in the third quarter, driven by better-than-expected growth rates for both Tommy and Calvin. Delivering this strong performance in the face of ongoing macroeconomic challenges is a testament to our disciplined execution of the PVH+ Plan and the strength of our 2 global brands. We managed our business in a prudent and disciplined manner, and underlying revenue growth, combined with an increased cost focus, drove the outperformance of non-GAAP EPS. Our international businesses continued to execute very well across both brands with increased product strength and strong consumer engagement driving performance even in the face of a challenging macro backdrop in Europe and ongoing COVID restrictions in China. And with respect to North America, we are encouraged that our business is starting to show green shoots, although we recognize that we still have work to do to win more of the domestic consumer. We have doubled down on improving our own execution, and this quarter, we delivered double-digit growth for Tommy and Calvin, led by our D2C stores even against the soft consumer backdrop and intense promotional environment. Given that we're in the middle of the very important holiday season, I've been traveling extensively with our leaders around the world. This past Thanksgiving week, I was with our North American leaders in several of our U.S. markets. Before that, I spent a week in Asia with our leadership team visiting both Korea and Japan. And in a week's time, I'm heading to Europe to spend time with our leaders there. Being out in the markets this holiday season, I feel very good about our performance and the hard work our teams put in to make the PVH+ Plan come to life with the consumer. There is a lot of progress being made, and I want to take the opportunity to say a big thank you to our leaders and teams, your work is making a big difference. One market visit that stood out over the past few weeks was our visit to Korea. This was my first time returning to Korea after COVID, where I could in person experienced the strong execution of the PVH+ Plan and our Calvin Klein brand to market. Calvin in Korea is a great example for how executing the PVH+ Plan will drive strong impacts over time across all regions and markets. In Korea, we have taken the key growth drivers of the PVH+ Plan and made them come to life in a uniquely strong way, driving year-to-date revenue growth of plus 22% in local currency. We have accomplished this by leaning into our key product growth categories like underwear, denim, outerwear, big categories where we have the right to play to win. Within each of these, we have them focused on winning with the best hero products in the market, 1 concrete example being the modern cotton underwear program. We have then connected this strong product focus with some of the strongest talent in the market like Jennie Kim, Ho Yeon Jung, (inaudible), to name a few. Finally, we make all these parts come to life on social media and in the consumer experience, both online and in stores. The results from executing this, both brand and financial, have been outstanding, generating increasing brand relevance, double-digit growth in revenue with significant pricing power and gross margin expansion. Since the PVH+ Plan growth drivers are the same across our brands and all regions, this Korea example is so valuable because it shows how we deliver results through disciplined execution of the plan. As a reminder, our PVH+ Plan is about connecting our 2 global brands closer to where the customer is going than any time before, through 5 growth drivers: winning with product, winning with consumer engagement, winning in the digitally-led marketplace, developing a demand and data-driven operating model and driving efficiencies while investing in growth. Let me share a brief update on where we are within each of these. In winning with product, our hero product strategy continues to be key to our plan, and we have seen a strong response to our product assortment from both Calvin and Tommy consumers. At Tommy, we are globalizing our strong product assortment developed by Tommy's global product engine based in Europe, building capabilities that deliver products that meet unique local demand across the world. For spring '23, nearly 90% of the assortments as our stores in North America will be aligned with global bestsellers. At the same time, for Calvin, we remain focused on doubling down on the key essential products the brand is known for and staying true to the brand's DNA. We are connecting our hero products through winning with consumer engagement. We are connecting our brands together with hero products with culturally relevant talent. For Tommy, we continue to build on our ongoing partnership with Shawn Mendes, who's a big fan of the Tommy brand and couple that with brand heat driving moments such as Tommy's recent fashion show at New York Fashion Week. For Calvin, we are continuing to drive strong consumer engagement through clear product stories centered around hyper-relevant talent. We are executing our strategy to win in the digitally-led marketplace by building direct-to-consumer connections, led by our own digital business to drive engagement. For example, ck.com in North America recently successfully launched this new platform with enhancements, including faster site speed and strong product imagery. In addition, we are focused on fueling high-quality growth by working with best-in-class digital partners. With David Savman having just joined the PVH team as our Chief Supply Chain Officer, we are actively working to improve our supply chain and build a demand and data-driven operating model. We are investing in important building blocks to enhance our end-to-end planning capabilities to better match inventory to consumer demand. Lastly, we remain focused on driving efficiencies and investing in growth. As we continue to proactively managing what's within our control, we increased our focus on ensuring that our cost structure match the external demand environment. Through disciplined execution, we control our costs, which has translated into solid operating margin performance, at the same time, enabled us to invest in the PVH+ growth drivers. The PVH+ execution and investments we are making today are building the foundation for long-term growth. This is where we remain intensely focused. Over time, the macro challenges we are navigating today will abate, and we will then be in a strong position to further capitalize on improved external conditions. During the third quarter, despite the challenging consumer sentiment, which has become further challenged over the last few months, particularly North America, we feel good about our team's execution and how well we delivered, a theme we expect to continue for the fourth quarter. So looking ahead, based on our underlying performance trends, we are reaffirming our revenue and EBIT margin guidance and increasing our EPS guidance for the full year, which incorporates our planning for a more promotional environment in the fourth quarter and continued focus on prudently managing our expenses. Our guidance is based on our current view on the macroeconomic environment, and we continue to carefully monitor developments and potential impacts on the consumer for each of the regions in which we operate. We also feel good about the start of the holiday. It's a Black Friday weekend. Performance has been in line with our expectations, and we are on plan. In Europe, where Black Friday has become increasingly relevant, we drove strong performance across all channels for both Tommy and Calvin, which include strong increases in traffic, more than ever, great brands such as our standout during this important shopping period. And for North America, against the backdrop of soft consumer sentiment and a highly promotional environment, we executed well. We have significantly better in-stock levels versus last year and we saw better conversions in our stores, along with some improvement in international traffic. We expect that the strength of our product and better in-stock levels of hero product will continue to support performance in Q4. With respect to leadership for our North America businesses and the Calvin Klein Global brand, we're making strong progress on the respective searches and look forward to sharing an update shortly. Now turning to our regional performance and how we're executing our PVH+ Plan across each region. Starting with Europe. Both our brands remain strong and continue to resonate with the European consumers, with both Calvin and Tommy showing improvements in relevance and consideration compared to last year. Adjusting for the impact of our exit from the Russian market and FX, we generated mid-single-digit growth on an underlying basis, consistent with our growth in the second quarter and achieved a record EUR 1 billion in revenue for the third quarter. This is on top of very strong growth the prior year. Product elevation remains a key priority with a positive impact on ASPs for Tommy and for Calvin, we remain focused on growing the CK lifestyle through elevated commercial collections connected to strong consumer experience and marketing campaigns. Even as we build on our brand strength, we continue to closely monitor the headwinds in the macro environment and the related impacts to consumer spending, particularly in the U.K. and Germany, where the pressures of high inflation and energy costs are the greatest. Southern Europe continues to perform very well. Demand in our future order books across brands continue to hold with the spring 2023 season firming up to be high single-digit growth on top of double-digit growth in spring this past year. Moving on to Asia Pacific. This past quarter, we continued to see strong momentum with all markets demonstrating solid local currency growth. Excluding China, the region demonstrated nearly 30% year-over-year growth, inclusive of a 15% headwind from foreign currency. Sales growth was driven by double-digit growth in Australia, Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia. Despite restrictions, we drove mid-single-digit local currency growth in China. In addition, e-commerce delivered solid double-digit growth led by China, Korea and Australia as we continue to expand our presence on the most important digital growth platforms in the region. As I shared in my Korea example earlier, across the region, we are connecting our PVH+ product and consumer engagement initiatives all the way to the stores where we meet to soar. We saw strong performance for our fall collections, and we continue to build brand heat and strong engagement, particularly around key holidays. We are delivering strong hero products coupled with ongoing locally relevant product collaborations. These efforts are driving strong growth in underwear, led by new silhouettes and functionality, outerwear driven by buy now, wear now transitional products as well as denim fits that resonates with the Gen Z consumer. During the quarter, we drove strong e-commerce performance for key consumer moments such as the Chinese Valentine's Day. And most recently, we delivered double-digit GMV and comp growth during China's 11.11 activation, outperforming the industry. Importantly, both Tommy and Calvin gained market share and moved up the rankings on Tmall. In addition, both brands live streaming events achieved a record 10 million views and each also delivered a record RMB 100 million GMV, which very few brands achieved. Our collaborations with Tmall with product development, led by our innovation center on the platform, continue to fuel our results. We are leveraging data and insights in these collaborations to quickly be able to react and replenish these products to maximize sales. We've also continued to rationalize our assortment to improve SKU productivity and inventory efficiency, while simultaneously named the region to activate near and onshore product supply chain for speed and margin expansion. We remain excited about the progress and underlying performance in the region and the future white space opportunity, particularly digital, which remains under-penetrated. Lastly, for North America, we remain in the early phase of our multiyear journey to unlock the significant opportunity in the region. We are doubling down on driving improved execution through our PVH+ Plan. Most importantly, we are seeing positive performance indicators, especially in our D2C stores, underscoring the effectiveness of the PVH+ execution. As we have moved through the year, even with external challenges, we have driven sequentially improved domestic consumer comps, which returned to pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter. In the third quarter, D2C stores delivered double-digit positive comps driven by higher traffic. We continue to make step-by-step progress, starting with product and our assortment. As we shared with you last quarter, we have been allocating more inventory to select doors to showcase the full assortment of our most important hero products. This past quarter, we further scaled our learnings to additional stores. We significantly improved inventory levels in these hero product programs and improved in-store experience to generate stronger results. This select group of stores continue to show a very strong sales lift against controlled doors with higher transactions and AUR. For Tommy, our #1 category, men's Polo significantly improved to achieve 2019 levels during the third quarter. We are seeing a lift as traffic and inventory positioning improves. Our global bestseller initiative, which puts the best products from our global design center into North America, continue to grow its impact in the third quarter, up from 50% in the second quarter, and we are seeing strong performance from these products. In wholesale, we are deepening the work we do together with our key wholesale partners. We are remerchandising doors with improved stock levels and we will intensify field team coverage and create clearer product presentation. In addition, we are seeing good improvement in on-time delivery. A significantly larger portion of spring orders are projected to be on time compared to the fall and holiday season. Lastly, as we just announced, we are extending our licensing agreement with G-III in North America, and we're doing that in a way that over a multiyear time period, step-by-step, we will transition our business back in-house. We are grateful to G-III for their partnership and long-term commitment to Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and they will continue to be a key partner as we work together over the next few years to internalize the direct operation of these businesses. This is an important long-term step to unlock the full potential of our brands in North America. By bringing these core product categories in-house over time, we will be able to draw on the power and expertise of our global brand teams and have them fully connected to the demand-driven supply chain we are developing. Next, I'll share a few key global brand highlights on how we are bringing both brands to life for the consumer, beginning with Calvin Klein. We have continued to drive strong brand relevance through our exciting brand campaigns featuring masspirational talent for the Millennial and Gen Z consumer. In September, we launched Calvin or Nothing, a new underwear campaign starring actor Maya Hawke and Belgium Professional Footballer, Romelu Lukaku. The campaign channels, the brand's iconic impactful aesthetic and featured the latest underwear offerings. On Instagram, where Calvin has over 22 million followers, the campaign exceeded our expectations and outperformed our engagement rate benchmarks. Most recently, ahead of the World Cup, Calvin Klein tapped soccer players; Trent Alexander-Arnold, Antonee Robinson, Kai Havertz, Richarlison and Virgil van Dijk in the latest installment of the campaign, expanding on the strategy of working with culturally relevant of the moment talent with global appeal. In addition, Calvin Klein Jeans launched a capsule collection and campaign in partnership with leading European online retailer, Zalando. The campaign launched first for Zalando Plus members, a loyalty program that gives consumers access to new releases before becoming available on Zalando, calvinklein.com and Calvin Klein retail stores in key European countries. In Asia, as I mentioned earlier, we leverage mega talent to driving relevance by featuring Jennie Kim, Jessica Jung, Ho Yeon Jung, Park Seo-Joon and others in images that captures the versatile nature of this season's Calvin Klein offerings across the region and increasingly globally. Turning to holiday. We've recently launched our curated gift guide, which includes iconic styles of underwear and apparel, focused on elevated clicks for going out as super soft layers for staying in. In addition to our brand-driven holiday campaign through our brand ambassadors and collaborators, we will pulse out holiday content to drive relevance and engagement throughout this important shopping period. Moving on to Tommy Hilfiger. Our marketing initiatives in the third quarter delivered brand heat, brand campaigns and immersive experiences, where the highlight was our return to New York Fashion Week, which kicked off with a multi-verse Tommy Factory Runway experience that launched our new Tommy Hilfiger monogram collection and included a star-studded guest list, generated global visibility and strong consumer engagement. We generated approximately 6.2 billion impressions from August to October, and approximately 27 million social engagements over the same period. The Tommy Factory Runway Show ranked the #2 on the list of the most talked about shows in New York, generating significant media interest with the most brand mentions around (inaudible) American, Sustainable, compared to other top participating brands in the New York Fashion Week. The brand campaign this fall generated 1.1 billion social media impressions and 44 million in organic reach. The TikTok video featuring Tommy Hilfiger is our best-performing video on the platform to date. In addition, we generated strong consumer engagement, reaching 14 million followers on Instagram and drove strong engagement on the platform. The brand has seen strong consumer demand following the launch of Tommy Hilfiger monogram. In Europe, the campaign featuring celebrities such as Kate and Lila Moss, Travis Barker, Jon Batiste and Anthony Ramos drove a higher sell-through rate twice that of the rest of the fall collection range with double-digit increases in ASP and very strong retail activations. We saw incredibly strong impressions, a share of voice in Asia, North America as well. In addition, as part of the Tommy Hilfiger monogram collection, the brand collaborated with British designer, Richard Quinn, on a limited-edition capsule, which highlights the refreshed logo and received exclusive tier retail distribution globally, including French premium retailer, Pronto. We're excited about our upcoming holiday campaign and collection featuring American iconic styles with distinctive modern aesthetic, inspired by Andy Warhol's factory, paying tribute to Warhol's famous parties and the joy of gift giving during the holiday. The collection is available at tommy.com, Tommy Hilfiger stores globally and key wholesale partners. And for Tommy Jeans, the label is collaborating with Martine Rose for an Americana-inspired capsule collection with modern wardrobe essentials fusing streetwear style with (inaudible) details, available on tommy.com, and Tommy Hilfiger stores globally. For both brands, we're looking forward to an exciting holiday season. In closing, I feel very good about the strong underlying performance we delivered in the quarter that enabled us to beat both our top and bottom-line expectations, and I'm confident in our ability to deliver our full year commitments. And we are delivering this despite the macro challenges and volatility we're all navigating through. Looking forward, I'm incredibly optimistic for how in a very disciplined manner, through the PVH+ Plan, every quarter, we will unlock more and more of the full potential of our 2 iconic brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger across all our regions, leveraged by PVH as a high-performing global growth platform. We will be relentless in our execution of this. Before I turn the call over to Zac, I would like to again thank all our associates around the world for your hard work, important contributions this year, and I wish everyone a happy, healthy and safe holiday season. I'll now turn the call over to Zac to discuss the financials in more detail. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Zachary James Coughlin, PVH Corp. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Stefan, and good morning. My comments are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. As Stefan discussed, we are pleased to report strong third quarter results, which exceeded our top line guidance by 2%, delivering underlying revenue growth of 9% versus last year and significantly exceeding our earnings guidance with earnings per share of $2.60. We remain laser focused on what is within our control as we continue to navigate a challenging and increasingly complex macroeconomic environment, and that discipline is reflected in our performance for the quarter. Our underlying revenue growth was driven by strong growth across all regions in both our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands. We delivered continued solid performance in our international businesses and sequential improvement in North America, driven by the direct-to-consumer business. On just a reported basis, revenue was down 2%, which reflected a 9% negative impact from exchange and a 2% negative impact from the war in Ukraine. We continue to focus on driving performance in our direct-to-consumer business, where we have the closest connection to our consumer and DTC was up high single digits on an underlying basis. On a reported basis, DTC revenue was down 5% compared to last year, which reflected a 10% negative impact from exchange and a 2% negative impact from the war in Ukraine. From a regional perspective, we drove underlying growth across all markets. Third quarter revenue for our international businesses was up 7% versus last year on a constant currency basis, continuing to significantly exceed 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Within our international business, our European business had a record quarter, exceeding EUR 1 billion in revenue for a quarter for the first time ever. Asia Pacific business, excluding China, grew nearly 30% compared to last year, even with a negative impact of exchange of 15%. And importantly, we drove mid-single-digit growth in China in local currency as COVID restrictions there lessened compared to the first half of the year. While we remain optimistic about our business in China, there continues to be a challenging environment as restrictions have once again intensified in the fourth quarter. In North America, revenue in the third quarter was up 10% overall for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein and above our plans despite the inflation and interest rate pressures that continue to weigh on consumer sentiment in the region. Our North America retail store business was up double digits versus last year, even as we continue to be impacted by the lack of international tourism from Asia, and we drove sequential improvement versus the second quarter as we improved inventory levels in store and grew sales to domestic consumers with our comp base now back to 2019 levels. Our wholesale business was also up double digits versus last year. Our global brands also continued to deliver strong underlying growth with Tommy Hilfiger revenues up 7% on a constant currency basis and Calvin Klein revenues up 9% on a constant currency basis. Reported revenues were down 4% for Tommy Hilfiger and up 1% for Calvin Klein. In the third quarter, we delivered gross margin of 55.9%, up approximately 130 basis points compared to pre-pandemic levels, but down approximately 180 basis points compared to last year. This includes a 40-basis point negative impact of exchange. While gross margin reflected planned price increases, that benefit was more than offset by higher costs and increased promotional selling as inventory levels are elevated across the industry. SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenue for the third quarter was better than planned at 46.2% and nearly flat to last year. We continue to take a disciplined approach to managing expenses, driving cost efficiencies while making targeted investments in strategic areas of fuel growth, in line with the fifth growth driver of the PVH+ Plan. We also took actions this quarter to drive initial progress under the plan we announced last quarter to reduce people costs in our global offices by approximately 10% by the end of 2023. As a reminder, we expect that once completed, these reductions will generate annual cost savings of over $100 million with a small benefit to 2022 and increase savings as we move through 2023. In total, our EBIT for the quarter exceeded our guidance due to strong revenue performance and lower expenses. Operating margin was 9.6% as reported and 10% excluding the negative impact of approximately 40 basis points due to exchange. On a GAAP basis, we also took a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $417 million, which was nonoperational and driven by significant increases in discount rates. Earnings per share was $2.60 compared to $2.67 in last year's third quarter and exceeded the top end of our guidance by $0.45, almost entirely driven by the improvement in EBIT. Earnings per share for the quarter also included a $0.35 negative impact compared to the prior year related to exchange and an $0.18 negative impact due to the war in Ukraine. Inventory was up 32% at the end of the quarter compared to the prior year period due to a combination of factors. First, inventory levels were abnormally low last year in all regions, and consistent with second quarter, we are normalizing to levels that support our planned growth. Second, as we've discussed previously, we have increased our inventory investment in core products to mitigate supply chain and logistics disruptions and ensure that we have the right product at the right time. While supply chain and logistics disruptions have not eased entirely, we have begun to see improvements in on-time delivery and decreases in in-transit times. And lastly, inventory levels remain elevated in North America wholesale due to lower-than-expected demand. At the end of Q2, I mentioned that this was worth about $65 million of the increase in inventory versus the prior year. At this point, we have reduced that amount by nearly 1/3 and are on track with our plan to normalize inventory levels in North America. Additionally, we delivered on our commitment under the PVH+ Plan to return excess cash to shareholders, returning over $100 million to shareholders during the quarter through the repurchase of 1.9 million PVH shares and our dividend. Moving on to our outlook. To start with, we are reaffirming the top end of our projected revenue guidance, up 4% on a constant currency basis and our EBIT margin outlook of approximately 9%, and we are raising our full year EPS projection to $8.25. We continue to work relentlessly to drive results even in the face of the challenging macroeconomic environment and trends within the retail industry. Our strong third quarter performance is a testament to our ability to react quickly in the short term, while continuing to be laser-focused on strategic actions to support the long-term growth of our business, powered by our 2 global brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. For the full year, we continue to project underlying high single-digit revenue growth in line with our previous guidance. On a reported basis, revenue is projected to be down approximately 3% as reported compared to 2021 and reflects a 7% negative impact from exchange and a 4% reduction resulting from the Heritage Brands transaction, the exit from the Heritage Brands retail business and the war in Ukraine. We expect total digital penetration as a percentage of revenue to be nearly 25%. We expect our full year gross margin rate to remain significantly above pre-pandemic levels, though approximately 130 basis points below record levels in 2021, which includes the negative impact of exchange of approximately 30 basis points. We continue to expect pressure on our gross margin for the remainder of the year due to promotional selling. Overall, we expect gross margin in the fourth quarter will reflect a similar year-over-year decline versus what we reported for the third quarter, as we offset the negative impact of the increasingly promotional environment by driving our higher-margin direct-to-consumer channel as a greater share of the business versus last year. We continue to take a disciplined approach to manage expenses across the business in light of increased macro pressures weighing on our gross margin, and we are accelerating cost efficiencies while prudently investing in the core pillars of the PVH+ Plan. SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenue for the full year reflects an approximately 60 basis points improvement compared to our previous guidance and is now expected to be approximately 40 basis points higher compared to 2021. Our full year operating margin projection continues to be approximately 9% and reflects a negative impact compared to last year of approximately 40 basis points due to exchange. Our interest expense projection is unchanged at approximately $85 million, and we continue to expect our corporate tax rate will be approximately 24%. For the full year 2022, we are raising our projected earnings per share to be approximately $8.25 compared to our previous guidance of $8. The increase versus our previous guidance is primarily due to our strong Q3 performance. Our planned stock repurchase in 2022 remained at approximately $400 million with approximately $330 million of repurchases completed year-to-date. For the fourth quarter, we are projecting mid-single-digit revenue growth in our underlying business. On a reported basis, revenue is projected to be down approximately 4% as compared to 2021 and reflects an 8% negative impact from exchange and a 2% negative impact from the war in Ukraine. Fourth quarter earnings per share is expected to be approximately $1.65, which reflects the negative impacts of approximately $0.27 due to exchange and approximately $0.15 from the war in Ukraine compared to the prior year. We expect our tax rate in this year's fourth quarter will be an expense of approximately 25%, which is relatively in line with our full year rate expectation. As a reminder, in last year's fourth quarter, we benefited from noncash tax rate relief tied to our purchase of the Calvin Klein brand back in 2003. This benefit ran out in 2021. As a result, our tax rate in the fourth quarter of last year was a benefit of approximately 33%. We expect our interest expense for the fourth quarter to be approximately $24 million. Before we open it up for questions, I want to reiterate that we are pleased with our strong third quarter results and that we continue to drive strong underlying growth across the business even in the tough macroeconomic environment. We remain focused on driving our strategic priorities despite the continued volatility. Through the PVH+ Plan, our global brands and businesses are well positioned to drive long-term value creation and deliver sustainable, profitable growth and shareholder returns. And with that, operator, we would like to open it up to questions. ================================================================================ Questions and Answers -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [1] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Robert Scott Drbul, Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior MD [2] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I guess the question I'd actually like to spend some time on, if you could, is Stefan, can you just talk us through the strategic rationale for taking the G-III licenses back and sort of how you structure them and why now and sort of how you really approach this? I think that would be pretty helpful. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stefan Larsson, PVH Corp. - CEO &amp; Director [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Absolutely. Thank you, Bob. So as we communicated yesterday, we are extending the licensing agreement with G-III in a way that over a multiyear period, we'll bring these categories back in-house. And the rationale for that is very much connected to the PVH+ Plan and what that is about. Because, in essence, the PVH+ Plan is a growth plan. It's a brand-driven growth plan. So it's about unlocking the full potential of our brands. And the brands, both Calvin and Tommy, the brands are the most valuable assets we have. So when we look at over time -- over the next few years in housing this, it's about giving us complete control of those brands. So when you look at the PVH+ Plan, we have 5 drivers. And it's very much connected to what creates value in unlocking those brands. So product design, the product assortment, the pricing, the market channel mix enabling us to connect to a demand-driven supply chain. So all those parts are value-creating growth drivers, and that's what we will be able to be in control of and it will help unlock more of Calvin and Tommy and bigger value creation over time, but it also help us build Calvin and Tommy to truly global cohesive aspirational lifestyle brands. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Zachary James Coughlin, PVH Corp. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. And maybe, Bob, I can give a bit of context from an economics perspective, to complement the strategic element of this. So first of all, I think it's useful to size the current business impact. These are predominantly U.S. women's wholesale categories for Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. And today, these licenses make up approximately 1/3 of our global licensing revenue. And from a profit perspective, the profit comprised less than 10% of our 2021 EBIT. I think also important to note is that due to the structure of the agreement, we do not expect any material impact to our financial results between now and the end of our PVH+ Plan commitments in 2025. Beyond that, in 2026 and beyond, we do expect the impact to become more material. We expect the intake of this business will be accretive to our financial results as we take advantage of the scale of what the rest of the business has. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [5] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question will come from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael Charles Binetti, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Research Analyst [6] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Congrats on a nice quarter. It's a tough backdrop. I guess a quick 1 on the model to Zac. For the EBIT guidance in the fourth quarter, it seems like it implies a decent step up relative to third quarter on both a year-over-year and a 3-year basis. Maybe you could unpack that a little bit, how much of that cost savings or mix dynamics? Help us understand that a little. And then I guess, what I found interesting was the U.S. DTC comments to store. Stefan, I know this has been a focus for you. It seems like there's a bigger unlock emerging there. I know you said -- I think you said domestic consumer traffic crossed it back above 2019 levels for the first time. It's great to hear. I know you've been citing that hard. I think you told us 30% of sales in those doors or at least in the outlet doors with tourist volume. Maybe talk a little bit about how far below 2019 levels those doors are today in productivity and in margins? And what you think are some realistic medium-term expectations for how much those can progress back to pre-COVID levels? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stefan Larsson, PVH Corp. - CEO &amp; Director [7] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Michael. So before I let Zac unpack more detailed financials in the outlook for Q4. So what excites us with Q3 is that we were able to compete to win in a difficult macro backdrop. And we continue the outlook for Q4. It's based on that. We will continue to do that in Q4. And we had on plan start of the holiday, and then we continue to compete to win through Q4. And that's the underlying driver of the Q4 outlook. But Zac, feel free to give more... -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Zachary James Coughlin, PVH Corp. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [8] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- No, I think as we saw -- as we look through the third quarter, overall, August and September are strong. And then some of that macroeconomic backdrop that Stefan mentioned, we again did see some softening consumer sentiment in October. And we fought hard and we believe competed for our fair share there. As we look forward, we've incorporated that sort of outlook as we sort of worked through the third quarter into the fourth quarter results or into the fourth quarter outlook and expect that to sort of be the underlying dynamic that we're competing in more broadly from a gross margin perspective. We expect our gross margin impact versus last year to be approximately the same at the third quarter. The composition of that, obviously, a little bit different as we do expect that higher level of promotional environment to continue through the fourth quarter, we saw at the end, but we get the lift there from a much heavier DTC retail-focused quarter, but the overall margin impact from there. And then I think from an SG&amp;A perspective, we expect to see continued efficiency as we work our way through being really disciplined and focused on the spending from an outlook for the fourth quarter heading into the -- that's all incorporated into the guidance that we provide. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stefan Larsson, PVH Corp. - CEO &amp; Director [9] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And Michael, to your question about North America and the green shoots we are seeing in D2C stores. Yes, it's exciting because we worked really hard to double down on the execution, starting with our hero products and making sure we have those best essentials that we are known for in both brands that we have them in stock. So what we saw in Q3 was that we were able to navigate through most of the supply chain issues. So we had better in-stock levels in more of our hero products. And then we were really focused on the channel execution. And we saw that drive this double-digit growth in our stores, and we saw the comps coming up with the domestic consumer. So still early days, but very encouraging. If we take Tommy, as an example, where we increasingly connect our products to the global design center of the brand and have those bestsellers even for the North American market, we see that in categories like men's knits, which is our #1 category for Tommy, we were up 42% versus last year. So Polo's iconic essential bestsellers are driving significant growth and led by global bestsellers. So we're able to get more of the hero products in stock, better product execution, leveraging the global brand design, higher AURs on that. And then we see that we are starting to come up and climb up against 2019. So early days in North America, but it's very encouraging. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [10] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question will come from Jay Sole with UBS. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jay Daniel Sole, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Executive Director and Equity Research Analyst of Softlines &amp; Luxury [11] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I'm going to follow up on some of the comments you made about SG&amp;A. It sounds SG&amp;A control as part of the PVH+ Plan. But can you help us understand how much of the really strong SG&amp;A control in the quarter was sort of a response to the consumer environment versus how much is sort of identifying opportunities to streamline costs and get more efficient, which will sort of continue into next year and beyond? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stefan Larsson, PVH Corp. - CEO &amp; Director [12] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Jay. So Zac has really done a great job coming in and helping us execute on the fifth growth driver of the PVH+ Plan, which is about driving efficiencies and freeing that up to invest in growth drivers. So what you see now in Q3 and going forward, increasingly, you will see that we are step-by-step becoming more cost competitive. Of course, 1 aspect of that is even more important when we operate and compete to win in a tough macro. But this is something that Zac and I will drive throughout the whole PVH+ journey and beyond. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Zachary James Coughlin, PVH Corp. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [13] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I think just more specifically, there was really no 1 single item driving the 3Q SG&amp;A efficiency. Instead, the efficiency was across the board as our disciplined focus on spending on only the most impactful elements of the PVH+ Plan really paid off. This is about focus and prioritization. And we actually are confident we can both invest in growth and deliver SG&amp;A efficiency. So we also continue to invest in those areas most importantly for growth. That was included in spending. So digital, as we replatformed our U.S. calvin.com site, it continue to build out our European digital ecosystem, supply chain as we're building the technology infrastructure across Asia and logistics capability in Europe. And increasingly moving forward, you'll see spending in the U.S. retail network and global marketing. So we believe that we actually do have the ability to do both to invest in those things most important and really drive those efficiencies as well. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [14] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question will come from Chris Nardone with Bank of America. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Christopher Nardone, BofA Securities, Research Division - Research Analyst [15] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Can you provide an updated state of the union on your performance in some of your major Western European markets? And then how some of those trends have evolved quarter-to-date relative to 3Q? And then just as a quick follow-up into some of your vacancies for Head of Americas and how did Calvin, this G-III announcement change, how you're looking at the attributes to fill some of those roles? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stefan Larsson, PVH Corp. - CEO &amp; Director [16] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Thanks, Chris. So starting with Europe, we had a record quarter. We never made a quarter before in Europe over EUR 1 billion. It's the first time we did over EUR 1 billion for the first time in the quarter. So very strong execution by our European team, drove underlying growth of mid-single digits. Again, we were able to do this despite the tougher macro. For sure, there is a tougher macro situation, I would say, globally. But in Europe was a good example of when we were able to navigate through that successfully. And then we go into the start of holiday where Black Friday has become increasingly relevant in Europe, increasingly relevant and big. And we just came out of that and drove strong performance across both brands or channels. So feeling good about how our teams continue to execute really well. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Zachary James Coughlin, PVH Corp. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [17] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I think then, if we take a look then just more broadly on the European performance, as Stefan mentioned, continue to see strength there. And as we look forward, there's all important order books. The fall order book holding well. Spring order book, as we've talked about in prior quarters, landing at high single digits. And in fact, some of the supply chain -- global supply chain challenges have loosened, product is showing up on time or a little bit early and reconfirming the strength of the brand as those accounts are eager to take that product. So I think moving forward as well, we feel good about the strength that Europe is continuing to drive. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stefan Larsson, PVH Corp. - CEO &amp; Director [18] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And then, Chris, when it comes to the leadership searches we have, I'm excited to share that we are making really strong progress. So within the next few weeks, I look forward to update you all on what that means both for the Calvin Klein global brand and for our North America businesses. And to your questions about how this connects to the talent choices, the leadership choices, connect to the transition of the G-III categories, definitely, it connects to the PVH+ Plan. So we are about to land leaders who will bring some different for a best-in-class experience that helps us unlock both Calvin and Tommy. So yes, very excited and looking forward to in a few weeks' time to just give you the update. We have time for 1 more question. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [19] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our last question will come from Ed Yruma with Piper Sandler. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edward James Yruma, Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst [20] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I guess 1 short-term question. As you think about these G-III licenses, I know you said there's no near-term financial impact, but how do you think about building talent in preparation for taking those licenses in '25 through '27? And then Stefan, as a longer-term question, it seems like in U.S. wholesale, 1 of your competitors is kind of abating some of these more premium price points. So can you talk about the white space you think that you have, given that you're able to kind of reposition some of your brands as a more premium product. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stefan Larsson, PVH Corp. - CEO &amp; Director [21] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, definitely. So starting from your questions about white space or opportunities. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I've been now traveling extensively this past week and Thanksgiving weekend was in a number of our U.S. markets. And just seeing the love for both Calvin and Tommy, the consumer love in the North America market and the opportunity we have to -- in a more disciplined way tap into that. So we have great partnership with our wholesale partners. We have great locations within those stores. And we have an end consumer that loves our brand. So where we have opportunity connects to the PVH+ focus, which is better disciplined on the product categories that really matters that are big for the consumer essential and where we have the right to play to win and that we build the best hero products within those. And when we do today, it's early days, but where we do that today, we see that we win. We win immediately, it's 1:1. As soon as we play in the right category with the right hero products, we drive the revenue and we drive -- we don't see any price resistance. So it's very exciting to see that being -- getting closer to excellence in product and then combining that with the consumer engagement and the talent that then the product and the consumer engagement that shows up in social media, shows up in e-commerce and increasingly in our stores, that it's just exciting potential. Every time I'm out walking stores, I see it, and it's so concrete. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Zachary James Coughlin, PVH Corp. - Executive VP &amp; CFO [22] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And then I think, Ed, I'm sure Stefan want to comment on the build-out of the talentability for the categories coming in, but just to sort of start a little bit, I think if you think about from a financial perspective on that, we already do great product creation all around the world. And we've got great supply chain abilities as well. And so I think we believe that we've got a good amount of the infrastructure in place from a financial perspective that we talked about not seeing a material impact to the financials over this medium-term period. That's what gives us the confidence, as Stefan will talk about how we go about building out some of the actual capabilities themselves. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stefan Larsson, PVH Corp. - CEO &amp; Director [23] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. We have both the time -- the time plan is set ourselves up in a very good way to -- as Zac mentioned, step 1 is to leverage the capability we already have because we have a lot of these capabilities. And we see that with those leaders and teams and capabilities, we're able to drive winning and winning big in both Europe and Asia. So we see that, one is tapping into that and 2 is to complementing our team strength, leadership strength here. So we're doing both and having this time to ramp that up. And with that, thank you very much, Ed. And with that, we want to thank all of you who are following us and wish you a really good restful holiday and looking forward to catching up in the New Year. Thank you. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [24] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp U.S. Bancorp Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, Timothy Welsh, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$834k worth of shares at a price of US$43.92 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$45.35, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 26% of Timothy Welsh's holding.U.S. Bancorp insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At U.S. Bancorp Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of U.S. Bancorp shares. Specifically, insiders ditched US$2.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. U.S. Bancorp insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$113m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The U.S. Bancorp Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought U.S. Bancorp stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for U.S. Bancorp you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(NYSE:WMT),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-intrinsic-value-walmart-inc-130055095.html,1669986055,STORY,['WMT'],"[How far off is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Walmart The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$13.4bUS$16.5bUS$14.1bUS$19.2bUS$20.7bUS$21.8bUS$22.7bUS$23.5bUS$24.2bUS$24.9bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 5.29%Est @ 4.3%Est @ 3.6%Est @ 3.12%Est @ 2.78% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1% US$12.6kUS$14.7kUS$11.8kUS$15.2kUS$15.4kUS$15.3kUS$15.0kUS$14.7kUS$14.3kUS$13.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$143bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$25b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.1%– 2.0%) = US$619bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$619b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)10= US$343bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$486b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$153, the company appears about fair value at a 14% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Walmart as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Walmart, we've put together three essential items you should consider:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Walmart , and understanding these should be part of your investment process.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for WMT's future outlook?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Walmart Inc. (WMT), Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) and Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB).

The company has been benefiting from its robust omnichannel operations due to its efforts to enhance both store and online experience. Walmart has been particularly gaining from its efforts to boost delivery services through acquisitions and partnerships.The company’s U.S. comp sales continued to benefit from an increased market share in grocery in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased year over year. A robust third-quarter show encouraged management to raise its overall guidance for fiscal 2023.However, its consolidated operating income and earnings per share view still suggest a decline from the year-ago period figures. The company is encountering cost inflation, and expects it to remain elevated.(You can read the full research report on Walmart here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Toyota Motors have declined -19.4% over the past year against the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry’s decline of -40.1%. The company is facing supply-chain disruptions, logistical challenges and manufacturing inefficiencies are likely to dent profits. Operating income is projected to decline 19.8% year over year. High capex and R&amp;D expenses are also likely to dent cash flows. Also, Toyota's rising debt pile raises concerns. As such, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.However, the Japan-based carmaker is one of the world’s leading automakers, with an array of brands, including Toyota, Lexus and Scion, offering solid prospects. Toyota’s electrification push is a major tailwind.It is deepening its focus on manufacturing electric and fuel-cell vehicles, which will bolster the company’s product competitiveness. The company's raised sales view for fiscal 2023 sparked optimism. Investor-friendly moves also instill confidence.(You can read the full research report on Toyota Motor here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Schlumberger’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry over the past year (+75.9% vs. +20.1%). The company is the single largest oilfield services player, with a presence in every energy market across the globe. Being the leading provider of technology for complex oilfields, the company is well-poised to take up new offshore projects in international markets.The significant increase in oil prices is aiding its overall business. Increased participation in growth of drilling and completion activities across the world brightened the company’s outlook. Also, it boasts of becoming the first company in the energy service industry to add Scope 3 emissions ambition in the net-zero emission target.  However, the company’s balance sheet has massive debt exposure compared with the composite stocks in the industry.

According to Small Business Trends, citing a survey done by Amazon research tool Jungle Scout, 66% of shoppers expect it for every purchase they make — and 80% think it should be mandatory once purchases reach a certain dollar amount.Discover: 11 Grocery Items To Buy at Dollar TreeMore: If Your Credit Score is Under 740, Make These 3 Moves NowThis is especially prominent when it comes to holiday shopping trends. So much so that, in 2008, National Free Shipping Day became an annual celebration every December, scheduled this year for Dec. 14.The Krazy Coupon Lady has released a list of 62 stores now carrying free shipping in time for the holidays. The list was published on Nov. 23 and shows that major retailers are offering this perk, including Walmart, Nordstrom and Target.Most stores, however, still require a minimum purchase total in order to receive the benefit. Per its blog, Target requires a purchase of $35 or more (unless you are a RedCard carrying member, in which case shipping is free). Walmart requires a $35 or greater purchase to qualify for free shipping — though if you have a Walmart+ membership, every purchase comes with free shipping. Stores like Crate &amp; Barrel have a “free shipping” section on their website to identify which items will net the perk.But there are other ways to get around the store minimums and get free shipping this month.Send the item directly to your gift recipientRather than paying to have the item shipped to you, unboxing it, rewrapping it and then again shipping it to your gift recipient, it’s best to send it right to them. As you’re checking out, use their address for the shipping section (just be sure to change the billing address to your own so your transaction goes through) and you can usually click a box that says “this is a gift” so that the receipt doesn’t show the price. Sometimes, retailers like Amazon allow you to add a personal greeting, too.Story continuesWith USPS prices increasing by up to $6.50 this peak holiday season, as noted in a USPS press release, this is a great way to save some money — especially if the store is already offering free shipping.Ship to store and pick upDuring the pandemic, many stores started offering online orders with in-store pickups for people who didn’t want to actually do their shopping indoors but needed the items fast. That perk has stuck around years later, and has become a popular option for consumers.Target is a big one for in-store shopping and Nordstrom is another retailer that offers a “ship to store” option. Free shipping is available for purchases if sent to a retail location in your area. If the store is convenient to get to, this is another great way to save on shipping fees. The Krazy Koupon lady lists 22 other chains allowing for this process, including Macy’s, Kohl’s and Apple.Use trial periods to your advantageAmazon Prime offers a 30-day free trial period for new members, as does Walmart+. Both memberships offer free shipping on every purchase. The 30-day trial period means you can enjoy free shipping for all of December — however, you’ll need to cancel by January in order to avoid being charged $12.95/month for Walmart+ and $14.99/month for Amazon Prime.Check your memberships for perksPer Fortune, UPS offers shipping discounts for both AAA and AARP members, and FedEx provides the same for USAA members.American Express also has a partnership with ShopRunner wherein some AMEX cardholders can get a complimentary membership with ShopRunner, which provides shipping (this is normally a $79/annual fee). ShopRunner has agreements with 100-plus brands (like ProFlowers and the NFL Shop, for example), per The Motley Fool.Do all your shopping at just a couple storesFor the stores that do have minimums to get free shipping, you might want to bulk shop for gift recipients there in order to meet the threshold and get everything shipped for free.Since many major stores offer free shipping when spending around $35 (like Walmart and Target listed above) that’s a pretty easy number to reach — and their selection of gifts is pretty expansive, allowing you to find something for nearly everyone.Take Our Poll: How Has Inflation Impacted Your Holiday Shopping Plans?Find: The 15 Best Holiday Deals From Costco’s December Coupon BookAsk for free shippingYou never know unless you ask!

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Stagflation Stocks To Buy. Stagflation Definition: What is Stagflation?Stagflation refers to consistently high inflation paired with peak unemployment and slow demand. While economists initially believed that stagflation was a foreign concept, as unemployment and inflation rates usually move in different directions, they learned after the ‘Great Inflation’ in 1970s that stagflation is indeed real and it can batter an economy. The term stagflation was coined in 1965 when Iain Macleod, a British Conservative Party politician, said in a House of Commons speech:""We now have the worst of both worlds — not just inflation on the one side or stagnation on the other, but both of them together. We have a sort of 'stagflation' situation and history in modern terms is indeed being made.""Stagflation favors defensive companies whose products and services are necessary for people’s day-to-day lives. This means their share prices often stay resilient despite a slowing macro backdrop. In quantitative terms, defensive sectors usually have a market beta of under 1, which means they outperform when the benchmark index declines, whereas cyclical sectors have a market beta of more than 1, indicating underperformance when the index falls. Utilities, energy, consumer staples, healthcare, and real estate are some of the defensive sectors that perform well, whereas their cyclical counterparts like technology, industrials, and financials take a hit during stagflation economies. Jonathan Wright, professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University, explained that stagflation may occur if a recession is triggered before inflation is limited to where the Federal Reserve wants it to be. Stagflation remains the primary risk for the global economy in 2023, according to Wall Street experts who believe that any rally in equity markets is too unsustainable following the severe selloff in 2022. Nicole Kornitzer, a Paris-based portfolio manager at Kornitzer Capital Management Inc, told Bloomberg on November 28: Story continues“Next year is still going to be difficult. Definitely, stagflation is the outlook for now.” A majority of Wall Street experts believe that the stock market is heading towards stagflation in 2023, similar to the 1970s, as per Bank of America. In its most recent survey of fund managers, BofA found that 92% of them see a period of high inflation and low economic growth in 2023, while 0% foresee a bullish ""goldilocks"" scenario, where the economy evades a recession and inflation declines.Some of the best stagflation stocks to buy include AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Stagflation Definition: 10 Best Stagflation Stocks To BuyPhoto by Mirza Babic on UnsplashOur Methodology For this article, we selected stocks which are defensive in nature, offer strong market visibility, have resilient dividend profiles, and display a longstanding history of surviving volatile market environments.

(NYSE:GIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) manufactures and markets branded consumer foods worldwide.

With a possible recession approaching, the analyst noted that the U.S. packaged food group has historically outperformed the S&amp;P 500 during economic downturns, but he told investors it is ""important to separate the wheat from the chaff"".

Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 1.6 million shares worth $129 million. Here is what Chartwell Investment Partners has to say about General Mills, Inc.

Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) is a Switzerland-based provider of insurance and reinsurance products worldwide. The company operates through North America Commercial P&amp;C Insurance, North America Personal P&amp;C Insurance, North America Agricultural Insurance, Overseas General Insurance, Global Reinsurance, and Life Insurance segments.

The analyst raised his fiscal 2023 earnings forecasts by a cumulative 12%, which he said makes Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB)’s current valuation ""much more attractive.""

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”7. eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42eBay Inc.

(NASDAQ:EBAY) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 43 funds in the prior quarter worth $1.3 billion.

(NASDAQ:EBAY) in the Q2 2022 investor letter:“We believe you need to avoid these formerly glamorous stock groups for many years. We loved to use eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) as a poster child back in 1999 for the dotcom bubble. We bought it eight years later and have done very well on it. We wouldn’t have done well if we bought it in the early years of that bear market, or even five years later. If you think this bear will be shorter and or less damaging than the dotcom bear market of 2000-2003, you could be showing your inexperience!.”6. Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) owns a portfolio of communications infrastructure that connects cities and communities to essential data, technology, and wireless services. Crown Castle Inc.

(NYSE:ABBV), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) is one of the premier stagflation stocks to monitor. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Global Infrastructure Income Strategy has to say about Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“U.S. communications company Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI) was the largest detractor from quarterly performance. Crown Castle is the leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure in the U.S. with a portfolio of approximately 40,000 towers. The stock underperformed as, driven by rising interest rates, investors rotated away from defensive into more value-oriented sectors. Communications infrastructure remains attractive, however, as companies continue to deploy greater capital spend to support the strong tailwinds from 5G.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stagflation Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:11 Best Delivery Stocks To Buy12 Best Falling Stocks To Buy Now12 Best ESG Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. Stagflation Definition: 10 Best Stagflation Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

But while many of those shootings occur in the workplace, employers are rarely held responsible.That is in part because nearly all U.S. states, including Virginia, require employers to buy workers compensation insurance to pay workers for medical expenses and lost wages stemming from workplace injuries. In return, the employers are shielded from most lawsuits workers could otherwise bring.""As a general matter, employees cannot sue their employers for injuries that they suffer on the job due to negligence by the employer,"" said Timothy Lytton, a professor at Georgia State University College of Law.But, some states, including Virginia, do make an exception for cases of gross negligence by an employer.Donya Prioleau, the Virginia employee suing Walmart, claims exactly that, saying that the shooter, Andre Bing, had a history of ""bizarre and threatening"" behavior and that she and other employees had warned Walmart management about him.The 31-year-old Bing, who worked as a supervisor for an overnight shift, opened fire on fellow employees in a break room on Nov. 22 before turning his gun on himself, according to witnesses.The lawsuit says Bing had ""known propensities"" for violence and threatening behavior. Prioleau said he had asked her if she liked guns, questioned other employees whether they had received active shooter training and saying he would retaliate if he were fired.Story continuesShe said she made a formal complaint about Bing after he harassed her and called her a ""bitch,"" and that other employees complained about him as well, though the lawsuit does not give details about those complaints.A Walmart spokesperson said the company is reviewing the complaint and will respond in court.The question before the Chesapeake Circuit Court in Virginia, where the lawsuit was filed Tuesday, will be whether the company was negligent to the extent that it is not shielded by workers' compensation.Workers' compensation is ""a tough defense to overcome,"" said Jeffrey Harris, a Georgia-based plaintiffs' attorney who has handled numerous workplace injury cases. ""It is usually construed very broadly to protect the employer.""Prioleau's case may depend on what, exactly, Walmart management was told about Bing, and whether it amounted to a concrete threat. She will have to prove that the company was told that its employees faced a specific danger, and that it did not care - a ""conscious disregard"" for their safety, Lytton said.Some past cases illustrate the challenge.Last month, an Indiana federal judge dismissed a lawsuit accusing FedEx of negligence after a former employee killed 8 workers in 2021 at an Indianapolis facility. UPS escaped lawsuits by dozens of workers and victims' relatives after one of its employees shot and killed three coworkers at a San Francisco facility in 2017. In both cases, courts said workers' compensation was the only available remedy because there were no allegations that the employers were warned of a threat.On the other hand, in 2016, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., allowed negligence lawsuits to proceed against government contractors that employed an IT worker who killed 12 people at a U.S. Navy facility. The judge said the companies were aware of the shooter's history of violent and paranoid behavior, including gun-related arrests, and that other employees had said they feared he might hurt others. The cases later settled for undisclosed amounts.Prioleau's allegations seem to fall somewhere in between.Kevin Morrison, a lawyer who represented the plaintiffs in the UPS case, said Bing's history might be enough to support a finding of gross negligence.""If the evidence shows Walmart was made aware of Bing's threats or the fact that he was a gun nut and Walmart turned a blind eye then there is an avenue for recovery for these folks,"" he said.Still, according to Morrison, the threat would have to have been specific.""It can't just be water cooler chat,"" he said.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points:·        For the 469 S&amp;P 500 members that have reported Q3 results already, total earnings are up +2.2% from the same period last year on +11.9% higher revenues, with 69.1% beating EPS estimates and 67.8% beating revenue estimates.·        Looking at 2022 Q3 as a whole, total S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +1.5% from the same period last year on +11.6% higher revenues. Excluding contributions from the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the index would be -5.9% below the year-earlier level.·        Looking at the calendar-year picture, total S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to be up +4.9% in 2022 and +3.1% in 2023. On an ex-Energy basis, total 2022 index earnings would be down -2.1% (instead of +4.9%, with Energy).·        Full year 2023 earnings estimates have been coming down after peaking in mid-April, with the aggregate total down -8.4% from the peak for the index as a whole and -11.3% on an ex-Energy basis.As the Q3 earnings season enters its final phase, we continue to see the overall earnings picture as more stable and resilient than many were willing to acknowledge ahead of the start of this reporting cycle. We are not suggesting that corporate earnings are great, but they aren't bad either.Story continuesMany in the market feared an earnings cliff that would force management teams across many industries to provide downbeat guidance. We got some of those downbeat reports, with Target TGT as the latest to come out with disappointing results and guidance. But we also had Walmart WMT and Lowe's LOW which impressed Wall Street.Not much growth was expected given where we are in the economic cycle. But the actual growth coming through the results is ever so slightly better than expected. It is this performance relative to expectations rather than the absolute level of earnings or the growth pace that is of relevance to the market.Looking at expectations for 2022 Q4 and beyond, they are getting reset lower, as we have been pointing out for a while now. Analysts have been steadily cutting their estimates for some time. We saw this in the run up to the start of the Q3 earnings season and the trend continues with respect to estimates for the current period (2022 Q4) and full-year 2023.As we have consistently been pointing out, aggregate S&amp;P 500 earnings outside of the Energy sector peaked in mid-April and have been steadily trending down ever since. In fact, S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates in the aggregate outside of the Energy sector have declined more than -11% since mid-April, with much bigger declines in Retail, Construction, Consumer Discretionary, Tech, Industrial Products and the Aerospace sectors. On the whole, estimates are down for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors.The Overall Earnings PictureEarnings next year are expected to be up only +3.1%. This magnitude of growth can hardly be called out-of-sync with a flat or even modestly down economic growth outlook. Don't forget that headline GDP growth numbers are in real or inflation-adjusted terms while S&amp;P 500 earnings discussed here are not.As mentioned earlier, 2023 aggregate earnings estimates on an ex-Energy basis are already down by more than -11% since mid-April. Perhaps we see a bit more downward adjustments to estimates over the coming weeks, after we have seen Q3 results. But we have nevertheless already covered some ground in taking estimates to a fair or appropriate level.This is particularly so if whatever economic downturn lies ahead proves to be more of the garden variety rather than the last two such events. Recency bias forces us to use the last two economic downturns, which were also among the nastiest in recent history, as our reference points. But we need to be cautious against that natural tendency as the economy's foundations at present remain unusually strong.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

36,9e024c5d-c3a4-372b-96d0-88edbc0ccd72,JWN,2022-12-02,7 Consumer Discretionary Stocks That Can Storm Back in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-consumer-discretionary-stocks-storm-175830462.html,1669658310,STORY,"['JWN', 'PVH', 'THO', 'WSM', 'VAC', 'HRB', 'KMX']","[Although the blues of 2022 negatively impacted most sectors not tethered to the energy or defense sectors, some of the top consumer discretionary stocks to buy absorbed some of the worst hits. Initially, inflation woes ground down consumer sentiment. Later, the Federal Reserve responded strongly with interest rate hikes. Unfortunately, this action in part contributed to mass layoffs, which is inherently deflationary (i.e. fewer dollars chasing more goods).Admittedly, this segment caters to contrarian risk-takers: it’s not for those that can’t handle volatility. At the same time, it may be too early to give up on certain consumer discretionary stocks. Here, investors must think cynically. If the broader economy does fall into a recession, some companies may benefit more than others.As well, investors can indirectly advantage of other developments in the global markets, including the wealth gap, automotive dynamics, and even the blockchain. Curious? Read on to learn more about intriguing consumer discretionary stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPVHPVH. Corp.$63.43JWNNordstrom$21.03WSMWilliams-Sonoma$116.94HRBH&amp;R Block$43.14THOThor Industries$86.28KMXCarMax$65.99VACMarriott Vacations$145.74Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy: PVH Corp (PVH)A photo of someone looking at clothing on hangers, hanging from a rack.Source: Rawpixel.com/ShutterStock.comWhile the company name PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH) might not resonate with most folks, its individual brands command international awareness. These include Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. In addition, PVH licenses brands such as Kenneth Cole New York and Michael Kors. Still, as a name within the ranks of consumer discretionary stocks, the company expectedly performed poorly this year.Indeed, since the January opener, PVH dropped more than 41% in equity value. With so much uncertainty in the global economy, many consumers understandably slashed their expenditures. At the same time, PVH may represent one of the consumer discretionary stocks that can bounce higher. For one thing, shares gained nearly 23% of market value in the trailing month.Story continuesMore importantly, workplace normalization may end up boosting PVH even higher. According to one report, 90% of companies will require their employees to return to the office at least part of the week starting in 2023. This dynamic may spark a wardrobe upgrade, which could help the apparel giant.Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy: Nordstrom (JWN)A Nordstrom (JWN) storefront in Toronto, Canada.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comFounded in 1901, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) is a luxury department store chain synonymous with American consumerism during the analog era. During the current digital period, Nordstrom lost some of its swagger relative to its heyday. With e-commerce rivals challenging its throne, JWN came under pressure. As well, the circumstances associated with 2022 imposed significant challenges.Still, as a luxury-focused name among consumer discretionary stocks, Nordstrom performed admirably. Yes, JWN is in the red since the start of this year. However, it’s only down by less than 8%, which is far better than what the benchmark S&amp;P 500 could muster. Moreover, the company built positive near-term momentum. In the trailing five days, JWN gained 3% while in the trailing month, shares swung up over 7%.Another factor moving in Nordstrom’s favor centers on its value proposition. According to data from Gurufocus.com, the market prices JWN at 8.5 times forward earnings. In contrast, the forward price-earnings ratio for the retail cyclical sector is nearly 14 times.Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy: Williams-Sonoma (WSM)the interior of a crowded shopping mallSource: jayk67 / Shutterstock.comGenerally speaking, consumer discretionary stocks are among the first investment classes to tumble because people can always cut their spending. As well, the word “discretionary” implies not 100% necessary. Nevertheless, contrarian investors may want to give a second look at Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM), the popular kitchenware and home furnishings retailer.It all comes down to the affluent user base. While the current median household income in the U.S. is probably around $70,000, Williams-Sonoma’s typical customer hails from a household generating $100,000 of income. As such, people who shop at the trendy retailer will likely be more resilient should the smelly stuff hit the proverbial fan.And similar to Nordstrom, Williams-Sonoma also features an attractively valued financial profile. Per data from Gurufocus.com, the market prices WSM at just a hair over 8 times forward earnings. This compares very favorably to the industry PE of 14 times (or lower than 84% of the competition).H&amp;R Block (HRB)Source: ShutterstockAlthough it’s a bit of a stretch, some investment resources label tax-preparation service provider H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB) as a name among consumer discretionary stocks. In some ways, it makes sense. You don’t have to seek tax advice as you can always consult free government resources. Now, whether you agree with the classification or not, HRB inarguably represents a strong performer.While so many publicly traded securities succumbed to the malaise of 2022, HRB finds itself up over 76% for the year thus far. To be fair, it’s been on a comparative lull lately, with shares gaining less than 5% in the trailing month. Still, the fundamentals could drive shares higher over the next several months to perhaps years. I’m confident because of the cryptocurrency fallout. With blockchain assets melting down, the severe volatility undoubtedly caused some investors to cash out. Naturally, this action creates a taxable event. Given how confusing crypto-related taxes are, HRB might enjoy a relevancy spike.Thor Industries (THO)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comFor the final three ideas for consumer discretionary stocks, I’m going to explore the most speculative component, beginning with Thor Industries (NYSE:THO). An American manufacturer of recreational vehicles, the company sells towable and motorized RVs through its subsidiary brands. Of course, RVs commanded plenty of relevance during peak coronavirus fears. Today? Not so much.Nevertheless, it’s possible that THO can rise compared to other consumer discretionary stocks because of the wealth gap. Essentially, the one segment of society that made out like bandits during Covid-19 was the exceptionally affluent. Should an economic downturn materialize, these are the folks that really won’t feel that much pain. Further, if Thor can attract this segment, it could ride out the storm.Like other overlooked consumer discretionary stocks, Thor Industries finds itself being significantly undervalued. Per Gurufocus.com, Wall Street prices THO at 4.2 times trailing-12-month (TTM) earnings. For comparison’s sake, the sector median PE ratio is 16.6 times.CarMax (KMX)Used car market: a row of cars of different makes and models sitting on a lot.Source: Mikbiz / ShutterstockEasily one of the riskiest ideas among consumer discretionary stocks – or any category for that matter – used-car dealership CarMax (NYSE:KMX) succumbed to significant market pressure. Since the beginning of this year, KMX gave up over 47% of its equity value. Much of this volatility can be blamed on the Federal Reserve and its efforts to contain runaway inflation. Unfortunately, this action translates to higher interest rates, which imposes an affordability strain.Still, even with prospects seemingly incredibly poor for CarMax, KMX managed to gain almost 8% in the trailing month. How can this be? While KMX represents one of the consumer discretionary stocks, the underlying business is also a necessity. For instance, with west-coast regions generally featuring less robust public transportation networks than the east coast, personal vehicles are indispensable.As well, cars on U.S. roadways already reached a record average age of 12.2 years. At a certain point, it’s simply better for people to acquire a new (or newish) car than to keep repairing a money pit.Marriott Vacations (VAC)Beautiful beach. Chairs on the sandy beach near the sea. Summer holiday and vacation concept for tourism. Inspirational tropical landscape. Tranquil scenery, relaxing beach, tropical landscape design. SLNA stockSource: icemanphotos / Shutterstock.comTo be blunt, I presently don’t have the warm and fuzzies for the broader travel sector. Nevertheless, Marriott Vacations (NYSE:VAC) might be worth a look for speculators. Per its public profile, Marriott Vacations is a pure-play public timeshare company. Put another way, it’s revenge travel for the rich.What makes VAC intriguing from the perspective of consumer discretionary stocks centers on market performance. True, the company is in the red for the year. However, with a loss of a bit over 13% YTD, it’s not the most garish shade of crimson. As well, in the trailing month, shares gained nearly 2% of equity value. It’s not much but it could be the early start of a sustained positive trend.Financially, Marriott Vacations brings some food for thought. Based on Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculation for fair market value, VAC may be modestly undervalued. In addition, the company features decently strong profit margins. If you like to gamble, VAC could be interesting.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

In addition, North American bank CROs representing institutions with assets ranging from $25 billion to over $1 trillion say economic worries and the need to prepare for potential recession are piling on top of non-financial risks like consumer compliance, cyber threats, and climate risk.Top risk priorities (Percentage of respondents citing each among their top five priorities)1.

While the industry as a whole was able to carry out its vital role despite the challenges of the pandemic, there is broad recognition that more work is required to increase preparedness for faster-moving and more idiosyncratic disruptions.Story continuesTop operational disruptions identified by respondents include a variety of third-party disruptions (93%), data corruptions (for example, those caused by ransomware) (70%), and internal technology failures (55%). CROs see strong business reasons for improving operational resilience.

Shares have added about 7.8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Xylem due for a pullback?

The bottom line increased 25.4% year over year.Xylem’s revenues of $1,380 million also outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,330 million and inched up approximately 9.1% year over year. Organic sales in the quarter rose 16%.Orders in the reported quarter decreased 7% year over year to $1,419 million. Organically, orders decreased by 1% owing to currency differences.Segmental DetailsRevenues in the Water Infrastructure segment were $574 million, up 5% year over year. Organic sales in the reported quarter grew 13% year over year, buoyed by effective price realization, healthy activity in the utility business in the U.S. and Western Europe and dewatering demand in the US and Emerging Markets.The Applied Water segment generated revenues of $458 million in the third quarter, up 15% year over year. Organic sales increased 20% on a year-over-year basis. The segmental performance benefited from strong price realization and backlog execution in all end markets.Quarterly revenues at the Measurement &amp; Control Solutions segment were $348 million, up 9% year over year. Organic sales were up 15% year over year due to strength in the water quality test applications.Margin ProfileIn the reported quarter, Xylem’s adjusted EBITDA was $252 million, up 11.5% from the year-ago quarter’s level. The margin in the quarter improved 170 basis points (bps) year over year to 18.3%.Operating income was $168 million in the quarter under review, up 10.5% year over year.

The company also bought back shares worth $52 million in the same period, down 23.5% year over year.OutlookOwing to strong demand, price realization and gradual easing of supply-chain constraints, Xylem raised its adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year. The company now expects the metric to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.75 compared with $2.50 to $2.70 anticipated earlier. The mid-point of the guided range — $2.70 — lies above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.58.Xylem now anticipates full-year revenues to increase 4% on a reported basis and 9-10% on an organic basis compared with organic revenue growth and reported revenue increase of 8-10% and 3-5% estimated earlier.For 2022, the adjusted EBITDA margin is now expected to be approximately 17% compared with 16.5-17% anticipated earlier.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Gartner Surpasses Q3 Earnings &amp; Revenue EstimatesGartner reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2022 results, wherein earnings and revenues surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Adjusted earnings (excluding 24 cents from non-recurring items) per share of $2.41 beat the consensus mark by 30.3% and increased 18.7% year over year.

Gartner repurchased 0.4 million common shares for $97 million.Story continues2022 ViewAdjusted EPS is anticipated to be $10.06 (previous view: $8.85). Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be $1.36 billion (previous view: $1.235 billion). Free cash flow is anticipated to be 1,025 million (previous view: $985 million).How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted 19.83% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Gartner has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

49,54f8e086-3f2d-3474-b697-a590df647a2b,IT,2022-12-02,"Gartner, Inc. (IT) Soars to 52-Week High, Time to Cash Out?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gartner-inc-soars-52-week-141502480.html,1669904102,STORY,"['IT', 'CRAI']","[Shares of Gartner (IT) have been strong performers lately, with the stock up 10% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $350.93 in the previous session. Gartner has gained 4.8% since the start of the year compared to the -25.9% move for the Zacks Business Services sector and the -21.3% return for the Zacks Consulting Services industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on November 1, 2022, Gartner reported EPS of $2.41 versus consensus estimate of $1.85 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 4.68%.For the current fiscal year, Gartner is expected to post earnings of $9.82 per share on $5.43 billion in revenues. This represents a 6.51% change in EPS on a 14.6% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $9.60 per share on $5.91 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of -2.29% and 8.94%, respectively.Valuation MetricsGartner may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Gartner has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 35.7X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 23.5X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 28.5X versus its peer group's average of 20X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.91. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Gartner currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Gartner fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Gartner shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does IT Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of IT have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Charles River Associates (CRAI). CRAI has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of B.Earnings were strong last quarter. Charles River Associates beat our consensus estimate by 33.33%, and for the current fiscal year, CRAI is expected to post earnings of $6.11 per share on revenue of $595.35 million.Shares of Charles River Associates have gained 20.4% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 20.02X and a P/CF of 13.52X.The Consulting Services industry is in the top 15% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for IT and CRAI, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""We're making some modest cuts all over the globe. In most businesses, that's what you do after many years of growth.""Corporations have postponed dealmaking as U.S. inflation remains high. That has put pressure on investment banks that earned record profits last year from advising on mergers, acquisitions and initial public offerings.In a wide-ranging interview, Gorman also praised billionaire Tesla Inc chief Elon Musk, one of the bank's clients.""I wouldn't bet against Elon Musk,"" Gorman said. ""He's probably, along with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and one or two others, the most interesting entrepreneur of last 50 years. Who would not want to do business with a person who has that kind of capability,"" he added. Morgan Stanley was among the lenders that provided $13 billion in financing for Musk's $44-billion acquisition of Twitter Inc. Reuters reported in October that banks abandoned plans to sell the debt to investors because of uncertainty around Twitter's fortunes and losses, citing people familiar with the matter.While Musk's management style has raised concerns among advocates of content moderation on one of the biggest social media platforms globally, he has also found support among C-suite executives. On Wednesday, Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings called Musk ""the bravest, most creative person on the planet.""Gorman said Morgan Stanley was targeting bringing in $1 trillion of new money from clients every three years. The bank plans to eventually boost assets under management to $10 trillion, he said, without specifying a timeframe for the target. Client assets, which include wealth and investment management businesses, were $5.4 trillion at the end of September.Story continuesAfter taking the helm at the Wall Street giant in 2010, Gorman has transformed Morgan Stanley into a more diversified firm less reliant on its traditional strengths - trading and investment banking.He struck major deals including the acquisitions of money manager Eaton Vance, online broker E*Trade, stock-plan manager Solium Capital and Smith Barney, a brokerage and investment adviser that became a cornerstone of the bank's wealth management arm.Wealth management accounted for 47% of Morgan Stanley's revenue in the third quarter, compared with 34% during his first quarter as chief executive.After a dozen years leading the bank, Gorman said he was preparing four potential successors, without naming them. Morgan Stanley co-presidents Ted Pick and Andy Saperstein, chief operating officer Jonathan Pruzan, and head of investment management Dan Simkowitz are widely seen as contenders for the top job.""I have a plan, and I don't do a lot of things by accident when it comes to running a business,"" he said. ""There will be a plan, there will be a result, one of those four executives will run Morgan Stanley, we will hit $10 trillion in assets.""To view the Reuters NEXT conference live on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1, please click here.(Reporting by Lananh Nguyen, Saeed Azhar and Megan Davies in New York and Noor Zainab Hussain and Niket Nishant in Bengaluru; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Sam Holmes)]"

The latest in the Firm’s Sustainable Signals series, this institutional investor survey polled 110 asset owners in North America, Europe and Asia, as well as 201 asset managers across the same regions to understand what asset owners want and what asset managers are offering—and where the gaps lie in delivering environmental, social and governance (ESG) solutions.""The results of our latest Sustainable Signals survey show that sustainable investing remains an important focus area for institutional investors globally, with the vast majority reporting an increased interest over the past two years,"" said Jessica Alsford, Chief Sustainability Officer and CEO of the Institute for Sustainable Investing at Morgan Stanley. ""At the same time, our findings show a significant opportunity for asset managers to better align with asset owner priorities in areas including sustainable investing practices and policies, access to key ESG data and metrics, and development of new sustainable investment products. Closing these gaps could help to boost the credibility and adoption of sustainable investing strategies among institutional investors across the globe.""According to the survey, the majority of asset managers and owners (77%) reported increasing interest in sustainable investing since May 2020, driven by pressures from clients and investors, shifting public sentiment and regulatory developments. Eighty-five percent of asset managers and 83% of asset owners state that they already implement or plan to implement sustainable investing in all or part of their portfolios. Regional differences were observed as well, with EMEA outpacing other geographies to date, but APAC respondents expressing the most interest in expanding their sustainable investing approach and products in the next 24 months.Story continuesHowever, there is a gap between asset managers and asset owners, with three key areas identified in the survey:Sustainable Investing Practices and Policies – The largest gap in sustainable investing practices relates to ESG reporting and disclosure (49%) – with only 39% of asset managers reporting ESG impact alongside financial performance, despite 88% of asset owners saying they seek third-party managers that provide this information.New and Expanded Sustainable Investing Products – 50% of asset owners identified climate change as their top thematic investment priority, while just 33% of asset managers have product offerings that meet that demand. The disconnect extends to additional areas where there is a gap between asset manager products or solutions compared to asset owner interest on themes including water solutions (19%) and education (10%).Sustainable Investing Data &amp; Metrics – 82% of asset owners want managers to provide carbon footprint data, but only 63% of asset managers surveyed offer this information. The biggest gap lies with fund managers providing climate risk related data to investors, like stress testing and scenario analysis.In addition to revealing gaps in asset owner and asset manager sustainability priorities, the survey highlights two main challenges to growth, including insufficient data and a talent gap. Eight in 10 asset owners said they lack data to adequately measure their investments’ environmental and social impact, and more than half of institutional investors (57%) agree that sustainable investing loses credibility when investors can’t measure impact.Another hurdle identified by institutional investors is an industry-wide talent gap. While a majority of asset managers (66%) and asset owners (53%) report increasing their headcount of sustainable investing specialists between May 2020 and May 2022, they also said the talent pool is still not meeting their hiring demands, with just 39% of asset managers and 23% of asset owners finding enough qualified individuals to meet their organizations’ needs.View the full results of the Sustainable Signals survey here.About Morgan StanleyMorgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) is a leading global financial services firm providing a wide range of investment banking, securities, wealth management and investment management services.

Economists expect about 200,000 jobs were added in November, which would indicate a slowdown in job creation from 261,000 the prior month.Back in Europe, inflation in the Eurozone fell more than expected in November, but remained near record levels at 10% on an annual basis.European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde warned on Friday that some European governments' fiscal policies could lead to excess demand, prompting the central bank to have to tighten monetary policy more than would otherwise be necessary.The economic data slate in Europe Friday includes October trade data for Germany and Eurozone producer prices for the same month.In the corporate sector, Credit Suisse (SIX:CSGN) is likely to remain in the spotlight Friday as continued client outflows at the embattled Swiss lender could spark takeover speculation and may lead to the partial sale of its domestic unit, according to analysts at influential investment bank JPMorgan.Story continuesCrude oil prices traded largely flat Friday but are set to post a weekly advance on hopes China is set to further relax its COVID restrictions, boosting economic activity and thus demand for energy at the biggest crude importer in the world.Beijing announced it would allow some infected people to isolate at home in the nation’s capital, another softening of the country’s strict COVID stance, raising hopes of a broader easing of its quarantine protocols in coming days after a period of civil unrest.Elsewhere, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, meets virtually on Sunday to decide future production levels, while European Union governments are still discussing the level at which to cap the price on Russian seaborne oil.By 02:00 ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $81.12 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $86.92.Both benchmarks were on track for their first weekly gains after three consecutive weeks of decline.Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,813.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.0527.Related ArticlesEuropean stock futures edge lower; looming U.S. payrolls prompt cautionExclusive-Credit Suisse looks to speed up cuts as revenue outlook worsensVolvo Cars' sales growth accelerates to 12% in November]"

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ETBitcoin's Short Winning Streak EndsBy James RubinCrypto prices, which had been rolling this week, retreated on Thursday, underscoring investors' caution about the industry's fate, and the wider economy.Bitcoin was recently trading just below $17,000, off 0.8% over the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had risen three consecutive days amid encouraging jobs and productivity data and hopes that the U.S. central bank was ready to scale back its hawkish monetary policy. On Wednesday, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had suggested in a speech at the Brookings Institute that the Fed might raise interest rates 50 basis points, down from its recent 75 basis points regimen.But in the 36 hours since Powell's remarks, cryptos have been largely unimpressed by the prospect of increased liquidity and more concerned about contagion linked to crypto exchange giant FTX's collapse, not to mention other 2022 debacles still winding their way through courts.""Cryptos are struggling,"" wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, in an email. ""Concerns brew that Tether loans could be the next big risk for the cryptoverse. Stablecoins are an important part of the crypto world and if one of the major ones break, that will send bitcoin and [ether] to new lows.""Story continuesEther was holding steady at slightly under $1,300, down 1.2%. Other major cryptos were largely in the red, albeit lightly shaded, although popular meme coin DOGE recently dropped more than 4%. DOGE had climbed about 50% over an eight-day stretch starting Nov. 22. MATIC, the token of the layer 2 Polygon blockchain platform, was down more than 2% after rising the past couple of days at least partly on news that its application programming interface (APIs) would soon deploy on web3 indexing service, The Graph.The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, slipped 1.26%.Cryptos' day largely dovetailed with stocks' sluggish day as the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 declined a few fractions of a percentage point. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose slightly.Moya noted that investors – crypto and otherwise – would be awaiting the release of nonfarm payroll data for the latest read on the U.S. job market, which has shown signs of cooling over the last few months. In November, private companies added only 127,000 jobs, according to payroll processor ADP, less than half the number in October.Meanwhile, Pranav Kanade, portfolio manager for mutual fund and exchange-traded fund company VanEck, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program on Wednesday that predicting where crypto prices bottom out would be difficult, although he struck an upbeat note about recent industry crises and market bearishness.""When we look at one of the positives coming out of what just happened, you have seen a lot of investors withdraw assets into self-custody,"" he said, adding: ""My guess is that anyone who's remaining in the ecosystem are likely true believers in the underlying technology and even the future upside of the asset class.""Biggest GainersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorLoopringLRC+2.9%Smart Contract PlatformTerraLUNA+1.8%Smart Contract PlatformChainlinkLINK+0.6%ComputingBiggest LosersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorSolanaSOL−3.0%Smart Contract PlatformDogecoinDOGE−2.8%CurrencyStellarXLM−1.9%Smart Contract PlatformInsightsIn Some Corners, Crypto Dreams Are Still ThrivingBy Shaurya MalwaWhat bear market?Depending where you look, the crypto dream is thriving.A recently concluded initial exchange offering (IEO) at crypto exchange Binance saw participants lock up over 9 million BNB, valued at over $2.7 billion, as they competed for the allocation of Hooked Protocol’s HOOK tokens.The IEO, a fundraising event administered by an exchange, comes as crypto markets weather a year-long bear market that has been exacerbated by the implosion of multiple major projects, most recently crypto exchange giant FTX. Some tokens have lost as much as 95% of their value amid the contagion, and bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has plunged more than 60%.IEOs usually see users lock up a certain amount of that exchange’s native tokens for allocation in another token that would soon be traded on that exchange.A total of 114,772 participants committed 9,010,765.2954 BNB during the subscription period, representing an oversubscription of 1,066x. Users would receive 139.44 HOOK to 13,944 HOOK based on the BNB they lock up. The BNB would be returned to users after HOOK is distributed – minus a predetermined fixed amount ranging from 0.4 BNB to 4 BNB.Hooked Protocol builds the on-ramp layer for Web3 applications and bespoke ""learn and earn"" products. HOOK is the governance token of the ecosystem, and is used to access community events and exclusive NFTs, and for in-app purchases, including game tools, for dapps built on Hooked.Hooked Protocol has raised over $6 million from two rounds of private token sales earlier this year and has a current valuation of $60 million.

He also pointed to a protracted economic adjustment to higher borrowing costs and a slow decline inflation as well as a chronic shortage of workers in the United States.While oil futures settled well below their session highs, crude had risen sharply earlier in the session on the chance of further supply cuts by OPEC+ and as easing COVID curbs in China spurred hopes for higher demand from world's top crude importer.While equity investors cheered signs of moderating inflation on Thursday and an increase in U.S. consumer spending in October, risk appetites dimmed after data showed U.S. manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in 2-1/2 years in November as higher borrowing costs weighed on demand.Still investors saw easing inflation supporting the Fed chair's indication that rate hikes could slow. In the 12 months through October, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 6.0% after advancing 6.3% in September compared with the Fed's 2% target.""We're in a little bit of a limbo after yesterday's huge rally.

Pricing actions had a favorable impact of 13%.Currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of 5%. Adjusted EBITDA was $185.3 million, up 9% from the last year’s quarter, as favorable price realization and productivity improvements helped offset the impact of lower volumes.Protective: The segment reported net sales of $571 million during the quarter under review, down 6% from the prior-year quarter. The divestiture of Reflectix had an unfavorable impact of 2%, while currency impacted sales by 5%.Pricing had a positive impact of 12%, while volumes slumped by 12% owing to recessionary pressures in the industrial and fulfillment markets.

To be clear, the focus of the aforementioned report centered on natural gas and heating-related solutions. Still, the crude oil industry will certainly note this development.For one thing, it’s not the first time that Wall Street analysts banked on oil stocks to buy as natural gas prices spiked. Second and more fundamentally, both natural gas and crude oil represent fossil fuels. Both are made up of hydrocarbons; therefore, demand fluctuations in one can sometimes (though not always) affect the other.Finally, the debate around post-pandemic workforce paradigms may pivot back toward normalization. One report indicates that 90% of companies will require employees to return to the office for at least part of the week. If so, this will boost collective mileage, in turn lifting fuel demand. Therefore, oil stocks to buy are still very much relevant.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsEQNREquinor$36.54GLPGlobal Partners$31.05GPRKGeoPark$13.82EGYVAALCO Energy$5.08MROMarathon Oil$29.96PSXPhillips 66$109.18EPSNEpsilon Energy$7.30Equinor (EQNR)rising oil prices concept. oil next to green up arrowSource: Pavel Ignatov / Shutterstock.comBased in Norway, Equinor (NYSE:EQNR) makes for an intriguing idea among oil stocks to buy. First, the company is massive, featuring a market capitalization of almost $116.7 billion. As well, it enjoys a mixture of hydrocarbon output along with heavy investments in renewable energy. Therefore, it has one foot in the present reality and the other looking ahead. On a year-to-date basis, shares gained nearly 38% of equity value.On a financial note, investors will likely view Equinor’s balance sheet favorably. At the moment, its cash-to-debt ratio stands at 1.4 times. In contrast, the sector median is only 0.5 times. As well, Equinor’s Altman Z-Score is 3.34, which is on the lower end of the safe zone (in terms of bankruptcy risk). On the income statement, Equinor’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 6.4%, beating out nearly 69% of its peers. Also, its net margin is 16.7%, above 69% of the industry.Story continuesGlobal Partners (GLP)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comAn energy supply firm, Global Partners (NYSE:GLP) focuses on the importing of petroleum products and marketing them in North America. Undoubtedly, one of the attractive attributes of Global Partners centers on passive income. Per Dividend.com, GLP offers a forward yield of 7.91%. That’s well above the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. And while the payout ratio is high at 78%, it’s not absurdly so.Now, the major caveat to all this is that Global Partners is structured as a master limited partnership. Therefore, shareholders must file a Schedule K-1 regarding their GLP holdings. For those that hate extra paperwork, this could be a drag. Therefore, you should think carefully about your individual situation before pulling the trigger.Still, if you decide to move ahead, you should also note that Global Partners features a return on equity of nearly 54%, reflecting an extremely high-quality business. As well, the market prices GLP at only 3.5-times trailing-12-month (TTM) earnings compared to the sector median of 8.7 times. Therefore, it’s worth consideration as one of the oil stocks to buy.GeoPark (GPRK)oil pumpsSource: Thaiview / Shutterstock.comContinuing on this list of lesser-known oil stocks to buy, GeoPark (NYSE:GPRK) is a name that flies under the radar. Still, astute investors may want to give this enterprise a closer look. Founded in 2002, GeoPark is a Latin American oil and gas explorer, operator, and consolidator with assets and growth platforms in Colombia, Ecuador, Chile, and Brazil.Currently, the company commands a market cap of just under $810 million. Since the start of the year, GPRK gained 21% of market value, which is somewhat modest compared to the hottest oil stocks to buy. At the same time, this circumstance may technically give GRPK more room to climb. In addition, GeoPark may benefit from geopolitics given Latin America’s relatively friendly posture to the U.S. (as opposed to Russia).Regarding the financials, GeoPark brings a balanced profile. Backed by decent stability (though not great), GeoPark features above sector median levels for revenue growth and profit margins. In addition, Wall Street prices GPRK at only 2.5 times forward earnings, which is significantly undervalued.VAALCO Energy (EGY)Oil barrel and spilled oil in form of United States isolated on white; oil stocksSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Houston, Texas, VAALCO Energy (NYSE:EGY) engages in hydrocarbon exploration. Per its public profile, VAALCO features operations in Etame Marin block, off the shore of Gabon. Also, the company owns an undeveloped portion of a block offshore Equatorial Guinea. Presently, Vaalco carries a market cap of just under $552 million. Since the beginning of the year, EGY gained 55%.Still, shares are down about 39% from the peak of this year, suggesting further upside potential. For investors looking for oil stocks to buy, VAALCO will likely draw in traders because of its financials. Specifically, the company features a strong cash-to-debt ratio of 21 times, reflecting resiliency against economic storms.On the income statement, VAALCO features a three-year revenue growth rate of 24.7%, beating out over 88% of the competition. Also, its net margin is 19%, above nearly 72% of the industry. Finally, the market prices EGY at only 2.9-time forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median is 6.9 times.Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil gas station carport on sunny day with blue sky backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss/shutterstock.comAlso headquartered in Houston, Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) primarily focuses on hydrocarbon exploration. For history buffs, Marathon represents a direct descendent of Standard Oil. Currently, the company commands a market cap of $19.3 billion. Since the January opener, MRO gained a blistering 80% of market value. While some folks don’t always like buying into strength, MRO gives you a lot for the premium.Fundamentally, Marathon offers a solid balance sheet. Its Altman Z-Score pings at 3.72, reflecting a business generally safe from bankruptcy risk. As well, the company’s equity-to-asset ratio stands at 0.63 times, beating out the industry median of 0.47 times.To be fair, Marathon’s three-year growth rate slipped into a rather middling position, though it ranks better than average. However, its net margin is a staggering 48.7%, exceeding over 91% of the competition. Finally, an argument exists that MRO is undervalued, with shares priced at 5.8 times TTM earnings. This ranks lower than nearly 65% of its rivals.Phillips 66 (PSX)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockA multinational energy firm, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) primarily specializes in the downstream component of the hydrocarbon industry, particularly refining and marketing. As well, the company offers exposure to the midstream segment, which centers on activities such as storage and transportation. Currently, Phillips 66 commands a market cap of $51.6 billion. Since the start of the year, PSX gained over 46% of its equity value.Though PSX represents one of the top-performing oil stocks to buy, it can still move higher. Fundamentally, the aforementioned normalization of the workplace could spark greater demand for fuel. While such a dynamic would bode well for the broader hydrocarbon space, the downstream component would accrue the most benefits.To be fair, on a financial level, PSX represents a greater risk profile among oil stocks to buy. For instance, both its revenue growth rate and net margin run slightly above the middle of the road. That said, Phillips 66 features a relatively stable balance sheet. As well, PSX’s PE ratio is a little over 5 times, whereas the sector median is 8.7 times.Epsilon Energy (EPSN)Several natural gas tanks with a sunrise in the backgroundSource: OlegRi / ShutterstockA North American onshore independent oil and natural gas company, Epsilon Energy (NASDAQ:EPSN) focuses on the acquisition, development, gathering, and production of oil and gas reserves. Presently, Epsilon features a market cap of $166.25 million, making it one of the smaller oil stocks to buy. While this enhances the risk profile, EPSN could also rise dramatically higher.Since the Jan. opener, shares gained over 29% of market value. In the near term, Epsilon is on the move, rising 1.6% in the trailing five days and 7% in the trailing month. With the combination of mobility catalysts (i.e. workers possibly commuting back to the office) and increased demand for heating boosting natural gas prices, Epsilon may be positioned ideally.Certainly, what investors should pay attention to is that the underlying company features zero debt. This gives the company greater flexibility against possible economic turmoil. In addition, Epsilon enjoys strong growth and profit metrics. Finally, EPSN trades for 5.2 times trailing earnings, which is modestly undervalued.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

In that report, analysts expect Microsoft to post earnings of $2.28 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 8.06%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $52.93 billion, up 2.32% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $9.54 per share and revenue of $212.38 billion, which would represent changes of +3.58% and +7.12%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Microsoft. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends.

We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon.

Still, long-term investors have been presented with a potentially strong buying opportunity after the less-than-ideal performance.Let’s take a closer look at each one of these beloved stocks.AppleAnalysts have primarily dialed back their near-term earnings outlook over the last several months, with the company’s upcoming quarter seeing the harshest revisions. The company is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStill, Apple has been able to consistently post better-than-expected earnings results, exceeding earnings and revenue estimates in four consecutive quarters.In its latest print, the tech titan posted a 2.4% bottom-line beat paired with a 1.9% sales surprise.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So while Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Paychex:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.43 = US$1.9b ÷ (US$9.1b - US$4.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to August 2022).Thus, Paychex has an ROCE of 43%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 12% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for Paychex roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Paychex compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Paychex here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at Paychex, we didn't gain much confidence. While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 57%. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.On a related note, Paychex has decreased its current liabilities to 52% of total assets. So we could link some of this to the decrease in ROCE. Effectively this means their suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of the business, which reduces some elements of risk. Some would claim this reduces the business' efficiency at generating ROCE since it is now funding more of the operations with its own money. Keep in mind 52% is still pretty high, so those risks are still somewhat prevalent.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Paychex's ROCEEven though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for Paychex. And long term investors must be optimistic going forward because the stock has returned a huge 110% to shareholders in the last five years. So while the underlying trends could already be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.Paychex does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Paychex  that you might be interested in.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The products offered by this segment are used in transportation, mobile construction, refrigeration and air conditioning, agriculture and other markets.The segment sells its products through two main channels, namely, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and extensive distribution network to smaller OEMs and the aftermarket.Products offered include sealing devices (dynamic and static); filters, systems and instruments to monitor and remove contaminants from fuel, air, oil, water and other liquids and gases; fluid connectors that control, transmit and contain fluid; hydraulic components and systems for builders and users of industrial and mobile machinery and equipment; and high-quality flow control solutions.Aerospace Systems (17.6%): This segment supervises the designing and manufacturing of products and also provides aftermarket support for a broad range of aerospace products including commercial, business jet, military and general aviation aircraft and missile.Products offered include control actuation systems &amp; components, fluid metering, delivery &amp; atomization devices, fuel systems &amp; components, pneumatic control components, hydraulic systems &amp; components and lubrication components among others.The segment's products and services are offered to OEM and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) customers throughout the world.

So, if you had invested in Parker-Hannifin ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in December 2012 would be worth $3,638.95, or a 263.90% gain, as of December 1, 2022, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 188.11% and gold's return of -0.75% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for PH.Strong demand across end markets and higher orders bodes well for Parker-Hannifin. Pricing actions and benefits from the Win strategy support the company’s margin performance. The Meggitt acquisition is contributing significantly to Aerospace sales. The company has increased its organic growth and earnings forecast for fiscal 2023 to consider the benefits of the acquisition. The acquisition is expected to add 45 cents per share to Parker-Hannifin’s adjusted earnings in fiscal 2023. The company’s measures to reward shareholders are encouraging. Due to these tailwinds, shares of the company have outperformed its industry in the past six months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Parker-Hannifin’s fiscal 2023 earnings has been revised upward in the past 60 days. However, the rising cost of sales is concerning for the company.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 5.43%, and there have been 7 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2022 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL) share price is up 37% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Over the last twelve months the stock price has risen a very respectable 9.4%.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Xcel Energy In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Xcel Energy managed to grow its earnings per share at 5.5% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 7% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Xcel Energy's TSR for the last 5 years was 58%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Xcel Energy shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 12% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 10%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Xcel Energy better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Xcel Energy   (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) you should know about.We will like Xcel Energy better if we see some big insider buys.

To skip the details about global imports and exports, go directly to the 5 Biggest Import-Export Companies in the World.International trade is one of the driving factors of the global economy. In the recent year, global trade hit a snag in 2018 due to tensions between USA and China.

Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE)Market Cap as of November 30: $11.233 billionCelanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) is an American chemical and advanced materials company. It is the world’s largest producer of acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomer and represent’s 25% of the global production of acetic acid. The company is one of the world’s most significant exporters with 25 production plants and six research centers across 11 countries. Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) serves customers globally.In the last 23 months, Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) made two significant acquisitions. The first one was Santoprene from Exxon Mobil for $1.15 billion in 2021, acquiring Santoprene®, Dytron™, and Geolast™ as part of the deal. Later in February 2022, Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) agreed to acquire DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (NYSE:DD)’s mobility and material business for $11 billion.

The stock price declines during the Russian invasion brought a lot of good prices to the market. Out of all the possibilities we considered, we picked the stocks of Celanese (CE).Celanese is the world’s largest producer of acetic acid and its chemical derivatives, including vinyl acetate monomers and emulsions. Their applications are used in a wide range of industries, such as automotive tobacco, coatings, construction, energy, telecommunications, food, and medical. Celanese recently closed the acquisition of a large part of DuPont’s business, which will make Celanese an even bigger player in the industry while reducing the cyclicality of it business. The acquisition is quite large and should deliver significant value to shareholders that in our view is not at all presently reflected in the share price. Celanese is a business that stands more or less aside from the main interests of most investors, but it is a company with very high returns on capital, strong free cash flow, and historically very efficient resource allocation.”9.

According to Deutsche Bank, global stocks are forecasted to plummet sharply by mid-2023 as a recession threatens to hit the United States. David Folkerts-Landau, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note: ""We see major stock markets plunging 25% from levels somewhat above today's when the US recession hits, but then recovering fully by year-end 2023, assuming the recession lasts only several quarters."" In the United States, analysts forecast the S&amp;P 500 to rally to 4,500 in the first half of 2023, then a selloff of more than 25% in the third quarter, before recovering back to 4,500 by the end of the year. In an effort to control the 40-year high inflation, the Federal Reserve will continue to raise rates, albeit at a slower pace than 2022, which will eventually tip the economy towards a full blown recession in 2023. While some money managers are predicting a recession, others believe that the global economy will be hit with stagflation instead, which is a period of high inflation and high unemployment. Whatever may be the fate of the US economy next year, it is important for investors to safeguard their money and construct a safe equity portfolio, consisting of defensive names like Philip Morris International Inc.

(NYSE:PM) stock rose 4.4% last week, insiders who sold US$17m worth of stock in the previous 12 months are likely to be better off. Selling at an average price of US$111, which is higher than the current price, may have been the wisest decision for these insiders as their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Philip Morris InternationalIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive Chairman of the Board, Andre Calantzopoulos, sold US$8.3m worth of shares at a price of US$111 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$102. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In the last year Philip Morris International insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Philip Morris International insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$251m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Philip Morris International Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Philip Morris International insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

Combined with thoughtful acquisitions, 10-year revenue growth has averaged +6.6%, which has translated to EPS growth of over +11% per year. The company has accomplished all this with ½ of the overall volatility of the stock market. The company reported Q4 2020 earnings on January 29th, beating both top (revenue +14% YoY) and bottom line measures (EPS $0.59 vs $0.51 expected). We view the shares as reasonably valued at 26x forward earnings given the high level of predictability of the company’s earnings and low financial leverage. Shares are down 0.5% year-to-date.”7.

Shares have added about 12.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Western Union due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Western Union's Q3 Earnings Meet EstimatesWestern Union reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 42 cents, matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line plunged 33.3% year over year due to lower operating profit.Total revenues fell 15% year over year on a reported basis or 6% on a constant currency basis to $1,089.6 million. Also, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a whisker.The quarterly results were hurt by lower revenues and transactions in the Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) segment, which usually contributes a massive chunk to WU’s overall revenues.The segment was affected by discontinuation of operations across Russia and Belarus. Nevertheless, the downside was partly offset by a lower expense level and double-digit growth in U.S. outbound new digital customer acquisition.Adjusted operating margin of 20.6% deteriorated 460 basis points year over year due to lower revenues, and technology and market-linked investments.Western Union’s total expenses came in at $857.8 million, down 11% year over year. Lower cost of services, and selling, general and administrative expenses contributed to this decline in overall expenses in the third quarter.C2C SegmentThe C2C segment reported revenues of $982.4 million, which tumbled 11% year over year on a reported basis or 8% on a constant currency basis in the quarter under review. The segment’s revenue, however, fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,001 million.Transactions within the C2C segment fell 12% year over year due to lower transactions across Europe and CIS, North America, East Asia and Oceania (APAC) and the Middle East, Africa and South Asia (MEASA).Story continuesDigital money transfer revenues dropped 12% year over year on a reported basis or 9% on a constant currency basis in the third quarter. Digital money transfer transactions fell 20% year over year.Branded Digital revenues decreased 8% on a reported basis or 5% on a constant currency basis.Balance Sheet (as of Sep 30, 2022)Western Union exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,176.1 million, slipping 2.7% from the 2021-end level. Total assets of $8,901.3 million inched up 0.9% from the figure at 2021 end.Borrowings dropped 13.2% from the figure at the 2021 end to $2,611 million.Total stockholders' equity of $528.3 million surged 48.6% from the level as of Dec 31, 2021.During the first nine months ended Sep 30, 2022, net cash provided by operating activities decreased 23.8% from the prior-year comparable period’s level to $522.4 million.Capital DeploymentWestern Union rewarded its shareholders with $97 million through $91 million of dividends and share buybacks worth $6 million during the third quarter.2022 GuidanceWestern Union reiterated its full-year outlook.Adjusted revenues (constant currency, excluding the impact of Argentina inflation and proforma for the planned sale of Business Solutions) are still expected to witness a mid-single-digit decline.Adjusted EPS is still anticipated within $1.75-$1.85 for 2022. The midpoint of the guidance indicates a 17.8% decline from the 2021 reported figure.Operating profit margin is expected between 20% and 21%. The metric stood at 22.5% in 2021.Update on Business Solutions Sell-OffLast year, Western Union had inked a deal with Goldfinch Partners LLC and The Baupost Group LLC to divest its Business Solutions unit in two stages. The first closing took place on Mar 1, 2022.However, in the third quarter, with the mutual consent of all the parties to the divestiture agreement, a decision was taken to divest Business Solutions in three stages. The second closing related to the sale of the United Kingdom operations is expected in December 2022. In the third stage, the European Union operations included within the Business Solutions unit, is expected to be divested in the first quarter of 2023. Needless to say, both closings are required to fulfill the pending regulatory approvals.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.VGM ScoresAt this time, Western Union has a subpar Growth Score of D, a grade with the same score on the momentum front.

While relative performance has been challenged by binary decisions around a handful of mega cap technology stocks, we’re entering a lower-growth period in which we’ve historically delivered strong relative results from our balanced approach.”11.

However, the ESG questionnaires were filled after securities were already selected for inclusion in many instances.With investors increasingly preferring ESG investments, the branding and marketing of such funds and strategies have increased. Sanjay Wadhwa, deputy director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement and head of its Climate and ESG Task Force stated that in such cases investment advisors “must establish reasonable policies and procedures governing how the ESG factors will be evaluated as part of the investment process, and then follow those policies and procedures, to avoid providing investors with information about these products that differs from their practices.”Goldman faces many investigations and lawsuits from investors and regulators.

Reckitt Benckiser, maker of the brand Enfamil, saying that formula shortage will likely persist until this spring. That's according to a report from Reuters. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani joins us now with the details. And Anj, what can you tell us as to why this is still the case?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Well, Seana, unfortunately, even the-- despite the fact that the US government put in a lot of effort, including enacting the Defense Production Act, as well as relaxing regulations, the FDA allowing more foreign export to come in of companies that hadn't previously been in the market, all of that still leading to a shortage.Reckitt, as you know, maker of the Mead Johnson brand and now accounting for 50% of the baby formula market, is leading this and still has not been able to meet, despite increased production, a full shelf. And that's sort of where they're looking at, is whether or not the shelves are fully stocked and not emptying out as frequently as they were before. As you saw on your screen, other makers like Gerber, as well as Prurigo, which is another one that does sort of white label brands for Walmart and Amazon.Meanwhile, Abbott, the reason why this shortage is still in effect, was previously 40%. And the market leader has lost ground to Reckitt since a recall last year, or earlier this year, rather, of its baby formula. It was a specialized formula that was contaminated in Michigan plants and had to be recalled. That has really been an ongoing problem. And despite the fact that that plant has restarted since, it still hasn't led to the level of production and level of supply that the country needs. And so despite the fact that the FDA continues to allow imports from abroad, it still isn't meeting demand.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and I've been buying a lot of baby formula over the last several months, and it's still very, very hard to find, sometimes.

Shares have added about 10.2% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is American International Group due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.AIG Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates on General Insurance StrengthAmerican International Group reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted operating earnings of 66 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.9%. The bottom line of AIG slumped 32% year over year in the third quarter.Operating revenues of $11.3 billion declined from $11.7 billion a year ago and lagged the consensus estimate of $11.5 billion and our estimate of $11.6 billion.The better-than-expected earnings were supported by the solid performance in the General Insurance despite the negative impacts of Hurricane Ian, and increased Life and Retirement premiums. However, the positives were partially offset by reduced alternative investment income and higher expenses.Quarterly Operational UpdateTotal net investment income (NII) tumbled 28.2% year over year to $2,668 million due to a decline in alternative investment returns, and reduced call and tender income. Nevertheless, the downside was partly offset by higher interest rates. The figure was lower than our estimate of $3,400 million.AIG’s total benefits, losses and expenses of $10,755 million increased 0.9% year over year primarily due to higher policyholder benefits and losses incurred. The figure was higher than our estimate of $10,106.1 million.Adjusted return on common equity deteriorated 280 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.7% in the third quarter.Segmental PerformancesGeneral InsuranceThe segment reported net premiums written of $6,403 million, which declined 3% year over year but grew 3% on a constant-dollar basis. The metric was lower than our estimate of $6,990 million. A decline in production in Warranty within North America Personal Insurance and International Personal Insurance affected the results. However, the downside was partly offset by improvements on the back of continuous rate hikes, strong renewal retentions and solid new business production.Story continuesUnderwriting income of $168 million soared from $20 million in the third quarter. The same comprised catastrophe losses (CATs) of $600 million, which included around $450 million for Hurricane Ian, comparing favorably with CATs of $628 million in the prior-year quarter.The segment’s combined ratio improved 240 bps year over year to 97.3% in the quarter under review. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94.2%.Life and RetirementAIG closed the IPO of Corebridge Financial in September, the holding company of its Life and Retirement unit. Following the move, AIG has 77.7% of Corebridge and is expected to combine CRBG’s results of operations in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.Premiums of the segment increased 34.9% year over year to $1,404 million in the third quarter. The figure was higher than our estimate of $1,080.3 million.Meanwhile, premiums and deposits of $8,894 million jumped from $7,234 million a year ago. Adjusted revenues of the segment amounted to $4,336 million, down from $4,444 million due to lower alternative investments. The figure was lower than our estimate of $4,352.9 million.The segment’s adjusted pre-tax income of $589 million fell from $877 million in the third quarter, primarily due to lower NII. The metric was significantly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $997.4 million.Financial Position (as of Sep 30, 2022)American International exited the third quarter with a cash balance of $2,294 million, which increased from $2,198 million at 2021-end. Total assets of $522.9 billion decreased from $596.1 billion at 2021-end.Short- and long-term debt of $24.5 billion rose from $23.7 billion at the prior-year end.Total equity slumped to $41 billion from $68.9 billion at the prior-year end. Total debt to capital was at 35.7% at the third-quarter end.Adjusted book value per share was $73.28, up from $61.80 a year ago.Share Repurchase &amp; Dividend UpdateAmerican International rewarded $1.5 billion to shareholders, which included $1.3 billion of share buybacks and dividends worth $247 million.Concurrent with announcing the third-quarter results, the board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 32 cents per common share. The dividend will be paid out on Dec 29, 2022, to shareholders of record as of Dec 15.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -13.55% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, American International Group has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, American International Group has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerAmerican International Group belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry. Another stock from the same industry, The Hartford (HIG), has gained 5.5% over the past month.

This is according to a report from ""The Wall Street Journal."" Now, the program is giving some lucky subscribers the chance to give feedback on the streaming giant's content. Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal has more on this story. Allie, an interesting move here from Netflix.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Very interesting. So the preview club, this was started more than a year ago. And 2,000 or so subscribers would give feedback on content. And now, according to this ""Wall Street Journal"" report, they want to expand that to tens of thousands of subscribers by early next year.And interesting that the ""Journal"" noted ""Don't Look Up."" I don't know if you guys saw that movie. But they said that they--SEANA SMITH: I did, actually.ALEXANDRA CANAL: --presented this movie to subscribers. And the initial feedback was that it was too serious. So they upped the comedic tone. And if you've seen it, you know it's very funny. So I wonder what it was like before this.DAVE BRIGGS: They changed the tone of a film?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes, yes. This is how--SEANA SMITH: It is a very funny film. So I actually appreciate that feedback because I liked it.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I appreciated it too. And I think this just speaks to the larger narrative going on in streaming. Netflix has been notorious when it comes to spending money. And now they need to make sure that they're getting the most bang for their buck ultimately. So interesting development, we'll see. We were just talking about how you get into the preview club.SEANA SMITH: That's what I want to know. I want to know what you need to do to get into it. I am the-- I am definitely not going to get into this preview club.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Wait.SEANA SMITH: If I was in the preview club, Netflix would have to wait like three years in order for me to review one series. But I think it would be interesting to know how they do.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And apparently, they provide employees with screeners. And they judge how quickly employees binge certain things to determine what will have-- be a hit and what they potentially need to change.DAVE BRIGGS: I'm picking this one over this one.SEANA SMITH: Oh, any day, anyone over me.DAVE BRIGGS: You haven't seen a movie in the theater since pre-COVID.SEANA SMITH: Although I did see ""Don't Look Up"" from Netflix.ALEXANDRA CANAL: She saw ""Don't Look Up.""DAVE BRIGGS: It's literally the only movie she's seen in five years.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I didn't love it, but it was funny.DAVE BRIGGS: Other than ""Paw Patrol--""SEANA SMITH: On repeat, yeah, and ""Paw Patrol.""ALEXANDRA CANAL: Any children-- we'll put you on the children graph.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, I'm well-versed in that.DAVE BRIGGS: Netflix also releasing a clip of the Harry and Meghan Markle docuseries. I'm trying to pretend I'm excited for that. What are the expectations though, for these two?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Oh, gosh, I think the expectations are high, just considering how well ""The Crown"" does, this fascination with the royal family, in particular the fascination with Harry and Meghan. These two, of course, did sign a multiyear deal with Netflix in September, 2020. It was reported to be valued at around $100 million.And this is on top of all of their other deals. They have memoirs, books, a Spotify deal. So they're clearly establishing a business and a brand outside of the royal family. And as we were just talking about with Netflix, content is king. And now maybe content can also be a prince for the company.DAVE BRIGGS: Well done.SEANA SMITH: There we go.DAVE BRIGGS: Well done.SEANA SMITH: That was good job there, Allie.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I've been dying to say it on this show. I'm like 50/50 chance it'll land.SEANA SMITH: Are you going to watch it?ALEXANDRA CANAL: I-- the trailer is very moody.SEANA SMITH: It is.ALEXANDRA CANAL: It's very mysterious. You just saw, it was shot in black and white. I am pretty curious about it. But we've been inundated with a lot of Harry and Meghan these days.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. I think I'll give this one a shot.ALEXANDRA CANAL: But I think it's-- and it's an easy one to put on in the background and watch.SEANA SMITH: You don't look like you're convinced.ALEXANDRA CANAL: He's not excited.DAVE BRIGGS: No chance.SEANA SMITH: You have a lot of time to kill on the train. Never say never. All right, Allie Canal, thanks so much for that.]"

131,59a49cb9-3ea2-33c3-a25c-cc46d15b2656,PSX,2022-12-02,Phillips 66 (PSX) Shows Fast-paced Momentum But Is Still a Bargain Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/phillips-66-psx-shows-fast-135001359.html,1669902601,STORY,['PSX'],"[Momentum investors typically don't time the market or ""buy low and sell high."" In other words, they avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.Phillips 66 (PSX) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 5% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this oil refiner well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. PSX meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 25.6% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for PSX is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.43. This indicates that the stock moves 43% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that PSX has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped PSX earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

132,4dfd85df-1b31-3a0c-8257-b615f57d9ecd,PSX,2022-12-02,CVX to Commence Venezuelan Oil Output Amid Easing Sanctions,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cvx-commence-venezuelan-oil-output-131701890.html,1669900621,STORY,"['CVX', 'VLO', 'PSX', 'XOM']","[Chevron CVX has been granted a license to recommence oil production in Venezuela by the Biden administration after U.S. sanctions halted all drilling activities in the South American nation almost three years ago. The respite was followed by the resumption of talks by Venezuela’s political groups with a deal to work together on a humanitarian spending plan.The oil major received a six-month license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, OFAC. The new policy authorizes the company to produce crude oil and petroleum products in its projects in Venezuela.While no new drilling is approved, CVX will be able to overhaul and do the maintenance of oil fields. The decision allows the San Ramon, CA-based company to revive existing oil projects in Venezuela and bring new oil supplies to refiners in the United States.However, the arrangement limits cash payments to Venezuela, which could reduce the amount of oil available to Chevron. Per the new policy, profits from the sale of energy will be directed to paying down the debt owed to CVX rather than providing profits to the Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA.U.S. sanctions against Venezuela were introduced in 2019 by the Trump administration. In 2020, before the United States ordered a complete halt of drilling operations, Chevron’s share of Venezuelan crude oil output was 15,000 barrels a day.The current U.S. dispensation’s decision to ease some of those sanctions came after the resumption of talks over the weekend between the government of Nicolas Maduro and the Venezuelan opposition. The talks led to the signing of a U.S.-brokered accord between the government and the opposition to resolve the country’s political turmoil.Chevron, the American oil major, is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world with operations spanning worldwide. The only energy component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, CVX is fully integrated as it participates in every aspect related to energy, from oil production to refining and marketing.Story continuesChevron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks from the energy space that warrant a look include Exxon Mobil XOM, Phillips 66 PSX and Valero VLO, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Exxon Mobil’s 2022 earnings is pegged at $13.92 per share, indicating an increase of about 158.7% from the year-ago earnings of $5.38.The consensus estimate for XOM’s 2022 earnings has been revised upward by about 9.4% over the past 60 days from $12.72 per share to $13.92 per share.Estimates for Phillips’ 2022 earnings stand at $20.39 per share, up about 257.7% from the year-ago earnings of $5.70.PSX beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all the trailing four quarters, the average being around 28%.Valero beat estimates for earnings in all the trailing four quarters, the average being around 25.1%.The consensus mark for VLO’s 2022 earnings stands at $28.37 per share, which implies an increase of about 909.6% from the year-ago earnings of $2.81.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Dollar General has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while TJX has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that DG is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.DG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 22.08, while TJX has a forward P/E of 25.67. We also note that DG has a PEG ratio of 1.99. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. TJX currently has a PEG ratio of 2.45.Another notable valuation metric for DG is its P/B ratio of 9.32. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, TJX has a P/B of 16.33.These metrics, and several others, help DG earn a Value grade of B, while TJX has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesDG sticks out from TJX in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that DG is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This first-in-human study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of AMG 133 in people with obesity and without diabetes (NCT04478708). These data will be presented as part of an oral presentation on Saturday, Dec. 3 at the 20th World Congress of Insulin Resistance, Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease (WCIRDC) Hybrid Conference.""AMG 133 was designed based on preclinical and human genetic data that strongly suggest GIPR inhibition as a strategy for weight loss, especially in combination with GLP-1 agonism,"" said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""We are encouraged by these Phase 1 results with once-monthly dosing of AMG 133, specifically, the degree, rate and durability of the weight loss. We look forward to initiating the Phase 2 study early next year.""Participants were randomized (3:1) to receive subcutaneous AMG 133 or placebo either as a single ascending dose (SAD) or multiple ascending doses (MAD). The MAD cohorts showed mean percent changes in body weight (BW), ranging from -7.2% at the lowest dose (140mg Q4W), to -14.5% at the highest dose (420mg Q4W) by day 85. A substantial degree of weight loss was maintained beyond the treatment period, which will be shared as part of the oral presentation. Most treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild and transient. The majority of the TEAEs were GI-related with the most common being nausea and vomiting, most events resolved within 48 hours.  Based on these data, a Phase 2 trial will be initiated early next year to further study the attributes of this molecule.Story continuesAmgen will host a webcast call for the investment community in conjunction with WCIRDC at 8:00 a.m. ET on Monday, Dec. 5, 2022. For more information visit: https://investors.amgen.com/.About ObesityObesity is a serious, chronic disease that affects a significant proportion of the world population. In the US alone, 74% of adults are either obese or overweight1, including 42% who are obese2. The worldwide prevalence of obesity has tripled over the past 40 years and continues to rise in nearly every demographic.3 Obesity is linked to a marked reduction in quality of life and an array of serious medical complications4, placing a significant burden on healthcare systems globally.5 Despite the scale of the disease, the formal recognition of obesity as a chronic disease by the American Medical Association (2013) and the European Health Commission (2021), and medical guidelines recommending pharmacologic treatment in appropriate individuals, only 1-3% of patients globally are prescribed medication.6,7About AMG 133AMG 133 is a bispecific glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) antagonist and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist molecule. AMG 133 mimics the agonist effects of GLP-1 and antagonizes the effects of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Amgen moved into this Phase 1 study based on human genetic insights and preclinical evidence that suggested synergistic effects with GIP receptor blockade and GLP-1 receptor agonism on weight loss and improvement in other metabolic parameters.About the Phase 1 Study and Future DevelopmentThe randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single and multiple ascending dose study of AMG 133 enrolled people with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of ≥30.0 kg/m2 and ≤40.0 kg/m2 without other medical conditions. Participants were randomized (3:1) to receive subcutaneous AMG 133 or placebo either as a single ascending dose (SAD) or multiple ascending doses (MAD). Participants were assigned to six SAD cohorts (n=49; mean age 48 years, BMI 33.4 kg/m2, and BW 99.5 kg) and three MAD cohorts (n=26; mean age 46 years, BMI 33.5 kg/m2, and BW 96.9 kg). Pharmacokinetics and body weight (BW) were measured and safety and tolerability were monitored. Most treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild and transient.8 The majority of the TEAEs were GI-related with the most common being nausea and vomiting, most events resolved within 48 hours.Amgen plans to initiate Phase 2 testing with a dose-ranging study in early 2023, where long-term effects in an expanded number of patients will be further characterized.About Amgen Amgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd., Kyowa-Kirin Co., Ltd., or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19), the performance of Otezla® (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), the Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. acquisition, the Teneobio, Inc. acquisition, or the recently announced proposed acquisition of ChemoCentryx, Inc., or the ChemoCentryx, Inc. acquisition, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.CONTACT: Amgen, Thousand Oaks Jessica Akopyan, 805-440-5721 (media) Arvind Sood, 805-447-1060 (investors)1 Fryar, C.D., Carroll., M.D., Afful, J.

137,9686661e-46ff-30aa-bd72-e4d9b1c9bdc9,NEM,2022-12-02,Why Is Newmont (NEM) Up 20.1% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-newmont-nem-20-1-163104232.html,1669912264,STORY,"['NEM', 'TECK']","[It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Newmont Corporation (NEM). Shares have added about 20.1% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Newmont due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Newmont Misses on Q3 Earnings and Revenue EstimatesNewmont reported net income from continuing operations of $218 million or 28 cents per share in third-quarter 2022, compared with a loss of $8 million or a penny per share in the year-ago quarter.Barring one-time items, adjusted earnings were 27 cents per share that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents.Newmont reported revenues of $2,634 million, down around 9% year over year.  The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,790 million. Sales fell due to reduced average realized metal prices (barring zinc) and lower sales volumes.Operational HighlightsNewmont's attributable gold production in the third quarter increased roughly 3% year over year to 1.49 million ounces. Production was driven by increased ore grade milled at Ahafo, Akyem and Boddington mines.Average realized prices of gold fell around 5% year over year to $1,691 per ounce.The company’s CAS for gold were $968 per ounce, up around 17% year over year. The increase was mainly driven by lower gold sales volumes and increased direct operating costs due to higher labor costs and increased commodity input costs, including higher fuel and energy costs.AISC for gold were up around 13% year over year to $1,271 per ounce, mainly due to higher CAS per gold ounce.Financial PositionThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $3,058 million, down 34% year over year. At the end of the quarter, the company had long-term debt of $5,569 million, up around 12% year over year.Net cash from continuing operations amounted to $466 million for the reported quarter.Story continuesOutlookFor 2022, Newmont continues to expect attributable gold production of 6 million ounces. The company also expects gold CAS to be $900 per ounce and AISC to be $1,150 per ounce.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -9.22% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Newmont has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the lowest quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of this revision indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Newmont has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerNewmont is part of the Zacks Mining - Miscellaneous industry. Over the past month, Teck Resources Ltd (TECK), a stock from the same industry, has gained 21.9%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended September 2022 more than a month ago.Teck Resources Ltd reported revenues of $3.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.5%. EPS of $1.33 for the same period compares with $1.49 a year ago.For the current quarter, Teck Resources Ltd is expected to post earnings of $0.94 per share, indicating a change of -53.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.8% over the last 30 days.The overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Teck Resources Ltd. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of A.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Currencies in Latin America rose 1.2%, outpacing the broader emerging market currencies index , which added 0.8%. The U.S. dollar index tumbled 1% after comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that U.S. rate hikes could be scaled back ""as soon as December"" and as an indicator tracked by the Fed showed inflation moderating. South Africa's rand dropped 2.3% against the dollar, weighing on the EM index. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa's future hung in the balance as his office said he was exploring options after a report found evidence he may have committed misconduct over a stash of cash stolen from his game farm. ""From a markets perspective, we believe that an early departure of President Ramaphosa will be perceived negatively by financial markets, given uncertainties about policy continuity that such an event would naturally bring,"" Barclays Bank strategists wrote in a note. ""Hence, against the uncertain political background over the next few weeks, we believe that markets are likely to remain volatile in the near term."" In Latin America, the Brazilian real dipped 0.2%, after rising for three straight sessions. Brazil's economic growth slowed more than expected in the third quarter as higher interest rates affected household spending, underscoring challenges facing President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva next year. The real has underperformed its regional peers in November, ending last month nearly flat compared to the 1% rise in the broader Latam index on fiscal policy concerns. Brazil's central bank intervened in the foreign exchange market on Thursday, selling $2 billion in the spot market with a repurchase agreement, it said in a statement on its website. Lula has also pushed back his first Cabinet announcements to next week, two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, dragging out key appointments that have kept financial markets on edge. Mexico's peso rose 0.6%. Central bank data showed remittances to Mexico reached a record-high of $5.360 billion in October. A survey showed Mexico's factory activity grew for a third straight month in November amid sales improvement, job creation. Meanwhile, a Reuters poll showed Colombia's inflation could have peaked in November. The peso currency was up 1.3%. Chile's peso gained 1.3%. Traders expect Chilean interest rate to remain at 11.25% in December even as recession looms in the top copper producer, with data showing a drop in the IMACEC economic activity index in October from the same month last year. Peru's Sol inched 0.1% up against the dollar after data showed consumer prices rose more than expected last month.

Precious metals, which were pressured by a sharp rise in rates this year, were the main beneficiaries of this rally.Spot gold fell 0.1% to $1,800.96 an ounce, but remained near three-month highs, while gold futures hovered near $1,814.70 an ounce- their strongest level in five months.Both instruments were set to add about 3% this week.Focus now turns to U.S. nonfarm payrolls data due later in the day, which is expected to show that the jobs market cooled slightly in November. But the sector has remained robust this year, with the Federal Reserve stating that it will seek more moderation in the space as it tightens policy.Any unexpected signs of strength in the jobs market gives the Fed enough impetus to keep raising interest rates- a scenario which is negative for markets.While Fed Chair Jerome Powell flagged slower interest rates in the coming months, he also warned that U.S. interest rates will likely peak at higher-than-expected levels due to stubborn inflation. This stifled some enthusiasm in risk-driven markets.But the prospect of smaller rate hikes offered much relief to markets battered by rising rates this year. Platinum and silver futures vastly outperformed gold this week, rising more than 6% each.Among industrial metals, copper prices fell slightly on Friday, but were also headed for a positive week on the back of growing hopes that major importer China will ease its anti-COVID policies.Copper futures fell 0.2% to $3.7865 a pound, but were set to end the week over 4% higher.Story continuesTwo major Chinese cities relaxed COVID-related curbs after an unprecedented wave of anti-government protests rocked the country this week. Demonstrations were directed against Beijing’s zero-COVID policy, which saw China maintain strict curbs on movement and activity over the past three years in order to contain COVID-19 cases.But the easing measures this week drove up expectations for a wider scaling back of anti-COVID measures, which could help spur an economic recovery.PMI data released earlier this week showed that economic conditions in China have deteriorated even further due to the zero-COVID policy.Related ArticlesGold steadies above $1,800 ahead of U.S. payrolls dataOil treads water amid speculation over OPEC cut, weekly gains on tapMexico, U.S. trade officials discuss energy, corn exports, environment]"

This gain is widely attributed to the growth in corporate profits during these decades.Many reports have revealed the strong performance of dividend equities during inflationary periods, making investors turn toward them. Guinness Atkinson Funds reported that the S&amp;P 500 surpassed the rate of inflation by over three times from December 1940 to April 2015.

The company’s Dental segment reflected improvements while the Animal Health segment’s sales continued to decline in the quarter under review. Sales of both segments were hurt by unfavorable currency movement. A prudent cost-savings approach and solid sales execution worked in favor of the company, expanding gross margin. Sustained momentum in the Animal Health business bodes well.A broad spectrum of products cushions the company against economic downturns in the MedTech space.

Zurbay, Patterson Companies, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be speaking with you for the first time as Patterson's CEO. I'm honored to be leading the outstanding Patterson team whose commitment to our strategy, customer vision and values has enabled a track record of strong financial performance. I'm pleased with our performance during our fiscal '23 second quarter. As we navigated ongoing macroeconomic challenges during the quarter, we remain focused on driving sales execution and profitability. Overall, for the quarter, we achieved $1.6 billion in consolidated revenue, representing year-over-year internal sales growth of nearly 1%. Year-over-year operating margin expansion in both our Dental and Animal Health segments and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.63, an increase of 9% year-over-year. Given our results through the first half and our forecast for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our full year EPS guidance range and remain committed to delivering internal sales growth and operating margin expansion for fiscal '23. Now before walking through the details of our quarter, I want to take this opportunity to share my perspective on the key elements of Patterson's success, our culture, strategy and our people. Patterson's purpose, vision and values is foundational to our success. And like our employees across Patterson, I am committed to ensuring that they are followed. We are passionate and people first, doing the right thing and being good to each other are my own beliefs that I will use to continue to guide Patterson moving forward. In my previous role at Patterson Company's CFO, I work closely with the rest of our executive leadership team to develop the strategy that has enabled us to accelerate business performance and drive long-term value for our customers as well as our shareholders. Looking ahead, we will continue to execute that strategy, which is focused on 3 foundational pillars; first, continuously deepening the value proposition we offer our customers in both the Dental and Animal Health segments; Patterson is so much more than a distributor. We are an indispensable partner to our customers and play a critical role in their success. We believe that expanding our capabilities for customers will continue to drive sales growth strengthen these relationships. Second, enhancing our margin performance to fully capture the value we create in the market with a focus on operational excellence improved mix and thoughtful coordination with our strategic manufacturing partners. And third, managing the organization with a keen focus on cost discipline. As you would imagine, developing a rigorous process for cost discipline and return on our investments has been a key focus for me throughout my tenure with Patterson and will continue to be in my new role. Patterson's balanced capital allocation approach supports our strategy with 3 priorities. First is investing with discipline in the core areas of our business, including our people and the support organizations to drive ongoing improvements in our field sales and service execution. These functions enable Patterson to deliver the high level of service that our customers reward us for as they navigate markets in good times and more challenging ones. Prioritizing investment ensures we don't take our foot off the gas. Second, our dividend remains an effective means of returning cash to our shareholders. As a reminder, in fiscal '22, we returned approximately $100 million to shareholders through our dividend. Third, we regularly evaluate opportunities to leverage our strong balance sheet and make strategic investments. As we've said before, we will be thoughtful and selective on opportunities that will further enhance our strategies, meet our financial criteria and drive improved returns for our shareholders. For example, in the second quarter, Patterson announced acquisitions of Dairy Tech and RSVP and ACT. These are examples of our business units identifying areas where they want to focus and using M&amp;A to help them execute. Our strong financial position and balance sheet provide us with flexibility to continue to pursue these opportunities to accelerate future growth and profitability. Taken together, we have a great foundation to build from. Through the continued execution of our proven strategy, I am confident in our future. Ultimately, is there people who execute on that strategy, our people are a key differentiator for Patterson, and I am so proud of the way our team supports each other and the dedication they have to serving our customers. Across our organization, we are fortunate to have a talented and driven team that is resilient and knows the power of working together to support each other. Over the past several years, Patterson has cultivated a deep bench of highly capable executive leaders. We've all been instrumental in developing and implementing Patterson's strategy. We expect continued benefit from the expertise, teamwork and continuity of our existing leadership team. I'm also pleased to keep working closely with Kevin Barry in his new capacity. As our former Vice President of Finance and Corporate Controller, Kevin has been an integral member of the executive leadership team and the finance organization. Internal promotions and succession demonstrate the depth of Patterson's talent, and Kevin is certainly a part of that. I have complete confidence in his ability to take on this important responsibility. You'll have an opportunity to hear from Kevin in his remarks to walk through the details of our second quarter performance shortly. I believe our executive leadership team and strategy will enable us to maintain our strong performance. Patterson has all the elements to create value for our customers and shareholders alike, a strong position in two attractive and healthy end markets, entrenched relationships with customers that view Patterson as an indispensable partner, a clear and focused strategy to drive profitable growth and the financial foundation to ensure we can invest to position this company for long-term success. With that overview, I'll turn to a discussion of our segment's financial performance, starting with Dental. Our Dental segment grew internal sales nearly 2% Year-over-year primarily driven by strong performance in our equipment and value-added service categories. Outstanding execution by our teams enabled our Dental segment to reach double-digit operating margins and year-over-year operating margin expansion as we continue to deliver a strong mix favoring the higher-margin areas of our business. We remain focused on advancing and strengthening key margin enhancement initiatives by mitigating the impact of an inflationary environment strengthening our mutually beneficial vendor relationships and focusing on operational efficiencies, including mix management and logistics productivity. For consumables, our internal sales in the first quarter declined mid-single digits year-over-year, primarily due to the persistent deflationary impact of certain infection control products. We continue to provide a broad range of infection control products because they are foundational to the practice of dentistry. And while the demand for these offerings is lower than the peak levels of the pandemic, it remains strong in comparison to pre-COVID levels as dentists have adapted to meet a higher standard of care. As we have previously discussed, improvements in the supply chain for infection control products have resulted in considerable pricing declines from the pandemic highs for certain products in this category. We expect this deflationary pressure in the infection control category to persist at least through the remainder of the fiscal year. Notably, Patterson achieved year-over-year internal sales growth in our non-infection control portfolio in the fiscal second quarter. We continue to leverage our broad consumables offering, including private label products to deepen our relationships with customers across the spectrum from independent private practices to regional and national DSOs. We expect the overall consumables market to normalize a low single-digit percentage growth rate over the long term. Dental financial performance in the equipment category reflects what makes Patterson. Our customers recognize Patterson's expertise in supporting the full purchase training and maintenance cycle of the latest technology and equipment. They feel confident investing in their practices with Patterson as their partner, knowing they have access to hands-on support from the Patterson Technology Center and the deep knowledge and service our local branch teams provide. Internal sales in dental equipment in the second quarter were up double digits year-over-year, benefiting from improved demand for our digital equipment portfolio and continued momentum in the core equipment category. As we previously discussed, equipment sales can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but Patterson has delivered year-over-year equipment sales growth averaging nearly 14% for the last 8 quarters. We continue to see that dentists are making equipment investments to keep their practices running well and maintaining their planned upgrade or replacement schedules. During the second quarter, our value-added services category delivered solid high single-digit growth, driven by our field technical service offering. We're proud that our customers turn to and trust Patterson to ensure their equipment is delivering for their practice. This category also benefited from growth in the sales of our practice management software products, which our customers see as the foundation of their practice operations. The Dental business is supported by resilient long-term trends, including an aging population, practice modernization and a growing appreciation for oral health as a key link to overall health. And we are confident in our ability to continue to effectively manage through the current macroeconomic environment to achieve our goals in fiscal '23 and beyond. Let's now turn to the Animal Health segment. During the second quarter of our fiscal '23, we leverage the depth of our offering and breadth of our channel presence to deliver solid performance in the face of more challenging external market conditions. Patterson has an omnichannel presence that spans a wide range of animal species and offers a comprehensive solution for diverse customers, ranging from large producer operations with on-site veterinarians to independent VET clinics the individual shopping at their local veterinary supply retailer. Our Animal Health segment achieved internal sales growth of nearly 1% year-over-year, driven by mid-single-digit growth in companion animal and a low single-digit decline in production animal. Despite some softness on the top line, which we attribute primarily to external factors, including staffing shortages and veterinary clinics, weather conditions impacting producers and the impact of a widely used product in the production animal market that has recently gone off patent. Patterson was still able to expand its operating margins in the Animal Health segment. Our success expanding margins was the result of our team's laser focus on mix, including the growth of our accretive private label and e-services offerings and continuing to enhance our relationships with strategic manufacturing partners who reward us for our performance. In our companion business, I'm particularly proud of our growth this quarter when you put our performance in context; first, the broader market growth has continued to moderate in line with our expectations; second, our results are compared to the extraordinary 21% sales growth Patterson achieved in the prior year period. We attribute the sustained outperformance of the market to our ability to serve more and more veterinary practices as they recognize the value we offer in a dynamic market environment as well as the deep relationships Patterson has with our preferred manufacturing partners and the growth of our private label portfolio. We're continuing to invest in the companion animal business in ways that deepen our value proposition and address critical customer needs. Last month, we announced an agreement to acquire RSVP and ACT, which stands for relief services for veterinary practitioners and animal care technologies, respectively. These are entities that provide innovative solutions to veterinary practices through data extraction and conversion, staffing and video-based training services. We believe this proposed acquisition will expand our companion animal capabilities in 3 key areas. First, ACT provides an in-house platform for data extraction and conversion capabilities which will enhance our software offerings and provide better insights, both for our business and our vet customers. Second, as RSVP is a staffing business that connects short-staffed clinics to the resources they need. This acquisition will help resolve a critical pain point for clinics and address a growing trend in part-time vet and technician work. This is particularly compelling given the staffing challenges our customers are facing today. Finally, ACT will help Patterson expand its educational offerings including the addition of a state recognized certification program for vet assistance. As we've previously discussed, our established education platform, Patterson Veterinary University is a key component of our value proposition for companion animal customers, working alongside customers to help them establish and enhance their practices lays the foundation for a meaningful long-term partnership. Importantly, we remain confident in the long-term growth opportunity of the companion animal market. Data shows that today's pet parents are increasingly dedicated to the health and well-being of their pets and willing to invest in the care that veterinarians provide. We believe that over the long term, people who own pets will continue to invest in their care throughout the pet's lifetime and own more pets during their life. On the production animal side, our internal sales performance was challenged by the impact of pricing pressures on a broadly used product, Draxxin that now faces generic competition. While this pricing pressure was not unexpected in the market, it still had an effect on our internal sales. Excluding the deflationary impact of this product, our production animal sales were up about 1%, reflecting positive fundamental growth over the extraordinarily strong 11% growth in the prior year comparative period. We attribute our positive financial performance in the production business to Patterson's service model in a market where we believe customers generally prefer to develop a long-term relationship with a single supply partner. We provide producers with a customized combination of hands-on service and delivery options and a comprehensive product and service portfolio, which they increasingly demand. Our differentiated model has continued to enable us to win new customers and outperform the broader production animal market. and we are focused on continuing to differentiate Patterson with the addition of new critical capabilities. Our recently announced agreement to acquire Dairy Tech is expected to expand our value-added platform within our production animal business. Dairy Tech provides pasteurizing equipment and single-use bags to safely produce store and feed colostrum, a necessary nutrient for newborn calfs. This is a critical capability for our cattle producer customers and we expect our acquisition of Dairy Tech to efficiently and effectively support the health of the producers herd. We believe this acquisition will align well with several key trends we're observing in the market, including producers looking for more efficient ways to manage costs and improve profitability, a continued market emphasis on Biosecurity and herd health and strong global demand for protein and dairy. As we look ahead to the rest of fiscal '23, our Animal Health business will continue to focus on accelerating our momentum of strong sales execution, operational excellence and deepening our value proposition to better serve our customers. And now I will turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our fiscal '23 second quarter financial performance in more detail. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin Barry, Patterson Companies, Inc. - Interim CFO [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a sincere thank you to Don and our Board for the opportunity to serve in this new role. I'm also grateful for the increasing levels of responsibility and for momentary Don has given me over the past several years. and it's a privilege to be a part of a very talented and committed leadership team here at Patterson. In my prepared remarks this morning, I will cover the financial results for our second quarter of fiscal '23, which ended on October 29, 2022, and then conclude with a few comments on our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. So let's begin by covering the results for our second quarter of fiscal '23. Consolidated reported sales for Patterson Companies in our fiscal '23 second quarter were $1.63 billion, a decrease of 1.4% versus the second quarter one year ago. Internal sales, which are adjusted for the effects of currency translation, increased 0.7% compared to the same period last year. Our second quarter fiscal '23 gross margin was 20.2%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to the prior year. Our gross margin was negatively impacted by 60 basis points this quarter by the mark-to-market accounting adjustment from rising interest rates on our equipment financing portfolio. However, this negative impact was nearly offset by the gain in our corresponding hedging instrument, which is reflected in the interest and other expense line on our P&amp;L. So the net result has a minimal impact on our adjusted earnings per share. This dynamic also occurred in the second fiscal quarter of last year when the negative impact of the mark-to-market accounting calculation was 20 basis points. We're normalizing for the negative impact in both periods for an alternative view of how our business is operating. Our gross margin is up 80 basis points compared to the prior year. This increase in gross margin reflects our continued focus on pricing and cost execution and driving an improved mix with higher growth of margin-accretive product categories. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal '23 were 15.9% and unfavorable by 60 basis points compared to one year ago. In the fiscal '23 second quarter, our consolidated adjusted operating margin was 4.3%, a decline of 20 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year. Again, normalizing for the negative impact from the mark-to-market valuation of our equipment financing portfolio, our consolidated adjusted operating margins for the fiscal second quarter improved by 30 basis points compared to the prior year. We remain focused on driving continued operating margin expansion through our efforts improve gross margin with pricing and cost execution, working more closely with strategic vendors who reward us for our sales performance, driving improved mix as well as exercising expense discipline and leveraging our cost structure as we grow the top line. With these collective efforts, we intend to deliver operating margin expansion in both of our business segments and our total business for fiscal '23. Our adjusted tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal '23 was 24.2%, a decrease of 80 basis points compared to the prior year. For the full year, we expect our tax rate to be in line with prior year. Reported net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. for the second quarter of fiscal '23 was $54.1 million or $0.55 per diluted share. This compares to reported net income in the second quarter of last year of $48.3 million or $0.49 per diluted share. Adjusted net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. in the second quarter of fiscal '23 was $61.2 million or $0.63 per diluted share. This compares to $57.1 million or $0.58 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal '22. This increase was primarily due to the operating margin expansion in both of our business segments. Now let's turn to our business segments, starting with our Dental business. In the second quarter of fiscal '23, internal sales for our Dental business increased 1.6% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '22. Internal sales of dental consumables declined 4.9% compared to one year ago. As Don mentioned earlier, we continue to experience the deflationary impact of infection control products compared to the prior year. Internal sales of non-infection control products increased 1.0% in the fiscal second quarter compared to the year ago period. We expect the deflationary impact of infection control products to continue for the remainder of fiscal '23. Internal sales of dental equipment and software increased 11.1% compared to one year ago. In core equipment, our double-digit sales increase in the quarter reflects our continued efforts to manage the supply chain in this category to deliver and install the equipment our dental customers have ordered to update their practices or open new dental offices. Sales of digital equipment products were also up double digits and sales of CAD/CAM products declined mid-single digits in the quarter. Internal sales of value-added services in the second quarter of fiscal '23 increased 7.8% over the prior year period, led by the strong year-over-year performance of our technical service team and double-digit growth of our software business. Value-added services represent the entire suite of offerings we provide to our customers that help make us an indispensable partner to their practice, and these valuable offerings are also mix favorable to our P&amp;L. Adjusted operating margins in Dental were 10.2% in the fiscal second quarter and a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year period. This strong performance reflects the efforts of our dental team to improve gross margins and exercise continued expense discipline compared to the prior year period. Now let's move on to our Animal Health segment. In the second quarter of fiscal '23, Internal sales for our Animal Health business increased 0.7% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '22. Internal sales for our companion animal business increased 3.5% with the U.S. companion animal business growing by 4.5% in the quarter. Internal sales for our production animal business decreased 2.3% in the quarter compared to the prior year as the production animal market has been affected by the deflationary impact of a key branded product that recently came off patent and as Don mentioned, is now experiencing generic competition. Excluding this deflationary impact, internal sales for our production animal business increased by 0.7%, and industry data would indicate that our sales team and production continues to outperform the overall market during the fiscal second quarter. Adjusted operating margins in our Animal Health segment were 3.8% in the fiscal second quarter, an increase of 40 basis points from the prior year. Our Animal Health team continues to drive business with strategic manufacturer partners who value our ability to move market share while also exercising expense discipline. Now let me cover cash flow and balance sheet items. During the first 6 months of fiscal '23, our free cash flow declined by $88.4 million compared to the same period one year ago. This was primarily due to an increased level of working capital in the first 6 months of fiscal '23 driven by strategic inventory purchases and timing of accounts payable. Now turning to capital allocation. We continue to execute on our strategy to return cash to shareholders. In the second quarter of fiscal '23, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per diluted share, which was then paid in the third quarter of fiscal '23. On a year-to-date basis, Patterson has returned $65.7 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Also during the second fiscal quarter, as previously disclosed, we successfully amended and extended our credit facility. Even in this challenging credit environment, we achieved favorable terms while maintaining our existing lending group, demonstrating the confidence our lenders have in the ongoing strength of our business. This new facility provides the capacity and flexibility to continue investing in our core business and to execute on strategic transactions. Let me conclude with some comments on our outlook for fiscal '23. Today, we are reaffirming our fiscal '23 GAAP earnings guidance of $1.96 to $2.06 per diluted share, and our adjusted earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.35 per diluted share. We intend to deliver internal sales growth and operating margin expansion for fiscal '23 and remain committed to achieving our guidance for the fiscal year. And now I will turn the call back over to Don for some additional comments. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Donald J. Zurbay, Patterson Companies, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [5] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Kevin. A few final comments before we open it up for Q&amp;A. First, I want to again thank the entire Patterson team. I'm proud of their work in delivering another strong quarter and their dedicated focus on supporting our customers. Second, despite macroeconomic challenges, the performance of this quarter demonstrates the strength of our strategy, the discipline and execution of our talented team and continued momentum within our end markets. With this winning combination, I'm confident in Patterson's ability to succeed in any environment and look forward to what we can accomplish together. That concludes our prepared remarks. Kevin and I we glad to take questions. Operator, please open the line. ================================================================================ Questions and Answers -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [1] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Jason Bednar from Piper Sandler. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jason M. Bednar, Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - VP &amp; Senior Research Analyst [2] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Don and Kevin, 2-part question here upfront. I want to make sure we all understand the accounting mechanics of how rising rates influence the mark-to-market dynamics with respect to your equipment financing portfolio. You mentioned, I think, a 60 basis point headwind. It looks like most of this reverse in the other income line, but we there's nothing else that's layering into that line as a onetime item. And then the second part of the question is whether you're reaffirming your view for operating margin expansion for the total company in spite of the mark-to-market headwinds that hit the hit the number here in Q2. I'm sorry if I missed that, but I just wanted to confirm that. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Donald J. Zurbay, Patterson Companies, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, Jason, thanks. This is Don. You're right. We did have another quarter, and we've had this first several quarters now in a row with the rising interest rate environment. What happens is our equipment portfolio gets mark-to-market, and that happens above the operating profit line in the gross margin. And so you saw that in the -- you saw that impact. So we had a 40 basis point increase in gross margin, but without the mark-to-market adjustment, it was 80 basis points. And then that comes in and the other income expense line down below and that's almost a perfect offset to that impact. So at the bottom line, it's negative or it's neutral. So you're right on that. And then in terms of reaffirming our guidance, yes, when we talk about operating margin expansion year-over-year, I would look at it as ex the impact of the mark-to-market. We probably will do it anyway, but just going to depend on the interest rate movements for the rest of the year and how that impacts the equipment portfolio. I don't know, Kevin, if you have anything you want to add to that? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin Barry, Patterson Companies, Inc. - Interim CFO [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The one point I'd add, Jason, is that this dynamic is fully held within our corporate segment. And so when you heard us say that both business segments, Dental and Animal Health expanded their margins this quarter that doesn't have any of the impact from this mark-to-market dynamic. So both of them had very strong gross margin and operating margin performance this quarter. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jason M. Bednar, Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - VP &amp; Senior Research Analyst [5] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- All right. Yes. Understood. Very, very helpful there. Okay. On the 2 acquisitions you announced recently, they it looks somewhat small, but strategic, not terribly risky or splashy. I guess, Don, is this the right way to think about the M&amp;A strategy you have in mind? And I can't help but look at sequencing of events here, but these acquisitions came shortly after you took over as CEO. And do you see yourself as being generally more aggressive than your predecessor in bringing external assets in-house? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Donald J. Zurbay, Patterson Companies, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [6] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I wouldn't say that. I think we've been -- we have a robust process for identifying acquisition candidates. And that's really been in place, I think, for the last 2 years once they got here, we were not really prepared with our balance sheet or, frankly, internally to take on acquisitions, particularly multiple acquisitions. But over the last 2 years, we've been pretty aggressive in trying to identify the right candidates. And so that's just more of a timing thing, frankly. In terms of how these fit into the strategy, I think they fit in really well for us. Our main thing is deepening our value proposition with our customers. These are right in the middle of the fairway for that kind of thing. And so size may differ, but I think you can look at these as a great example of the kind of acquisitions that can help us going forward. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [7] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nathan Allen Rich, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [8] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I guess looking at the dental consumables growth of 1%, excluding PPE. Could you maybe talk about how that breaks down between volume and price? And then Don, I think last quarter, you had pointed to slowing traffic and spend per visit as a risk to the dental end market. Just curious to get your updated thoughts on how that progress or played out during the quarter? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Donald J. Zurbay, Patterson Companies, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [9] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sorry, what was the -- just can you reiterate the last question? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nathan Allen Rich, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [10] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Yes. I think on your last quarterly call, you had talked about the potential for slowing traffic and spend per visit at the dental practice. Just curious to get your updated thoughts there. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Donald J. Zurbay, Patterson Companies, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [11] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, maybe we'll start there and then see if Kevin has some data he wants to give on PPE. I think right now, we're viewing patient traffic in the dental business as steady or stable I mean that's the way I would look at it. And in terms of spend per visit, I'd probably say the same thing. I think we're really just seeing a pretty stable environment right now in that part of the business. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin Barry, Patterson Companies, Inc. - Interim CFO [12] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. And to your question about price and mix, we have had some inflation in the -- our acquisition cost that in the non-PPE area. I wouldn't describe it as significant. It's certainly not as high as what you see in some of the headline inflation numbers, but it's there. So that certainly is built into our sales growth this quarter. But like Don said, when we look at the end markets and what our customers are seeing in their practices, we see a pretty stable market for demand in the dental business. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nathan Allen Rich, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [13] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Great. And then if I could just ask on the Dental equipment side. I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about improved demand for digital equipment. Could you maybe dig into a little bit more detail there? And I guess I would maybe -- does that mean, I guess, digital equipment kind of outpaced that 11% overall Dental equipment growth, and I guess I'd be a little bit surprised just given some of the commentary around pricing pressure we've seen in that category. So could you maybe just unpack that a little bit further for us? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Donald J. Zurbay, Patterson Companies, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [14] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I mean it's a 3-month period. So we try to look at this over a longer period of time. But we had a -- we feel like that was an excellent part of the print here for us today. And so it did outpace the rest of the equipment growth. I think CAD/CAM was down, as we mentioned, digital was up. I think what it really points to is just the resiliency of our full equipment portfolio. I think we feel like we have a competitive advantage here. We have a particular skill in this area. And this is what we've seen really several times here is some categories are up, some are down each quarter. It just kind of depends on timing. I think the main data point from my perspective is when you look at the last 8 quarters, we're up 14%. And again, that's a time period that we can get our arms around and say, we think that we're executing in this area at a really high level. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [15] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeffrey D. Johnson, Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [16] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I missed the first part of the call, so I don't want to ask anything you might have already covered. But let me just ask, I guess, one higher level question. And Don, that's on the makeup of the business. You've had some changes at the dental leadership level recently, I think at least one outsider who had probably advocated for some bigger changes recently left. So we know the Board has long been a pretty conservative Board. So I guess, Don, now that you're in the CEO chair, where do you sit between maybe that conservative Board maybe tacking to things like private label, self-manufacturing of dental products, dental outside of North America, just kind of those bigger picture issues that could maybe move the sales force away from kind of that transactional approach that's long been there. and more maybe to a consultative approach and into some of these kind of newer areas of dental? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Donald J. Zurbay, Patterson Companies, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [17] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, Jeff. I won't comment on the Board. But I mean, we -- I think if you look at our strategy that we've had for the last couple of years, obviously, I was a big part of that, along with the rest of the leadership team. So I don't expect that to change significantly. I think that even though it may have not have shown up yet, as I mentioned, we've been, I think, aggressive in terms of looking at the other kinds of opportunities, the M&amp;A opportunities, other ways to enhance our strategy. And my view, and I don't think this is different than where we've been, but I want to be aggressive in both the Dental and Animal health space in really deepening our value proposition. We know how to pick pack and ship but we're on the search and continuing journey to continue to deepen that. And I think that's our focus, and I think if you got into our meetings and some of the things we're doing, you'd find it to be a more aggressive discussion than it may come across. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeffrey D. Johnson, Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [18] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Do you feel Don on at all like you are even more supportive of kind of that evolution of Patterson and of where kind of dental distribution probably needs to go over the next 5 or 10 years? Then maybe past leadership? Is there any change that we should expect in your mentality or support of kind of that, again, what I think is needed evolution versus maybe past leadership? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Donald J. Zurbay, Patterson Companies, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [19] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I wouldn't want to stack myself up exactly, but I think when we look at our strategy, like I said, there's a -- we're fully bought into the idea of we're not just a distributor. I mean when we talk about being an indispensable partner to our customers, that really is where we're at. And the best way to do that. And I think is to really how do you deepen the value proposition. And I think we're -- you can kind of see it starting to take hold and continue is on our margin performance and how it's impacting our margins. We're really being diligent about how we look at each customer and kind of the holistic view of that. And those efforts are paying off quarter after quarter now on the margin expansion side. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [20] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Albert J. William Rice, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Research Analyst [21] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just first question around the comments around PPE. It sounds like from here through the rest of the fiscal year, you're thinking you'll still experience deflationary pressure, but the order -- the volumes are stabilized. Is that the right takeaway? And then on that deflationary aspect, is that year-over-year, but sequentially, pricing is stabilizing? Or is pricing on a sequential quarterly basis still coming down? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Donald J. Zurbay, Patterson Companies, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [22] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Well, what we're seeing is pricing is coming down sequentially. I think when we look at the volume implications, we think when all is said and done here that volumes are going to be above pre-pandemic levels. But the pricing continues to moderate. And as we go -- and we think that, that should hopefully abate at the end of this fiscal year. The impact going forward is going to be that on a year-over-year comparison that will move into next year just because of the dynamics of how it's declined this year. I don't know, Kevin, if you want to add anything to that? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin Barry, Patterson Companies, Inc. - Interim CFO [23] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. No, that's right. It's primarily a gloves issue for us. And like Don said, what we've seen is the pricing on those products has started to stabilize a bit. But because they are lower than they were a year ago, we're going to have a comparison issue for the next couple of quarters here as we kind of work through that dynamic. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Albert J. William Rice, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Research Analyst [24] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Maybe just the other follow-up question would be, when you guys talk about the sort of macro challenges of inflation, interest rate rising and then sort of the uncertainty about the economy generally. I understand the issues you have on inflation and I understand the issues you have the interest rates rising presents with financing and so forth. But what about the slowdown in the economy, it's hard for me to look at your numbers and see that you're seeing any impact there. Consumables you're describing is steady and your equipment orders are strong. So is there any place today that you feel the economic uncertainty is impacting the business? Or is it more of we're just mindful of this and we're keeping an eye on it. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Donald J. Zurbay, Patterson Companies, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [25] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I would characterize it more as the latter. Obviously, when we talk about impacts on our market and the macroeconomic conditions, relative to the markets we're in. I mean, I think it's kind of on the margin. The thing we like about our portfolio, the thing we like about being in both the Dental and Animal health business and frankly, all 3 businesses, if you really break Animal Health down into companion and production is -- these are resilient markets. They've proven that in the past. I think -- and that's proving out here now. So that's how we would look at it. I mean compared to a lot of industries. Like I said, when we talk about moves, there are small moves. There are things that we're monitoring, but we don't expect a significant impact. I mean, in terms of the rest of the impacts of the economy, I mean, you mentioned interest rates. I think interest rates really affect equipment portfolio, as we mentioned, to some extent, but the real impact on it for interest rates on us is on our debt. We have a responsible debt structure where we have roughly 50% of our debt fixed, 50% variable, but the interest rate increases that we've been seeing have had an impact on the variable side. And I would estimate those at maybe $0.05 of EPS that we're dealing with, but that we're overcoming as we talk about reaffirming our guidance, we're really looking at other parts of the business to cover that. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [26] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your next question comes from the line of Jon Block from Stifel. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jonathan David Block, Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Equity Research Analyst [27] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Maybe I'll just start on the Animal Health side of the business. The overall [AHI] weren't too far from our expectations. But production animal Don, as you mentioned, at low single digits. I know you got the 11% year ago comp, but why the DRAXXIN headwinds now? I believe that when off-patent, call it well over a year ago. And so if you're first feeling that now why, and if so, should we expect that to sort of last for the next 2 or 3 quarters until arguably you lap that? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin Barry, Patterson Companies, Inc. - Interim CFO [28] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- John, it's Kevin. I can jump in and then Don can add. The DRAXXIN issue, you're right, it came off patent last year. I think, the impact sort of builds over time, right? I think as those products come off patent, it's not a quick switch. And I think our production animal team who -- a team that executes very well out in the market has done a good job of managing that transition over the past 9 months here. And so the impacts sort of accumulated for us over the fiscal year. And I think this is the first quarter where we really saw a real sizable impact on that category from the generics coming in. So I think we will see this dynamic in the next couple of quarters as we comp over the prior periods. But it's obviously built into our guidance, and that team is executing really well to keep our customers operating well and helping them understand what's going to be best for their practice for their operations. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jonathan David Block, Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Equity Research Analyst [29] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Got it. All right. I'll jump to my second question, and that was helpful. So on the dental consumables ex infection prevention, roughly the past 5 quarters, the growth has been plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 2 and now plus 1. And arguably, the price contributions probably improved along the way. So maybe a couple of questions here. When you see the low single-digit long-term for dental consumables. Is that inclusive of infection prevention or exclusive? And then also, is that long term a fiscal '24 time frame and if so, how do you get there considering price may play less of a role next year relative to fiscal '23? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Donald J. Zurbay, Patterson Companies, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [30] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. We would consider it, over the long term, inclusive of the PPE dynamic. As we mentioned, that's going to moderate as we move forward. And when you talk about the long term, I'd say that that's how you'd look at that. Sorry, Jon, what was the second part of that question? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jonathan David Block, Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Equity Research Analyst [31] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, just maybe even just speak to sort of like the reacceleration, right? If you've had the decel and I'm sort of going because there's 2 different dynamics, right? One is, as you mentioned, the deflationary environment on gloves and that should normalize per your comments on vials. But Don, if we look at the decel, and it's been subtle, to be clear, but the plus 3 to plus 1 x infection prevention with price playing a bigger role, and you guys want to get back to low single digits, implying a little bit of an acceleration. How do you get there arguably if price may play less of a role next year versus this year? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Donald J. Zurbay, Patterson Companies, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [32] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Well, I think we're going to continue to execute on our strategy. I think when we break down the consumables, one thing I would say is that in the categories we compete in, we believe we're maintaining or taking share. We think we do pretty well in those categories. Sometimes it's hard to stack up everything just given the way that we're in certain categories, competitors are in certain categories, what does the market exactly look like. But I think we're well positioned to get back to taking share, which would probably put our companion sales, ex PP in the short term, but overall, in the long term, above the market growth. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [33] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your next question comes from the line of [Charlotte Coll] from Bank of America. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unidentified Analyst, [34] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is [charlotte] on for Mike. Could you just provide some more color on the trends that you're seeing in your customers, particularly as it relates to utilization in volumes? And then just an update around spend per visit as well. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Donald J. Zurbay, Patterson Companies, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [35] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I think the industry data would talk about in the companion business, vet visits being down roughly 2%, but that spend per visit is up 5%. So we think that's a growing market with that dynamic. So that's really the breakdown that I think -- and we would be -- we would look at our data and say that we think that seems reasonable and that that's consistent with what we're seeing as well. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin Barry, Patterson Companies, Inc. - Interim CFO [36] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And especially within the context of the comparisons we have a year ago where you had a very high growth rate on visits in particular. So we've expected this sort of moderation in our results and our forecast. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unidentified Analyst, [37] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Got it. And then could you just discuss more on your strategy, particularly around organic investments that you're making in the core business? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Donald J. Zurbay, Patterson Companies, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [38] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, we have a lot of different things we're investing in, in our core business. I think we've talked about them before. I mean, obviously, we strive for continued and improvement in our efficiency, just in our distribution operation itself. Our private label program is a very important part of our margin enhancement initiatives. And then just investing in the infrastructure we need to really drive the margin improvement. Margin improvement is paramount, and I think you can see it in these results. And if you look back, we're starting to -- in my view, we have a track record here of doing what we said we were going to do, which is improve the margins. And a lot of that has to do with all the various investments we're making to help drive that. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [39] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Vazquez from William Blair. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brandon Vazquez, William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Associate [40] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I just wanted to focus a little bit on the macro comments that were being made earlier. And maybe you can talk a little bit, there's been some noise just around potentially like a deterioration of the consumer as we go into the final month here of the year. So kind of curious, maybe if you think about like on a month-to-month basis and even a month what you've seen since the close of the second quarter. It sounded like things have been stable. Have you been -- I just wanted to confirm that that's been the case, especially as we go beyond the second quarter and you haven't really seen maybe a worsening macro environment compared to the beginning of the quarter? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Donald J. Zurbay, Patterson Companies, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [41] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, we wouldn't be -- we wouldn't really comment too much on intra-quarter trends or month-to-month trends. I mean I think I would say that just at a macro level, we kind of view our markets, as I mentioned, as particularly in the dental side as stable. The companion side, like I said, we're seeing vet visits down, but spend per visit up. And we're dealing with the Draxxin impact on production, but that's a resilient, stable market where we have the benefit of having a diversified portfolio that has really served us well over time. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brandon Vazquez, William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Associate [42] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. And then similarly on the macro headwinds, but maybe a different angle kind of looking geographically, are you guys seeing any notable differences in kind of end market strength? I know there seems to be a lot of concerns, especially around like Europe, that maybe higher energy prices there might lead to a more difficult kind of end market for a lot of names. So anything like that you guys would call out or factoring into guidance that we should be keeping in mind? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin Barry, Patterson Companies, Inc. - Interim CFO [43] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is Kevin. Yes. Our international footprint is relatively small compared to North American footprint. We have a really nice business in the U.K. that performed well this quarter. Obviously, there's an FX headwind on the sales line, but constant currency basis is showing good growth. And so we feel like our position there is pretty strong. We're obviously watching it closely for those dynamics you said. But within our portfolio, North America is the majority of our business. And like Don said, we feel good about the stability of the markets here and how we're executing in them. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Donald J. Zurbay, Patterson Companies, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [44] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think we have time for one more question. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [45] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Certainly, your last question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unidentified Analyst, [46] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is Pat on for Elizabeth. So to think we've been trying to sort through on the deal equipment side is that we're hearing about weakness in the category from some of the factors right now. But both you and some of your peers are characterizing strength in the segment. Can you just help us sort through that? Are there any channel dynamics you might be neglecting to consider? Or what is driving that disconnect between dental equipment commentary between the distributors and the manufacturers? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Donald J. Zurbay, Patterson Companies, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director [47] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I think honestly, what we're seeing is just what we said, which is we had a strong equipment quarter. There's continued solid, good demand. The pipeline continues to be replenished and it's -- I think it's always been a little hard to sort out and reconcile the timing of things that happen at the manufacturers versus the distributors just given when shipments take place, how the supply chain works, what we're seeing and it's hard to really argue given our results, is that equipment is strong, the demand is strong and that's our -- that's kind of our world and what we're seeing. Thank you for your time today and your interest in Patterson Companies. We wish you and your families a wonderful holiday season. Happy new year, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thanks. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [48] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

Shares have added about 8.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Verisk due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts. Verisk's Q3 Earnings Match EstimatesVerisk Analytics reported mixed third-quarter 2022 results, wherein earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same.Adjusted earnings per share (excluding 26 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.46 meet the consensus mark but grew 1.4% on a year-over-year basis. The upside was backed by growth in the Insurance segment and a lower average share count.Revenues of $745.3 million missed the consensus estimate by 1.6% and decreased 1.8% year over year on a reported basis but increased 4.8% on an organic constant-currency (cc) basis. The revenue decline was primarily due to the sale of the environmental health and safety business (3E), and Verisk Financial Services.Segmental PerformanceThe Insurance segment’s revenues totaled $610.1 million, up 9.4% year over year on a reported basis and 5.3% on an organic cc basis.Within the segment, underwriting and rating revenues of $436.2 million rose 11.7% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic cc basis. The upside was primarily driven by an annual increase in prices derived from the continued enhancements of the content of solutions within the industry-standard insurance programs and the sale of expanded solutions to the existing customers in commercial and personal lines. In addition, extreme event and life solutions contributed to growth.Claims revenues amounted to $173.9 million, improving 3.9% on a reported basis and 2.4% on an organic cc basis. The top line was primarily driven by growth in claims analytics solutions and in repair cost estimation solutions.Story continuesThe Energy and Specialized Markets segment’s revenues of $135.2 million decreased 18.5% year over year on a reported basis but increased 2.5% on an organic cc basis. The fall in revenues was primarily due to the sale of the 3E business that closed on Mar 11, 2022, and the suspension of commercial operations in Russia. However, organic cc growth was driven by modest growth in research revenues.Operating ResultsAdjusted EBITDA of $383.5 million increased 1.2% on a reported basis and 6% on an organic cc basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 51.5% from 49.9% in the prior-year quarter.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowVerisk exited third-quarter 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $276.8 million compared with $480.7 million at the end of the prior-year quarter. Long-term debt was $2.34 billion, flat with the prior-year quarter’s level. Verisk generated $280.2 million of cash from operating activities, while capex was $65.8 million. Free cash flow was $214.4 million.Share Repurchase &amp; Dividend PayoutDuring the quarter, Verisk paid out a total cash dividend of $48.6 million. It bought back 1.6 million shares at an average price of $187.08 for a total cost of $300 million. As of Sep 30, 2022, VRSK had $407.5 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -19.96% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Verisk has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Verisk has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerVerisk belongs to the Zacks Business - Information Services industry. Another stock from the same industry, S&amp;P Global (SPGI), has gained 13.5% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended September 2022.S&amp;P Global reported revenues of $2.86 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +37.1%. EPS of $2.93 for the same period compares with $3.54 a year ago.For the current quarter, S&amp;P Global is expected to post earnings of $2.52 per share, indicating a change of -20% from the year-ago quarter.

The Company also refers to and presents certain additional non-GAAP financial measures, within the meaning of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These measures are: non-GAAP pro forma adjusted organic revenue guidance, non-GAAP pro forma adjusted operating profit margin guidance, and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures are not available due to the challenges and impracticability with estimating some of the items. The Company is not able to provide reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Because of those challenges, reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures are not available without unreasonable effort.The Company's non-GAAP measures include adjustments that reflect how management views our businesses. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that enables investors to better compare the Company's performance across periods, and management also uses these measures internally to assess the operating performance of its business, to assess performance for employee compensation purposes and to decide how to allocate resources. However, investors should not consider any of these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information that the Company reports.Forward-Looking Statements:  This press release contains ""forward-looking statements,"" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, including statements about COVID-19 and the completed merger (the ""Merger"") between a subsidiary of the Company and IHS Markit Ltd.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Mastercard (NYSE:MA), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. See our latest analysis for Mastercard Mastercard's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. We can see that in the last three years Mastercard grew its EPS by 15% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Mastercard shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 54% to 57%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Mastercard's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Mastercard Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Mastercard has a market capitalisation of US$347b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$355m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.1% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Should You Add Mastercard To Your Watchlist?One positive for Mastercard is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. Still, you should learn about the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Mastercard.Although Mastercard certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

Currencies in Latin America rose 1.2%, outpacing the broader emerging market currencies index , which added 0.8%. The U.S. dollar index tumbled 1% after comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that U.S. rate hikes could be scaled back ""as soon as December"" and as an indicator tracked by the Fed showed inflation moderating. South Africa's rand dropped 2.3% against the dollar, weighing on the EM index. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa's future hung in the balance as his office said he was exploring options after a report found evidence he may have committed misconduct over a stash of cash stolen from his game farm. ""From a markets perspective, we believe that an early departure of President Ramaphosa will be perceived negatively by financial markets, given uncertainties about policy continuity that such an event would naturally bring,"" Barclays Bank strategists wrote in a note. ""Hence, against the uncertain political background over the next few weeks, we believe that markets are likely to remain volatile in the near term."" In Latin America, the Brazilian real dipped 0.2%, after rising for three straight sessions. Brazil's economic growth slowed more than expected in the third quarter as higher interest rates affected household spending, underscoring challenges facing President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva next year. The real has underperformed its regional peers in November, ending last month nearly flat compared to the 1% rise in the broader Latam index on fiscal policy concerns. Brazil's central bank intervened in the foreign exchange market on Thursday, selling $2 billion in the spot market with a repurchase agreement, it said in a statement on its website. Lula has also pushed back his first Cabinet announcements to next week, two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, dragging out key appointments that have kept financial markets on edge. Mexico's peso rose 0.6%. Central bank data showed remittances to Mexico reached a record-high of $5.360 billion in October. A survey showed Mexico's factory activity grew for a third straight month in November amid sales improvement, job creation. Meanwhile, a Reuters poll showed Colombia's inflation could have peaked in November. The peso currency was up 1.3%. Chile's peso gained 1.3%. Traders expect Chilean interest rate to remain at 11.25% in December even as recession looms in the top copper producer, with data showing a drop in the IMACEC economic activity index in October from the same month last year. Peru's Sol inched 0.1% up against the dollar after data showed consumer prices rose more than expected last month.

Precious metals, which were pressured by a sharp rise in rates this year, were the main beneficiaries of this rally.Spot gold fell 0.1% to $1,800.96 an ounce, but remained near three-month highs, while gold futures hovered near $1,814.70 an ounce- their strongest level in five months.Both instruments were set to add about 3% this week.Focus now turns to U.S. nonfarm payrolls data due later in the day, which is expected to show that the jobs market cooled slightly in November. But the sector has remained robust this year, with the Federal Reserve stating that it will seek more moderation in the space as it tightens policy.Any unexpected signs of strength in the jobs market gives the Fed enough impetus to keep raising interest rates- a scenario which is negative for markets.While Fed Chair Jerome Powell flagged slower interest rates in the coming months, he also warned that U.S. interest rates will likely peak at higher-than-expected levels due to stubborn inflation. This stifled some enthusiasm in risk-driven markets.But the prospect of smaller rate hikes offered much relief to markets battered by rising rates this year. Platinum and silver futures vastly outperformed gold this week, rising more than 6% each.Among industrial metals, copper prices fell slightly on Friday, but were also headed for a positive week on the back of growing hopes that major importer China will ease its anti-COVID policies.Copper futures fell 0.2% to $3.7865 a pound, but were set to end the week over 4% higher.Story continuesTwo major Chinese cities relaxed COVID-related curbs after an unprecedented wave of anti-government protests rocked the country this week. Demonstrations were directed against Beijing’s zero-COVID policy, which saw China maintain strict curbs on movement and activity over the past three years in order to contain COVID-19 cases.But the easing measures this week drove up expectations for a wider scaling back of anti-COVID measures, which could help spur an economic recovery.PMI data released earlier this week showed that economic conditions in China have deteriorated even further due to the zero-COVID policy.Related ArticlesGold steadies above $1,800 ahead of U.S. payrolls dataOil treads water amid speculation over OPEC cut, weekly gains on tapMexico, U.S. trade officials discuss energy, corn exports, environment]"

To skip the details about global imports and exports, go directly to the 5 Biggest Import-Export Companies in the World.International trade is one of the driving factors of the global economy. In the recent year, global trade hit a snag in 2018 due to tensions between USA and China. However, it was on its way to recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic started to spread worldwide. 2021 saw global trade recovery due to mass vaccine roll-outs and the easing of lockdown restrictions.China was the biggest exporter in the world in 2021 with exports worth $3.36 trillion by the end of the year.

Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE)Market Cap as of November 30: $11.233 billionCelanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) is an American chemical and advanced materials company. It is the world’s largest producer of acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomer and represent’s 25% of the global production of acetic acid. The company is one of the world’s most significant exporters with 25 production plants and six research centers across 11 countries. Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) serves customers globally.In the last 23 months, Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) made two significant acquisitions. The first one was Santoprene from Exxon Mobil for $1.15 billion in 2021, acquiring Santoprene®, Dytron™, and Geolast™ as part of the deal. Later in February 2022, Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) agreed to acquire DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (NYSE:DD)’s mobility and material business for $11 billion. The company expects revenue and cost synergies of up to US$450 million from both deals in the next 4 years.On November 10,  Deutsche Bank analyst David Begleiter maintained a Buy rating on Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE)’s and lowered his price target to $105 from $110 after the company’s Q3 results.Here is what Vltava Fund had to say about Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We then used the money freed up to, among other things, open three new positions. The stock price declines during the Russian invasion brought a lot of good prices to the market. Out of all the possibilities we considered, we picked the stocks of Celanese (CE).Celanese is the world’s largest producer of acetic acid and its chemical derivatives, including vinyl acetate monomers and emulsions. Their applications are used in a wide range of industries, such as automotive tobacco, coatings, construction, energy, telecommunications, food, and medical. Celanese recently closed the acquisition of a large part of DuPont’s business, which will make Celanese an even bigger player in the industry while reducing the cyclicality of it business. The acquisition is quite large and should deliver significant value to shareholders that in our view is not at all presently reflected in the share price. Celanese is a business that stands more or less aside from the main interests of most investors, but it is a company with very high returns on capital, strong free cash flow, and historically very efficient resource allocation.”9.

First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors was dominated by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”7.

This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Expedia is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Expedia imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for ExpediaThis online travel company is expected to earn $7.46 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2022, which represents a year-over-year change of 352.1%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Expedia. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 10.3%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Expedia to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Expedia and Amazon are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that EXPE is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.EXPE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.31, while AMZN has a forward P/E of 131.43. We also note that EXPE has a PEG ratio of 1.02. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. AMZN currently has a PEG ratio of 6.52.Another notable valuation metric for EXPE is its P/B ratio of 4.49. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, AMZN has a P/B of 7.16.These metrics, and several others, help EXPE earn a Value grade of A, while AMZN has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesEXPE stands above AMZN thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that EXPE is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The mean price target of $135.75 indicates a 27.1% upside potential.The mean estimate comprises 20 short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $28.66. While the lowest estimate of $100 indicates a 6.4% decline from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 84.4% to reach $197. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.But, for EXPE, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for EXPEHere's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why EXPE Could Witness a Solid UpsideThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.6% over the past month, as four estimates have gone higher compared to no negative revision.Moreover, EXPE currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much EXPE could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE American: KULR) (the ""Company"" or ""KULR""), a leading energy management platform company accelerating the global transition to a sustainable electrification economy, today announced it has achieved operational readiness for its Fractional Thermal Runaway Calorimeter (“FTRC”) within its suite of battery safety and thermal management solutions after finalizing a commercial licensing agreement with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”) for the agency's patent-pending FTRC solution.Following a one-year trial license from NASA, KULR’s new commercial license allows FTRC to be utilized by commercial-leaning companies, such as leading aerospace company Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), that wish to develop better and safer battery pack and battery management system (“BMS”) designs. This successful progression deepens the Company’s position as the leading end-to-end battery safety design, testing, shipping, storage and failure-mitigation provider.Originally developed by NASA and refined by KULR’s engineering team led by NASA alumni and current KULR Chief Technology Officer, Dr. William Walker, FTRC measures the amount of heat energy released during a thermal runaway event, a dangerous, powerful chain-reaction explosion that can happen when batteries are stored, shipped or used together. This technology helps engineers and designers better understand these incidents and helps develop safer battery solutions to mitigate them. FTRC also allows engineers and designers to perform necessary testing experiments faster while also enabling them to utilize a variety of trigger methods such as heaters, internal short circuit (“ISC”), and nail penetration to generate more accurate results and in turn, eventual solutions. “FTRC is a key part of KULR’s holistic methodology for the design of safe battery systems and amplifies the Company’s mission of providing commercially applicable solutions that support the electrification of the circular economy,” said Dr. William Walker CTO of KULR Technology Group. “It is humbling to see a technology that I co-invented during my tenure at NASA become a licensed product in private industry and I am excited to support our customers with this new service offering. Fractional calorimetry has certainly changed the way we understand thermal runaway and I cannot wait to see what else is revealed to the industry as we continue our explorative studies internally on thermal runaway behavior.”Story continuesThe commercial license for KULR’s FTRC specifically applies to 18650 and 21700 format Lithium-ion cells and the Company plans to enable pouch cell FTRC next month.About KULR Technology Group Inc. KULR Technology Group Inc. (NYSE American: KULR) is a leading energy management platform offering proven solutions that play a critical role in accelerating the electrification of the circular economy. Leveraging a foundation in developing, manufacturing, and licensing next-generation carbon fiber thermal management technologies for batteries and electronic systems, KULR has evolved its holistic suite of products and services to enable its customers across disciplines to operate with efficiency and sustainability in mind.

Dividend companies with solid dividend growth tracks have outperformed the broader index historically and dividends have shown significant growth during inflationary periods, according to a report by Fidelity.According to a report by CME Group, dividend payouts grew by 12%  and 116% during the high inflation decades of the 2000s and the 2010s, respectively. This gain is widely attributed to the growth in corporate profits during these decades.Many reports have revealed the strong performance of dividend equities during inflationary periods, making investors turn toward them. Guinness Atkinson Funds reported that the S&amp;P 500 surpassed the rate of inflation by over three times from December 1940 to April 2015.

The theme this year is transformative solutions for inclusive development: the role of innovation in fueling an accessible and equitable world.Kentaro Doi has spent the majority of his 14 years at Medtronic in clinical research and regulatory roles but he's especially passionate about spreading awareness about people with disabilities. That's because he lives with retinitis pigmentosa.The progressive disease has no cure and causes low vision, a narrowing of the visual field, and night blindness. ""It affects quality of life,"" Doi said.A lot of people don't know they have it until they are older, but he started experiencing symptoms at just 3 years old.Based in Japan, the regulatory affairs specialist spends much of his time writing documents. Because his visual function is so low, he uses tools known as assistive technology.There are assistive technologies now embedded in many tools within the Microsoft Office suite and Zoom, but there are also specialized tools that Medtronic procures for employees with disabilities.One example is the JAWS Reader, a specialized screen reader software used by people with low or no vision.Glare is another symptom of retinitis pigmentosa that can be challenging for office workers who need to look at a screen all day.""Brightness hurts my eyes. Because of that, I reverse the colors on the screen,"" he said. ""That eases the brightness, and I don't have to suffer much from glare.""Breaking down barriers through technologyFor Shane Creaven, it all started with fielding IT requests for the JAWS reader.Inspired by the Awareness Benefitting Leadership and Employees about Disabilities employee resource group (ABLED ERG), Creaven began to examine the IT problems confronted by employees with disabilities.Now, the service delivery manager is working on getting licenses to accommodate more people who need specific software for not only visual impairment, but also dyslexia and hearing impairment.Story continuesAfter he became involved with the ABLED ERG, a family member was diagnosed with autism.""It made me aware on a bigger scale on how you approach dealing with people who have accessibility issues,"" he said. ""It can take time, but the intention is there to do the right thing. It truly is an inclusive and diverse company.""He and Doi agree on the importance of raising awareness.""The more we talk about it the better the solutions we can put out there for people,"" Creaven said.Tips for an inclusive workplaceWe all have a part to play when it comes to creating and maintaining inclusive workplaces.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Stagflation Stocks To Buy. Stagflation Definition: What is Stagflation?Stagflation refers to consistently high inflation paired with peak unemployment and slow demand. While economists initially believed that stagflation was a foreign concept, as unemployment and inflation rates usually move in different directions, they learned after the ‘Great Inflation’ in 1970s that stagflation is indeed real and it can batter an economy. The term stagflation was coined in 1965 when Iain Macleod, a British Conservative Party politician, said in a House of Commons speech:""We now have the worst of both worlds — not just inflation on the one side or stagnation on the other, but both of them together. We have a sort of 'stagflation' situation and history in modern terms is indeed being made.""Stagflation favors defensive companies whose products and services are necessary for people’s day-to-day lives. This means their share prices often stay resilient despite a slowing macro backdrop. In quantitative terms, defensive sectors usually have a market beta of under 1, which means they outperform when the benchmark index declines, whereas cyclical sectors have a market beta of more than 1, indicating underperformance when the index falls. Utilities, energy, consumer staples, healthcare, and real estate are some of the defensive sectors that perform well, whereas their cyclical counterparts like technology, industrials, and financials take a hit during stagflation economies. Jonathan Wright, professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University, explained that stagflation may occur if a recession is triggered before inflation is limited to where the Federal Reserve wants it to be. Stagflation remains the primary risk for the global economy in 2023, according to Wall Street experts who believe that any rally in equity markets is too unsustainable following the severe selloff in 2022. Nicole Kornitzer, a Paris-based portfolio manager at Kornitzer Capital Management Inc, told Bloomberg on November 28: Story continues“Next year is still going to be difficult. Definitely, stagflation is the outlook for now.” A majority of Wall Street experts believe that the stock market is heading towards stagflation in 2023, similar to the 1970s, as per Bank of America. In its most recent survey of fund managers, BofA found that 92% of them see a period of high inflation and low economic growth in 2023, while 0% foresee a bullish ""goldilocks"" scenario, where the economy evades a recession and inflation declines.Some of the best stagflation stocks to buy include AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Stagflation Definition: 10 Best Stagflation Stocks To BuyPhoto by Mirza Babic on UnsplashOur Methodology For this article, we selected stocks which are defensive in nature, offer strong market visibility, have resilient dividend profiles, and display a longstanding history of surviving volatile market environments.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”7. eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42eBay Inc.

We wouldn’t have done well if we bought it in the early years of that bear market, or even five years later. If you think this bear will be shorter and or less damaging than the dotcom bear market of 2000-2003, you could be showing your inexperience!.”6. Crown Castle Inc.

(NYSE:CCI) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“U.S. communications company Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI) was the largest detractor from quarterly performance. Crown Castle is the leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure in the U.S. with a portfolio of approximately 40,000 towers. The stock underperformed as, driven by rising interest rates, investors rotated away from defensive into more value-oriented sectors. Communications infrastructure remains attractive, however, as companies continue to deploy greater capital spend to support the strong tailwinds from 5G.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stagflation Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:11 Best Delivery Stocks To Buy12 Best Falling Stocks To Buy Now12 Best ESG Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. Stagflation Definition: 10 Best Stagflation Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

It's also where he witnessed six of his siblings pass away from preventable diseases. Millogo's father was a strong believer in education and sent him to attend the nearest school in another village, which was hours away from Konkourona on foot.Despite experiencing much communal trauma growing up, Millogo graduated from medical school and began his career in a Burkina Faso province far from Konkourona, serving as the only doctor for a population of 250,000.""I somehow managed to overcome bouts of homelessness, hunger and illness from infectious diseases that often come with extreme poverty,"" said Millogo. ""I grew up knowing that I needed to make a difference in Konkourona and bring opportunities and hope to the people living there.""Forming Konkourona Alliance Foundation (KAFO) to fight for opportunity and equityWhen Millogo joined Merck, he met Cathy Hoath, senior director of regulatory affairs international, vaccines. Hoath was born in Booth Memorial Hospital for Unwed Mothers in Philadelphia, after her teenage birth mother was thrown out of her parents' home and was unable to find a job or apartment. That experience fuels Hoath's drive to fight for equity and opportunities - for women, children and all who want to create better lives for themselves and their communities in the U.S. and around the world.In 2019, during a meeting with the World Health Organization to register our company's Ebola Zaire vaccine in the countries at highest risk in Africa, Millogo and Hoath began discussing ways they could support development in Konkourona. A few months later, they co-founded the non-profit organization Konkourona​ Alliance Foundation (KAFO), Inc.Story continues""It was the perfect convergence of my professional and personal worlds, giving me the chance to fight for greater opportunity and equity for some of the world's most vulnerable people.""-Cathy HoathBecause remote villages like Konkourona are often referred to in development efforts as ""the last mile,"" they named their effort ""The First Mile Development Program."" The people of Konkourona are KAFO's highest priorities.KAFO builds foundation for educationMillogo and Hoath have met many like-minded people - both within our company and beyond - who have become supporters of KAFO since its founding. And they've made good progress in Konkourona.KAFO has built three new classrooms - reducing class sizes from approximately 90 to 45 students - as well as an office and housing for teachers. It also renovated an existing building for use as a library.Approximately 400 students are now receiving assistance, from books and tutoring to tuition and bicycles so older students can make the two-hour journey to the closest upper-level school.Students are making educational progressPreviously, only one or two students per year progressed to middle school. Now, in just a couple of years, over 80 students are continuing their education at middle school and beyond.""In 2020, we began providing books for each child because there were not nearly enough. We also opened the school at night - the only place in the village with electricity - and offered tutoring services. That year, 20 children passed the middle school entrance exam - which is unheard of in any school in this sub-region,"" said Hoath. ""In the past two years, 63 additional students have progressed to middle school.""One of those students is Eric, who couldn't afford tuition for middle school. His father died, and he had to help his mother, so he got a job on Millogo's brother's farm. Now, through KAFO's sponsorship, he's going to high school. He's also helping to sustain the program long term by mentoring younger children and working with the team on the ground to secure books and bicycles.He's now thinking about what he may want to study in college - a dream that would not have existed just several years ago.""We have high hopes for this thoughtful young man,"" said Millogo.Improving access to health care and clean waterThe maternal and child mortality rates in Burkina Faso are among the highest in the world. In addition to a lack of health care resources, the villagers also had very little access to clean water.""One of the biggest problems we face in Konkourona is water-borne diseases,"" said Millogo. ""People drink water from wherever they can find it - open ponds or other sources contaminated with human and animal waste and other pathogens.""Working closely with the Mami Siara Na Association, a community-led organization created in 2019 to partner with KAFO to lead and sustain development efforts on the ground, the team has now constructed three water towers, three community fountains, a health center for mothers and children, a separate facility for primary care, a pharmacy, latrines, housing for health care workers and an incinerator.""Providing access to clean water in Konkourona is practically a revolution.""-Jules Millogo""And the health care facility, where we can provide critical maternal care, immunizations, and primary services for children and community members - like caring for illnesses, wounds, etcetera - will have a significant impact for this community in many ways,"" said Millogo.Providing economic development and hope for a better futureThe improvements in education and health care have sparked local economic development as well. There are new jobs in Konkourona to ensure continued access to education, health care, water and sanitation, not to mention those related to construction activities.Over the next five years, Millogo and Hoath plan to build a middle school, a technical school and a high school, as well as housing for teachers in these schools. They also plan to expand the health center.We're all in on this program and learning every day how to do new things - things we don't have experience in - to make progress in Konkourona,"" said Millogo.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Merck's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Merck How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Merck is:34% = US$15b ÷ US$45b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.34 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Merck's Earnings Growth And 34% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Merck has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 18% the company's ROE is quite impressive. As a result, Merck's exceptional 28% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.We then compared Merck's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 14% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is MRK fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Merck Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Merck has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 64%, meaning the company only retains 36% of its income. This implies that the company has been able to achieve high earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.Besides, Merck has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 37% over the next three years. Despite the lower expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Merck's performance has been quite good. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

188,34925a94-3ea8-3d7b-8b3b-ea332a6b3f9e,MRK,2022-12-02,FOCUS-Merck could keep its patent edge by shifting Keytruda cancer drug to a simple shot,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/focus-merck-could-keep-patent-110000890.html,1669978800,STORY,['MRK'],"[By Michael ErmanDec 2 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Merck &amp; Co hopes to patent a new formulation of its $20 billion cancer immunotherapy Keytruda that can be injected under the skin, allowing it to protect its best-selling drug from competition expected as soon as 2028.For years Merck has relied on Keytruda to fuel its growth. The treatment, approved in 2014, harnesses the body's own immune system to fight cancers with dramatic results. Against advanced lung cancer, it has led to a five-year survival rate in about one-quarter of people compared to 5% of people historically.But the key patents on Keytruda will begin to expire in 2028, opening the door to biosimilars - near copies of expensive biologic drugs whose complex molecules cultivated inside living cells make it impossible to manufacture exact copies.Merck is testing in clinical trials two versions of the drug that can be injected subcutaneously, a quick alternative to infusions, the current delivery method in which patients receive an intravenous drip in a health office once every three or six weeks. The company reported early data from one of those trials last year.While Merck has disclosed that it is developing subcutaneous versions of Keytruda, it has not previously said that it expects the new formulation to become the most widely used version of the drug after it is rolled out and an engine for growth toward the end of the decade.If successful, Merck could begin marketing the new formulation within a few years, a top Merck executive told Reuters. It expects it to fuel Keytruda's growth as it gains approvals in earlier stage cancers. Keytruda now accounts for more than one-third of Merck’s sales.""We believe that subcutaneous formulation has the potential to be novel, non-obvious and useful, which means we would get a new patent for it,"" Merck CFO Caroline Litchfield said in an interview, using the terminology for the criteria under U.S. law to determine what technologies merit a patent.Story continues""The clock for that patent would start ticking from the time we would get that patent approved.""While some patients would likely still receive the original formulation if it is being administered along with chemotherapy or other intravenous drugs, the subcutaneous formulation could replace the IV version for most patients, Merck Chief Medical Officer Eliav Barr told Reuters.""In theory it could replace everywhere that Keytruda currently is used,"" Barr said.Drug patents have a guaranteed term of exclusivity for 20 years after receiving a patent under U.S. law, but sometimes the companies are able to add additional patents that extend their exclusivity.For example, the primary patent on Abbvie's arthritis drug Humira expired in 2016 but the drug will not face U.S. competition until 2023, in part because the company eventually received more than 130 patents that protect the drug.Merck's patents on the subcutaneous version of Keytruda could protect that formulation until at least 2040, according to Tahir Amin, co-founder of drug patents watchdog group Initiative for Medicines, Access &amp; Knowledge (I-MAK).""It's the way the pharmaceutical companies now use that system -- it's all about taking up as much space as possible, making it difficult for anybody to enter,"" Amin said. ""Keytruda is going to be the next Humira by all accounts.""Asked whether it was motivated more by patent issues than medical need, Merck said it was continuously focused on improving Keytruda and getting it to more patients.Merck said it may seek patents for innovations in how the drug is used, its formulation, the size and schedule of doses and combinations with other drugs.""These patent applications, if granted, may provide varying degrees of protection beyond 2028. However, we would continue to point to late 2028 as the most likely timeframe for biosimilar entry into the market,"" Merck said in a statement.DO PATIENTS PREFER SHOTS?Getting doctors and hospitals to adopt the new formulation before biosimilar competition arrives could help Merck protect more of its Keytruda revenue for longer but is not certain, analysts said. On average, they expect Keytruda revenues to top $30 billion in 2026 and $35 billion by 2028, according to Refinitiv data. ""Theoretically, in the US, they could transition all of the market,"" Mizuho analyst Mara Goldstein said, ""depending on how quickly they can get it to market.""However, BMO Capital's Evan Seigerman said that private insurers in the U.S. might balk at paying for the more expensive branded product and prefer a biosimilar infusion version. Still, he believes the new formulation could allow the company to hold onto as much as 20 percent of its Keytruda revenue into the 2030s.Two doctors interviewed by Reuters said they were not convinced that the new route of administration represents a significant enough clinical improvement over IV infusions to justify the additional system-wide healthcare costs that might be a product of Merck receiving a new patent.""I don't think it's going to improve the safety or the effectiveness of the drug,"" said Dr. Shailender Bhatia, an oncologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle.Merck's Barr said the easier-to-use formulation of the drug could help patients' health by keeping them on Keytruda and on schedule, and could keep high-risk cancer patients from spending long times in hospital settings where they could be exposed to other diseases.""From a quality of life and patient perspective, it's for sure going to be helpful,"" Barr said.That view is backed by clinical studies that have found that patients prefer subcutaneous injections to intravenous administration which can be time-consuming and invasive.How much hospitals and doctors embrace the method could reflect how they will be impacted by the change financially.Hospitals are typically paid less to administer an injection than a long infusion. That could be offset somewhat if the drug's price is higher, since providers receive a percentage fee for physician-administered drugs, according to Lisa Mulloy, chief pharmacy officer for New York's Northwell Health hospital system.Merck said it would not speculate on the expected price of pipeline products. The infusion's list price is about $185,000 per year, though the drug may cost less with company discounts.Northwell's Mulloy said moving patients to subcutaneous versions of drugs also opens up spots in infusion centers for additional patients.

On Nov 30, investors’ sentiment got a further boost after Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted at scaling back the pace of interest rate hikes soon. This sent stocks on a rally.This might lead the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow to somehow manage ending the year in green. However, the crisis is far from over, as inflation is still at multi-year highs and far from the Fed’s target range of 2%. Although at a slower pace, the Fed will continue to hike interest rates over the next year.Interest Rate Hikes to ContinueInflation has lately shown signs of cooling off in the United States, which has been the Fed’s biggest concern since the beginning of the year. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.3% month over month in October and 7.7% from a year ago, after increasing 8.2% in the prior month.Market participants have since been optimistic about the Fed going slow on its aggressive rate-hike stance in the coming months. On Wednesday, they got further assurance after Powell said that the Fed might consider scaling back its interest rate hikes as soon as December.Although stocks rallied on the news, inflation is still at a multi-year high, and Powell cautioned that the crisis is far from over. So, interest rate hikes will continue, albeit at a slower pace.Powell warned that fight against inflation is not yet over and that important questions remain unanswered, including how far and how long interest rates will need to be hiked. Market players are worried about the high borrowing costs that could harm the economy and push it into recession as the Fed’s target of 2% is still a far cry.Undoubtedly, such a situation will affect the business climate and consequently the stock market performance.Also, COVID-19 cases are again on the rise in China, compelling the government to impose strict restrictions. Businesses are once again being shut down, and citizens have come out on the streets, getting involved in frequent clashes with the regime opposing the restrictions.Story continuesIn addition to all of these factors, the current geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine poses dangers to the global supply chain and is causing stock market volatility.Higher interest rates result in higher costs of borrowing. The likelihood of an economic downturn rises as a result of this. Both these are warnings for the markets, which have been volatile all year.Therefore, it makes sense for an astute investor to keep a watch on dividend-paying equities right now.

This is encouraging because it indicates that insiders are more optimistic about the company's prospects.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Boeing The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At BoeingOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by President David Calhoun for US$4.0m worth of shares, at about US$160 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of US$176. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. In this case we're pleased to report that the insider purchases were made at close to current prices.While Boeing insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeBoeing is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Boeing Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at Boeing. Not only was there no selling that we can see, but they collectively bought US$4.2m worth of shares. This could be interpreted as suggesting a positive outlook.Insider Ownership Of BoeingAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 0.06% of Boeing shares, worth about US$63m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Boeing Insiders?The recent insider purchases are heartening. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. But on the other hand, the company made a loss during the last year, which makes us a little cautious. When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest Boeing insiders are well aligned, and that they may think the share price is too low. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. While conducting our analysis, we found that Boeing has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it.Of course Boeing may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Southern Southern Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Accounting Officer &amp; Comptroller, Ann Daiss, sold US$506k worth of shares at a price of US$67.47 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$67.72. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 29% of Ann Daiss's stake.Insiders in Southern didn't buy any shares in the last year.

Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of SouthernFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Southern insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$165m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Southern Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But it is good to see that Southern is growing earnings. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Southern. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for Southern (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Stagflation Stocks To Buy. Stagflation Definition: What is Stagflation?Stagflation refers to consistently high inflation paired with peak unemployment and slow demand. While economists initially believed that stagflation was a foreign concept, as unemployment and inflation rates usually move in different directions, they learned after the ‘Great Inflation’ in 1970s that stagflation is indeed real and it can batter an economy. The term stagflation was coined in 1965 when Iain Macleod, a British Conservative Party politician, said in a House of Commons speech:""We now have the worst of both worlds — not just inflation on the one side or stagnation on the other, but both of them together. We have a sort of 'stagflation' situation and history in modern terms is indeed being made.""Stagflation favors defensive companies whose products and services are necessary for people’s day-to-day lives. This means their share prices often stay resilient despite a slowing macro backdrop. In quantitative terms, defensive sectors usually have a market beta of under 1, which means they outperform when the benchmark index declines, whereas cyclical sectors have a market beta of more than 1, indicating underperformance when the index falls. Utilities, energy, consumer staples, healthcare, and real estate are some of the defensive sectors that perform well, whereas their cyclical counterparts like technology, industrials, and financials take a hit during stagflation economies. Jonathan Wright, professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University, explained that stagflation may occur if a recession is triggered before inflation is limited to where the Federal Reserve wants it to be. Stagflation remains the primary risk for the global economy in 2023, according to Wall Street experts who believe that any rally in equity markets is too unsustainable following the severe selloff in 2022. Nicole Kornitzer, a Paris-based portfolio manager at Kornitzer Capital Management Inc, told Bloomberg on November 28: Story continues“Next year is still going to be difficult. Definitely, stagflation is the outlook for now.” A majority of Wall Street experts believe that the stock market is heading towards stagflation in 2023, similar to the 1970s, as per Bank of America. In its most recent survey of fund managers, BofA found that 92% of them see a period of high inflation and low economic growth in 2023, while 0% foresee a bullish ""goldilocks"" scenario, where the economy evades a recession and inflation declines.Some of the best stagflation stocks to buy include AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Stagflation Definition: 10 Best Stagflation Stocks To BuyPhoto by Mirza Babic on UnsplashOur Methodology For this article, we selected stocks which are defensive in nature, offer strong market visibility, have resilient dividend profiles, and display a longstanding history of surviving volatile market environments.

Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies held the biggest stake in the company, comprising 3 million shares worth $208.2 million. Like AbbVie Inc.

(NYSE:GIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) manufactures and markets branded consumer foods worldwide. The company operates through five segments – North America Retail, Convenience Stores &amp; Foodservice, Europe &amp; Australia, Asia &amp; Latin America, and Pet. General Mills, Inc.

(NYSE:GIS) with an Outperform rating and a $90 price target. With a possible recession approaching, the analyst noted that the U.S. packaged food group has historically outperformed the S&amp;P 500 during economic downturns, but he told investors it is ""important to separate the wheat from the chaff"". He thinks General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) is ""reaching for a higher ground"" and that its Blue Buffalo pet food brand has a significant runway.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 40 hedge funds were long General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS), compared to 35 funds in the earlier quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 1.6 million shares worth $129 million. Here is what Chartwell Investment Partners has to say about General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“In the Dividend Equity accounts, the three best performers in Q2 include General Mills (NYSE:GIS, 3.2%), up 12.2%. General Mills benefitted from the combination of being in a very defensive industry as well as demonstrating solid business momentum; margins have been particularly impressive, following price increases.”8. Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) is a Switzerland-based provider of insurance and reinsurance products worldwide. The company operates through North America Commercial P&amp;C Insurance, North America Personal P&amp;C Insurance, North America Agricultural Insurance, Overseas General Insurance, Global Reinsurance, and Life Insurance segments. On November 17, Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.83 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on January 6, 2023 to shareholders of record on December 16. On November 15, Atlantic Equities analyst John Heagerty upgraded Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) to Overweight from Neutral with a $240 price target. The analyst raised his fiscal 2023 earnings forecasts by a cumulative 12%, which he said makes Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB)’s current valuation ""much more attractive."" The property and casualty insurance sector is well positioned to benefit from the current profitability improvement and higher interest rates, which will continue to ""feed through into stronger investment income and operating profitability"" over the next few years, the analyst told investors. According to the third quarter database of Insider Monkey, 41 hedge funds were bullish on Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB), compared to 35 funds in the prior quarter. Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global is the biggest position holder in the company, with 3.6 million shares worth $653.5 million. Here is what Aristotle Capital Management Value Equity has to say about Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Our investment in Chubb began in the fourth quarter of 2015, shortly after ACE Limited announced it would acquire the Chubb Corporation, creating the largest global property and casualty insurance company by underwriting income. During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”7. eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is a California-based company that operates marketplace platforms connecting buyers and sellers in the United States and internationally. On November 29, eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) declared a $0.22 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on December 16, to shareholders of record on December 1. eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is one of the best stagflation stocks to invest in. On November 15, MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Morton assumed coverage of eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) with a Market Perform rating and a $44 price target. He does not believe in the bear scenario of peak e-commerce penetration and believes e-commerce penetration growth will continue at the historical levels, said the analyst, who prefers market share gainers and finds it ""challenging to have an appetite for market share losers"".Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 42 funds reported owning stakes worth $1 billion in eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 43 funds in the prior quarter worth $1.3 billion. D E Shaw held the leading position in the company, comprising nearly 6 million shares worth $218 million. Here is how Smead Capital Management mentioned eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) in the Q2 2022 investor letter:“We believe you need to avoid these formerly glamorous stock groups for many years. We loved to use eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) as a poster child back in 1999 for the dotcom bubble. We bought it eight years later and have done very well on it. We wouldn’t have done well if we bought it in the early years of that bear market, or even five years later. If you think this bear will be shorter and or less damaging than the dotcom bear market of 2000-2003, you could be showing your inexperience!.”6. Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) owns a portfolio of communications infrastructure that connects cities and communities to essential data, technology, and wireless services. Crown Castle Inc.

(NYSE:CCI) and all U.S. tower stocks, especially if rates continue to stabilize.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 48 hedge funds were bullish on Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI), with collective stakes exceeding $1 billion. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management held the biggest stake in the company, consisting of 3 million shares worth $434 million. In addition to AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) is one of the premier stagflation stocks to monitor. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Global Infrastructure Income Strategy has to say about Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“U.S. communications company Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI) was the largest detractor from quarterly performance. Crown Castle is the leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure in the U.S. with a portfolio of approximately 40,000 towers. The stock underperformed as, driven by rising interest rates, investors rotated away from defensive into more value-oriented sectors. Communications infrastructure remains attractive, however, as companies continue to deploy greater capital spend to support the strong tailwinds from 5G.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stagflation Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:11 Best Delivery Stocks To Buy12 Best Falling Stocks To Buy Now12 Best ESG Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. Stagflation Definition: 10 Best Stagflation Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

205,6c23347c-a78c-3fdb-a564-d3c039fa28bb,NOC,2022-12-02,Northrop Grumman to debut new B-21 bomber as aerospace employment rebounds,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northrop-grumman-debut-b-21-130043943.html,1669986043,STORY,['NOC'],"[The B-21 Raider stealth bomber is unveiled at Northrop Grumman in Palmdale on Friday. America's newest nuclear stealth bomber comes after years of secret development. (Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press)Seven years after Northrop Grumman Corp. won the contract to build a new stealth bomber, the B-21 Raider was unveiled Friday evening in a dramatic ceremony at dusk.A giant silver sheet was hoisted off the aircraft as it was slowly towed out of its hangar at Northrop Grumman's Palmdale facility. The bomber has a flying-wing shape with a massive wingspan that measures nearly as wide as its hangar. Ceremony attendees, a group that included industry executives, U.S. Air Force officials and personnel and Northrop Grumman employees, could largely see only a front view of the plane.""The B-21 looks imposing but what's under the frame and space-age coating is even more impressive,"" Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III said during the roll-out ceremony. ""Fifty years of advances in low-observable tech has gone into this aircraft. The B-21's edge will last for decades to come.""The Air Force plans to buy at least 100 new stealth bombers by the mid-2030s for about $80 billion. Already, six B-21 bombers are in the final assembly and test process in Palmdale, Northrop Grumman said.Designed to fly long-range missions while evading radar detection, the plane is expected to make its first flight next year, and the Air Force plans to get its first few B-21 bombers by the mid-2020s.The assembly line represents a boost to Southern California's flagging aerospace industry, which has declined from the heights reached during World War II, the space race and the Cold War. In recent years, Southern California's aerospace resurgence has largely come from the commercial space sector, with the growth of Hawthorne-based SpaceX and various drone makers playing a large role.But the region's aircraft and defense contractor roots are still very much alive.""The U.S. military is still choosing to build these very big, complicated bombers and other weapon platforms,"" said Peter Westwick, a professor in USC's history department and author of ""Stealth: The Secret Contest to Invent Invisible Aircraft."" ""As long as the U.S. military wants to build those, a lot of the expertise for that still resides in Southern California.""Story continuesOnce seen as the region's lifeblood, the aerospace industry accounted for just 2% of Los Angeles County's total employment in 2019, according to a 2020 L.A. County Economic Development Corp. report. That year, more than 55,000 people were employed in aerospace and defense, a slight uptick compared with previous years.In the Antelope Valley, where defense contractors have advertised open jobs on billboards, Northrop Grumman is the largest private employer.Employment at Northrop Grumman’s Antelope Valley sites has soared to more than 7,000 workers, double the population in 2015 when the company first won the bomber contract.Antelope Valley is a major hub for aerospace activity. It’s home to the sprawling and secretive Air Force Plant 42, which houses facilities used by Lockheed Martin, Boeing and NASA, in addition to Northrop Grumman’s B-21 assembly line. About 16,000 people work at the complex, said Thomas Lynch, communication and public information officer for the city of Palmdale.""These are high-paying industry jobs, even if they’re not as numerous as they used to be,"" said Robert Kleinhenz, principal economist with Kleinhenz Economics and director of research at Cal State Long Beach's office of economic research. ""This is an important part of the economy. The fact that that activity is taking place here has huge spillover effects on the rest of the economy.”There's history at the plant. Northrop Grumman also built the B-2 stealth bomber there, and the company has leveraged that experience into the B-2's successor, the B-21. A few hundred people who worked on the B-2, as well as B-2 pilots, have contributed knowledge to the B-21 and conveyed to co-workers what that experience was like, said Doug Young, vice president and general manager of the company's strike division in the aeronautics systems sector.Young knows the B-2 well. He started working on the bomber for Northrop in 1985 and stayed with the program for 10 years.A lot has changed since the B-2 first rolled out. For one, stealth technology has improved, the company says, although it's understandably reluctant to offer details. The B-21 will also be more supportable and maintainable than its predecessor, a major point of emphasis for development given the high maintenance costs for the B-2.Northrop Grumman iterated on thousands of designs for the bomber and tested aspects digitally before building hardware, Chief Executive Kathy Warden told reporters shortly before the roll-out ceremony. This digital approach helped ""de-risk"" the test program, said Gen. Charles Brown Jr., Air Force chief of staff.Compared with the B-2, the B-21 will better adapt to and incorporate different payloads and capabilities, according to Northrop Grumman officials. That means the bomber could one day carry weapons that have yet to be invented, Austin said at the ceremony.“Twenty years ago, if you bought a computer, it was a really challenging thing to integrate a printer or a modem,"" Young said. ""These days, you just bring stuff home, and it's plug-and-play. Aircraft today are much more adaptable.""The manufacturing site itself has also changed. Once used only for B-2 work, Northrop Grumman's Palmdale facility now also produces the center fuselages for the F-35 fighter jet, the RQ-4 Global Hawk drone and the MQ-4C Triton drone.That variety is intended to keep and maintain the workforce, even after programs end.“In the past, in the Antelope Valley, programs were episodic,"" Young said. ""They would happen, and they would go away.""Although the program has relied on veteran aerospace workers and those from other manufacturing industries, a large portion of workers are in their first aerospace job or first job ever, said Tom Jones, Northrop Grumman Aeronautics System president.""This is the beginning of a multidecade franchise in the Antelope Valley,"" he said. ""The Northrop Grumman aeronautics workforce of the future is being created today through this program.”This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"
206,814140bf-a06b-3f94-9e62-6220fd2790c7,NOC,2022-12-02,Northrop Grumman's (NYSE:NOC) investors will be pleased with their decent 90% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northrop-grummans-nyse-noc-investors-130033394.html,1669986033,STORY,['NOC'],"[Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, long term Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) shareholders have enjoyed a 75% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 48% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 53% in the last year , including dividends .So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Northrop Grumman managed to grow its earnings per share at 21% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 12% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Northrop Grumman has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Northrop Grumman will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Northrop Grumman the TSR over the last 5 years was 90%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Northrop Grumman shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 53% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 14% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Northrop Grumman better, we need to consider many other factors.

The Air Force planned to buy at least 100 of the planes and begin to replace B-1 and B-2 bombers.Northrop beat out a team comprised of Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp when it won the 2015 contract to make the bomber alongside suppliers including engine maker Pratt &amp; Whitney, Collins Aerospace, GKN Aerospace, BAE Systems and Spirit Aerosystems.Northrop is calling the plane a sixth generation aircraft given its ability to connect to other aircraft and easily integrate future weapons into its systems architecture. It also features more durable stealth-enabling low observable surface material that will require less maintenance and keep operations costs and downtime to a minimum, Doug Young, sector vice president and general manager at Northrop Grumman Aeronautics Systems, told Reuters in an interview.The rollout at Northrop's Plant 42 in Palmdale will provide the first photographs of the new bomber. So far, only artist renderings have been published.Six of the planes, which is to have its first flight in mid-2023, are in various stages of assembly. More than 8,000 people from Northrop Grumman, industry partners and the Air Force work on the program today which consists of more than 400 suppliers in 40 states.

The time was when Adidas (ETR:ADSGN) stock would fall heavily if the German national soccer team ever made an early exit from the World Cup. Defeat at, say, the quarter-final stage (such as 1994 or 1998), would depress merchandise sales in the company's home market so much that it would affect the company's global numbers.No more. By 05:40 ET (10:40 GMT) in the morning after the German national side was eliminated at the group stage for the second World Cup running. Adidas stock opened with a resigned shrug, falling only 0.1% at the open, before eking out a gain of 0.3%.The main reason, of course, is that Adidas has outgrown its home market enormously in the last 20 years: even the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region, which includes Germany, only accounts for one-third of its global sales. That also means it has other, bigger problems to worry about these days, such as a consumer boycott in China and the implosion of a successful business partnership with rapper Kanye West.It's also possible that Germany's performances at major tournaments since 2014 have led to more realistic expectations at Adidas with regard to inventory management. It's the third time in a row that the team has failed to reach the quarter-final stage - an unprecedented fallow streak for the four-time world champions. And again, Adidas currently has much bigger inventory problems to worry about, as a surprise slowdown in consumer spending led to a 63% rise in unsold stock in its latest quarterly report.But the tournament is going badly for Adidas in other ways too. Rival Nike (NYSE:NKE) has a dominant role as official kit supplier among the other teams, having tournament favorites including Brazil, France, England, Portugal, and the Netherlands in its stable, as well as surprise successes Australia and the U.S.A. By contrast, two of Adidas' other big hopes - Belgium and Mexico - have already been knocked out alongside Germany. Its hopes now rest on Lionel Messi's Argentina, Alvaro Morata's Spain, and, ironically, Japan.Story continuesA victory for Nike in Qatar would be a bitter pill to swallow for Adidas, an evergreen sponsor of the FIFA World Cup. But for some, even that may not be the worst-case outcome. Puma (ETR:PUMG) still has a couple of horses in the race, albeit they're long shots: Switzerland, Senegal, Ghana, and Uruguay. Should any of those end up lifting the trophy, the embarrassment could be acute for Adidas' new CEO Bjørn Gulden, who only last month agreed to leave Puma for its bigger neighbor.Adidas and Puma were founded by two brothers, Adolf and Rudolf Dassler. Both companies still have their headquarters in the Bavarian town of Herzogenaurach.Related ArticlesAdidas shrugs as World Cup goes from bad to worse with German exitExclusive: Reckitt expects U.S. infant formula shortage until springGermany pledges $86 million to Ghana for 'critical sector' development]"

Home buyers got just that today, though, with mortgage rates falling yet again. Freddie Mac now says the average 30-year fixed sits at 6.49%. That's down from 6.58 one week ago. Rates have now seen the biggest three-week drop since 2008. The 30-year was north of 7 on November 10. Of course, this all depends upon your perspective. Rates were still more than double the 3.11 of one year ago.High mortgage rates have put potential buyers off of their searches. And it's impacting mortgage employees, as you might expect. Wells Fargo cutting hundreds of its mortgage workers today, according to Bloomberg. The bank has already let go of thousands of its employees this year. And it's not the only one. JPMorgan cut hundreds of home lending staff back in June. The cuts all an impact to the Fed's fight to tame inflation.And Seana, this is a lot like much of the layoffs we've seen even in the tech sector, to draw a parallel. They overhired during the pandemic because, of course, they had to. And now they're really trimming the fat from being bloated during COVID.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and that's very important to point out. I think the question here is how long it's going to take for the real estate market to correct and what this means for home prices because, yes, mortgage rates, they've come back a bit. They're still extremely high, especially compared to what we saw just a year ago, two years ago. Home prices have also remained high, still up 10% in the month of September from a year ago.So we need to see a little bit more of a correction there in order to see that demand really return to the market. Pantheon was out with a note earlier this week saying that they expect existing home prices to drop by about 20% from their June peak levels. Goldman was out. They revised their outlook for home prices from roughly flat next year to down 4%.Story continuesAnd we see affordability a massive issue. And that's affecting where people are buying, where people are looking. There was a Redfin report out saying that about a quarter of home buyers are now looking at places, metro areas that they wouldn't necessarily have considered in the past because they want to find somewhere that's affordable and somewhere that makes sense for their family. Now, given the high home prices and also just inflation, really, every aspect of their life has been getting more expensive.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, and basically every number has been negative. Pending home sales down about 5%. Existing home sales, I think, 6%. But, a big but here is the number you gave, 10% up over a year ago. And yes, I think they'll drop, and people I've talked to, another 3%, 4%, or 5% in the next year. But that still leaves you with a pretty healthy gain, unless, of course, you bought at the peak of the pandemic. But you're probably not selling your home if, in fact, that's the case. So I don't see that 20% correction ahead, but we shall see.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, because you locked in much lower rates.DAVE BRIGGS: Because rates, again, are falling pretty precipitously.]"

In addition to supporting the certification of trainees, the initiative includes entrepreneurship and small business development components with a focus on creating 130 potential new businesses. The National Urban League will work with Wells Fargo to build a pipeline of diverse appraisers from three metro cities - Atlanta, Charlotte, and Houston - through Urban League Entrepreneurship Centers. This effort will begin in early 2023.""Racial discrimination in the home appraisal industry is a significant barrier to economic equity,"" National Urban League President and CEO Marc H. Morial said. ""We're proud to partner with Wells Fargo on this innovative project to open the doors of opportunity and bring a much-needed new approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion that we hope will serve as inspiration to others in the field and beyond.""""We are delighted to continue working with the National Urban League to create more opportunities for underserved communities,"" said Kristy Fercho, who was recently named Wells Fargo Head of Diverse Segments, Representation, and Inclusion and continues to lead the Home Lending business. ""We're excited to mobilize the combined resources at Wells Fargo and the National Urban League to help address core barriers in appraiser certification and increase the number of diverse-owned appraisal businesses. This relationship will help to diversify the industry and improve customer confidence in home valuations.""The home appraisal industry has long suffered from a lack of diversity among real estate appraisers exemplified by a Bureau of Labor Statistics survey, which indicates 97 percent of appraisers are white. According to the Urban Institute, increased diversity in the appraiser profession may help address valuation bias for Black and Hispanic homeowners, which, in turn, can support more equitable homeownership outcomes.Story continuesNational Urban League will provide entrepreneurial training and support on business basics, including formation, business and financial management, and access to capital, to those trainees who are undergoing or have completed the certification process. The Urban League Entrepreneurship Centers will customize these programs for each trainee based on their experience, skill level, and interest.This collaborative effort between Wells Fargo and the National Urban League complements existing commitments by both organizations to help promote fair and equitable home appraisals and advance racial equity in homeownership.In 2021, the National Urban League partnered with Fannie Mae to seek applicants for their Appraiser Diversity Initiative Sponsorship Program, which focused on attracting new entrants to the appraisal field, facilitating the transition into the appraisal profession, and helping to foster diversity in the appraisal community.In May 2022, Wells Fargo identified 25 individuals to participate in the Appraisal Associate Program, a multi‑year commitment to hire and train individuals from underrepresented communities to become licensed residential appraisers (trainees were also successfully recruited for the program in 2016 and 2018). Ninety-two percent of the trainees are diverse.About National Urban LeagueThe National Urban League is a historic civil rights organization dedicated to economic empowerment in order to elevate the standard of living in historically underserved urban communities.

So this is proactive investment,"" he said on Thursday.Pfizer's revenue is expected to top $100 billion this year - more than double its pre-pandemic level - on the strength of sales of its COVID-19 vaccine and treatment, Paxlovid.But COVID-related sales are expected to drop sharply over the next few years, and Pfizer also faces the loss of patent protections for some big-selling medicines after 2025, such as cancer treatment Ibrance and arthritis drug Xeljanz.The sizeable investment and creation of jobs in Europe comes at a critical time for the region as companies struggle with soaring costs of energy, labour, raw materials and credit, fuelling worries over a recession.The crisis has hit energy-intensive industries, such as fertilisers and chemicals, particularly hard, prompting some to shift manufacturing to locations where cheap energy is abundant, such as the United States.Story continuesDrug manufacturers have also warned that energy costs risk undermining the recent push to boost generic medicines production in Europe to make the region more self-sufficient.NEW MEDICINESPfizer hopes to introduce as many as 19 new medicines over the next year and a half, including treatments for ulcerative colitis and migraines, as well as its vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).""Our portfolio is strong and requires an expansion of our network to accommodate these new products that will really make an impact,"" McDermott said.The new products produced at the plants will cover various therapeutic areas including rare diseases, inflammation and immunology, he said.The expansion in Ireland will add around 400 to 500 jobs and allow it to double the amount of drug substance it makes at the site, which produces material for complex biologic drugs and vaccines.In Belgium, Pfizer is expanding the Puurs site's capacity to finalize and bottle doses of drug substance. It is also expanding its packaging and cold storage capabilities there.The new projects will result in an additional 250 jobs at the Belgian plant, whose workforce has grown to 4,500 people from 2,800 before the pandemic.Pfizer has also been spending significantly to expand its manufacturing capacity in the United States. The New York-based drugmaker has announced plans to expand its Kalamazoo, Michigan, Rocky Mount, North Carolina, and McPherson, Kansas plants.It has also said it will spend close to $1 billion to boost its ability to produce gene therapies at sites in Massachusetts and North Carolina.

Shares have added about 6.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Pfizer due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Q3 Earnings &amp; Sales Beat; Ups 2022 GuidancePfizer’s third-quarter results were better than expected as it beat estimates for both earnings and sales.Pfizer reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $1.78, which significantly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.47 per share as well as our estimate of $1.45 per share. Earnings rose 40% year over year and 44% excluding currency impact.Revenues came in at $22.6 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.04 billion. Sales declined 6% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis, reflecting an operational decline of 2% and currency headwinds of 4%. More than half of Pfizer’s revenues comprised direct sales and alliance revenues from its partner, BioNTech for the COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty and revenues from Pfizer’s oral antiviral pill for COVID, Paxlovid.Excluding revenues from Pfizer/BioNTech’s Comirnaty and Paxlovid, sales rose 2% operationally. Higher sales of key brands like Eliquis and Vyndaqel/Vyndamax (globally) and improved Prevnar vaccine sales in the United States were partially offset by weaker sales of Xeljanz and Ibrance globally. Also, a difficult comparison to exceptionally strong growth in the prior-year quarter resulted in the decline.International revenues declined 43% to $8.79 billion. U.S. revenues rose 97% to $13.85 billion.Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&amp;A) expenses rose 23% (operationally) in the quarter to $3.24 billion due to increased spending for Paxlovid and Comirnaty and new products and higher health care reform fees. Adjusted R&amp;D expenses rose 2% to $2.69 billion due to costs related to oncology and non-COVID-19 vaccines program and costs to develop recently acquired programs.Story continuesSegment DiscussionBeginning in the third quarter of 2022, Pfizer started reporting its revenues under three broad sub-segments of its Biopharma operating segment, Primary Care, Specialty Care and Oncology. Sales in the Primary Care segment declined 1% operationally to $15.85 billion. The Specialty Care unit recorded sales of $3.4 billion, down 3%. Sales of Oncology rose 3% to $3.07 billion.Primary CareIn Primary Care, direct sales and alliance revenues from BioNTech for Comirnaty were $4.4 billion in the quarter, down 65% year over year. Comirnaty sales rose 83% in the United States due to deliveries of the newly authorized Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent booster and approval for primary vaccination of children 6 months to less than 5 years of age. Comirnaty sales declined 86% in outside U.S. markets due to a shift in scheduled deliveries to the fourth quarter as well as slower demand in emerging markets. Comirnaty sales were better than our estimate of $2.74 billion.Paxlovid contributed $7.5 billion to sales in the third quarter, compared with $8.1 billion in the second quarter, backed by launches in several countries in 2022. Paxlovid sales missed our estimate of $8.0 billion.Alliance revenues from Bristol-Myers for Eliquis and direct sales rose 15% to $1.46 billion. Continued increased adoption in oral anti-coagulant as well as non-valvular atrial fibrillation market share gains benefited alliance revenues from Bristol-Myers for Eliquis sales in the quarter.Global Prevnar family revenues rose 14% to $1.61 billion. The Prevnar family includes revenues from Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 (pediatric and adult) and Prevnar 20 (adult). Prevnar revenues were less than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84 billion.Prevnar sales rose 28% in the United States due to strong demand for Prevnar 20 for the eligible adult population, which offset the unfavorable timing of purchases (both government and private) of Prevnar 13 for the pediatric indication. Prevnar revenues declined 7% in international markets.Specialty CareRare disease drug, Vyndaqel/Vyndamax recorded sales of $602 million in the quarter, up 29% year over year driven by continued strong uptake in the United States and developed Europe, which was partially offset by a price decrease in Japan.  Vyndaqel/Vyndamax were better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $589 million.Xeljanz sales declined 14% to $502 million due to lower prescription volumes as doctors’ prescribing patterns shifted away from JAK inhibitors following label warnings.Enbrel revenues declined 8% to $230 million due to continued biosimilar competition in key European markets and Japan.OncologyIn Oncology, Ibrance revenues declined 3% year over year to $1.28 billion due to planned price decreases in some international developed markets and continued increase in the proportion of patients accessing Ibrance through the U.S. Patient Assistance Program.

The figure increased 9% year over year.Revenues were up 4.8% year over year to $3.19 billion, which matched the consensus mark.Affiliate fees (53.6% of revenues) rose 2.6% to $1.71 billion led by 6% growth at the Television segment. Meanwhile, advertising (38.2% of revenues) increased 8% to $1.22 billion, primarily due to higher political advertising revenues at the FOX Television Stations, continued strength in pricing across the company’s news and sports brands, and continued growth at TUBI.Other revenues (8.2% of revenues) increased 5.2% from the year-ago quarter’s levels to $261 million, primarily due to higher FOX Nation subscription revenues.Top-Line DetailsCable Network Programming (44.8% of revenues) revenues inched up 1.1% year over year to $1.43 billion. Advertising revenues increased 1.6%, primarily due to FOX News Media, where continued strength in linear pricing was partially offset by lower ratings and lower digital advertising revenues. In addition, advertising revenues associated with the national sports networks were lower in the quarter due to the absence of prior-year international soccer matches.Revenues from Affiliate fees increased 0.3% year over year, primarily due to contractual price increases, partially offset by the impact of net subscriber declines. Other revenues increased 8.9% on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to higher FOX Nation subscription revenues.Television (53.7% of revenues) revenues increased 8.4% from the year-ago quarter’s figure to $1.71 billion. Advertising revenues increased 10.5% year over year, primarily due to higher political advertising revenues at the FOX Television Stations, continued growth at TUBI and continued strength in pricing, partially offset by lower ratings, at the FOX Network. The FOX Network also benefitted from additional MLB broadcasts in the reported quarter.Affiliate fees increased 6% year over year, driven by increases in fees from third-party FOX affiliates and higher average rates, partially offset by the impact of net subscriber declines, at the company’s owned and operated television stations.Other revenues increased 5% year over year, primarily due to the impact of the consolidation of TMZ and entertainment production companies at FOX Entertainment.Story continuesOperating DetailsIn first-quarter fiscal 2023, operating expenses increased 5.4% year over year to $1.65 billion.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Marathon Petroleum Posts Better-Than-Expected Q3 EarningsIndependent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum reported adjusted earnings per share of $7.81, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.80 and compared with a profit of merely 73 cents per share in the year-ago period.The company’s bottom line was favorably impacted by the stronger-than-expected performance of its Refining &amp; Marketing segment. Operating income of the segment totaled $4.6 billion, ahead of its Zacks Consensus Estimate by 23.2%.Marathon Petroleum reported revenues of $47.2 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35.7 billion and improved 44.8% year over year.In October, the company completed its target to buy back $15 billion in common stock. This was after Marathon Petroleum concluded the sale of its Speedway business, comprising approximately 3,900 c-stores in 35 states to Japan-based retail group Seven &amp;i Holdings — the owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain — for $21 billion. Currently, MPC has remaining authorization of $5 billion with no expiration date.Inside MPC’s SegmentsRefining &amp; Marketing: The Refining &amp; Marketing segment reported an operating income of $4.6 billion, which soared from the year-ago profit of just $509 million. The jump primarily reflects higher year-over-year margins and throughputs.Specifically, the refining margin of $30.21 per barrel improved significantly from $14.51 a year ago. Total refined product sales volumes were 3,587 thousand barrels per day (mbpd), up from 3,539 mbpd in the year-ago quarter. Throughput rose from 2,836 mbpd in the year-ago quarter to 3,007 mbpd and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2,932 mbpd. Capacity utilization during the quarter was up from last year’s 93% to 98%.Midstream: This unit mainly reflects Marathon Petroleum’s general partner and majority limited partner interests in MPLX LP — a publicly traded master limited partnership that owns, operates, develops and acquires pipelines and other midstream assets.Segment profitability was $1.2 billion, 12.9% higher than in the third quarter of 2021. Earnings were supported by stable, fee-based revenues from MPLX’s wide range of midstream energy services.Story continuesCosts, Capex &amp; Balance SheetMarathon Petroleum reported expenses of $40.6 billion in third-quarter 2022, rising 29.7% from the year-ago quarter.In the reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $789 million on capital programs (56% on Refining &amp; Marketing and 34% on the Midstream segment) compared to $464 million in the year-ago period.

229,67ba8e03-2ae5-3d97-b16b-59921d7b662a,MPC,2022-12-02,U.S. Oil Prices Rise as EIA Confirms a Big Inventory Draw,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-oil-prices-rise-eia-132501730.html,1669901101,STORY,"['OXY', 'HO=F', 'CL=F', 'MPC', 'HES']","[U.S. oil prices moved up on Nov 30 after government data showed a large weekly draw in crude supplies. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures rose $2.35 (or 3%) to settle at $80.55 a barrel yesterday.Before going into the overall macro environment for oil, let's dig deep into the Energy Information Administration’s (""EIA"") Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the holiday-shortened week ending Nov 25.Analyzing the Latest EIA ReportCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell 12.6 million barrels compared to expectations of a 4.4 million-barrel decrease per the analysts surveyed by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. The combination of a surge in exports, lower imports and higher refinery demand accounted for the big stockpile draw with the world’s biggest oil consumer.Total domestic stocks now stand at 419.1 million barrels — 3.2% less than the year-ago figure and 8% lower than the five-year average.The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) fell 415,000 barrels to 24.3 million barrels.Meanwhile, the crude supply cover decreased from 26.8 days in the previous week to 25.7 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 27.9 days.Let’s turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies increased for the third time in as many weeks. The 2.8 million-barrel rise was primarily attributable to higher production and a slight pullback in demand. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would rise 600,000 barrels. At 213.8 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is a marginal 0.7% less than the year-earlier level and 4% below the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) also increased for the third week in succession. The 3.5 million-barrel gain reflected higher production and a fall in demand. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply build of some 800,000 barrels. Despite last week’s addition, current inventories — at 112.6 million barrels — are 9.1% below the year-ago level and 11% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at 95.2%, rose 1.3% from the prior week.Final WordEven as fears revolving around high inflation and slowing growth somewhat cloud the outlook for Oil/Energy, it has remained the best S&amp;P 500 sector this year. The space has generated a total return of more than 64% in 2022 against the S&amp;P 500’s loss of around 14%. Apart from a positive fundamental picture, the sector is enjoying support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity.Oil has pulled back from those lofty levels, with the conflict showing no sign of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC agreeing on a production curtailment means that the commodity has got enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.Consequently, three of the top four gainers of the S&amp;P 500 this year are all energy-related names: Occidental Petroleum OXY, Hess Corporation HES and Marathon Petroleum MPC.Occidental Petroleum: OXY is the top-performing S&amp;P 500 stock in 2022, with a gain of 139.7%. Occidental Petroleum beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 12.7%, on average.OXY has a projected earnings growth rate of 283.1% for this year. Occidental Petroleum is valued at around $62.8 billion.Hess Corporation: Hess shares have appreciated 94.4% so far in 2022. HES has a projected earnings growth rate of 229.7% for this year.Hess, with a market capitalization of $43.8 billion, enjoys a Zacks Growth Style Score of A. HES beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 8.1%.Marathon Petroleum: This stock is among the best performers on the S&amp;P 500 Index, with shares having appreciated 90.4% in 2022. MPC, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has a projected earnings growth rate of 949% for this year.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Marathon Petroleum beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters.

Shares have added about 11.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Molson Coors due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Molson Coors Q3 Earnings Miss Estimates, Sales BeatMolson Coors reported third-quarter 2022 results, wherein sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year. Meanwhile, earnings missed the consensus mark and declined year over year. The top line continued to benefit from a favorable sales mix and improved pricing trends across regions. However, consumer inflationary pressures, a strike at its Quebec brewery and the cycling of a solid shipment in the prior-year quarter hurt results.The company’s adjusted earnings of $1.32 per share declined 24.6% year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36.Net sales rose 4% to $2,935.2 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,858 million. On a constant-currency basis, net sales rose 7.9% due to positive pricing, and a favorable sales mix stemming from portfolio premiumization, offset by a decline in financial volumes.Quarterly DetailsNet sales per hectoliter increased 9.2% on a brand-volume basis, driven by strong net pricing, and a favorable sales mix from portfolio premiumization.Molson Coors’ worldwide brand volumes fell 2% to 22.1 million due to sluggishness in the America segment, owing to lower Canada shipments and continued impacts of the Québec labor strike. This was partly offset by higher EMEA &amp; APAC financial volumes on increased brand volumes in Western Europe.Financial volumes declined 0.2% to 22.8 million hectoliters due to a 1.5% decline in the Americas on soft industry performance and continued impacts of the Québec labor strike, and a 3.1% decrease in EMEA &amp; APAC due to the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and consumer inflationary pressures across Central and Eastern European countries. This was partially negated by growth in Western Europe.Underlying (non-GAAP) earnings before income taxes (EBT) declined 5% year over year to $364.6 million. On a constant-currency basis, EBT rose 0.5% year over year.Story continuesSegmental InformationMolson Coors operates under the following geographical segments.Americas: Net sales in the segment increased 6.8% to $2,376.6 million on a reported basis and 7.4% on a constant-currency basis due to favorable pricing and the positive sales mix, offset by a decline in financial volumes. Financial volumes declined 1% year over year on reduced Canada shipments due to the Québec labor strike, offset by a 1.4% increase in U.S. domestic shipments.Brand volume for the segment dropped 1.5% on a 0.9% fall in the United States, owing to softer industry performance and an 8.6% decline in Canada due to the Québec labor strike, offset by 3.5% growth in Latin America on gains in Mexico.Net sales per hectoliter, on a brand volume basis, rose 7.5% on a constant-currency basis due to a favorable sales mix and higher net pricing. Underlying EBT improved 7.5% and 10.5% on a reported and constant-currency basis, respectively, to $378.1 million. The increase can be attributed to higher pricing, lower depreciation expenses, favorable sales mix and lower MG&amp;A expenses, offset by cost inflation on materials, transportation and energy costs, and lower financial volume.EMEA &amp; APAC: The segment’s net sales (on a reported basis) declined 6.4% to $562.6 million but improved 9.6% on a constant-currency basis. Higher constant-currency sales resulted from financial volume growth, favorable pricing and a positive sales mix. Net sales per hectoliter (on a brand volume basis) for the segment advanced 14.3% on a constant-currency basis, resulting from a favorable sales mix, as well as higher pricing.The segment’s financial volumes rose 2% due to brand and factored volume growth in Western Europe, partly negated by consumer inflationary pressures across Central and Eastern Europe. Brand volume declined 3.1% due to volume declines resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and consumer inflationary pressures across Central and Eastern Europe, somewhat offset by brand volume growth across Western Europe.The segment’s underlying EBT declined 8.4% on a reported basis to $41.5 million and 38.9% constant-currency basis due to cost inflation, particularly in materials, transportation and energy costs, as well as higher MG&amp;A spending. However, higher financial volumes, favorable pricing and sales mix were offsetting.Other Financial UpdatesMolson Coors ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $525.2 million. At the end of third-quarter 2022, the company had a total debt of $6,587.7 million, resulting in net debt of $6,062.5 million.In the nine months ending Sep 30, 2022, the company provided $1,117.5 million in cash by operating activities, resulting in an underlying free cash flow of $597.4 million.In the first nine months of 2022, the company declared and paid out cash dividends of $1.14 per share, with the CAD equivalent totaling C$1.45 per share.

On Feb 17, 2022, the company approved a share-repurchase program to buy back up to an aggregate of $200 million worth of its Class B common stock till Mar 31, 2026.OutlookDespite the continued uncertainties related to the pandemic, as well as rising cost inflation, management retained the 2022 view. Net sales are projected to grow year over year in the mid-single digits on a constant-currency basis. Underlying EBT is likely to grow year over year in the high-single digits on a constant-currency basis. Management estimates achieving a net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio below 3.0X by 2022.Underlying depreciation and amortization are projected to be $700 million, plus or minus 5%, compared with the $750 million mentioned earlier.

This covers 525,000 EVs registered this year in the U.S.The remaining non-Tesla sales are divided across 46 other nameplates (AKA models), such as the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Hyundai Ioniq5, and Chevrolet Bolt EV, among others. S&amp;P says by 2025 the number of nameplates is expected to grow to 159 by 2025, suggesting more and more competition for Tesla.But despite the coming onslaught of new entrants, Tesla is still in a good spot given its huge lead and EV manufacturing scale.GARDEN CITY, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 15: A general view of a Tesla car charging station on September 15, 2022 in Garden City, New York, United States. Many families along with businesses are suffering the effects of inflation as the economy is dictating a change in spending habits. (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)""Before you feel too bad for Tesla, however, remember that the brand will continue to see unit sales grow, even as share declines,"" said Stephanie Brinley, S&amp;P Global Mobility associate director for AutoIntelligence, said in the report. ""The EV market in 2022 is a Tesla market, and it will continue to be, so long as its competitors are bound by production capacity.""S&amp;P Mobility analysts report that once other automakers scale up, much of the increased competition in the EV space will come in at the lower end of the market, the sub-$50K price range where Tesla does not really operate. This is reflected when looking at the luxury EV market, where S&amp;P data shows Tesla commands a larger 86% market share through the first nine months of the year (S&amp;P’s report does say what price level or criteria delineates the luxury market).That being said, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is on record as saying the company is actively developing a sub $30,000 vehicle to address the lower end of the market, as well as launching the Cybertruck next year to tackle the popular light pickup segment.While total EV market share has grown in the U.S. this year to 5.2% versus 2.8% a year ago, S&amp;P notes this figure has likely been held back by low volumes of EVs in the marketplace and supply chain constraints, which will likely improve over time.Story continues""Evaluating EV market performance requires looking through a lower-volume lens than with traditional ICE products,"" Brinley said. ""But growth prospects for EV products are strong, investment is massive and the regulatory environment in the U.S. and globally suggests that these are the solution for the future.""The biggest losers thus far in the overall EV transformation happening in the U.S. are the Japanese automakers, who have traditionally done very well in the U.S. S&amp;P data concludes that the top Tesla brand “conquests” are Toyota (15.3%), Honda (13.3%), with the top models being conquested by the Model Y being the Lexus RX, Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Honda Odyssey, Honda Accord. For the Model 3 the top conquests are the Honda Civic, Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V.Tesla brand conquests (credit: S&amp;P Global Mobility)—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

240,a0c63db6-8d24-3281-84fb-0aec6bd4d7f4,MKC,2022-12-02,3 Stocks to Watch That Recently Announced Dividend Hikes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-watch-recently-announced-140602394.html,1669903562,STORY,"['MKC', 'MRK', 'TNP-PF', 'MKC-V']","[Wall Street has lately bounced back from the blow it suffered during the first three quarters of the year. On Nov 30, investors’ sentiment got a further boost after Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted at scaling back the pace of interest rate hikes soon. This sent stocks on a rally.This might lead the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow to somehow manage ending the year in green. However, the crisis is far from over, as inflation is still at multi-year highs and far from the Fed’s target range of 2%. Although at a slower pace, the Fed will continue to hike interest rates over the next year.Interest Rate Hikes to ContinueInflation has lately shown signs of cooling off in the United States, which has been the Fed’s biggest concern since the beginning of the year. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.3% month over month in October and 7.7% from a year ago, after increasing 8.2% in the prior month.Market participants have since been optimistic about the Fed going slow on its aggressive rate-hike stance in the coming months. On Wednesday, they got further assurance after Powell said that the Fed might consider scaling back its interest rate hikes as soon as December.Although stocks rallied on the news, inflation is still at a multi-year high, and Powell cautioned that the crisis is far from over. So, interest rate hikes will continue, albeit at a slower pace.Powell warned that fight against inflation is not yet over and that important questions remain unanswered, including how far and how long interest rates will need to be hiked. Market players are worried about the high borrowing costs that could harm the economy and push it into recession as the Fed’s target of 2% is still a far cry.Undoubtedly, such a situation will affect the business climate and consequently the stock market performance.Also, COVID-19 cases are again on the rise in China, compelling the government to impose strict restrictions. Businesses are once again being shut down, and citizens have come out on the streets, getting involved in frequent clashes with the regime opposing the restrictions.Story continuesIn addition to all of these factors, the current geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine poses dangers to the global supply chain and is causing stock market volatility.Higher interest rates result in higher costs of borrowing. The likelihood of an economic downturn rises as a result of this. Both these are warnings for the markets, which have been volatile all year.Therefore, it makes sense for an astute investor to keep a watch on dividend-paying equities right now. This is because dividend stocks have a history of success and a solid business plan, which allows them to withstand market volatility.They not only provide a steady stream of revenues, but also fewer chances of frequent price movements. Moreover, dividend-paying firms have regularly outperformed non-dividend-paying stocks during periods of market turmoil. Three such companies are Merck &amp; Co., Inc. MRK, McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated MKC and Tsakos Energy Navigation Limited TNP.Merck &amp; Co., Inc. boasts more than six blockbuster drugs in its portfolio, with PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda, approved for several types of cancer. MRK made its biggest acquisition of Schering-Plough and sold off its Consumer Care business to Bayer.Other key acquisitions of Merck &amp; Co. include Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Rigontec, ArQule and Acceleron Pharma.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Safest Stocks To Invest In. The stock market outlook for 2023 is rather dismal as per the majority of Wall Street analysts. According to Deutsche Bank, global stocks are forecasted to plummet sharply by mid-2023 as a recession threatens to hit the United States. David Folkerts-Landau, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note: ""We see major stock markets plunging 25% from levels somewhat above today's when the US recession hits, but then recovering fully by year-end 2023, assuming the recession lasts only several quarters."" In the United States, analysts forecast the S&amp;P 500 to rally to 4,500 in the first half of 2023, then a selloff of more than 25% in the third quarter, before recovering back to 4,500 by the end of the year. In an effort to control the 40-year high inflation, the Federal Reserve will continue to raise rates, albeit at a slower pace than 2022, which will eventually tip the economy towards a full blown recession in 2023. While some money managers are predicting a recession, others believe that the global economy will be hit with stagflation instead, which is a period of high inflation and high unemployment. Whatever may be the fate of the US economy next year, it is important for investors to safeguard their money and construct a safe equity portfolio, consisting of defensive names like Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT). Our Methodology The following stocks are defensive, enjoy strong market visibility, display solid dividend profiles, and have a prominent history of surviving market downturns. This qualifies the following companies as safe investments in a volatile economic environment.

It offers a portfolio of approximately 500 beer brands, including Budweiser, Corona, and Stella Artois. For full-year 2022, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) expects its FY22 EBITDA to grow between 6%-8% and the revenue to trail ahead of EBITDA from a solid combination of volume and price. On November 28, JPMorgan analyst Jared Dinges upgraded Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) to Overweight from Underweight with a price target of $70, up from $45. The analyst sees ""scope for earnings outperformance"" and said the company's ""rapidly deleveraging balance sheet provides optionality."" Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD)’s transition to a ""higher-quality top-line growth story is well underway,"" the analyst told investors in a research note. He views AB InBev's valuation as attractive at present levels.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 14 hedge funds were long Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) at the end of Q3 2022, with collective stakes worth $740.2 million. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 9.2 million shares valued at approximately $419 million. Like Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) is one of the safest stocks to monitor. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Large Cap Growth Strategy has to say about Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“To make room for these new names and optimize the growth profile of the Strategy, we exited two additional positions during the quarter. We sold out of Anheuser-Busch InBev as we see too much work ahead for the world’s largest beer maker to re-ignite sales growth post COVID-19. While the company should benefit from a recovery in the on-premise channel, individual country complexities, the hedging of raw materials, and senior management turnover leave us more confident in the Strategy’s other reopening-related holdings.”11. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) is a London-based fast moving consumer goods company. It operates through Beauty &amp; Personal Care, Foods &amp; Refreshment, and Home Care segments. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) is one of the safest stocks to add to a portfolio.

Inspired by the growing demand for hygiene products, the Lifebuoy brand of soaps was launched to ‘make health infectious’. 128 years later the Lifebuoy brand continues as a leading soap brand – albeit without the coal tar-derived ingredients list. In fact, the market research firm Kantar ranked Lifebuoy as the global #3 most chosen FMCG brand in 2020, just below Coca-Cola (KO) and Colgate (CL) – an astonishing fact given the age of the brand. While the brand is largely absent from shelves here in the UK, it is a juggernaut in Asian markets, and is the #1 brand in India.There are two observations about the Lifebuoy story which tell us a lot about Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL), which is currently our largest holding in the Fund.The first is the enduring power of brands in the consumer goods market. According to Kantar’s list of most chosen brands, the top 20 global marques have an average age of 116 years, with over half being founded in the 19th century. Fashions come and go, but there is something special about low-cost consumable goods that advantages strong, time-worn brand names…” (Click here to view full text)10. Dollar Tree, Inc.

(NYSE:CHD) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:“Church &amp; Dwight is another classic “defensive” company – it sells cleaning products (Arm &amp; Hammer, OxiClean), toothache medication (Orajel), and condoms (Trojans). For those that fail to purchase Trojans, the company also offers pregnancy test kits (First Response). Joking aside, the company’s revenue has historically grown by GDP+ rates organically. Combined with thoughtful acquisitions, 10-year revenue growth has averaged +6.6%, which has translated to EPS growth of over +11% per year. The company has accomplished all this with ½ of the overall volatility of the stock market. The company reported Q4 2020 earnings on January 29th, beating both top (revenue +14% YoY) and bottom line measures (EPS $0.59 vs $0.51 expected). We view the shares as reasonably valued at 26x forward earnings given the high level of predictability of the company’s earnings and low financial leverage. Shares are down 0.5% year-to-date.”7.

However,NAVI’s top line faces a potential threat from limited servicing fee growth opportunities. Also, a rising interest rate environment, escalating costs and high debt levels are major headwinds.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s current-year earnings has been revised marginally downward in the past 30 days.In the past six months, shares of the company have gained 5.7% against the industry’s decline of 16.5%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Navient is an eminent portfolio holder of Private Education Loans and education loans insured or guaranteed under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). The specialized focus is advantageous to Navient, making it a leading student-loan company. The company is growing its in-school originations. In the long term, management expects the demand for refinancing loans to rebound once direct federal loan repayments begin and enhance its business prospects.Navient’s recurring business model also aids top-line growth. Notably, the company’s education loan portfolio generates significant cash flows. Projected annual cash flows from private education loans and FFELP loans are $0.8 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively, for 2023.The company’s business risk reduction and simplification efforts bode well. Navient transferred all its ED servicing contracts to Maximus in October 2021. With this move, Navient eliminated an operationally-risky business and amplified its focus on domains outside government student loan servicing. In 2022, Navient will provide transition services to Maximus and receive offsetting payments to cover associated costs.However, we remain cautious due to limited growth opportunities for Navient. Lost servicing revenues related to the sale of ED servicing contracts will affect its servicing revenues in the upcoming quarters. Also, if Navient fails to acquire new loans or expand or develop alternative sources of revenues to replace or enhance its declining revenues from the FFELP loan portfolio, its top line will be under pressure.Story continuesAs of Sep 30, 2022, the company held long-term borrowings worth $63.99 billion, along with cash and cash equivalents of only $1.36 billion. Given such a high debt burden and limited liquidity, Navient's capital deployment activities keep us apprehensive.NAVI aims to improve operating efficiency by taking cost-control initiatives by increasing automation, incorporating artificial intelligence and rationalizing the real-estate footprint. However, ongoing product and technology investments will escalate expenses. Also, a rise in litigation costs might affect the company’s bottom-line growth in the days to come.Lastly, the current rising interest-rate environment may put pressure on the net interest margin for Federal Education Loans and Consumer Lending segments. Relatively higher interest rates will lower Navient’s floor income, affecting margins, and reduce refinance loan origination volumes.Stocks to ConsiderA couple of better-ranked finance stocks are Hancock Whitney Corporation HWC and F.N.B. Corporation FNB. At present, HWC and FNB carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like CSX (NASDAQ:CSX). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. Check out our latest analysis for CSX How Fast Is CSX Growing?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. CSX managed to grow EPS by 11% per year, over three years. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. While CSX did well to grow revenue over the last year, EBIT margins were dampened at the same time. So it seems the future may hold further growth, especially if EBIT margins can remain steady.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of CSX's forecast profits?Are CSX Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$70b company like CSX. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Holding US$60m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.Story continuesDoes CSX Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of CSX is that it is growing profits. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for CSX   you should know about.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

Earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while sales beat the same.The company saw a modest rise in customer traffic and continued share gains in consumable and non-consumable product sales. That said, cost pressures and supply chain-related issues leading to greater-than-expected distribution and transportation costs were hurdles.Taking into account higher-than-expected gross margin pressures, sales mix, inventory shrink and damages, management is lowering its earnings per share (EPS) guidance for fiscal 2022. The company is narrowing its expectations for same-store sales growth guidance for fiscal 2022.Dollar General Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Dollar General Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseDollar General Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Dollar General Corporation Quote Let’s Delve DeeperThe quarterly earnings came in at $2.33 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.55. Nevertheless, the bottom line increased 12% from the prior-year quarter’s levels.Net sales of $9,464.9 million rose 11.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The upside can be attributed to positive sales contributions from new stores and gains from same-store sales. These were somewhat offset by the impact of store closures. The top line came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,434.8 million.Dollar General’s same-store sales rose 6.8% on the back of a rise in average transaction amount and modest growth in customer traffic. Same-store sales reflected growth in the consumables category, somewhat countered by a decline in the apparel, seasonal and home products categories.Based on categories, sales increased 14.3% year over year to $7,664.8 million for Consumables. Sales rose 3.2% to $942.8 million for Seasonal and 4.2% to $574.4 million for Home Products. However, the same declined 18.8% to $282.8 million in the Apparel category.The gross profit increased to $2,885.2 million from $2,619.4 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin contracted 27 basis points (bps) to 30.5%. The contraction in gross profit margin can be attributed to a rise in LIFO provision, a higher proportion of sales from the consumables category and higher distribution costs, markdowns, inventory shrink and damages. This was somewhat offset by increased inventory markups.SG&amp;A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, contracted 23 bps to 22.7% in the quarter. The operating profit jumped 10.5% to $735.5 million.Story continuesStore UpdateDuring the quarter under discussion, Dollar General opened 268 new stores, remodeled 485 stores and relocated 45 stores. The company anticipates carrying out 2,945 real estate projects, including 1,025 new store openings, 1,795 remodels and 125 store relocations in fiscal 2022.Other Financial DetailsDollar General ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $362.7 million, long-term obligations of $5,985.7 million and shareholders’ equity of $6,093.8 million.For fiscal 2022, the company anticipates capital expenditures of nearly $1.5 billion.During the quarter, Dollar General repurchased 2.3 million shares for $546 million. The company had $2.5 billion remaining under the authorization at the end of the quarter. The company expects to make share repurchases of $2.75 billion in fiscal 2022.On Nov 30, 2022, management announced a quarterly cash dividend of 55 cents per share, payable on or before Jan 17, 2023, to shareholders on record as of Jan 3, 2023.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOutlookDollar General expects net sales growth of about 11% — including an estimated benefit of approximately two percentage points from the 53rd week — for fiscal 2022. The company now foresees same-store sales growth toward the upper end of its earlier projected range of 4-4.5% for the fiscal year 2022. The company now expects EPS growth in the range of 7- 8% for the fiscal year 2022, compared with the earlier guidance of 12-14% growth. The view includes an estimated benefit of approximately four percentage points from the 53rd week.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the company expects same-store sales growth of 6- 7%.

The year started off with rising inflation around the world as economies recovered from COVID-19 shutdowns, and the stimulus packages announced by central banks fueled demand. To tackle the challenge of inflation, the central banks, including the US FED, embarked on a rate-hike cycle, which started the downturn in the equity markets across the globe. Higher interest rates cause stocks to decline.It is no secret that we are in the middle of a bear market as recession fears are on the rise.

(NYSE:LUMN) – Global fiber company Lumen was the top detractor in the quarter. In September, the company announced a new CEO, Kate Johnson, would take over for Jeff Storey. Johnson has a strong track record of delivering organic revenue growth, the primary area where Lumen has struggled. Johnson held previous roles at GE and Microsoft, where she most recently served as head of Microsoft US and doubled her division's revenue in only four years. Multiple checks through our network vouch for her and suggest this leadership change is a positive upgrade that will bring the discipline and focus on sales that Lumen has been missing. The market reacted negatively with concern over the potential for another dividend cut or strategy change. We are confident the stock price reaction is highly overblown versus any impact that a potential dividend cut would have on value per share. The stock now trades at 4.5x EBITDA, and we believe the best value accretive capital allocation move today is share repurchase. Shortly after quarter end, Lumen closed on the sale of part of its consumer business to Apollo, further improving its balance sheet and business mix.6. AT&amp;T Inc.

Currencies in Latin America rose 1.2%, outpacing the broader emerging market currencies index , which added 0.8%. The U.S. dollar index tumbled 1% after comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that U.S. rate hikes could be scaled back ""as soon as December"" and as an indicator tracked by the Fed showed inflation moderating. South Africa's rand dropped 2.3% against the dollar, weighing on the EM index. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa's future hung in the balance as his office said he was exploring options after a report found evidence he may have committed misconduct over a stash of cash stolen from his game farm. ""From a markets perspective, we believe that an early departure of President Ramaphosa will be perceived negatively by financial markets, given uncertainties about policy continuity that such an event would naturally bring,"" Barclays Bank strategists wrote in a note. ""Hence, against the uncertain political background over the next few weeks, we believe that markets are likely to remain volatile in the near term."" In Latin America, the Brazilian real dipped 0.2%, after rising for three straight sessions. Brazil's economic growth slowed more than expected in the third quarter as higher interest rates affected household spending, underscoring challenges facing President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva next year. The real has underperformed its regional peers in November, ending last month nearly flat compared to the 1% rise in the broader Latam index on fiscal policy concerns. Brazil's central bank intervened in the foreign exchange market on Thursday, selling $2 billion in the spot market with a repurchase agreement, it said in a statement on its website. Lula has also pushed back his first Cabinet announcements to next week, two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, dragging out key appointments that have kept financial markets on edge. Mexico's peso rose 0.6%. Central bank data showed remittances to Mexico reached a record-high of $5.360 billion in October. A survey showed Mexico's factory activity grew for a third straight month in November amid sales improvement, job creation. Meanwhile, a Reuters poll showed Colombia's inflation could have peaked in November. The peso currency was up 1.3%. Chile's peso gained 1.3%. Traders expect Chilean interest rate to remain at 11.25% in December even as recession looms in the top copper producer, with data showing a drop in the IMACEC economic activity index in October from the same month last year.

Precious metals, which were pressured by a sharp rise in rates this year, were the main beneficiaries of this rally.Spot gold fell 0.1% to $1,800.96 an ounce, but remained near three-month highs, while gold futures hovered near $1,814.70 an ounce- their strongest level in five months.Both instruments were set to add about 3% this week.Focus now turns to U.S. nonfarm payrolls data due later in the day, which is expected to show that the jobs market cooled slightly in November. But the sector has remained robust this year, with the Federal Reserve stating that it will seek more moderation in the space as it tightens policy.Any unexpected signs of strength in the jobs market gives the Fed enough impetus to keep raising interest rates- a scenario which is negative for markets.While Fed Chair Jerome Powell flagged slower interest rates in the coming months, he also warned that U.S. interest rates will likely peak at higher-than-expected levels due to stubborn inflation. This stifled some enthusiasm in risk-driven markets.But the prospect of smaller rate hikes offered much relief to markets battered by rising rates this year. Platinum and silver futures vastly outperformed gold this week, rising more than 6% each.Among industrial metals, copper prices fell slightly on Friday, but were also headed for a positive week on the back of growing hopes that major importer China will ease its anti-COVID policies.Copper futures fell 0.2% to $3.7865 a pound, but were set to end the week over 4% higher.Story continuesTwo major Chinese cities relaxed COVID-related curbs after an unprecedented wave of anti-government protests rocked the country this week. Demonstrations were directed against Beijing’s zero-COVID policy, which saw China maintain strict curbs on movement and activity over the past three years in order to contain COVID-19 cases.But the easing measures this week drove up expectations for a wider scaling back of anti-COVID measures, which could help spur an economic recovery.PMI data released earlier this week showed that economic conditions in China have deteriorated even further due to the zero-COVID policy.Related ArticlesGold steadies above $1,800 ahead of U.S. payrolls dataOil treads water amid speculation over OPEC cut, weekly gains on tapMexico, U.S. trade officials discuss energy, corn exports, environment]"

(NYSE:VZ) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 63% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Verizon Communications. See our latest analysis for Verizon Communications ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Verizon Communications?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Verizon Communications does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Verizon Communications, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Verizon Communications is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.3% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.6% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 3.9% of the company stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Verizon CommunicationsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Verizon Communications Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$29m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 37% stake in Verizon Communications. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Verizon Communications   you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

(""Glass Lewis""), a leading independent proxy advisory firm, has recommended that Aimco stockholders vote ""FOR"" Aimco’s three highly qualified director nominees, Jay Paul Leupp, Michael A. Stein and R. Dary Stone, on the WHITE proxy card in advance of the Company’s December 16, 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (""Annual Meeting"").In its report dated December 1, 2022, Glass Lewis stated1:""Based on our review and analysis, having evaluated the arguments made by L&amp;B, Aimco's responses, and other considerations, we do not believe there is a compelling case to warrant board change at this time, nor do we believe L&amp;B's nominees would be additive to the Aimco board. We find the Company's performance has been generally strong and its valuation broadly in-line with peers, particularly as of late. We believe current leadership deserves credit for the numerous actions it has taken related to Aimco's business, operations and corporate governance, which appear to have been the main drivers underlying Aimco's recent share price outperformance.""""Moreover, we don't consider either L&amp;B nominee to be particularly additive or the right fit for the Aimco board. And we would have serious misgivings about the board losing certain expertise and perspective that the incumbent directors possess under any of the alternative voting scenarios described above. Specifically, it appears both L&amp;B nominees have a similar skill set and are meant to fulfill the same purpose on the Aimco board, which would seem to be to primarily assist with investor communications and capital allocation.""Story continuesOn Aimco’s Performance:""In our view, Aimco's share price outperformance and the narrowing of its NAV trading discount to peers… have been driven primarily by the actions taken by the current board and management team since the spin-off, as well as Aimco's operational execution and financial results, which for the most part appear to have given investors reason to believe in the Company's strategy, performance and management.""""Thus, while we acknowledge Aimco's persistent discount to NAV, given that both developer and apartment REIT peers have also recently traded at significant discounts to NAV, this currently appears to be more of an industry-wide issue than an Aimco-specific problem, in our opinion.""""Given the timing of Aimco's valuation gap narrowing (which we acknowledge partially overlaps with L&amp;B's involvement and public campaign) and the consistency with which Aimco has recently traded with peers on a price-to-NAV basis, we do not believe recent trading activity can be attributed solely to investor ""hope"" stemming from the Dissident's campaign.""""Still, L&amp;B's narrative is largely refuted, in our view, by the fact that Aimco initially set out its strategy and objectives for investors more than a year ago, in October 2021, and has provided key updates for investors along the way, including in both February 2022 and June 2022, in addition to quarterly earnings releases.""On the Strength of Aimco’s Incumbent Directors:""Lastly, with respect to the incumbents who L&amp;B is opposing this year, we take note of Mr. Stein's accounting, executive, and business separation experience, as well as his role as chairman of the investment committee currently leading the board's review of options to further enhance value, and Mr. Stone's real estate development experience and role as chairman of the governance committee, where he has demonstrated a responsiveness to investor concern by enacting a number of governance improvements. In our view, the expertise and experience of the incumbent directors up for re-election this year remains crucial to Aimco's progress and forward plan.""""Based on our meeting with Mr. Leupp and other Aimco board members, we believe he and the board are committed to further enhancing Aimco's investor relations and communications. And the board appears well equipped to do so, in our view, given Mr. Leupp's experience and perspective.""""Although L&amp;B has called out Mr. Stone, as chairman of Aimco's governance committee, for not pressing for the immediate de-staggering of the board or other governance improvements earlier, the fact that he and the board have since shown responsiveness to investor feedback by adopting various governance reforms (as detailed above) suggests to us that Mr. Stone is more likely part of the solution than any ongoing problems on the Aimco board.""""We also find Aimco's investor relations and capital allocation – primary complaints of the Dissident and the areas where its nominees would presumably make their biggest contributions - to already be in capable hands and not nearly as lacking as L&amp;B has alleged, significantly undercutting the candidacies of L&amp;B's nominees, in our view.""On Land &amp; Buildings’ Nominees:""On the other hand, the first of L&amp;B's nominees, Ms. Applebaum, comes from a background in the steel industry, first as an analyst and then a director, with no relevant real estate or REIT experience. We also note she is a perennial L&amp;B nominee, having been nominated by the investor in three prior instances yet never elected by shareholders or otherwise appointed to those boards.""""While Mr. Sullivan's experience seems much more suited for Aimco, we consider it is also largely duplicative by virtue of Mr. Leupp's presence on the Aimco board, who has significant real estate and REIT experience from an investor perspective, as well as additional, current board experience at another public REIT. Given this would be Mr. Sullivan's first public company directorship (which is not a disqualifying factor on its own, in our view) and considering his perspective is largely replicated by Mr. Leupp and the Company's ongoing advisory relationship with Green Street, where Mr. Sullivan previously led the advisory practice, we see a reduced need for his perspective at this time.""Commenting on the Glass Lewis recommendation, Aimco issued the following statement:We are pleased that Glass Lewis supports the reelection of all three of Aimco’s highly qualified director nominees.Glass Lewis clearly recognizes that Aimco has the right Board and the right strategy to continue enhancing value for stockholders. Its recommendation reaffirms the Board’s unanimous conclusion that electing Land &amp; Buildings’ slate of dissident director nominees would not be additive and would remove expertise from the New Aimco Board that is critical to the Company’s success.We strongly urge stockholders to follow Glass Lewis’s recommendation and vote ""FOR"" the Company’s three highly qualified directors: Jay Paul Leupp, Michael A. Stein and R. Dary Stone on the WHITE proxy card.Aimco reminds stockholders that their vote is extremely important, no matter how many or how few shares they own. The Company strongly recommends that stockholders vote ""FOR"" the Company’s three highly qualified directors: Jay Paul Leupp, Michael A. Stein and R.

Supply-chain disruptions, raw material cost inflation, foreign currency headwinds and weakness in the Tools &amp; Outdoor segment have been weighing on the stock’s performance.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSupply-chain restrictions, primarily semiconductor constraints and logistics and input cost increases, are weighing on Stanley Black’s operations. Escalating cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses, pose a threat to the company’s bottom line. In the first nine months of 2022, cost of sales jumped 28.6% year over year while selling, general and administrative expenses climbed 15.6%.Reduced retail and consumer demand have been a drag on the Tools &amp; Outdoor segment’s performance. The segment is seeing lower volumes due to reduced consumer spending as a result of an increase in interest rates and spike in fuel prices. The company expects Tools &amp; Outdoor organic revenues to decline mid-to-high single digits in 2022.Stanley Black has operations in multiple nations. Such business diversifications expose it to risks stemming from unfavorable movements in foreign currencies, geopolitical issues and other headwinds. In third-quarter 2022, foreign currency translation had a negative impact of 4% on sales.Due to a volatile demand environment, especially softness in North American consumer and European markets, cost inflation and foreign currency headwinds, SWK has lowered its 2022 earnings forecast.

MCK, Cardinal Health, Inc. CAH, and Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI.Below is a chart illustrating the year-to-date performance of all three stocks, with the Zacks Oils and Energy sector blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs we can see, all three stocks have outperformed the sector by fair margins (especially SMCI), entirely shrugging off the general market’s woes. Let’s take a closer look at each one.Cardinal Health, Inc.Cardinal Health is a nationwide drug distributor and provider of services to pharmacies, healthcare providers, and manufacturers. The company has two reporting segments: Pharmaceutical and Medical.Undoubtedly a major positive, Cardinal Health belongs to the elite Dividend Aristocrat group; Dividend Aristocrats are classified as companies with at least 25 consecutive annual dividend increases.CAH’s annual dividend currently yields roughly 2.5%, above its Zacks Medical sector by a fair margin. In 2022, dividends have become a hot topic, helping shield investors.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company has a solid growth profile as well, with earnings forecasted to climb 4.2% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 14% in FY24.The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue upticks of 9% in FY23 and 7.3% in FY24.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcKesson Corp.

SMCI has a favorable revenue trend, as shown in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWhile the general market has struggled in 2022, the Zacks Oils and Energy sector has undoubtedly been the brightest spot, rewarding investors with considerable gains.Still, there are many stocks outside of the sector snapping the overall bearish trend, including McKesson Corp.

The collaboration will enable Henry Schein One to introduce Dentrix Detect AI (artificial intelligence), powered and manufactured by VideaHealth.The Dentrix Detect AI is an AI-enabled X-Ray analysis tool that integrates directly into Dentrix Practice Management Systems. The integration with VideaHealth’s FDA-cleared computer-assisted detection device will likely aid oral health professionals in harnessing the power of AI in dental practices.The latest tie-up and the subsequent launch are expected to significantly boost Henry Schein's technology and value-added services business on a global scale. It will also likely solidify the company’s foothold in the global dental practice management solutions space.Rationale Behind the Tie UpThe AI-enabled X-ray analysis tool, the Dentrix Detect AI, is expected to provide real-time clinical decision support to dentists. Its full integration into Dentrix allows it to work within existing Dentrix workflows and eliminates the need for dentists to import or export images to utilize AI analysis. As every image is automatically analyzed in the software, it will likely aid dentists in assessing radiographs and other images more quickly. Thus, dentists may be able to provide greater transparency to patients, thus making better treatment recommendations and improving case acceptance.Per Henry Schein’s management, Henry Schein One aims to focus on AI solutions that can add greater value to dental practices and patients. The tie-up with VideaHealth is expected to aid in helping dental professionals elevate the digitalization of patient care via AI.VideaHealth’s management feels that the seamless integration of its AI detection technology into the Dentrix software will allow dentists to begin using AI to make more accurate patient diagnoses.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Precedence Research, the global dental practice management software market size was estimated at $1.37 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to reach $4.67 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 14.6%. Factors like the expanding elderly population, growing awareness about oral health and increasing use of AI are likely to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the latest partnership is likely to provide a significant boost to Henry Schein’s business globally.Notable DevelopmentsLast month, Henry Schein reported its third-quarter 2022 results, where it registered solid bottom-line performance. It also witnessed robust global technology and value-added services sales, where its year-over-year growth was driven by strength in Henry Schein One. Management had noted that the technology &amp; value-added services businesses had good underlying sales growth and Henry Schein One’s solid domestic and international sales growth was driven by its Dentrix practice management software and Dentrix Ascend and Dentally cloud-based solutions.In October, Henry Schein’s JV with Internet Brands, Henry Schein One, and Smile Brands announced that Dentrix Ascend cloud-based practice management software from Henry Schein One would be adopted as the exclusive dental practice management system of Smile Brands and its affiliated dental practices.Price PerformanceShares of the company have gained 13.2% in the past year against the industry’s 8.1% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 15.1% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Henry Schein carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

Meanwhile, advertising (38.2% of revenues) increased 8% to $1.22 billion, primarily due to higher political advertising revenues at the FOX Television Stations, continued strength in pricing across the company’s news and sports brands, and continued growth at TUBI.Other revenues (8.2% of revenues) increased 5.2% from the year-ago quarter’s levels to $261 million, primarily due to higher FOX Nation subscription revenues.Top-Line DetailsCable Network Programming (44.8% of revenues) revenues inched up 1.1% year over year to $1.43 billion. Advertising revenues increased 1.6%, primarily due to FOX News Media, where continued strength in linear pricing was partially offset by lower ratings and lower digital advertising revenues. In addition, advertising revenues associated with the national sports networks were lower in the quarter due to the absence of prior-year international soccer matches.Revenues from Affiliate fees increased 0.3% year over year, primarily due to contractual price increases, partially offset by the impact of net subscriber declines. Other revenues increased 8.9% on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to higher FOX Nation subscription revenues.Television (53.7% of revenues) revenues increased 8.4% from the year-ago quarter’s figure to $1.71 billion. Advertising revenues increased 10.5% year over year, primarily due to higher political advertising revenues at the FOX Television Stations, continued growth at TUBI and continued strength in pricing, partially offset by lower ratings, at the FOX Network. The FOX Network also benefitted from additional MLB broadcasts in the reported quarter.Affiliate fees increased 6% year over year, driven by increases in fees from third-party FOX affiliates and higher average rates, partially offset by the impact of net subscriber declines, at the company’s owned and operated television stations.Other revenues increased 5% year over year, primarily due to the impact of the consolidation of TMZ and entertainment production companies at FOX Entertainment.Story continuesOperating DetailsIn first-quarter fiscal 2023, operating expenses increased 5.4% year over year to $1.65 billion.

288,0a145d6b-c516-3655-bbf6-65c256b41932,CHRW,2022-12-02,JinkoSolar and C.H. Robinson Worldwide have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jinkosolar-c-h-robinson-worldwide-121512317.html,1669896912,STORY,"['JKS', 'CHRW', 'TSLA', 'ALSN']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – December 1, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares JinkoSolar JKS as the Bull of the Day and C.H. Robinson Worldwide CHRW as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Tesla Inc. TSLA, CarParts.com PRTS and Allison Transmission Holdings ALSN.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:JinkoSolar is one of the largest solar panel manufacturers on the planet and it stands to benefit from the massive expansion of renewable and alternative energy in the U.S. and beyond. The solar giant's earnings outlook for next year has soared since its Q3 release in late October.JinkoSolar stock is trading well off its highs and its valuation levels are extremely enticing for a growth-focused company in a potentially game-changing industry. Plus, JKS stock soared above a key moving average on Wednesday.JinkoSolar Basics JinkoSolar makes various types of solar panels geared toward different aspects of the market. The company sells its offerings to residential customers for their roofs, as well as high-performance systems for localized industrial and commercial energy production. JKS also sells its photovoltaic (PV) panels to larger energy and electricity producers.JinkoSolar boasts that more than a million homes around the world have been fitted with JinkoSolar's PV panels. JKS has benefited from an internal push from the Chinese government to boost solar panel production in the country.JinkoSolar's vertically integrated manufacturing process helps it lower the costs of producing complicated, high-tech PV panels. JinkoSolar operates out of 14 global production bases in China, U.S., Malaysia, and Vietnam. Production outside of China is key as tension rise between the U.S. and the world's second-largest economy.Solar's Expansion &amp; UpsideThe nearby chart showcases JinkoSolar's impressive revenue growth. Yet all of this expansion is rather new. In fact, solar panels and solar energy didn't gain any real traction until the mid-2010s.Story continuesSolar is now a massive industry that's been spurred by a mixture of government forces and incentives, as well as public and private investment. The expansion of wind and solar helped renewables expand their share of the U.S. electricity generation mix from 10% in 2010—when it was mostly from hydroelectric—to 20% last year.Overall, solar accounts for roughly 3% of total U.S. electricity generation. Meanwhile, renewables only make up about 12% of total U.S. primary energy consumption, with solar making up just 12% of that slice of the pie.The mixture of rapid growth and massive upside is what makes the solar energy industry so intriguing. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that renewables will double their share of the U.S. electricity generation mix by 2050, with solar making up a large chunk of those gains. And alternative energy now accounts for 75% of the growth in overall global energy investment.Growth Outlook The Chinese solar firm's global module shipments doubled year-over-year in Q3. The company is also successfully boosting both its production efficiency and rolling our more efficient panels, which are both crucial to the long-term growth of the industry.JinkoSolar's profitability improved sequentially in Q3, with its gross margin up 100 basis points to 15.7%. Analysts raced to boost their FY23 estimates following its Q3 release, which is no easy task amid the current economic environment.Zacks estimates call for its revenue to skyrocket 84% in 2022 from $6.34 billion to $11.65 billion (on top of 19% growth last year). The firm is then projected to boost its sales by another 40% in FY23 all the way to $16.34 billion—a $10 billion expansion in just two years.JinkoSolar's adjusted earnings are projected to soar 116% in FY22 to hit $3.67 per share and then climb 68% higher in FY23. Plus, its consensus EPS estimate for 2023 has jumped 39% since its release to help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.Price Performance and Valuation JinkoSolar stock has climbed 105% in the past five years to lag its industry, with JKS up 175% over the past three years vs. the Zacks Solar industry's 160% climb. More recently, JKS has managed to jump 10% in 2022.Despite the showing in 2022, JinkoSolar stock has tumbled since the summer to trade around 33% below its highs. This pullback sets up a nice entry point. Plus, its current price target offers nearly 30% upside to Wednesday's closing price. And the stock jumped above its 50-day moving average on Wednesday after it soared during regular hours.JinkoSolar trades at just 7.7X forward 12-month earnings vs. the Zacks Solar industry's 44.1X average. This group of companies includes other standouts such as First Solar (FSLR) and Sunrun (RUN).Both First Solar and Sunrun are part of the solar PV space. First Solar trades at 37.1X forward earnings, while Sunrun trades at over 60X. These examples help highlight how much value JinkoSolar offers investors. JinkoSolar also trades well below the S&amp;P 500's 17.5X, as well as a 40% discount to its own five-year median.Bottom LineInvestors should be aware that the U.S. government and the Biden administration are trying to curb imports of Chinese solar panels as the country tries to boost its own production, which is microscopic by comparison. That said, JinkoSolar now makes panels in various parts of the world and sells them in China, Europe, and beyond. And the U.S. simply needs the panels as it tries to reach its self-imposed emissions goals.JinkoSolar's growth outlook is clearly impressive as the solar industry gains momentum in the U.S., China, Europe, and beyond. Solar accounts for only a tiny fraction of U.S. power generation right now, but its role is expected to soar in the coming decades.Investors might want to consider adding exposure to at least a few solar stocks. JinkoSolar offers investors the chance to do just that through its ADR shares which are trading at a big discount to their highs. Plus, JKS currently presents an excellent mixture of near-term and long-term growth, coupled with impressive value.As a note, I own JinkoSolar stock as part of Zacks newest trading service – Alternative Energy Innovators.Bear of the Day:C.H. Robinson Worldwide is one of the largest logistics platforms on the planet, and CHRW stock has outperformed the market over the last year.But C.H. Robinson reported disappointing Q3 2022 results in early November. The company’s earnings outlook has slipped since then and CHRW shares have now lagged the market over the past three months.The BasicsC.H. Robinson is one of the world's largest logistics platforms, with nearly $30 billion in freight under management. The company provides freight transportation and logistics, as well as outsource solutions, information services, and beyond to roughly 100,000 global customers.In general, the third-party logistics industry offers room for expansion in a globally-interconnected world, where streamlined shipping and transportation services are paramount. C.H. Robinson’s revenue climbed 6% in 2020 and 43% in 2021.Recent SetbacksThe firm was looking solid through the first half of 2022, but the slowing economy is finally catching up. “On our second quarter earnings call in late July, I talked about a deceleration in demand that we expected to see in the second half of 2022 in three large verticals for freight, including weakness in the retail market and further slowing in the housing market. We’re now seeing those expectations play out,” CEO Bob Biesterfeld said in prepared Q3 remarks in early November. C.H. Robinson’s third quarter revenue fell 4% as did its adjusted earnings. Both figures came in below Zacks estimates, with the logistics firm missing our EPS estimate by 17%. The company’s operating expenses climbed 12%. Plus, CHRW said it believes it is “entering a time of slower economic growth where freight markets will continue to cool from their peak.”Zacks estimates still call for its revenue to climb nearly 11% in 2022 to boost its adjusted earnings by 29%. These are rather impressive figures considering the big year it had in 2021. However, C.H. Robinson now faces economic headwinds and two strong years of growth to compare itself against.Analysts lowered their earnings outlook for both 2022 and 2023 to help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now. Zacks estimates call for its revenue to fall 14% YoY in 2023 and for its adjusted earnings to slide 28% to see it pull in less on both the top and bottom lines than it did in 2021.Bottom LineC.H. Robinson does pay a solid dividend and it is rolling out efforts to cut costs. That said, investors might want to stay away from CHRW shares until the market gains more clarity on the economic outlook for 2023.Additional content:Tesla (TSLA) Recalls 80K EVs in China, Revamps Model 3In two major distinct recalls, EV kingpin Tesla Inc. is recalling more than 80,000 EVs in China.The automaker decided to recall a total of 67,698 imported Model S and Model X vehicles produced between Sep 25, 2013 and Nov 21, 2020, according to China's State Administration for Market Regulation. The recall is due to a software issue that hinders the battery management system of the cars. The software on these vehicles will be upgraded free of cost.In the second recall, Tesla is recalling 2,736 imported Model 3 vehicles produced between Jan 12, 2019, and Nov 22, 2019, and 10,127 of the China-produced version of the car. The decision was arrived at due to malfunctioning seatbelts.Even though Tesla is still the undisputed leader in the EV space, recalls have been quite frequent. A few days ago, Tesla announced two recall plans. In the first incident, it recalled nearly 30,000 Model X cars in the United States over an issue of the faulty deployment of airbags. Tesla announced its decision to recall another 321,628 vehicles over a software issue that caused the tail lights on some cars to malfunction.The glitch may affect one or both tail lights on certain Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. Earlier in the month, the company recalled more than 40,000 Model S and Model X vehicles that ran the risk of experiencing a loss of power steering assist when driving on rough roads or after hitting a pothole. Recalls continue to hurt this auto giant amid its constant push for high-efficiency technology.In other news, it has been reported that Tesla is working on a new version of its Model 3 sedan that was originally launched in 2017. The Model 3, with a starting price under $47,000 in the United States, has been Tesla's smallest and most affordable vehicle and has remained a popular choice among buyers. The model has not received much of an overhaul, unlike Model S, TSLA's premium EV sedan that was launched last year.The EV magnate has recently come up with a redesign project codenamed Highland. Allegedly, the project has been planned to reduce cost as Tesla is contesting itself with other Model 3 contenders and legacy automakers amid an intensively competitive environment. In light of the situation, Tesla plans to do away with redundancies in the vehicle design and streamline the production process to not limit margins.To cut down production costs, under the project, the manufacturer will make the vehicle shell out of large cast pieces, reducing the number of components. The new model will have fewer interior components and a slightly redesigned exterior.The redesign for the Model 3 is based on the revamp of the Model S that added an airplane-style yoke instead of the conventional steering wheel and removed buttons and traditional air vents to have a minimalist interior. On similar lines, physical buttons will be eliminated as much as possible and there is a chance that the new model will have a yoke. The redesigned Model 3 may also have some powertrain performance adjustments.Per sources, production of the new model will begin at Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory in the third quarter of 2023 and is planned for Tesla's Fremont, CA, plant as well, although no definite date has been provided.From the beginning, the Model 3 had a radically simplified interior compared to other vehicles in its class. Tesla's approach has always been to avoid complexity in production. The recent development will ensure that EV owners keep Tesla in mind despite the tough competition.Shares of TSLA have lost 50.4% over a year compared with the industry's 51.8% decline.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksTSLA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here are some better-ranked players in the auto space – CarParts.com, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Allison Transmission Holdings carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Disney's debts will not fall on taxpayers of Florida.""The FT report added that the return of Bob Iger as CEO last month could help pave the way for a resolution on the law.The bill signed in spring this year by DeSantis eliminates special governing jurisdiction that allowed the company to operate Walt Disney World Resort as its own city.Disney had condemned Florida's LGBTQ legislation dubbed as ""don't say gay"" bill by critics, which bans classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity for children in kindergarten through third grade.Disney did not respond to a request for comment.

Disney's debts will not fall on taxpayers of Florida.""The FT report added that the return of Bob Iger as CEO last month could help pave the way for a resolution on the law.The bill signed in spring this year by DeSantis eliminates special governing jurisdiction that allowed the company to operate Walt Disney World Resort as its own city.Disney had condemned Florida's LGBTQ legislation dubbed as ""don't say gay"" bill by critics, which bans classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity for children in kindergarten through third grade.Disney did not respond to a request for comment.(Reporting by Akanksha Khushi and Jahnavi Nidumolu in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Rhea Binoy; Editing by Dhanya Ann Thoppil and Shailesh Kuber)]"

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Akamai Technologies'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Akamai Technologies How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Akamai Technologies is:12% = US$507m ÷ US$4.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.12 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Akamai Technologies' Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo start with, Akamai Technologies' ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 15%. This certainly adds some context to Akamai Technologies' moderate 20% net income growth seen over the past five years.As a next step, we compared Akamai Technologies' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 15%.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for AKAM? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Akamai Technologies Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Given that Akamai Technologies doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Akamai Technologies' performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate.

301,ce8270fc-cac7-3f79-8aa7-1ecdaff69de9,HP,2022-12-02,NuStar (NS) Stock Barely Moves Since Q3 Earnings Announcement,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nustar-ns-stock-barely-moves-142602216.html,1669904762,STORY,"['NS', 'HAL', 'DINO', 'HP']","[The stock of oil pipeline operator NuStar Energy L.P. NS has hardly moved since its third-quarter 2022 results were announced on Nov 3. The muted response, despite the overall robust results, could be attributed to the throughput and revenue misses in its ‘Storage’ segment.What Did NuStar’s Earnings Unveil?NuStar Energy reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per unit of 20 cents, which matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved from the year-ago income of 16 cents. The partnership’s bottom line was buoyed by the strong performance of its “Pipeline” segment.Moreover, NuStar Energy’s revenues of $413.2 million beat the consensus mark of $374 million and edged up 0.2% year over year. This was primarily on account of all-time high Permian volumes, which averaged 580,000 daily during the quarter.  NuStar recorded an operating income of $111.9 million, reversing the loss of $79.2 million in the last year’s corresponding quarter. This upside could be attributed to the presence of impairment losses in the year-ago quarter.Segment PerformancePipeline: Total quarterly throughput volumes were 1,895,538 barrels per day (Bbl/d), down 4% from the year-ago period. Throughput volumes from crude oil pipelines fell 2.9% to 1,335,336 Bbl/d, while throughput from refined product pipelines decreased to 560,202 Bbl/d from 599,423 Bbl/d.However, a record-breaking quarter from its Permian Crude System led to a 6.5% rise in the segment’s revenues to $209 million and surpassed the consensus mark of $207 million. Moreover, operating profit of $110.4 million surged 174.5% year over year in the absence of last year’s impairment loss.Storage: Throughput volumes fell to 439,239 Bbl/d from 462,094 Bbl/d in the prior-year quarter and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 480,578 Bbl/d. The unit’s quarterly revenues decreased 27.5% year over year to $78.4 and underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20.2% as storage terminal sales declined 33.5%.Story continuesHowever, the segment reported an operating income of $22.6 million, turning around the third-quarter 2021 loss of $91.9 million. The favorable comparison could be attributed to lower operating expenses and the absence of an impairment loss.Fuels Marketing: Product sales increased to $125.8 million from $108 million in the year-ago quarter. Notwithstanding a 9.7% uptick in the cost of goods, the segment recorded earnings of $8.5 million, which surged from $949,000 a year ago, primarily due to higher fuel margins.Cash Flow, &amp; DebtThird-quarter 2022 distributable cash flow available to limited partners was $93.5 million (providing 2.12X distribution coverage), higher than $92.1 million (2.10X) in the year-ago period. In addition to rising year over year, the coverage ratio, far in excess of 1, implies that the partnership is generating more than enough cash in the period to cover its distribution.As of Sep 30, the partnership’s long-term debt was $3.1 billion. NuStar continues to improve its debt-to-EBITDA ratio, after bringing it down below 3.80 in the third quarter.GuidanceNuStar expects to spend $105-$125 million on capital projects this year ($60 million on the Permian system), while maintenance expenditure is pegged between $30 million and $40 million. The partnership expects Permian Crude System volumes to exit 2022 at an average of 600,000 barrels per day – well above the record 580,000 achieved during the July-September period and 15% higher than last year.Net income and adjusted EBITA guidance are expected in the range of $193-$206 million and $700-$730 million, respectively. Finally, the partnership wants to focus on the identified areas of cost control to lessen the effect of inflation and strengthen the free cash flow position.Zacks Rank &amp; Energy PicksNuStar currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked players in the Oil/Gas sector are HF Sinclair DINO, Helmerich &amp; Payne HP and Halliburton HAL, each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), currently.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.HF Sinclair: HF Sinclair is valued at some $12.6 billion.

302,48b4b13d-0223-35d7-a463-e0783ef315b8,HP,2022-12-02,4 High Earnings Yield Picks in Focus as Fed Turns Less Hawkish,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-high-earnings-yield-picks-124312899.html,1669898592,STORY,"['URI', 'CNHI', 'HP', 'SLCA']","[Markets had been waiting with bated breath for Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at the Brookings Institution on Wednesday for cues related to the duration and extent of tightening of monetary policy. Powell’s speech didn’t push the hawkish ball forward. The Fed was seen tilting slight dovish as it indicated smaller interest rate increases ahead, which fueled a rally across major equity indices yesterday.Last month, the CPI signaled that inflation is rising but lesser than expected. And yesterday, Powell set the stage for a 50 basis-point (bp) rate hike at its December meeting instead of the 75 bps we’ve seen in each of the past four Fed meetings. Even though Powell stated that the central bank would scale back the pace of its rate hikes as soon as December, he still feels that the fight against inflation is hardly over.Powell said, “we have a long way to go in restoring price stability.” He cautioned that the contractionary monetary policy will continue for some time until real signs of progress emerge on inflation data. As such, while Powell is in no hurry to pivot toward lowering rates anytime soon, he is also not interested in the Fed dragging the economy into recession.While Powell’s comment provided a boost to markets yesterday, this relief rally is likely to be short term as inflation is far from over. A 50-bps hike in mid-December would raise the Fed Funds Target range to 4.25-4.50%. It remains to be seen where the Fed goes from there.Value Investing Should Still Be the Way ForwardUntil inflation remains high and key questions are left unanswered, including how long the Fed will stay on course with its rate hikes, economic uncertainty looms. Markets aren’t likely to meaningfully turn the corner anytime soon and volatility will persist.Investors should stay focused on value investing and ferret out fundamentally strong companies that are trading at a discount now. With economic reopening gaining traction, now is the time for them to flourish on beaten-down valuation. The value investing approach seeks to profit from investing in stocks that appear to be trading at a discount to their intrinsic values. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies.Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.Story continuesUnlock Your Portfolio Value With High Earnings Yield StocksOne interesting ratio that you can consider for picking attractively valued stocks is earnings yield. The ratio is the inverse of the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and is measured as (Annual Earnings per Share/Market Price) x 100. While comparing similar stocks, the one with higher earnings yield is more likely to provide better returns, with other factors remaining constant.Earnings Yield, in fact, has the edge over the popular P/E ratio as the former facilitates the comparison of the performance of a market index with the 10-year Treasury yield. When the yield of the market index is more than the 10-year Treasury yield, stocks can be considered undervalued in comparison to bonds and vice versa. In such a situation, for value investors, investing in the stock market may be a better option than the bond market.However, it is important to remember that T-bills are risk-free, while stock investments come with a caveat. It would be a good idea to add a risk premium to the Treasury yield while comparing it with the earnings yield of a stock or the overall market.CNH Industrial CNHI, Silica Holdings, Inc. SLCA, Helmerich &amp; Payne Inc. HP and United Rentals, Inc. URI are a few high earnings yield value picks that can fetch handsome rewards.Picking the Right WayWe have set Earnings Yield greater than 10% as our primary screening criterion but it alone cannot be used for picking stocks that have the potential of generating solid returns. So, we have added the following parameters to the screen:Estimated EPS growth for the next 12 months greater than or equal to the S&amp;P 500: This metric compares the 12-month forward EPS estimate with the 12-month actual EPS.Average Daily Volume (20 Day) greater than or equal to 100,000: High trading volume implies that a stock has adequate liquidity.Current Price greater than or equal to $5.Buy-Rated Stocks: Stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have been known to outperform peers in any type of market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.4 Stocks to BuyBelow we have highlighted four of the 106 stocks that made it through the screen:CNH Industrial: CNH Industrial is a leading equipment and services company engaged in the manufacture and sale of agricultural and construction equipment.Raven Industries and Sampierana buyouts are set to bolster the prospects of CNH Industrial's Agriculture and Construction segments, respectively.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Value Score of B.

""In fact, our pipeline is tremendous. The reason these aren't coming to market is because of all the volatility in the market.""Volatility has been heightened since the beginning of the pandemic by a large increase in electronic trading driven by algorithms, which has led to faster and larger volume spikes than were seen even five years ago, LSEG Group Chief Executive David Schwimmer said on Thursday.There are about 200 companies currently waiting to go public on the Nasdaq, which is below the range of 250-300 over the past few years, Nasdaq Inc CEO Adena Friedman said on Wednesday.The IPO market has gone ""on almost a pause"" as investors wait for clarity around the extent to which interest rates are going to rise, she said.""We are hopeful that the second half of '23 becomes an opportunity for companies to get out, but I would expect a quiet first half,"" she said.Story continuesIncreased scrutiny over the accounting practices of Chinese companies listing in the United States has been another factor in the slowdown in IPOs.Nasdaq postponed the IPOs of several small Chinese companies in October as it investigated short-lived rallies following the IPOs of such companies, while earlier in the year, five Chinese state-owned enterprises whose audits have been under scrutiny by U.S. regulators delisted from the NYSE.The NYSE's Martin said a potential deal between U.S. and Chinese authorities over allowing U.S. audits of China-based firms appeared promising.IPO proceeds at Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX) are on track to be at their lowest level in a decade, hurt by China's economic slowdown, a sweeping regulatory crackdown that has tightened scrutiny over companies' fundraising outside mainland China, and geopolitical tensions.There are around 100 companies in HKEX's pipeline, many of which are waiting for market sentiment to improve so that their valuations are higher when they come to market, HKEX Chairman Laura Cha told the Reuters NEXT conference on Wednesday.""I am quite confident that the IPO market activity will return very quickly in the new year,"" she said.(Reporting by John McCrank, Saeed Azhar, Lananh Nguyen, John Sinclair Foley, and Peter Thal Larsen in New York and Sumeet Chatterjee in Hong Kong; editing by Megan Davies and Deepa Babington)]"

Shares have added about 2.6% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Prudential due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Prudential Q3 Earnings Lag Estimates, Revenues Rise Y/YPrudential Financial's third-quarter 2022 operating net income of $2.13 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.6%. The bottom line decreased 43.6% year over year.Prudential Financial's results reflect higher expenses, poor performance of Prudential Global Investment Management (PGIM), U.S. Businesses and International businesses, offset by higher premiums.Behind the HeadlinesTotal revenues of $21.6 billion increased 10% year over year on higher premiums. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 69.4%. The figure was higher than our estimate of $12.8 billion.Total benefits and expenses of $20.6 billion were up 15.5% year over year for the quarter. The increase in expenses was mainly attributable to higher insurance and annuity benefits and interest expense. The figure was higher than our estimate of $11.6 billion.Quarterly Segment UpdatePGIM reported adjusted operating income of $219 million,  decreased 33% year over year. This decrease reflects lower asset management fees, due to a reduction in assets under management.U.S. Businesses’ adjusted operating income was $702 million, down 35.6% from the year-ago quarter. This decrease reflects lower net investment spread results, due to lower variable investment income, and lower net fee income. It was partially offset by favorable underwriting results.Assurance IQ incurred adjusted operating loss of $44 million, narrower than a loss of $55 million in the year-ago quarter. This lower loss reflects lower expenses, partially offset by lower revenues, due to less case referral income.International Businesses delivered adjusted operating income of $430 million, down 51.5% from the year-earlier period. This decrease reflects less favorable underwriting results and lower net investment spread results, due to lower variable investment income.Corporate and other operations incurred adjusted operating loss of $325 million, narrower than a loss of $460 million  a year ago. This lower loss reflects the absence of costs related to the early extinguishment of debt in the year-ago quarter, gains from the sales of certain home office properties, favorable foreign exchange rate impacts and higher income from pension and other employee benefit plans.Story continuesShare Repurchase UpdatePrudential returned capital worth $829 million in the quarter, including $375 million of share repurchases and $454 million of dividends.Dividends paid were $1.20 per share, representing a 5% yield on adjusted book value.Financial UpdateCash and cash equivalents of $20.1 billion at quarter-end increased 28.8% year over year. The figure was higher than our estimate of $12.4 billion.Debt balance totaled $20.7 billion as of Sep 30, 2022, up 6.8% from the 2021-end level.As of Sep 30, 2022, Prudential’s assets under management decreased 21.8% year over year to $1.350 trillion.Adjusted book value per common share — a measure of the company’s net worth — came in at $102.26 as of Sep 30, 2022, down 4.3% year over year.Operating return on average equity was 8.3% for the third quarter, contracting 620 basis points year over year.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.VGM ScoresAt this time, Prudential has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

URI recently unveiled an online rental catalog to provide companies with emissions level information for all equipment. This feature will help them choose the right equipment that supports their jobsite needs and sustainability goals with more precision.The catalog makes it easy to understand the environmental impact of different equipment options with four different categories - Zero Emissions, Low Emissions, Lower Diesel Emissions and Standard Emissions.Joli Gross, senior vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary of URI, stated, “With our new online catalog feature, we give customers the power to select equipment to create lower-emission worksites without compromising safety or productivity.”Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of the world’s largest equipment rental company fell 0.62% in the after-hours trading session on Nov 30. Nonetheless, the stock outperformed the Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry over the past three months. The uptrend will likely continue to push the company into investing in fleet, accretive acquisitions and robust market demand.Strategic Initiatives Driving GrowthAs the largest equipment rental company in the world, United Rentals enjoys strong brand recognition, which enables it to draw customers and build customer loyalty. The company offers approximately 4,000 classes of rental equipment for rent on an hourly, daily, weekly or monthly basis.

The company’s rental fleet is the largest and most comprehensive in the industry.Moreover, its commitment to building “a better future together” with the reduction of the carbon footprint of equipment used on construction and industrial worksites is commendable. Reducing emissions from its non-rental fleet is one of URI’s top priorities. The recent move is likely to have added benefits to its equipment rental business.Apart from this, United Rentals is expanding its geographic borders and product portfolio through acquisitions and joint ventures.During third-quarter 2022, its earnings and revenues increased 40.9% and 17.5% year over year, respectively.

311,48b4b13d-0223-35d7-a463-e0783ef315b8,URI,2022-12-02,4 High Earnings Yield Picks in Focus as Fed Turns Less Hawkish,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-high-earnings-yield-picks-124312899.html,1669898592,STORY,"['URI', 'CNHI', 'HP', 'SLCA']","[Markets had been waiting with bated breath for Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at the Brookings Institution on Wednesday for cues related to the duration and extent of tightening of monetary policy. Powell’s speech didn’t push the hawkish ball forward. The Fed was seen tilting slight dovish as it indicated smaller interest rate increases ahead, which fueled a rally across major equity indices yesterday.Last month, the CPI signaled that inflation is rising but lesser than expected. And yesterday, Powell set the stage for a 50 basis-point (bp) rate hike at its December meeting instead of the 75 bps we’ve seen in each of the past four Fed meetings. Even though Powell stated that the central bank would scale back the pace of its rate hikes as soon as December, he still feels that the fight against inflation is hardly over.Powell said, “we have a long way to go in restoring price stability.” He cautioned that the contractionary monetary policy will continue for some time until real signs of progress emerge on inflation data. As such, while Powell is in no hurry to pivot toward lowering rates anytime soon, he is also not interested in the Fed dragging the economy into recession.While Powell’s comment provided a boost to markets yesterday, this relief rally is likely to be short term as inflation is far from over. A 50-bps hike in mid-December would raise the Fed Funds Target range to 4.25-4.50%. It remains to be seen where the Fed goes from there.Value Investing Should Still Be the Way ForwardUntil inflation remains high and key questions are left unanswered, including how long the Fed will stay on course with its rate hikes, economic uncertainty looms. Markets aren’t likely to meaningfully turn the corner anytime soon and volatility will persist.Investors should stay focused on value investing and ferret out fundamentally strong companies that are trading at a discount now. With economic reopening gaining traction, now is the time for them to flourish on beaten-down valuation. The value investing approach seeks to profit from investing in stocks that appear to be trading at a discount to their intrinsic values. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies.Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.Story continuesUnlock Your Portfolio Value With High Earnings Yield StocksOne interesting ratio that you can consider for picking attractively valued stocks is earnings yield. The ratio is the inverse of the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and is measured as (Annual Earnings per Share/Market Price) x 100. While comparing similar stocks, the one with higher earnings yield is more likely to provide better returns, with other factors remaining constant.Earnings Yield, in fact, has the edge over the popular P/E ratio as the former facilitates the comparison of the performance of a market index with the 10-year Treasury yield. When the yield of the market index is more than the 10-year Treasury yield, stocks can be considered undervalued in comparison to bonds and vice versa. In such a situation, for value investors, investing in the stock market may be a better option than the bond market.However, it is important to remember that T-bills are risk-free, while stock investments come with a caveat. It would be a good idea to add a risk premium to the Treasury yield while comparing it with the earnings yield of a stock or the overall market.CNH Industrial CNHI, Silica Holdings, Inc. SLCA, Helmerich &amp; Payne Inc. HP and United Rentals, Inc. URI are a few high earnings yield value picks that can fetch handsome rewards.Picking the Right WayWe have set Earnings Yield greater than 10% as our primary screening criterion but it alone cannot be used for picking stocks that have the potential of generating solid returns. So, we have added the following parameters to the screen:Estimated EPS growth for the next 12 months greater than or equal to the S&amp;P 500: This metric compares the 12-month forward EPS estimate with the 12-month actual EPS.Average Daily Volume (20 Day) greater than or equal to 100,000: High trading volume implies that a stock has adequate liquidity.Current Price greater than or equal to $5.Buy-Rated Stocks: Stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have been known to outperform peers in any type of market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.4 Stocks to BuyBelow we have highlighted four of the 106 stocks that made it through the screen:CNH Industrial: CNH Industrial is a leading equipment and services company engaged in the manufacture and sale of agricultural and construction equipment.Raven Industries and Sampierana buyouts are set to bolster the prospects of CNH Industrial's Agriculture and Construction segments, respectively.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Value Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CNHI’s 2022 earnings suggests year-over-year growth 9%. The company surpassed estimates in each of the four trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 18.8%.Silica Holdings: Silica Holdings makes and markets commercial silica, a specialized mineral, to a variety of attractive end markets in the United States. U.S. Silica should gain from its expansion actions in the Permian Basin. The Sandbox and EP Minerals buyouts are also expected to make a meaningful contribution.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of A.

Jay Powell’s speech on Wednesday helped confirm the Fed’s plan to raise rates by 0.50% and not the 0.75% it had rolled out recently. The speech caused markets to rally, with the Nasdaq up 4.4% and Oracle closing up roughly 3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith ORCL showing it can hold on to gains after rallies, investors may want to consider buying the stock. ORCL stock could be poised to move higher and has recovered most of its losses earlier in the year.ORCL is only down -3% in 2022 to outperform the S&amp;P 500’s -15% and the Nasdaq’s -27%. ORCL has also outperformed its peer group’s -28% that includes Salesforce CRM and Adobe ADBE. Over the last five years, ORCL’s total return is +86% to beat the broader market and its peer group’s +33%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOutlook &amp; Valuation ORCL has rallied 37% from its September low of $60.78 a share after slightly missing its fiscal Q1 earnings expectations. Even better, earnings estimate revisions have begun to rise as the company adjusts to the tougher economic and operating environment.ORCL earnings are now expected to rise 1% in its fiscal 2023 and pop 11% in FY24 at $5.55 per share. Its sales are projected to climb 17% in FY23 and another 7% in FY24 to $52.97 billion. FY24 projections would represent 34% sales growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $39.50 billion.Story continuesTurning to valuation, ORCL trades at 20.2X earnings. This is below the industry average of 26X. Even better ORCL trades nicely below its decade-long high of 25.3X and closer to the median of 15.9X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineOracle currently lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in correlation with rising earnings estimates for FY23 and FY24. As tech stocks look to regain momentum ORCL’s valuation could continue to support a sustained rally with the stock still trading attractive relative to its past. ORCL also offers investors a modest 1.54% annual dividend yield and the average Zacks Price Target still suggests 5% upside from current levels.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Oracle is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ORCL in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.19 per share for ORCL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.17 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ORCL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.48% heading into earnings season.Oracle Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseOracle Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseOracle Corporation price-eps-surprise | Oracle Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that ORCL has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Oracle, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have added about 5.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Public Storage due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Public Storage Q3 FFO &amp; Revenues Top Estimates, View UpPublic Storage's third-quarter 2022 core FFO per share of $4.13 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.05. The figure also increased 20.8% year over year.Quarterly revenues of $1.09 billion exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07 billion. Moreover, revenues increased 21.6% year over year.Results reflect better-than-anticipated top-line growth alongside an improvement in the realized annual rent per occupied square foot. The company also benefited from its expansion efforts through acquisitions, developments and extensions. It raised its guidance for 2022 FFO per share. After PSB’s merger with Blackstone on Jul 20, 2022, PSA received a total of $2.7 billion of cash proceeds from the sale of its equity investment in PSB. The transaction resulted in a gain of $2.1 billion.Behind the HeadlinesPublic Storage’s same-store revenues increased 14.7% year over year to $822.5 million in the third quarter, highlighting the higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot, partially offset by a decline in occupancy. This REIT experienced a 17.2% increase in the realized annual rental income per occupied square foot to $22.52. However, the weighted-average square foot occupancy of 94.5% was down 2.4% year over year.The same-store cost of operations increased 7.7% year over year, mainly reflecting a rise in property tax expense, marketing expense, other direct property costs and centralized management costs.Consequently, PSA’s same-store net operating income (NOI) increased 17% to $632.6 million. Also, this REIT’s NOI growth from non-same-store facilities was $56.5 million due to the facilities acquired in 2021 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.Public Storage achieved an 80.3% same-store direct NOI margin in the quarter, reflecting an increase of 1.6% year over year.Story continuesPortfolio ActivityIn the September quarter, Public Storage acquired 24 self-storage facilities comprising 1.7 million net rentable square feet of area for $250.6 million. Following Sep 30, 2022, the company acquired or was under contract to buy 33 self-storage facilities spanning 1.7 million net rentable square feet of space across six states for $262.6 million.In the third quarter, this REIT opened five newly developed facilities and completed several expansion projects with 0.5 million net rentable square feet costing $69.7 million.As of Sep 30, 2022, PSA had several facilities in development (2.1 million net rentable square feet) with an estimated cost of $421 million and several expansion projects (3.0 million net rentable square feet) worth $590.9 million. It expects to incur the remaining $605.5 million of development costs related to these projects, mainly over the next 18 to 24 months.Balance Sheet PositionPublic Storage exited third-quarter 2022 with $883.8 million of cash and equivalents, down from $1.01 billion as of Jun 30, 2022.2022 Guidance UpPublic Storage increased its guidance for 2022 core FFO per share after including the impact of the sale of its investment in PSB.It now projects the same in the range of $15.35-$15.75, up from the prior guidance of $15.00-$15.70.The company’s full-year assumption is backed by 13.5-15% growth in same-store revenues, a 6% to 8% rise in same-store expenses and a 15.4% to 18.0% expansion in same-store NOI. Further, the company expects $800 million in acquisitions and $250 million in development openings.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.VGM ScoresCurrently, Public Storage has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a B. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Public Storage has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerPublic Storage belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry. Another stock from the same industry, Highwoods Properties (HIW), has gained 6.5% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended September 2022.Highwoods Properties reported revenues of $207 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.9%. EPS of $0.36 for the same period compares with $0.96 a year ago.Highwoods Properties is expected to post earnings of $0.97 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.6%.Highwoods Properties has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) based on the overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions.

Well, this is actually one of the first concepts-- this is the first test by McDonald's in Fort Worth, Texas. Now, what's a little bit different here is the order ahead component of this new test restaurant design, and the order ahead technology allows customers to order on the app and then flag the restaurant team when that customer is approaching the restaurant, so then they can prepare that order.But other parts of this new test restaurant design include kiosks, which already exists in many McDonald's restaurants, pick up shelfs for orders, curbside order pickup, parking spaces for delivery drivers, and inside the restaurant, you're also going to see food and beverage [INAUDIBLE]-- conveyors that is, and a new kitchen format. Now, the name of the game here, and the focus, is speed and accuracy. Now, in the release, they said the franchise operating-- the franchise operate owner who is behind this test really said that he's hoping that the restaurant team is able to deliver big and faster, and that the restaurant team can fulfill orders with more ease.Now, you guys know that McDonald's has been really trying to bring about their Accelerating the Arches campaign for the past few years. That is developed on maximizing marketing. They're developing the core menu, so we've seen them sort of revisit those core menu items a lot over the past year without introducing new things. But really, the triple D's here-- Delivery, Drive-through, and Digital-- they're continuously looking to up the ante there.- Three D's-- I like that. It's also going to be interesting whether or not this helps kind of alleviate some of the pressures that fast food companies like McDonald's, so many of its competitors, have had with trouble attracting workers. There's been worker shortages, which has been affecting the output of so many of these fast food companies. So you would think the integration of more technology will help them a little bit with this.Story continuesNothing here that was too revolutionary, though. It makes a lot of sense. I'm surprised it's taken McDonald's until now to implement some of these changes. I don't know. We'll see.BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah- It's like turning around a tanker. It's awfully big. You know, it's hard to make changes on the fly when your McDonald's.Stocks up about 1.8% on the year. Good to see you, Brooke. Thank you.]"

The move comes as part of the company’s acquisition-driven growth strategy.Located at 629 Henry Street, this property comprises one industrial distribution building containing roughly 23,000 square feet on 1.8 acres. It is 100% leased on a short-term basis.The property’s advantageous location — adjacent to the Newark Liberty International Airport and Exit 13A of the New Jersey Turnpike — is likely to lure tenants. The estimated stabilized cap rate is 5.4%.Amid an e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies making efforts to improve supply-chain efficiencies, demand for industrial real estate space has been shooting up. TRNO is banking on such opportunities and is focused on expanding its portfolio through acquisitions.Further, the company is targeting functional assets at in-fill locations. Such assets enjoy high-population densities and are located near high-volume distribution points.With such expansion efforts, Terreno Realty is well-poised to enhance its portfolio in six major coastal U.S. markets — Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Miami and Washington, DC. These markets display solid demographic trends and witness healthy demand for industrial real estate.Since the beginning of the year through Oct 6, 2022, Terreno Realty acquired 16 properties comprising 14 buildings containing roughly 766,000 square feet and ten improved land parcels of around 32.9 acres. The total purchase price was $355.4 million.Moreover, in recent months, Terreno Realty shelled out $17 million to purchase an industrial property in Los Angeles, CA. Also, TRNO acquired an industrial property in Miami, FL, for $4.7 million.Apart from the fast adoption of e-commerce, industrial real estate space is poised to gain traction over the long run from a likely rise in the inventory levels of companies as a precaution for any supply-chain disruption. This will offer opportunities to industrial landlords, including TRNO, Prologis PLD and Rexford Industrial Realty REXR, to enjoy a favorable market environment.Shares of Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Terreno Realty have climbed 10.6% quarter to date compared with the industry’s increase of 6.1%.

In a new survey (available on demand) ""The UK data management costs and opportunities index, 2022 edition"" from Seagate Technology (NASDAQ: STX), British businesses are spending an average of £213,000 per year just on storing and managing their own data. The survey reveals companies are prioritising spending on data over energy costs, as well as employee welfare and training. The findings, which come during today’s global macro-economic crisis, highlight the urgent need for businesses to rein in their data costs.According to the 2022 Global DataSphere forecast report by IDC, 211 zettabytes of data will be generated globally in 2026. This is translating into budget headaches for British businesses. Seagate’s survey, which polled senior IT decision-makers at companies with more than 1,000 employees, reveals UK businesses are spending up to one third of their IT budgets on data storage and management alone. Over half (52%) of those surveyed describe this level of spending as ‘unsustainable.’In addition to the financial strain these rising costs will place upon companies, UK innovation is also at stake. Digital innovation is essential to the success of businesses – unlocking that requires the ability to access and put to work all data available within an organisation. In the recent Multicloud Maturity report from Seagate we have seen that companies with a high level of maturity in storing and managing data in a multicloud bring new solutions to market 6 times faster than competitors with a lower level of maturity.The vast majority of IT decision-makers (90%) are concerned about the rising costs, but what’s more, the majority (51%) believe that their management does not always realise the scale of the problem. Nearly two thirds (64%) of those surveyed believe that the way data storage and management is currently priced discourages innovation.Story continuesSeagate Lyve Cloud UK ExpansionThe survey was commissioned by Seagate as company expands its Lyve Cloud storage-as-a-service to the UK. Seagate’s S3-compatible cloud storage offers customers a simple, trusted, and cost-efficient way to unlock the value of their massive unstructured datasets, helping to drive innovation.Lyve Cloud reduces storage infrastructure cost and complexity which are preventing organizations from making full use of their data. By leveraging Lyve Cloud in scenarios such as data analytics, data repository for content collaboration, and backup/disaster recovery, organizations can break data silos, get insights from their data and reduce dramatically their total cost of ownership.""UK Businesses are using and storing data at unprecedented levels and Seagate Lyve Cloud equips them with true multi-cloud flexibility, world-class security, and long-term cost predictability,"" said Ravi Naik, Seagate’s executive vice president of storage services and CIO. ""Companies that minimize data costs and maximize data innovation, win. Lyve Cloud empowers businesses to manage and transfer mass data easily, rapidly and securely across various storage environments unlocking significant savings and accelerating digital transformation and innovation.""Launched in the United States in 2021, Seagate Lyve Cloud now has over 50 companies in its ecosystem network. UK customers include Twickenham Studios, Ovation, and PXGeo, which collaborate with Seagate to help businesses take full advantage of their cloud infrastructure.""Our clients’ main pain points involve efficient data management in the multicloud. They need to access their data quickly, and also gain knowledge from this data in a cost-effective way. Lyve Cloud has all the features that we need: security, reliability, and of course, no lock-ins,"" explained Mark Bashforth, CEO at Ovation Data. ""Getting up and running within Lyve Cloud took only a matter of hours and it complements our existing systems. Cost is on every business leader’s mind, so having a clear line-of-sight appealed to us and we’re excited to be one of Seagate’s first customers in the UK.""In this challenging economic environment, UK businesses now have another cost to worry about -- the unsustainable cost of data management. Companies need to optimise spending but also face the explosion of data costs -- enterprises have experienced 30% growth in data-management spending over the past year, with over half of businesses believing it will be unsustainable in 3 years, according to the Seagate study. More efficient data management is essential to cost savings, innovation, and, ultimately, winning.For more information on how to solve your cloud infrastructure challenges with Seagate Lyve Cloud and to know more about the recent use cases, please visit: https://www.seagate.com/services/cloud/storage/Notes to editorsIn partnership with third-party research vendor Vitreous World, Seagate Technology fielded a 9-question survey among 502 UK IT decision-makers in businesses with more than 1,000 employees, from 6th -13th October 2022.About SeagateSeagate Technology crafts the datasphere, helping to maximize humanity’s potential by innovating world-class, precision-engineered mass-data storage and management solutions with a focus on sustainable partnerships.

327,5bac449f-b3ca-3926-9ac1-2909be966f28,RHI,2022-12-02,A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE:RHI),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-robert-half-113150540.html,1669980710,STORY,['RHI'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE:RHI) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Robert Half International What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$620.8mUS$593.1mUS$567.0mUS$441.0mUS$412.2mUS$395.8mUS$387.2mUS$383.5mUS$383.3mUS$385.4mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -6.53%Est @ -3.98%Est @ -2.19%Est @ -0.94%Est @ -0.06%Est @ 0.55% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.3% US$584US$525US$472US$345US$304US$274US$253US$235US$221US$209(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$3.4bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$385m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.3%– 2.0%) = US$9.1bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$9.1b÷ ( 1 + 6.3%)10= US$5.0bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$8.4b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$78.5, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Robert Half International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.841. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Jim Clyburn, the chair of the committee, said in a statement.The program closed to borrowers in May 2021 after lending about $800 billion.The committee opened an investigation into fintech companies Kabbage and Bluevine and their partner banks in May 2021 following reports they were linked to a disproportionately high number of fraudulent loans, and later expanded that investigation to include Blueacorn and Womply.The report found that internal systems to detect fraud were often lacking. Blueacorn employees who reviewed loans were told that each application should take less than 30 seconds to review, and that they did not need to apply as much scrutiny to high dollar loans, the committee said.Womply’s lending partners accused the company of allowing “rampant fraud” to occur and described its fraud prevention practices as “put together with duct tape and gum.”Kabbage, which was acquired by American Express in October 2020, likely approved loans with red flags because the loan program “imposed minimal risk on lenders who approved questionable applications,” the report said.Kabbage in a statement said it ""adhered to the applicable rules and regulations"" of the program ""in good faith.""""Unfortunately, the report does the American people a disservice by parsing bits of information out of context to reach a predetermined conclusion,"" Kabbage said.Story continues“American Express has honored its obligations under the transition services agreement and will continue to do so in accordance with its terms,"" a company spokesperson said.Meanwhile, the committee observed that Bluevine’s lending partner, Celtic Bank, conducted oversight of Bluevine’s anti-fraud controls and prompted the fintech to introduce manual review processes, after which it observed a steep decline in fraud.""Since its founding in 2013, Bluevine has remained committed to establishing and maintaining robust internal controls and governance processes,"" a spokesperson for Bluevine said.""As recognized in the report, Celtic made extensive and effective efforts to combat fraud,"" a Celtic Bank spokesperson said in a statement.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for NetApp How Fast Is NetApp Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. It certainly is nice to see that NetApp has managed to grow EPS by 18% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. EBIT margins for NetApp remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 8.3% to US$6.5b. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of NetApp's forecast profits?Are NetApp Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since NetApp has a market capitalisation of US$15b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. To be specific, they have US$46m worth of shares. This considerable investment should help drive long-term value in the business. While their ownership only accounts for 0.3%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders.Story continuesDoes NetApp Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?You can't deny that NetApp has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in NetApp's continuing strength. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock. So if you like to buy cheap, you may want to check if NetApp is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/78-ownership-mondelez-international-inc-110045057.html,1669978845,STORY,['MDLZ'],"[Every investor in Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 78% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Mondelez International. View our latest analysis for Mondelez International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Mondelez International?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Mondelez International. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Mondelez International's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Mondelez International. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.9% of shares outstanding. With 7.0% and 4.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Mondelez InternationalThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Mondelez International, Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$108m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 21% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for Mondelez International (1 doesn't sit too well with us)  that you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

Shares have added about 8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Mondelez due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Mondelez Q3 Earnings &amp; Sales Beat Estimates, View HikedMondelez International posted impressive third-quarter 2022 numbers. Adjusted earnings were 74 cents per share, which increased 15.7% year over year on a constant-currency (cc) basis. The metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents per share. The year-over-year upside was backed by reduced outstanding shares, decreased taxes, solid operating gains and higher income from equity method investments. This was partly countered by the elevated interest expenses.Net revenues advanced 8.1% to $7,763 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,507 million. The uptick was driven by the strong organic net revenue growth of 12.1% and increased sales from the Chipita buyout, somewhat negated by currency headwinds. Favorable volumes and pricing contributed to organic net revenues.Revenues from emerging markets increased 19.7% to $3,094 million, while rising 24.4% on an organic basis. Revenues from developed markets moved up 1.5% to $4,669 million, while increasing 5.2% on an organic basis. Region-wise, revenues in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East &amp; Africa, and North America increased 21.6%, 4.6%, and 19.6% year over year, respectively. Meanwhile, the Europe region’s revenues declined 2.4% year over year. On an organic basis, revenues increased 31.6%, 14.6%, 5.2% and 12% in the above-mentioned regions, respectively.The adjusted gross profit ascended to $351 million at cc. The adjusted gross profit margin contracted by 100 basis points (bps) to 37.4% due to increased raw material and transportation costs, and an adverse mix. These were somewhat negated by favorable pricing. Mondelez’s adjusted operating income rose $118 million at cc. The adjusted operating income margin contracted by 110 bps to 16.1% due to inflated input costs and an adverse mix, largely countered by SG&amp;A leverage and favorable pricing.Story continuesOther Financials &amp; GuidanceThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2,177 million, long-term debt of $19,811 million, and total equity of $26,670 million.

Management expects a free cash flow of more than $3 billion for 2022. During the quarter, the company distributed $800 million to shareholders through cash dividends and share buybacks.Driven by the solid quarterly results and the continued momentum in the snacks business, management raised its guidance for 2022. For 2022, management expects organic net revenues of more than 10% compared with the more than 8% growth stated earlier. The company updated the view on the sturdy year-to-date performance.It envisions a 10% increase in adjusted earnings per share or EPS at cc compared with the prior mentioned mid to high-single-digit growth. Currency movements are likely to negatively impact net revenues by 6.4% and adjusted EPS by 26 cents in 2022.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended upward during the past month.VGM ScoresAt this time, Mondelez has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C.

The company has been gaining from strength in emerging markets and its core chocolate and biscuit categories. It has also been focused on strengthening areas with higher growth potential through prudent buyouts (like Clif Bar) and divestitures.These upsides, together with pricing actions, fueled second-quarter 2022 results and led to the raised organic revenue guidance. However, Mondelez is seeing input cost inflation, especially for energy, transportation, packaging, wheat, dairy and edible oils.It is also navigating through supply-chain bottlenecks due to labor shortages at third parties. Management's guidance for 2022 reflects anticipation of the elevated cost of goods sold inflation, the timing impact of extra pricing actions and the impacts of the Ukraine war.(You can read the full research report on Mondelez here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of EOG Resources have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry over the past year (+65.5% vs. +49.1%).

The companies did not reveal a schedule or a cost estimate for the initiative.Enbridge is collaborating with Occidental’s low-carbon business for the research. The facility will serve some of Enbridge’s nearby facilities and other nearby emitters.Oil and gas companies are actively involved in carbon capture and storage projects as they offer a transition pathway for the rapid and effective reduction of CO2 emissions beyond what can be achieved by alternative methods like electrification and renewable fuels. Thus, the use of carbon capture and storage in reducing industrial emissions offers an excellent opportunity.Occidental aims to develop multiple carbon capture projects (as many as 135 direct-air carbon capture facilities) by 2035. OXY believes that the new project will look to develop carbon sequestration sites outside of Ingleside.Enbridge will construct and operate the CO2 pipeline system, while Occidental will construct and operate the CO2 sequestration facilities. The facility would offer services to CO2 emitters in the Corpus Christi region, home to various energy and industrial activities.Local environmental groups have voiced uncertainty over carbon capture instead of favoring reducing existing operations or slowing all expansion to drive global warming away. Climate change mitigation can take place by significantly reducing the use of fossil fuels. As fossil fuel use is necessary, it should be paired with carbon capture.Occidental and Enbridge continue to assess technology options and the scope of opportunity for carbon capture and storage projects. The latest collaboration is an excellent opportunity for the companies to decarbonize their facilities and provides a platform for industrial neighbors seeking to reduce emissions. The collaboration will help accelerate the path to a net-zero future.Story continuesPrice PerformanceShares of Enbridge have underperformed the industry in the past six months.

348,67ba8e03-2ae5-3d97-b16b-59921d7b662a,OXY,2022-12-02,U.S. Oil Prices Rise as EIA Confirms a Big Inventory Draw,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-oil-prices-rise-eia-132501730.html,1669901101,STORY,"['OXY', 'HO=F', 'CL=F', 'MPC', 'HES']","[U.S. oil prices moved up on Nov 30 after government data showed a large weekly draw in crude supplies. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures rose $2.35 (or 3%) to settle at $80.55 a barrel yesterday.Before going into the overall macro environment for oil, let's dig deep into the Energy Information Administration’s (""EIA"") Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the holiday-shortened week ending Nov 25.Analyzing the Latest EIA ReportCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell 12.6 million barrels compared to expectations of a 4.4 million-barrel decrease per the analysts surveyed by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. The combination of a surge in exports, lower imports and higher refinery demand accounted for the big stockpile draw with the world’s biggest oil consumer.Total domestic stocks now stand at 419.1 million barrels — 3.2% less than the year-ago figure and 8% lower than the five-year average.The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) fell 415,000 barrels to 24.3 million barrels.Meanwhile, the crude supply cover decreased from 26.8 days in the previous week to 25.7 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 27.9 days.Let’s turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies increased for the third time in as many weeks. The 2.8 million-barrel rise was primarily attributable to higher production and a slight pullback in demand. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would rise 600,000 barrels. At 213.8 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is a marginal 0.7% less than the year-earlier level and 4% below the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) also increased for the third week in succession. The 3.5 million-barrel gain reflected higher production and a fall in demand. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply build of some 800,000 barrels. Despite last week’s addition, current inventories — at 112.6 million barrels — are 9.1% below the year-ago level and 11% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at 95.2%, rose 1.3% from the prior week.Story continuesFinal WordEven as fears revolving around high inflation and slowing growth somewhat cloud the outlook for Oil/Energy, it has remained the best S&amp;P 500 sector this year. The space has generated a total return of more than 64% in 2022 against the S&amp;P 500’s loss of around 14%. Apart from a positive fundamental picture, the sector is enjoying support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity.Oil has pulled back from those lofty levels, with the conflict showing no sign of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC agreeing on a production curtailment means that the commodity has got enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.Consequently, three of the top four gainers of the S&amp;P 500 this year are all energy-related names: Occidental Petroleum OXY, Hess Corporation HES and Marathon Petroleum MPC.Occidental Petroleum: OXY is the top-performing S&amp;P 500 stock in 2022, with a gain of 139.7%. Occidental Petroleum beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 12.7%, on average.OXY has a projected earnings growth rate of 283.1% for this year. Occidental Petroleum is valued at around $62.8 billion.Hess Corporation: Hess shares have appreciated 94.4% so far in 2022. HES has a projected earnings growth rate of 229.7% for this year.Hess, with a market capitalization of $43.8 billion, enjoys a Zacks Growth Style Score of A. HES beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 8.1%.Marathon Petroleum: This stock is among the best performers on the S&amp;P 500 Index, with shares having appreciated 90.4% in 2022. MPC, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has a projected earnings growth rate of 949% for this year.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Marathon Petroleum beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters.

We have three today. We have Ulta Beauty, Marvell Technology, and Zscaler. Let's kick it off with Ulta Beauty. You're looking at gains of just around 3%. The company reporting earnings earlier in the hour, boosting their full-year net sales guidance, $9.95 billion to $10 billion is now what they're expecting. The company also boosting its full-year profit guidance. Third-quarter results reflect, quote, ""sustained resilience"" of the beauty category.That's what executives said in this earnings release. Over the past three months, the company's done relatively well, up just around 11% year to date. We are now looking at gains. Look at that-- up just about 14%, bucking the downward trend that we have certainly seen in the broader markets this year.Let's move on to Marvell Technology, a big mover here after hours, now off just about 6%, so paring some of those earlier losses in extended trading. Third-quarter profit missed expectations. Revenue also coming in a bit light. Fourth-quarter net revenue guidance did miss what the Street was looking for. Inventory reductions-- this is what the company is saying-- impacting some of the near-term results. Over the past three months, the stock just in the red, off about 1%. Over the last six months, you're looking at losses of about 21%.Rounding it out with Zscaler, the cloud security company. That stock off nearly 10% in after-hours trading. Full-year calculated billings forecast was lagging the Street's estimates, and that is why we're off nearly 10%. When you take a look at the current quarter numbers, it actually looked relatively well for its fiscal first quarter, the company beating on both the top and bottom line. But the guidance for its calculating billing, that is what's really dragging the stock Lower past three months were essentially flat. Year to date, Zscaler off about 55%.- Ouch. It's more than half their market cap. Thank you, Seana. Good stuff.]"
353,32a649e3-46cd-36c5-898d-022d84513bf3,ULTA,2022-12-02,Ulta has been a ‘very modern retailer with a very modern retail strategy’: Analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ulta-very-modern-retailer-very-214443272.html,1669931083,VIDEO,['ULTA'],"[Jane Hali &amp; Associates Senior Research Analyst Jessica Ramirez joins Yahoo Finance Live to weigh in on Ulta's Q3 earnings results and the company's forward-looking guidance.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]SEANA SMITH: All right, have Ulta earnings right now crossing the wires. And you can see the reaction in the stock, up just about 3%. A lot of that reaction has to do with the guidance that we are getting from Ulta. The company boosting their full-year outlook here.Full year net sales guidance now expecting to see net sales of $9.95 billion to $10 billion. Initially, they saw $8 and 1/2 billion to $8.6 billion. The company also raising its full-year operating margin estimate here, and we're seeing that reflected in the stock after-hours. Adjusted EPS for the quarter, $534. That was a beat in terms of what the Street was expecting. Revenue of $2.34 billion, also slightly better than what analysts were looking for.For more on this, we want to bring in Jessica Ramirez, Jane Hali &amp; Associates Senior Research Analyst. Jessica, it's great to see you. It certainly seems like investors are encouraged by these results. I know you've only had a few minutes to dig into this report, but what's your initial takeaway?JESSICA RAMIREZ: I mean, it's definitely a colorful stock, isn't it? I think when you look at Ulta, Ulta has been doing very well in this year compared to some of the other retailers, retail stocks, just because the beauty category has been very strong. And I think it's a resilient category that we continue to see throughout the year.The consumer has various reasons to shop beauty. And alone from beauty being a great category at the moment, Ulta's also been a very modern retail-- very modern retailer with a very modern retail strategy in place, which, again, is future-proof for when times are difficult and other retailers, again, are having difficulty with other parts of the business, either too much inventory or promotions.Story continuesThey've been running a very clean promotional business in Q3. It was pretty much flat from our data that we pulled. And overall, I mean, digital omnichannel, the stores are looking great. The conversations they have with Target, the partnership there is also great. So it's quite a strong retailer at the moment.DAVID BRIGGS: Indeed it is, up 14% this year, outperforming just about, frankly, everything on the planet. You talked about Target. How have partnerships really built the Ulta that we see today?JESSICA RAMIREZ: Well, I think partnerships, in general-- so you have two sides, where you have this great partnership with Target, which we've seen do very well, and they've been able to manage it well because Target itself, the beauty category, has been very special. And they brought in a lot of these young brands and things like that. So it's done a very-- it complements each other on each side.You're able to get this consumer in to Target, discover these new brands that maybe Ulta has that Target may not have. So that's, I think, quite beautiful. And also, the beauty business changed very differently at the same time, where, in apparel, we have a drop model. And that was basically new collaborations coming in to create hype and momentum with the consumer.And then there was these unique collaborations that would come through retail doors, again, to have that consumer come in only to your door because it was exclusive. So beauty started doing a lot of that. And Ulta started catching on quite some time ago. And I thought that was absolutely great. I think one of the biggest ones that we commonly see is the Kylie Cosmetics. There, Ulta was the first one to secure that.So we've seen them do a lot of these unique collaborations. Again, it gets the customer excited, especially Gen Z. In the quarter, they had collaborations with Disney. They had a line with Lisa Frank. These very exciting things. So I think that's part of the winning formula and, again, of a modern retail strategy that we do expect, especially by now that retailers have caught on to and really take that to the next level.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, well, the results here boosting Ulta Beauty to an all-time high. Jessica, when you take a look at the floor plan or really, I guess, the brick and mortar side of things when it comes to Ulta adding new stores, 18 new stores in the third quarter, plans to add more in the current quarter and looking ahead to 2023, does that strategy make sense to you when we know more and more people are shopping online?JESSICA RAMIREZ: Yeah. So it does make sense. And I think the argument of are you in store or are you online, I think what we have to remember is the consumer doesn't necessarily see what we talk about, omnichannel. A consumer sees is my shopping experience seamless?Can I be at work and pick this up easily? I might buy something in the store while I'm there. Am I just shopping online because I'm watching something and, oh, look, she looks great with that makeup. Maybe I can find that for myself. I can go on the app. That's just the way consumers shop today.So if there is a store, it's a medium format. It's a format that engages you. Ulta's also going a lot into services, which I noticed just quickly diving in, it was a quick-- a small increase of 1% service. But they've been trying to increase those services. And when you go online, there's so many more that you can do. There's eyebrows. There's eyelashes. There's makeup. There's hair. There's just more and more growing.And so they're really trying to engage with that consumer, have that sticky feeling in the store and a reason for-- for them to trust them more and to stay within that space. So, yes, we do need the store. Again, if it's not a huge store and we're not having too much inventory, I think it's great. They're also coming up with this new format that's more of a curated version of this is my makeup for XYZ rather than having prestige and the mass sit in different parts of the store, which, again, I think it's a great way to engage with the customer a lot more.DAVID BRIGGS: Sounds rather recession proof there. CEO Dave Kimbell highlighting the strong emotional connection and loyalty they've cultivated with their guests. That we are seeing in the numbers. Jane Hali &amp; Associates Senior Research Analyst Jessica Ramirez, appreciate that. Good stuff.]"

Dave? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David C. Kimbell, Ulta Beauty, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered outstanding performance this quarter with strong revenue growth driving operating margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth. We accomplished these results because the Ulta Beauty teams continue to execute at a high level, and I want to thank all of our associates for their commitment to delivering great guest experiences, ensuring operational excellence, strengthening our culture and working together as one team to move our business forward as the leader in beauty. For the third quarter, net sales increased 17.2% to $2.3 billion, and comp sales increased 14.6%. Operating margin increased to 15.5% of sales and diluted EPS increased 35.5% to $5.34 per share. Reflecting these results and our updated fourth quarter expectations, we have increased our outlook for the full year. Scott will share more details about our expectations later in the call. Our third quarter results are a testament to the resilience of the beauty category and our team's ability to drive strong guest engagement that fueled broad-based growth across our business. All major categories exceeded our expectations, and we increased our market share in prestige beauty versus the fiscal third quarter last year based on dollar sales according to point-of-sale data from the NPD Group. We delivered growth across our store and digital channels and achieved record loyalty membership of 39 million members. Additionally, we continue to see growth in spend per member across all income demographics. Our strategic framework, anchored by the power of our differentiated model, continues to drive our ambitions and successes as we work to expand our market leadership and drive profitable growth. This afternoon, I will share an update on our progress against several of our strategic pillars. Starting with our efforts to drive disruptive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty, our strategy to engage and delight beauty enthusiasts with a thoughtfully curated assortment focused on inclusivity and leading trends is delivering results. Our double-digit comp this quarter was a result of growth from our core assortment, price increases executed this year and compelling newness. Although pricing contributed more to our comp than last quarter, the majority of our third quarter comp was fueled by growth from our core assortment and newness. Historically, sales of new products have averaged 20% to 30% of our sales, and the overall mix of newness this year has been in line with our historical experience. Turning to performance by category. Skincare, fragrance and bath, hair care and makeup all delivered double-digit comp growth against the third quarter last year. From a segment perspective, we saw double-digit sales growth across both prestige and mass, with mass generally outperforming prestige. While it's hard to know with certainty if we are starting to see consumers trade down, as the only beauty retailer that offers a wide variety of price points from entry level mass to high-end luxury and everything in between, Ulta Beauty is uniquely positioned to capture any consumer shifts within price points in the beauty category. Turning to the performance of our core categories, starting with our fastest-growing category, skincare. Beauty enthusiasts are maintaining their skincare routines with a focus on science-backed and dermatologist-recommended products. Guests are engaging with newer brands, like Drunk Elephant, Super Goop and Good Molecules, while new products from established brands like the Ordinary Hero Cosmetics and the Roche-Posay also contributed to sales growth. To drive discovery and support guest education, this quarter, we introduced our Skincare We Love All in all stores. This curated presentation highlights exciting brands and best-selling items across key categories. The fragrance and bath category delivered another impressive quarter, as Gen Z guests engaged with the category, leveraging multiple fragrances to express themselves. Recently launched Ulta Beauty exclusive Billie Eilish, as well as Nescens from Burberry, Gucci and Victor and Ralph drove meaningful sales growth. While our monthly fragrance crush program drove engagement with established brands including Versace and Jimmy Choo. In addition, the category benefited from strong guest engagement with our holiday fragrance gift sets, which were available earlier this year. Haircare, our second largest category, delivered solid growth, primarily driven by newness and innovation. Key category trends include hair health, damage repair and targeted treatments. Prestige brands, including Way and Briogeo, saw strength in treatments and core assortments, while masstige brands, including EBA, NYC, (inaudible) and Kristin S., and professional brands such as Pure Allergy, Redken and Kenra, continued to resonate with guests. Within the category, strong hair product growth was offset by softer performance in hair tools as we lapped strong performance last year. Finally, our largest category, makeup, delivered double-digit comp growth, driven by newness and the strength of our key events, including 21 Days of Beauty and Fall Haul. Growth in foundation, concealers, blush and lip continue to lead the category. New brands like (inaudible), R.E.M. Beauty and [Numero OneChannel] drove sales during the quarter, while new products from a wide range of brands, including Clinique, e.l.f. and NYX also contributed to growth. In addition, the expansion of MAC, Chanel Beaute and Bobby Brown into more stores has continued to drive prestige sales. Now let me give you an update on our key cross-category platforms. Conscious Beauty, Black-Owned and by pack brands and wellness. With 290 certified brands, Conscious Beauty continues to resonate strongly with beauty enthusiasts, reflecting growing interest in products that are good for the world. This quarter, we certified 15 new brands, including 8 cosmetics, Morphe and Dime Beauty, and introduced the Conscious Beauty essentials kit, featuring minis for more than 15 brands, such as Dermalogica, Koula and our own Ulta Beauty Collection. During the quarter, we expanded our buy pack brand assortment with 4 new buy pack brands: Pebble, Bread Beauty Supply, Sugar Dough and Undefined Beauty. As another way we look to create foundational industry change, we proudly launched our MUSE Accelerator program to support early-stage buy pack brands as they prepare for retail readiness. Our inaugural class included 8 buy pack founders, with innovative brands across skin care, makeup, fragrance, haircare and wellness. In addition to financial support, each MUSE Accelerator participant took part in an intensive 10-week training program, learning from Ulta Beauty leaders, industry subject matter experts and leading buy pack brand owners. We are honored and excited to be a part of their journey as they build their business and expand their reach. Finally, we continue to increase our presence in wellness. During the quarter, we further enhanced our assortment to reflect our guest evolving needs. And in September, we expanded our offering to include intimate wellness as the sixth online-only pillar of the wellness shop. While wellness represents a small part of our overall business today, we believe it is a significant longer-term growth opportunity given the incrementality of the purchase and the strong emotional connection consumers have with self-care. Turning now to our efforts to evolve the omnichannel experience through a connected physical and digital ecosystem, all in your world. Store traffic trends accelerated this quarter and exceeded pre-pandemic levels for the first time, representing an important milestone in our COVID recovery. In addition to strong sales growth from stores, we continue to deliver growth in e-commerce, further reinforcing the incrementality of this important channel. The convenience of BOPIS for e-commerce orders continues to resonate with guests. During the quarter, BOPIS increased 18% to 23% of e-commerce sales, compared to 20% last year. Our services business accelerated and delivered another quarter of double-digit comp growth, primarily due to higher stylist retention, increased stylist productivity and increased capacity in our salons as we lap capacity constraints due to the pandemic. Our targeted CRM efforts to drive awareness, trial and frequency are working, delivering increases in salon appointments from both existing and new members. Additionally, our in-store back bar events continue to drive product attachment and new guest acquisition for participating brands. As industry leaders, we're always working to enhance guest experiences across all of our platforms. During the quarter, we introduced a new layout in about a dozen stores to showcase our categories better, improve navigation, enhance the services experience and create more opportunities for discovery. The most noticeable changes include the repositioning of skincare, an important growth category to the front of the store. All products grew by category with delineated fixtures and visuals and a flow from prestige to masstige to mass. Elevated gondolas that showcase key iconic and service brands, new beauty bars that offer our brow and makeup services, as well as supporting in-store events, dedicated space in the front of the store to feature brand and product launches across categories and a relocated checkout closer to the salon. We are excited to introduce this new store layout to guest. And as we've done in the past, we intend to introduce this new experience in new stores, remodels and relocations. At this time, we have no plans to retrofit existing stores. Stores are a critical part of our ecosystem. And while most Ulta Beauty's transactions occur in stores, we know the guest journey often begins online. To assist guests along their journey, we offer a suite of virtual digital tools, including GLAMlab, Skin Advisor and our hairstyle tool, among others. The latest addition is a fragrance finder designed to help guests explore fragrances by favorite brand or ingredient, launched just in time for the holiday season. Finally, we continue to be excited about the long-term opportunity with our strategic Target partnership. This touch point enables us to connect and reconnect with members. And while the partnership isn't material yet to our overall member growth, it has contributed positively. Importantly, we are seeing members bounce back to Ulta Beauty after becoming an active member while at the Ulta Beauty at Target shop. Now let me give you an update on some of the steps we're taking to drive love, loyalty and emotional connection with Ulta Beauty. Recognizing the beauty is personal. We are on a multiyear journey to create stronger, more emotional connections with our guests and bring our brand purpose to life. Launched in September, our latest brand building campaign Beauty And is rooted in insights from cultural leaders and beauty enthusiasts. The creative content on owned and paid channels has driven broad improvement in top-of-mind awareness and is resonating with our guests, particularly Black and Latin beauty enthusiasts. Turning to our loyalty program. Our efforts to nurture loyalty in personalized ways is driving member growth and delivering incremental value. We ended the quarter with 39 million active members, 9% higher than the third quarter last year. Overall spend per member increased driven by increased frequency and higher average ticket. While price increases are having an impact, we are encouraged to see unit growth per member. Our loyalty program is a strategic asset and an important driver of our long-term growth. We prioritize member engagement, loyalty and retention across every Ulta Beauty touch point. The growth and strength of our loyalty program starts with ensuring that our existing guests stay engaged. Nurturing our existing members through our Member Love events and life cycle marketing strategies has enabled us to maintain healthy retention rates, which have contributed to member growth and higher spend per member. Member reactivation remains a priority, and we are leveraging CRM tools to personalize offers and reengage members in more targeted ways. And, of course, conversion of new members also contributes to overall member growth, and we continue to acquire new members in our stores, digital platforms and through our partnership with Target. Shifting now to our plans and expectations for holiday. The holiday season is in full flow, and our teams are executing well. While predicting holiday shopping patterns this year is challenging, I am optimistic about the opportunity for Ulta Beauty this holiday season. Our engaging holiday messaging, one-of-a-kind assortment, with exceptional seasonal options and diverse touch points, all paired with our team's unrelenting passion for delivering great guest experiences, position us well to deliver another successful holiday season. Grounded and robust consumer insights, our holiday marketing strategy positions Ulta Beauty as the place for gifting, glamming and self-care this season. Our intent is to empower guests to celebrate the season however they want. And our integrated media plan for the holiday aims to build broad awareness of Ulta Beauty as a holiday destination, spark connection with key audiences, leverage our beauty expertise and drive consideration and purchase. Our merchandising team has built an outstanding holiday gifting assortment, whether guests want to get others or treat themselves, we have thoughtfully curated options across every category and budget, with a balanced approach to the mix of seasonal holiday items and core items that make great guests. We entered the holiday season with well-staffed stores in DCs, and our teams are excited, engaged and ready. For the first time since 2019, our store teams gathered in person to review our holiday strategies. And I know their excitement and enthusiasm for our plans will be felt in every guest interaction. And our corporate and DC teams have worked cross-functionally to ensure Ulta Beauty is positioned to deliver for our store teams and our guests. In closing, I am incredibly proud of our year-to-date results, and I'm excited about our holiday plans. Even as consumers continue to navigate economic headwinds, we believe the beauty category will remain resilient, and we are confident that our differentiated model and growth strategy, combined with our outstanding associates, will continue to position Ulta Beauty as the preferred beauty destination. And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Scott M. Settersten, Ulta Beauty, Inc. - CFO, Treasurer &amp; Assistant Secretary [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported results that were better than our initial expectations. Strong double-digit revenue growth resulted in record-setting third quarter operating margin performance. These excellent results reflect the continued focus and hard work of our store, DC and corporate teams. And I want to thank all of our Ulta Beauty associates for working together to deliver another outstanding quarter for our shareholders. Now to the financial results, starting with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 17.2%, driven by comp sales growth of 14.6% and strong new store performance. In addition, other revenue increased $20 million, primarily due to credit card income growth, higher loyalty point redemptions and an increase in royalty income from our partnership with Target. Breaking down the comp performance further. Comp transactions for the quarter increased 10.7%, primarily driven by strong growth from in-store transactions. Average ticket increased 3.5% due to an increase in average selling price, partially offset by slightly lower average units per transaction. The increase in average selling price primarily reflects the impact of retail price increases executed this year. We estimate that price increases contributed about 500 basis points to the overall comp increase. While average units per transaction was slightly lower than last year, the total number of units sold increased about 10% on a comp basis. During the quarter, we opened 18 new stores, relocated one store and remodeled 8 stores. For the quarter, gross margin increased 160 basis points to 41.2% of sales compared to 39.6% last year. The increase was primarily due to the leverage of store fixed costs, other revenue growth and higher merchandise margin, partially offset by higher inventory shrink. Robust top line growth and benefits from our ongoing occupancy cost optimization efforts resulted in healthy leverage of store fixed costs. The improvement in merchandise margin was primarily due to benefits resulting from the timing of retail price changes, partially offset by brand mix. As we have discussed, we have executed a number of price increases from our brand partners this year. Generally, when the new price is effective at the shelf, we are still selling the inventory purchased at the lower cost. As a result, there's a short-term benefit to cost of goods as we move through the lower cost inventory. As expected, our promotional activity increased from the second quarter, but the impact to margin was not meaningful compared to last year. SG&amp;A increased 18.6% to $597.2 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&amp;A increased 30 basis points to 25.5% compared to 25.2% last year, primarily due to increases in store payroll and benefits and corporate overhead, partially offset by lower marketing expenses. Store payroll and benefits deleverage this quarter primarily due to increased labor hours to maintain service standards, higher average wage rates to support recruitment and retention and a timing shift of incentive compensation accruals. Corporate overhead expense deleveraged in the quarter, primarily reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities including Project SAR and other IT capabilities, UV Media and Ulta Beauty at Target. These headwinds were partially offset by lower marketing expense. As we have discussed on previous calls, this year, we are offsetting the incremental marketing expense of digital campaigns we manage for our brand partners, with vendor income that is a direct reimbursement for these specific costs within total marketing expense. Similar to what we saw in the first half, this resulted in about 70 basis points of favorable impact to SG&amp;A in the quarter. Operating income for the quarter increased 27.3% to $361.9 million. As a percentage of sales, operating margin increased 130 basis points to 15.5% of sales compared to 14.2% last year. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 35.5% to $5.34 per share, compared to $3.94 per share last year. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory increased 10.3%. In addition to the impact of 41 additional stores, the increase reflects purchases to support key brand launches and increases in inventory costs, as well as ongoing efforts to maintain strong in-stock to support expected demand. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $83.5 million compared to $51.1 million last year. The increase was primarily related to investments in new remodeled and relocated stores, IT projects and merchandising improvements. Depreciation was $58.5 million compared to $65.2 million last year, primarily due to a shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. We ended the quarter with $250.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we repurchased 340,000 shares at a cost of $137.5 million. At the end of the third quarter, we had $1.4 billion remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization. Turning now to our outlook. We have raised our financial guidance for fiscal 2022 to reflect our strong third quarter performance and increased expectations for the fourth quarter. We now expect net sales for the year will be between $9.95 billion and $10 billion, with comp sales growth between 12.6% and 13.2%. This guidance reflects our expectation that fourth quarter comp growth will be between 6% and 8%, up from our previous expectation for low single-digit increase. Sales growth moderated in November as we lapped last year's strong performance, but we are pleased with the sales trends we saw through the Thanksgiving holiday shopping weekend, including Cyber Monday. We still have several important weeks left in the holiday season, and the operating environment continues to be dynamic. Our Q4 comp outlook, reflects both the expected resilience of the beauty category as well as potential risks from shifts in consumer spending, increased points of distribution for prestige beauty and higher promotional activity. For the year, we plan to open approximately 47 net new stores and remodel or relocate 33 stores. Our new store performance continues to be strong. But like many other major retailers, we are seeing project delays resulting from external real estate and construction issues, as well as supply chain disruption for key equipment. These external factors have impacted our fiscal 2022 plans and will likely shift new stores originally planned for fiscal 2023 into 2024. We continue to expect to open about 100 stores over the next 2 years, but the timing of opening between fiscal 2023 and 2024 may shift as we navigate these external challenges. The operating environment is fluid, and we will provide specific targets for fiscal 2023 when we report in March. We now expect operating margins for the year will be between 15.5% and 15.6% of sales. We expect gross margin for the year will increase with leverage of fixed costs and growth in other revenue, partially offset by lower merchandise margin, higher shrink and higher supply chain costs. We continue to expect SG&amp;A expense for the year will increase between 15% and 16% or approximately flat as a percentage of sales, driven primarily by $60 million to $65 million of expenses related to our strategic priorities, as well as higher wage rate growth across the enterprise, partially offset by lower marketing expense. Reflecting these assumptions, we now expect diluted earnings per share for the year will be between $22.60 and $22.90. One final update. We now expect to spend between $300 million and $350 million in CapEx in fiscal 2022, including approximately $160 million for supply chain and IT, $140 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, and about $30 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be around $250 million. While we are not providing guidance for next year on this call, we want to share some high-level thoughts for your consideration as you model fiscal 2023. The beauty category has been stronger this year than expected. Barring a major economic event, we would expect category growth to continue in 2023, albeit at lower rates, reflecting strong consumer engagement with the category, and we remain confident we can deliver comp sales growth in fiscal 2023 within our longer-term targeted range of 3% to 5%. In this sales scenario, we would expect operating margin deleverage versus our fiscal 2022 guidance. In addition to inflationary pressures on wage rates and other operational expenses, we expect to increase investment spending related to our strategic priorities, reflecting timing shifts from fiscal 2022 and the planned ramp-up of key IT and supply chain investments. Finally, fiscal 2023 will be a 53-week year for Ulta Beauty. We are still finalizing our budget for fiscal 2023 and plan to provide specific financial guidance, and update our longer-term growth targets, if appropriate, on our March earnings call. And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&amp;A session. ================================================================================ Questions and Answers -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [1] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steven Paul Forbes, Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division - Analyst [2] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dave, Scott, I wanted to focus and start with member engagement. But Dave, curious if you can expand on how member engagement trends within the recent member cohorts differ or I guess, are similar from the more mature cohorts in terms of retention, repeat behavior, the maturation of wallet share, channel preferences, really just any color that helps maybe underpin your conviction for a positive comp outlook next year? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David C. Kimbell, Ulta Beauty, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great. Thanks, Steve. Yes, as I said in the remarks, our loyalty program, our membership, is vital and critical to our long-term success and one that we're extremely proud of what we've built the relationship that we have with our guests. Yes, I guess, a few things that I'd call out. Naturally, our longer tenured. You get -- if you're tenured 3-plus years, we see kind of a higher level of retention, higher level of engagement that tends to grow over time. Greater percentage of our guests, the longer they're here, move into our higher levels platinum and diamond levels. So naturally, with that tenure comes greater engagement. And as I mentioned, one of the drivers of our third quarter growth, 9% growth in our total membership was healthy retention and it's been a big focus for our entire team. Our loyalty team, our store teams, our digital, everybody that participates into delivering a great experience. So that's key and really job 1 is engaging and retaining our existing guests. Our newer members that we acquire in stores, online and increasingly with our partnership with Target, play an important role. Their spend per member makes sense. It's on average lower, and we work hard to get them into the full Ulta Beauty experience. Often they enter into one category or one experience. They might come in store, we try to move them online. They might come in to makeup, we try to move them into skincare, get them into services. We have a full suite of activities and experiences designed to engage our new members through -- and including their what we call their sophomore year, their second year with us, which is important pivot year into long-term retention. So we look across all spectrum, what we're excited about now and encouraged by is we're seeing strength across all sectors, all income demographics, all geographies. We have a healthy member base. That's what's driving the 9% growth in our (inaudible) of course, that, in turn, played a big role in the sales performance we had in the third quarter. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Irwin Bernard Boruchow, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Specialty Retail Analyst [5] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Congrats. Great quarter. I guess, Scott, I was going to focus on the margins with you. Merch margin is better in 3Q. It sounds like you're off to a good start on the promotional side in 4Q as well. You're going to end the year -- I mean, it's a good problem to have. You're going to end the year closer to 16% margins. Your long-term target is 13% to 14%. I guess, just with merch margins as elevated as they are and as healthy as they are, are you guys starting to think more longer term about the AUR dynamics in the business and maybe that this elevated level of merch margin that you're at might be more sustainable than maybe what you had originally thought and maybe that 13% to 14% actually can move a bit higher? I mean it more is a high-level question, not necessarily 2023, but that's kind of where I was coming from. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Scott M. Settersten, Ulta Beauty, Inc. - CFO, Treasurer &amp; Assistant Secretary [6] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Thanks, Ike. I think probably gets to a larger picture versus the AUR piece of your question there. So let me start it, because I know this is at the top of the list for all investors right now as we're thinking about next year. So let me start by saying we are very proud of what the Ulta Beauty team has been able to deliver over the last several years with respect to our operating margin profile overall. We continue to lead the beauty category, capture market share gains and deliver some of the strongest operating margins in all of retail, while also absorbing significant cost pressures, driven by an e-commerce business that we doubled the size of since 2019, along with wage pressures, supply chain disruptions, fuel costs and other inflationary pressures across the business. And also continuing to make significant investments to innovate and build a healthy and vibrant business for the long term. Having said that, we've been very transparent with investors all year when discussing the continued beauty rebound in 2022, and that sales trends have been much stronger than what we expected back in the fall of 2021 when we provided our long-term financial outlook. And that sales performance is driving stronger-than-expected operating margins, driven primarily by fixed cost leverage, price increase benefits and gross margin that are extraordinary this year and more moderate promotion levels and that the sales increases have been outpacing the inflationary cost pressures that we've seen in our business. So again, big picture, let me just lay out a couple of the bigger variables here as we're thinking about modeling for next year. So again, back to what we referenced in the script, we do expect we can grow sales next year in line with our longer-term 3% to 5% comp target. So on the top line, merchants have done an outstanding job. We feel good about the queue for newness next year. We've got some great things lined up. But we're going to be lapping over some extraordinary newness this year, right, with these leading brands in each of our key categories, Fenty and makeup, Drunk Elephant, skincare and OLAPLEX in haircare, all right? Price increase is another major lever. So we're kind of in uncharted territory right now, right? The percentage of our assortment where we've seen increases and the depth of those increases is something we've never experienced in all the years here at Ulta Beauty. So we're going to be cycling over some of that next year, and it's kind of yet to be seen how the consumer is going to react to that over the longer period of time. So elasticity and resilient, while it's been resilient so far, there's a question of how far we're able to push this without seeing some kind of impact. Lastly, on the top line, I'd say we're going to lean into our very powerful loyalty program, the benefits of our credit card. And of course, we're going to look to continue to see benefit from our Ulta Beauty at Target relationship next year. Thinking about the rest of the P&amp;L then, on the gross margin piece of it, promotion levels, we think, will likely be higher next year than they have been the last couple of years. Channel mix then kind of a benefit this year because stores, the big bounce back and traffic we've seen in stores has helped, right, some of the margin headwinds that we see from our digital business. Pricing benefits, we, again, this gross margin benefit from the timing between price versus the inventory change -- it contributed meaningful benefits this year. And again, some of that will recur next year, but the question is to what significance? Wage pressure will continue. Fuel will probably moderate, right? We've seen that here more recently. Supply chain investments will ramp up next year. And of course, UB Media will accelerate, will step up there. So ramp-up will contribute on the margin line, gross margin line. In SG&amp;A, we got store payroll upward pressure on wages, which we expect to continue, maybe not to the same rate we've seen here this year, but certainly will continue upward. Variable cost, inflationary pressures, again, credit card fees, I mean, we're seeing it in every part of our business right now. We've been able to mitigate a lot of that. And super high sales increases help camouflage that a bit as well. And then, of course, our strategic investments, as we mentioned in the script, we plan to ramp those up, and that's coming in 2023. So other digital investments UB Media and UBN and target as well. So we've got mitigating strategies in place, right? You've heard us talk about some of these over the years, and we've demonstrated the company we are able to deliver, we've delivered hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits from our EFG efforts, and we've got plenty of margin enhancement and cost optimization opportunities in front of us, and we're building out new continuous improvement capabilities, which, again, you've heard us talk about are building for the long-term cost optimization of the business. So I'll close it up by saying, even in what we see as a more uncertain environment, being with us here into next year, we are well positioned. We've got a strong business model. We are in a great category that's growing and we've got a very -- a business that delivers very healthy margins. And we expect to be able to grow the top line next year even off extraordinary performance in 2021 and '22. So we feel good about where we are. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [7] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lorraine Corrine Maikis Hutchinson, BofA Securities, Research Division - MD in Equity Research [8] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your sales guidance continues to include pressure from increased points of distribution for prestige. Can you talk about what you're seeing in the fleet when one of these new stores open and how meaningful it is? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David C. Kimbell, Ulta Beauty, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [9] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. We're certainly watching, monitoring, tracking all competitive activity across the landscape. And as I've said before, our focus continues to really be on offense for us to really leverage what we do best, the unique differentiated model we have. Nobody does what Ulta Beauty does. So our competitive strategy is to lead and to drive our business forward. Having said that, we are watching, there are changes. When stores, competitive stores open, depending on the circumstances of the situation, we can see a relatively minor impact. Typically, over time, our business sustains and recovers any short-term impact. So we're confident. And again, our focus is on delivering what our experience is. What we found over time is doing that allows us to continue to find growth and deliver an experience that our guest continues to want to find at Ulta Beauty. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [10] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And our next question comes from the line of Ashley Helgans with Jefferies. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ashley Elizabeth Helgans, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [11] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Congrats on the quarter. So we just wanted to ask about the promotional landscape that you've seen heading into holiday. And if you feel discounting at other retailers has been as heavy as initially expected? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David C. Kimbell, Ulta Beauty, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [12] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I guess, we'd say for holiday, a little early to know exactly. I mean, we're right in the middle of the battle here, I guess, with our biggest, biggest weeks of the holiday period still ahead of us. And we know we've been -- I think we shared this at our last call and really any time we're talking about holiday. Holiday is a more promotional period. The November, December period is different than the other 10 months of the year because the gifting aspects, the idea that we're not just competing with beauty. We're competing with other gift categories across retail. The landscape, it's hard for us to judge midstream exactly. What we've been delivering is an aggressive promotional, but not wildly different than what we've done in the past. So we've seen consistency there. So far, we're really encouraged by what we're seeing, feeling like Ulta Beauty is well positioned and competing effectively, but we're also monitoring, tracking and ensuring that we close out this next, I guess, 24, 25 days with excellence as we complete the holiday, and that's our focus going forward. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [13] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael Allen Baker, D.A. Davidson &amp; Co., Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst [14] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I just wanted to ask a little bit about cadence, the month throughout the third quarter. And then November, you said it slowed. I guess, I'm just wondering, within your 6% to 8% guidance for the fourth quarter, we know the comparisons get easier in December relative to November. Is that contemplated within the guidance? Or maybe another way to ask it is, is November slow? Did it slow below 6% to 8% and you need to pick up to get there? Or is it within that range? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David C. Kimbell, Ulta Beauty, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [15] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, what I will say is, first on the third quarter, we saw a strong growth throughout the quarter, although October was modestly -- decelerated modestly, but still double-digit growth in each period of the quarter. As is suggested in our 6% to 8% guidance for the fourth quarter, we're anticipating deceleration from what we saw in the third quarter and really throughout the year. And we've been kind of anticipating this all year as we -- our comps are strong. And again, we're in a different type of period in holiday. We're not going to get into specific week-by-week replay yet. We'll, as I said, we're right in the middle of it. We've got big weeks ahead of us. We'll obviously share -- when we share our fourth quarter results, all the details. But what I will say is, again, reflected in the [6 to 8] is an anticipated healthy growth, but not to the level of what we saw in the third quarter, and we're encouraged by what we're seeing so far in the holiday period, knowing that there's a lot of ground still to cover as we complete holiday. And January is a big important period for us as well. So still a lot ahead of us, but encouraged by what we're seeing so far. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [16] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And our next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Adrienne Eugenia Yih-Tennant, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD, Senior eCommerce &amp; Brand Retailing Analyst [17] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great. Scott, I was wondering if you can talk about -- you had mentioned sort of the vendor contribution that was offsetting some of the lower marketing spend. So does that mean that they want to present their brands more aggressively, and therefore, are taking more space either on the 21 days of beauty, or if we purchase that type of thing. And then I also wanted to know, Dave, at the beginning of the pandemic, you pulled out of the international Canada opening. Now that the domestic business seems to be on pretty good footing, how are you thinking about kind of reentry into that market? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Scott M. Settersten, Ulta Beauty, Inc. - CFO, Treasurer &amp; Assistant Secretary [18] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. So I'll start. So the first part of your question, yes, it's an accounting recognition of how the debits and credits flow through the P&amp;L, Adrienne. So there's really nothing related to the vendor choices or how we work or execute any of those kinds of things. It's just accounting convention. -- matching up expense with income when it's incremental expenses related to these marketing activities and then the rest of it kind of rolls through the gross margin through our inventory accounting. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David C. Kimbell, Ulta Beauty, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [19] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And on your question about Canada and international, as you stated, we obviously stopped that early in the pandemic. Right now, we have no plans, consistent with what we shared at our Analyst Day. No plans to expand internationally at this time, although we are always looking for opportunities to find new growth potential. And so in our future at some point, that's possible, but nothing in our immediate plans for sure. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [20] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question comes from the line of Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unidentified Analyst, [21] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So I'd like to expand a little bit on what you're seeing within the specific product categories. I mean, you did know pretty strong growth for all categories. But as we head into the early parts here of Q4 and the holiday season, can you talk about kind of specific trends you're seeing for cosmetics, skincare, fragrance? What categories are maybe requiring a little bit heavier promotional activity for holiday? Just any color you can provide there would be helpful. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David C. Kimbell, Ulta Beauty, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [22] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, I'll start with (inaudible) we're really encouraged by what we saw in the third quarter. And really, we've seen this trend for the first 3 quarters, a strong growth across all categories, which is obviously a great place to be. The strength we're seeing in our business is not outweighted by one specific category. It's balanced across our portfolio. And it's because we've -- our team across both merchandising, marketing, our stores have done a great job engaging our guests in our entire assortment. And so we're excited and encouraged to see strength -- across double-digit growth across all key categories. Each one has unique stories, make up driven by this increased engagement in social activities, plus strong product trends that are highlighted through social media and new product growth that a spectrum of newness that's really working. So a collection of activity that's coming together, both product newness, marketing newness and engagement opportunities. Skincare, continued strength by both science-backed, clinically proven dermatologists recommended solutions. So that engagement that many people elevated through the pandemic has sustained. It's actually our fastest-growing category in the third quarter. Haircare, you know we've been driving that growth as a leader in haircare and strong trends, a healthy portfolio of newness that continues to drive great engagement. And then really all year, pleased with fragrance and bath. As I look and the innovation and engagement, I mentioned Gen Z being a part of that, and really the whole portfolio working quite well across that important category. As we look in the fourth quarter, again, not getting in, we won't get into any specifics right now. We're in the middle of holiday. And so there's a lot to cover. I wouldn't say there's anything jumping out uniquely for any category from a promotional standpoint. And we come in really with a focus in the fourth quarter of what we call gifting and glamming. And the gifting component is a mix of holiday-specific, but core items that serve all year long, and the team has done a nice job with a balance there. So we feel great about our assortment. It's -- again, we're encouraged by what we're seeing at this point in the holiday and confident that we'll be able to deliver a strong holiday across all of our categories. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [23] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Olivia Tong Cheang, Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division - MD &amp; Research Analyst [24] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I have 2 questions. First one on newness. Because you had a few brands that really anchored newness, and I would imagine contributed towards the upper end of your average ranges this year, so could you talk about your view on innovation, the level of innovation as you think about the next 12 months versus the prior 12? And then you also mentioned in your prepared comments that mass is outperforming for stage, but in your view, wasn't definitively trade down. So could we dig into that a little? Is there more newness in one versus the other? Or any other reason that you think that mass is starting to outperform prestige if it wasn't related to a stretched consumer. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David C. Kimbell, Ulta Beauty, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [25] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. So just on the broader idea of newness, it's important to our business and the beauty category always. And as I mentioned in our remarks, typically 20% to 30% of sales are new items, and that's the range that we will land this year and anticipate we'll be able to continue to be in that range going forward. As I -- we did -- Scott mentioned, we had some really important new brands in 2022. But we're excited and encouraged by the outlook. This category, both big brands like some mentioned, but also new and emerging brands that take off and connect. I mentioned a couple of those like Good Molecules, among others. So we've got a portfolio of brands as we look forward into next year and confident about newness, both new brands and newness from our existing brands. That plays a big role. And as we work with all of them and see their pipeline, we're encouraged by what we're seeing. The trends are strong across each of the categories. And we're seeing healthy growth. And we think newness will play an important part in that going forward, knowing that we've got some of these big brands that Scott mentioned earlier to launch or to lap. As it relates to the mass and prestige, we did see mass growing somewhat faster than prestige. But both sides were strong and healthy. So I wouldn't say the strength in mass or the somewhat higher growth in mass as we look at it and do -- and analyze our members didn't come at the expense of prestige. It's just a came because mass is strong and there's good newness brands like e.l.f., NYX, Ordinary, (inaudible) are strong, newness and engagement. And so they're just capturing and growing. But prestige is doing really well, too. So I don't look at them being a little bit higher than prestige as coming at the expense of just their -- several of these brands and some of our bigger brands are hitting the mark, and that's working. All of our analysis suggests that we have not seen clear signs of trade down. But I'd reinforce, if there is that, we are uniquely positioned to deliver and support our guests regardless of what choices they make from a price point. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [26] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael Lasser, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Analyst of Consumer Hardlines [27] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Scott, can you help stress test a couple of the key variables that are going to impact Ulta's gross overall operating margin in 2023 between the expense spending that you slated for this year and the step-up that you had originally planned for 2023. Is it reasonable that we think around about that as like a $50 million (inaudible) increase in the next year? And then the second part of the question, you're on pace to have a 15.5% to 15.6% operating margin this year. If you were to take the level of promotional activity from 2019 and apply it, all else being equal, to this year, is it reasonable that you would have like a 14.5% operating margin. So a worst case, if promotions go back to 2019 levels, that would be like 100 basis points to the operating margin. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Scott M. Settersten, Ulta Beauty, Inc. - CFO, Treasurer &amp; Assistant Secretary [28] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Is this the Michael Lasser that I know? I mean -- I appreciate your question, Michael. Yes, and I understand. But we can't -- we're not going to piecemeal out the bits and pieces of the variables and the formula for our EBIT margin for next year. It's just -- it's too hard, and that's why we said we would -- we'll update in March if it's appropriate, okay? And we kind of see how 2022 shakes out here in totality. And then look at our '23 plan, which we're in the heat of battle on right now, finalizing here, which the final step of that is as we get finalized through the holiday season, so to see what the numbers look like. So we either -- as I've laid out for Ike here a little bit earlier in the call, all the different variables and of course, they're all on wide continuums, right? And so we're doing our best to assess each one of those. And coming up with our best idea of how we think it's going to shake out for next year. Again, we're very optimistic about the long-term options for our business. I mean, we're in a great position. We've got lots of levers to push and pull, to deliver healthy operating margins over the long term. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kiley F. Rawlins, Ulta Beauty, Inc. - VP of IR [29] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- John, I think we have time for one more question, please. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [30] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And the final question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael Charles Binetti, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Research Analyst [31] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Maybe since you mentioned it a few times now, how much is shrink versus 2019 as a percent of sales? I'm wondering if that's becoming a meaningful number? And maybe you could just help us orient how much incentive comp influences the margin this year. I don't know if I heard that. And I guess, just maybe touching on Ike and Michael's question, you seem to be getting the higher margins the right way here with all the extra sales and gross profit dollars from driving the business and leveraging the fixed costs. You'll be at a revenue level this year, we didn't expect to see until 2024, and you're still seeing the algo next year. I know you gave the long list to Ike in the middle of the P&amp;L, but it feels like you earn some upside to the framework at that 13% to 14%. I'm just wondering if you can give us color on what you think relative to the framework you laid out remain structurally higher or what you think needs more investment than what you thought at the Analyst Day framework to bring all those extra dollars down to that [13 and 14]. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Scott M. Settersten, Ulta Beauty, Inc. - CFO, Treasurer &amp; Assistant Secretary [32] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, Michael. So working backwards. So the shrink part of your question, I mean, shrink when you think about our category, we are especially susceptible to some of the trends that you see across retail. But that's not new to us. We've been dealing with this since the very early days because of the category we operate in. So I want to make sure I say thank you to our teams, to our LP teams, our store operations teams and all the support personnel that have been working hard to try to mitigate the losses that we've seen step up here, accelerate over the last couple of years. Again, when times get tough, shrink goes up. We've seen that in retail over a long period of time. On the incentive compensation, I would say, we -- for the year, it's going to be flattish versus 2021. Again, our performance has been super strong this year. And then back to the operating margin question, which everyone has, again, we really can't provide any more quantitative detail at this point in time. I would just point back to the long laundry list of different variables that I described earlier in the call. And just that we're a pragmatic team. We're trying to optimize with all the things that we have, the challenges and the opportunities, we're going to do our best to lean in where we can and try to optimize and deliver the best overall financial performance that we're capable of, whether it's the fourth quarter or 2023. You can rely on us for that. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David C. Kimbell, Ulta Beauty, Inc. - CEO &amp; Director [33] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- All right. With that, I'm going to wrap it up. But I want to first thank you. Thank you for your interest and engagement in Ulta Beauty. And I want to close by thanking our more than 40,000 Ulta Beauty associates for delivering another excellent quarter, while also executing against our strategic priorities. Our teams have been working hard to get our stores, digital channels and DCs ready for this holiday season, and I sincerely appreciate their focus and commitment to delivering meaningful guest experiences across every single touch point. We hope you all have a happy and healthy holiday season, and we look forward to speaking to all of you again in early March when we report results for fiscal 2022 and share our plans for fiscal 2023. Have a great evening, everybody. Thanks again. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [34] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.]"

Amyloid plaque and P-tau are key biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and their reduction is likely to predict clinical benefit in the treatment of early Alzheimer's disease.In the study, which assessed donanemab’s superiority over Aduhelm on amyloid plaque reduction, donanemab met all primary and secondary endpoints for the six-month primary outcome analysis. The data were presented at the 15th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease conference. The data represented the first active comparator data on amyloid plaque clearance in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease treated with amyloid-targeting therapies.The data showed that 37.9% of donanemab-treated participants experienced brain amyloid clearance compared with 1.6% of Aduhelm-treated patients at six months. Brain amyloid plaque clearance was defined as achieving brain amyloid plaque levels of &lt;24.1 Centiloids.  Donanemab reduced brain amyloid plaque levels versus baseline by 65.2% compared with 17.0% for Aduhelm at six months, thereby meeting a key secondary outcome. In an exploratory outcome, donanemab treatment significantly reduced plasma P-tau217 at six months compared to baseline.As far as the safety profile of the candidates is concerned, the incidence of total amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), a brain swelling side effect associated with anti-amyloid antibodies, was 26.1% in the Aduhelm arm compared to 25.4% in the donanemab arm. Importantly, though treatment with donanemab led to much greater amyloid clearance than Aduhelm, it was not associated with a higher rate of ARIA.Story continuesEli Lilly’s biologics license application (BLA) seeking accelerated approval of donanemab, based on data from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study, is already under priority review with the FDA. A decision is expected in early 2023.Lilly also expects a data readout from the pivotal phase III TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 by mid-2023, which, if positive, will form the basis of its application for traditional regulatory approval for donanemab.Lilly’s stock has risen 34.4% this year so far compared with an increase of 8.7% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBiogen Aduhelm’s FDA approval in June 2021 faced a lot of criticism about its mixed efficacy results, the FDA selection of the accelerated approval path and the regulatory process in general. The FDA approved Aduhelm despite an FDA advisory committee voting against its approval due to mixed outcomes data from ENGAGE and EMERGE phase III studies. All these issues affected demand, patient access and reimbursement for Aduhelm, which resulted in the slow launch. Eventually, Biogen decided to substantially wind down commercial operations of Aduhelm after Medicare limited the coverage for Aduhelm to only for patients enrolled in CMS-approved studies as its efficacy was under question.Earlier this week, Biogen’s Japanese partner, Eisai presented detailed data from their large phase III confirmatory study, Clarity AD, on another anti-amyloid beta protofibril antibody candidate lecanemab to treat early Alzheimer’s disease at the CTAD conference. The data showed that Biogen’s candidate did reduce markers of amyloid in early Alzheimer’s disease and led to moderately less decline in measures of cognition and function than placebo at 18 months. However, the treatment with lecanemab was associated with adverse events.Biogen/Eisai have already filed their BLA seeking accelerated approval for lecanemab with the FDA. The BLA was supported by data from a phase II study (Study 201). The FDA accepted the BLA and granted priority review to the same. The FDA’s decision is expected on Jan 6, 2023.Eisai plans to file for traditional approval of lecanemab in the United States and submit regulatory applications in the EU and Japan by the end of the first quarter of 2023 based on data from the Clarity AD studyBiogen has developed lecanemab in collaboration with Eisai, with the latter leading the clinical development and regulatory submissionsRoche’s RHHBY phase III GRADUATE I and II studies on gantenerumab, also an anti-amyloid beta antibody, failed to meet the primary endpoint of slowing clinical decline in people with early Alzheimer’s disease earlier this month. In the study, participants treated with gantenerumab showed a slowing of the clinical decline of -0.31 and -0.19, respectively in the GRADUATE I and GRADUATE II studies from the baseline score on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes scale. However, this decline was not statistically significant in either of the studies. This represented a relative reduction in the clinical decline of 8% in GRADUATE I and 6% in GRADUATE II compared with placebo. The level of beta-amyloid removal by gantenerumab was less than expected. Roche was developing the candidate in collaboration with MorphoSys.Zacks Rank &amp; Stock to ConsiderEli Lilly has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently.

But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) shareholders have seen the share price rise 58% over three years, well in excess of the market return (28%, not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 3.3% in the last year , including dividends .Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Textron In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Textron was able to grow its EPS at 3.1% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. In comparison, the 17% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Textron has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Textron has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 3.3% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 6% per year, is even more impressive. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute.

364,9f7a7b78-4a80-3940-ac08-dcfbcb9476d4,KO,2022-12-02,Investing in Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) five years ago would have delivered you a 63% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-coca-cola-nyse-ko-110107070.html,1669978867,STORY,['KO'],"[If you buy and hold a stock for many years, you'd hope to be making a profit. But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 39% over five years, which is below the market return. However, more recent buyers should be happy with the increase of 20% over the last year.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Coca-Cola achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 17% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 7% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Coca-Cola has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Coca-Cola, it has a TSR of 63% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Coca-Cola has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 24% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 10% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Coca-Cola better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Coca-Cola has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

365,623dec68-4fee-3025-afa4-1a4022966e54,KO,2022-12-02,We Ran A Stock Scan For Earnings Growth And Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (AMS:CCEP) Passed With Ease,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ran-stock-scan-earnings-growth-052401344.html,1669958641,STORY,['KO'],"[Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (AMS:CCEP). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Coca-Cola Europacific Partners with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners How Fast Is Coca-Cola Europacific Partners Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Coca-Cola Europacific Partners managed to grow EPS by 14% per year, over three years. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The music to the ears of Coca-Cola Europacific Partners shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 10% to 12% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. That's great to see, on both counts.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners' future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Coca-Cola Europacific Partners Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Investors are always searching for a vote of confidence in the companies they hold and insider buying is one of the key indicators for optimism on the market. Because often, the purchase of stock is a sign that the buyer views it as undervalued. However, small purchases are not always indicative of conviction, and insiders don't always get it right.The real kicker here is that Coca-Cola Europacific Partners insiders spent a staggering €1.3m on acquiring shares in just one year, without single share being sold in the meantime. Buying like that is a fantastic look for the company and should rouse the market in anticipation for the future. It is also worth noting that it was CEO &amp; Executive Director Damian Gammell who made the biggest single purchase, worth €913k, paying €45.89 per share.On top of the insider buying, it's good to see that Coca-Cola Europacific Partners insiders have a valuable investment in the business. Indeed, they hold €29m worth of its stock. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Despite being just 0.1% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.Does Coca-Cola Europacific Partners Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners is a growing business, which is encouraging. On top of that, we've seen insiders buying shares even though they already own plenty. These factors alone make the company an interesting prospect for your watchlist, as well as continuing research. You still need to take note of risks, for example - Coca-Cola Europacific Partners has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. So if you like the sound of Coca-Cola Europacific Partners, you'll probably love this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

Credit Builder offers a line of credit and a secured savings account enabling members to build their credit while building up savings. By combining SeedFi’s Credit Builder technology with Credit Karma’s long standing relationships with credit bureaus and others in the credit ecosystem, Intuit will be able to move with greater speed and scale to help Credit Karma members make financial progress.Late last year, Credit Karma entered into a partnership with SeedFi to offer Credit Builder to its members, enabling them to make regular payments, starting with as little as $20 per month or $10 per paycheck. By reporting these payments to the credit bureaus, members took steps toward improving their financial health. Through this partnership, members increased their score by an average of 21 points in as little as 30 to 45 days2 and built up over $10 million in savings. This acquisition will enable Credit Karma Money to continue to build on that momentum and help put more members on a path to financial security.""Credit Karma Money was built to change consumers’ relationship with money and help them develop responsible financial habits, like staying on top of their bills and spending within their means,"" said Poulomi Damany, SVP and GM for Credit Karma Money and Tax. ""With Credit Builder, we are able to differentiate ourselves as one of the best accounts for building credit. We have long standing relationships with credit bureaus and others in the credit ecosystem, and SeedFi has built great technology, so when combined, we will move even faster and build products to help more members, including those who need it the most.""Story continuesA recent study from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) showed that nearly three-quarters of Americans with no emergency savings have credit scores below 660. The correlation between low credit scores and lack of emergency savings persists over time, and SeedFi takes that problem head-on. Similar to Credit Karma, SeedFi’s mission is to break the cycle of debt and help Americans realize their financial potential.""We have already been working with the Credit Karma Money team for over a year to help members build their credit score and have been impressed with how Credit Karma’s mission comes through in everything the company does.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Progressive Progressive Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe President of Personal Lines, Patrick Callahan, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.4m worth of shares at a price of US$126 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$131. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was 59% of Patrick Callahan's stake.Insiders in Progressive didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Progressive better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Progressive Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Progressive shares. In total, President of Personal Lines Patrick Callahan sold US$2.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Progressive insiders own 0.3% of the company, currently worth about US$240m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Progressive Tell Us?An insider hasn't bought Progressive stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Progressive you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

It was first easing in more than three years of a U.S. ban on imports from the South American nation. A further relaxation may follow if Caracas and opposition leaders agree on terms of a presidential election, Washington has said.Valero Energy Corp, PBF Energy and Citgo Petroleum have shown interest in getting access to the oil Chevron is expecting in coming weeks, according to the people.Valero, PBF and PDVSA did not reply to requests for comment. A Chevron spokesperson said it does not comment on commercial matters. A spokesperson for Citgo declined to comment.Venezuelan heavy crude grades, popular among U.S. refiners for producing products from asphalt to motor fuels, had been partially replaced by Russian supplies in the aftermath of sanctions on Venezuela.Some of these companies this week began contacting Chevron, shipping agencies and vessel owners to check timetables, the sources added. No Venezuelan oil officially has been allocated to Chevron yet and no chartering contracts have been signed to transport cargoes to the United States, according to Venezuelan export schedules and Refinitiv freight data.EAGER REFINERSThe most recent chartering contracts to transport Venezuelan oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast are from late 2018, right before sanctions, the Refinitiv data showed.Valero, PBF and other U.S. independent refiners would not need any new authorization to buy Venezuelan oil from Chevron. But Citgo, owned by Venezuela's PDVSA, may require clearance from the U.S. Treasury Department since it operates under a license, analysts and experts said.Story continuesChevron could prioritize its own refineries, especially Pascagoula, Mississippi, and El Segundo, California, which were regular receivers of Venezuela oil in the past.On Thursday, Chevron CEO Michael Wirth said the company is not likely to add investment to boost Venezuela's output in the next six months as the sanctions framework will take time to be eased. The primary effect will be to allow some Venezuelan oil to flow back to the United States, ""which will help the U.S. refining system,"" Wirth said.A total lifting of sanctions is unlikely in the near term, said analysts, but Venezuela's former customers, its business partners and creditors are taking steps to collect pending debts in the wake of the Chevron authorization. Washington has not signaled it would authorize other companies to collect on those debts.ROAD TO EXPORTSBecause spring and summer in the United States are the most active seasons for asphalt paving and peak driving, Venezuela's heavy Boscan crude produced by Chevron and PDVSA at their Petroboscan project could be the first exported.To restart those shipments, dredging Maracaibo Lake's navigation channel might be needed to allow Panamax and Aframax tankers reach Venezuela's western oil terminals, shipping sources said.A glut of Boscan crude in storage earlier this year forced a total shutdown of its processing. Draining those stocks must come first to restart output, PDVSA documents showed.There are separate stocks of Hamaca oil and diluted crude for immediate export at the nation's largest terminal. But as of Nov. 29, there were only 1.47 million barrels available, enough for only two cargoes, according to the PDVSA documents.Petropiar's crude upgrader, operated by PDVSA and Chevron, was halted last week over a naphtha leak. It restarted days later to produce about 100,000 barrels per day of Hamaca.In November, PDVSA sent 1.2 million barrels of Hamaca to its refineries for processing. About 1 million barrels of fuel oil were also shipped from Petropiar to Iran's state firm Naftiran Intertrade Co LTD (NICO) as part of an oil swap, the documents showed.(Reporting by Marianna Parraga; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Safest Stocks To Invest In. The stock market outlook for 2023 is rather dismal as per the majority of Wall Street analysts. According to Deutsche Bank, global stocks are forecasted to plummet sharply by mid-2023 as a recession threatens to hit the United States. David Folkerts-Landau, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note: ""We see major stock markets plunging 25% from levels somewhat above today's when the US recession hits, but then recovering fully by year-end 2023, assuming the recession lasts only several quarters."" In the United States, analysts forecast the S&amp;P 500 to rally to 4,500 in the first half of 2023, then a selloff of more than 25% in the third quarter, before recovering back to 4,500 by the end of the year. In an effort to control the 40-year high inflation, the Federal Reserve will continue to raise rates, albeit at a slower pace than 2022, which will eventually tip the economy towards a full blown recession in 2023. While some money managers are predicting a recession, others believe that the global economy will be hit with stagflation instead, which is a period of high inflation and high unemployment. Whatever may be the fate of the US economy next year, it is important for investors to safeguard their money and construct a safe equity portfolio, consisting of defensive names like Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT). Our Methodology The following stocks are defensive, enjoy strong market visibility, display solid dividend profiles, and have a prominent history of surviving market downturns. This qualifies the following companies as safe investments in a volatile economic environment. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. Story continues12 Safest Stocks To Invest InPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashSafest Stocks To Invest In12.

It offers a portfolio of approximately 500 beer brands, including Budweiser, Corona, and Stella Artois. For full-year 2022, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) expects its FY22 EBITDA to grow between 6%-8% and the revenue to trail ahead of EBITDA from a solid combination of volume and price. On November 28, JPMorgan analyst Jared Dinges upgraded Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) to Overweight from Underweight with a price target of $70, up from $45. The analyst sees ""scope for earnings outperformance"" and said the company's ""rapidly deleveraging balance sheet provides optionality."" Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD)’s transition to a ""higher-quality top-line growth story is well underway,"" the analyst told investors in a research note. He views AB InBev's valuation as attractive at present levels.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 14 hedge funds were long Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) at the end of Q3 2022, with collective stakes worth $740.2 million. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 9.2 million shares valued at approximately $419 million. Like Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) is one of the safest stocks to monitor. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Large Cap Growth Strategy has to say about Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“To make room for these new names and optimize the growth profile of the Strategy, we exited two additional positions during the quarter. We sold out of Anheuser-Busch InBev as we see too much work ahead for the world’s largest beer maker to re-ignite sales growth post COVID-19. While the company should benefit from a recovery in the on-premise channel, individual country complexities, the hedging of raw materials, and senior management turnover leave us more confident in the Strategy’s other reopening-related holdings.”11. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) is a London-based fast moving consumer goods company. It operates through Beauty &amp; Personal Care, Foods &amp; Refreshment, and Home Care segments. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) is one of the safest stocks to add to a portfolio.

Inspired by the growing demand for hygiene products, the Lifebuoy brand of soaps was launched to ‘make health infectious’. 128 years later the Lifebuoy brand continues as a leading soap brand – albeit without the coal tar-derived ingredients list. In fact, the market research firm Kantar ranked Lifebuoy as the global #3 most chosen FMCG brand in 2020, just below Coca-Cola (KO) and Colgate (CL) – an astonishing fact given the age of the brand. While the brand is largely absent from shelves here in the UK, it is a juggernaut in Asian markets, and is the #1 brand in India.There are two observations about the Lifebuoy story which tell us a lot about Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL), which is currently our largest holding in the Fund.The first is the enduring power of brands in the consumer goods market. According to Kantar’s list of most chosen brands, the top 20 global marques have an average age of 116 years, with over half being founded in the 19th century. Fashions come and go, but there is something special about low-cost consumable goods that advantages strong, time-worn brand names…” (Click here to view full text)10. Dollar Tree, Inc.

For those that fail to purchase Trojans, the company also offers pregnancy test kits (First Response). Joking aside, the company’s revenue has historically grown by GDP+ rates organically. Combined with thoughtful acquisitions, 10-year revenue growth has averaged +6.6%, which has translated to EPS growth of over +11% per year. The company has accomplished all this with ½ of the overall volatility of the stock market. The company reported Q4 2020 earnings on January 29th, beating both top (revenue +14% YoY) and bottom line measures (EPS $0.59 vs $0.51 expected).

The respite was followed by the resumption of talks by Venezuela’s political groups with a deal to work together on a humanitarian spending plan.The oil major received a six-month license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, OFAC. The new policy authorizes the company to produce crude oil and petroleum products in its projects in Venezuela.While no new drilling is approved, CVX will be able to overhaul and do the maintenance of oil fields. The decision allows the San Ramon, CA-based company to revive existing oil projects in Venezuela and bring new oil supplies to refiners in the United States.However, the arrangement limits cash payments to Venezuela, which could reduce the amount of oil available to Chevron. Per the new policy, profits from the sale of energy will be directed to paying down the debt owed to CVX rather than providing profits to the Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA.U.S. sanctions against Venezuela were introduced in 2019 by the Trump administration. In 2020, before the United States ordered a complete halt of drilling operations, Chevron’s share of Venezuelan crude oil output was 15,000 barrels a day.The current U.S. dispensation’s decision to ease some of those sanctions came after the resumption of talks over the weekend between the government of Nicolas Maduro and the Venezuelan opposition. The talks led to the signing of a U.S.-brokered accord between the government and the opposition to resolve the country’s political turmoil.Chevron, the American oil major, is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world with operations spanning worldwide. The only energy component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, CVX is fully integrated as it participates in every aspect related to energy, from oil production to refining and marketing.Story continuesChevron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

388,0cb16ee2-fdb6-324a-af07-d6881a99a474,UNH,2022-12-02,Wall Street Analysts Look Bullish on UnitedHealth (UNH): Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-look-bullish-150403188.html,1669907043,STORY,['UNH'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about UnitedHealth Group (UNH) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.UnitedHealth currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.45, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 19 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.45 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 19 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 13 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 68.4% and 15.8% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for UNHBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for UNHCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for UnitedHealth here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying UnitedHealth, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in UNH?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for UnitedHealth, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $22.01.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for UnitedHealth. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for UnitedHealth may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The program is designed to transform organizational culture, remove the stigma associated with seeking mental health support and offer nurses a new burnout prevention model to help them use mental health resources earlier and more effectively. It stands out from other programs because it will emphasize and validate the voices and needs of millennial and Generation Z nurses, as well as nurses of color to ensure their unique experiences are recognized and addressed.""Given the complexity, intensity and intimacy of what nurses do every day, nurses’ need for mental health support has always existed. This has been exacerbated tenfold by the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Kate Judge, executive director of the American Nurses Foundation. ""Burnout cannot just be addressed one nurse at a time. This new partnership addresses burnout at the systems level, especially for those most impacted including younger nurses and nurses of color.""Nurses are facing mental, emotional and physical burdens from the demands of health care during the persistent and unpredictable COVID-19 pandemic. The American Nurses Foundation will pilot the program, implemented as a train-the-trainer model, in four health care organizations representing over 15,000 nurses in rural and urban locations in acute, primary, and long-term care settings. Participating health systems include BayCare Health in Tampa Bay, Fla.; Indiana University Health in locations throughout Indiana; University of South Alabama Health Hospital in Mobile, Ala.; and Wayne Health Care in Newark, N.Y. Learnings from these pilot sites will be used to iterate and evolve into a national awareness campaign reaching over 50,000 nurses nationwide.Story continues""Few could have predicted how unprecedented and demanding the past two and a half years have been for all of us, let alone our country’s nursing staff,"" said Mary Jo Jerde, RN and senior vice president of the UnitedHealth Group Center for Clinician Advancement. ""Nurses have played a vital role throughout this critical period and we’re committed to ensuring they have the resources they need to deliver care across the country.""The pilot program is based on a framework originally developed for the military and since deployed in other demanding professions. It is designed to identify and reduce stress reactions before they develop into lasting issues. It goes beyond identification of burnout to intervention by helping nurses speak about their stress/burnout using a common language, normalize talking about it, and provide support to their peers. Program learnings will also be incorporated into a national awareness and education campaign, providing free anti-burnout resources for frontline nurses and nurse leaders.The new partnership addresses findings from the most recent Pulse on the Nation’s Nurses Survey, indicating the impact of the pandemic:Nurses reported high levels of feeling stressed (71%), frustrated (69%), exhausted (65%), burned out (49%), and overwhelmed (58%).Millennial and Generation Z nurses (age 34 and under) conveyed these feelings more than their older counterparts: stressed (81%), frustrated (76%), exhausted (77%) , burned out (69%) and overwhelmed (69%).Nurses of color echoed these feelings. They report feeling stressed (73%) and burned out (55%).Additionally, an American Nurses Foundation survey in August 2021 found that 34% of nurses do not feel emotionally healthy and 42% report experiencing trauma because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Fifty percent of nurse respondents said they are considering leaving the profession.This commitment is one of the many ways UnitedHealth Group is working to advance health equity by ensuring every person, regardless of race, place, or circumstance, has the opportunity to live their healthiest life. In 2020, the United Health Foundation also teamed with the American Academy of Family Physicians on a program to address burnout among our nation’s family physicians. Since the start of the pandemic, the American Nurses Foundation has invested in resources and programs focused specifically on addressing nurses’ mental health as well as examining their unique experiences responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.About the American Nurses FoundationThe American Nurses Foundation is the charitable and philanthropic arm of the American Nurses Association (ANA), with the mission to transform the nation’s health through the power of nursing. The Foundation supports research, education, and scholarships, which improve health, wellness and patient care.

390,3e10255d-2629-3c4b-b17b-9bfd2228082d,EL,2022-12-02,Calculating The Fair Value Of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-est-e-110132655.html,1669978892,STORY,['EL'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.81bUS$2.46bUS$3.00bUS$3.91bUS$4.21bUS$4.43bUS$4.62bUS$4.79bUS$4.94bUS$5.08bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x11Analyst x9Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 5.36%Est @ 4.35%Est @ 3.64%Est @ 3.14%Est @ 2.79% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% US$1.7kUS$2.1kUS$2.4kUS$3.0kUS$3.0kUS$2.9kUS$2.9kUS$2.8kUS$2.7kUS$2.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$26bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.1b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.0%) = US$101bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$101b÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$51bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$77b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$232, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Estée Lauder Companies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.995. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Dividend companies with solid dividend growth tracks have outperformed the broader index historically and dividends have shown significant growth during inflationary periods, according to a report by Fidelity.According to a report by CME Group, dividend payouts grew by 12%  and 116% during the high inflation decades of the 2000s and the 2010s, respectively. This gain is widely attributed to the growth in corporate profits during these decades.Many reports have revealed the strong performance of dividend equities during inflationary periods, making investors turn toward them. Guinness Atkinson Funds reported that the S&amp;P 500 surpassed the rate of inflation by over three times from December 1940 to April 2015. The report also mentioned that during 53 calendar years from 1962 through 2014, the market declined 15 times, but the inclusion of dividend payments for each year took the negative years to 11.In view of these arguments, we will discuss the best dividend stocks for passive income.Photo by Dan Dennis on Unsplash Our Methodology:The stocks mentioned below are reliable options for generating passive income as these companies pay regular dividends to shareholders.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Stagflation Stocks To Buy. Stagflation Definition: What is Stagflation?Stagflation refers to consistently high inflation paired with peak unemployment and slow demand. While economists initially believed that stagflation was a foreign concept, as unemployment and inflation rates usually move in different directions, they learned after the ‘Great Inflation’ in 1970s that stagflation is indeed real and it can batter an economy. The term stagflation was coined in 1965 when Iain Macleod, a British Conservative Party politician, said in a House of Commons speech:""We now have the worst of both worlds — not just inflation on the one side or stagnation on the other, but both of them together. We have a sort of 'stagflation' situation and history in modern terms is indeed being made.""Stagflation favors defensive companies whose products and services are necessary for people’s day-to-day lives. This means their share prices often stay resilient despite a slowing macro backdrop. In quantitative terms, defensive sectors usually have a market beta of under 1, which means they outperform when the benchmark index declines, whereas cyclical sectors have a market beta of more than 1, indicating underperformance when the index falls. Utilities, energy, consumer staples, healthcare, and real estate are some of the defensive sectors that perform well, whereas their cyclical counterparts like technology, industrials, and financials take a hit during stagflation economies. Jonathan Wright, professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University, explained that stagflation may occur if a recession is triggered before inflation is limited to where the Federal Reserve wants it to be. Stagflation remains the primary risk for the global economy in 2023, according to Wall Street experts who believe that any rally in equity markets is too unsustainable following the severe selloff in 2022. Nicole Kornitzer, a Paris-based portfolio manager at Kornitzer Capital Management Inc, told Bloomberg on November 28: Story continues“Next year is still going to be difficult. Definitely, stagflation is the outlook for now.” A majority of Wall Street experts believe that the stock market is heading towards stagflation in 2023, similar to the 1970s, as per Bank of America. In its most recent survey of fund managers, BofA found that 92% of them see a period of high inflation and low economic growth in 2023, while 0% foresee a bullish ""goldilocks"" scenario, where the economy evades a recession and inflation declines.Some of the best stagflation stocks to buy include AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Stagflation Definition: 10 Best Stagflation Stocks To BuyPhoto by Mirza Babic on UnsplashOur Methodology For this article, we selected stocks which are defensive in nature, offer strong market visibility, have resilient dividend profiles, and display a longstanding history of surviving volatile market environments.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”7. eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42eBay Inc.

We wouldn’t have done well if we bought it in the early years of that bear market, or even five years later. If you think this bear will be shorter and or less damaging than the dotcom bear market of 2000-2003, you could be showing your inexperience!.”6. Crown Castle Inc.

(NYSE:CCI) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“U.S. communications company Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI) was the largest detractor from quarterly performance. Crown Castle is the leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure in the U.S. with a portfolio of approximately 40,000 towers. The stock underperformed as, driven by rising interest rates, investors rotated away from defensive into more value-oriented sectors. Communications infrastructure remains attractive, however, as companies continue to deploy greater capital spend to support the strong tailwinds from 5G.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stagflation Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:11 Best Delivery Stocks To Buy12 Best Falling Stocks To Buy Now12 Best ESG Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. Stagflation Definition: 10 Best Stagflation Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The ongoing supply-chain constraints have been pinching the margins of industry players due to higher freight and input costs. Also, elevated advertising and sales promotion spending is expected to dent margins in the near term. Some of the players have been undertaking cost-curtailment actions to support margins, while coming up with the latest products and improved marketing efforts.Nevertheless, continued solid demand for consumer products and brands, cost-saving efforts, strong execution, and pricing actions have been aiding industry participants. Companies focused on transforming operations, digital commerce growth, innovation and brand building have been gaining amid the macro hardships. Companies like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company PG, Reckitt Benckiser Group RBGLY, Henkel AG &amp; Co. HENKY, Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. CHD and The Clorox Company CLX have stayed upright on these efforts despite the continued cost inflation.About the IndustryCompanies involved in the manufacturing and supply of fast-moving consumer goods, including personal care, household and specialty products, primarily make up the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry. The personal care segment comprises skin and hair care products, deodorants, and oral care items. The household category covers home care products, including laundry care, house cleaning agents, bleaching products, air care, dishwashing liquids and other cleaning items. Laundry detergent is one of the largest markets among the above-mentioned ones. A few players in this space also offer baby and feminine care items. Some companies offer pet care products. These companies market and sell products through supermarkets, mass merchandisers, grocery stores, distributors, wholesalers, department stores, drugstores, specialty stores, dollar stores and pet stores, and websites.Story continuesMajor Trends Shaping the Future of the Soaps &amp; Cleaning Materials IndustryElevated Costs: The soaps and cleaning materials industry players have been grappling with escalating raw material and logistic costs, particularly transportation, due to supply-chain disruptions and current industry dynamics. Higher-than-anticipated commodity and freight costs have been hurting the industry participants’ margins. Elevated manufacturing and distribution costs, as well as increased advertising and sales promotion expenses, are other factors impacting margins. Additionally, the companies have been incurring higher SG&amp;A expenses on account of increased operational costs related to salaries and bonuses, as well as planned investments in digital capabilities and productivity enhancements. To overcome these shortcomings and improve margins, some of the players are focusing on cost-containment initiatives, including streamlining the supply chain and minimizing overhead costs, among others. Most companies are resorting to price increases to cushion their margins.Demand Trends &amp; Competition: The soaps and cleaning materials industry has been experiencing volatile demand trends across markets and ambiguous pricing conditions. Post the COVID-19 pandemic, increased awareness about personal and household hygiene are likely to fuel product demand for the players in the industry. The cultivation of new habits, including maintaining good hygiene, especially sanitizing hands, is likely to continue to encourage consumers to purchase soaps and sanitizers. Meanwhile, the industry players are at risk of increased competition due to the availability of alternate products in the market. With the rise in competition, players remain focused on actively coming up with hygiene campaigns, which are anticipated to promote their products and expand their customer bases.Product Innovation &amp; Strategic Efforts: Investments in product development to suit consumers’ changing needs have been supporting the companies in the soaps and cleaning products space. Investments in innovation, product portfolio and digital capabilities have been the key to driving sales of companies. Additionally, the players have been undertaking pricing, packaging and marketing initiatives, along with restructuring actions, including acquisitions and divestitures. Companies are also looking to expand into new markets and channels. Developing products with eco-friendly and natural ingredients is another area of focus among industry players, as consumers increasingly prefer environment-friendly ingredients in their daily use items. The online availability of products has been another key sales driver across various markets due to convenience and ease of shopping. Consumer goods companies are undertaking pricing and productivity efforts to counter inflation, which are likely to continue.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #157, which places it in the bottom 37% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. In the past year, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2022 have declined 9.7%.Despite the murky scenario, we will present a few stocks that one can retain in their portfolio, given their solid growth endeavors. But before that, it is worth taking a look at the industry’s performance and current valuation.Industry Vs. Broader MarketThe Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index in the past year. However, it has lagged the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector in the same period.The industry has lost 2.1% in the past year compared with the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 15.1%. Meanwhile, the broader sector has gained 1.3%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing Consumer Staples stocks, the industry is currently trading at 22.78X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 17.59X and the sector’s 19.13X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 25.13X and as low as 17.56X, the median being 22.1X, as the chart below shows.Price-to-Earnings Ratio (Past 5 Years)5 Stocks to Keep a Close Eye onProcter &amp; Gamble: The Cincinnati, OH-based consumer goods giant has been benefiting from strength across all segments, coupled with robust volume, pricing and mix. Procter &amp; Gamble’s products play a key role in meeting the daily health, hygiene and cleaning needs of consumers worldwide. Increased consumer demand for its hand soaps, detergents and surface cleaning products has been a key catalyst. The company has been witnessing strong growth in two of its largest markets, the United States and Greater China. The company’s e-commerce sales have been growing globally.Procter &amp; Gamble is focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins.

(NASDAQ:SRCL) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 19% in the last month. But if you look at the last five years the returns have not been good. In fact, the share price is down 21%, which falls well short of the return you could get by buying an index fund.It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that. Check out our latest analysis for Stericycle While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Stericycle moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we are surprised to see the share price is down. Other metrics may better explain the share price move.Arguably, the revenue drop of 8.0% a year for half a decade suggests that the company can't grow in the long term. This has probably encouraged some shareholders to sell down the stock.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe know that Stericycle has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? If you are thinking of buying or selling Stericycle stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.A Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Stericycle returned a loss of 9.3% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 15%. Given the total loss of 4% per year over five years, it seems returns have deteriorated in the last twelve months. Whilst Baron Rothschild does tell the investor ""buy when there's blood in the streets, even if the blood is your own"", buyers would need to examine the data carefully to be comfortable that the business itself is sound. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Stericycle (including 1 which shouldn't be ignored) .Story continuesOf course Stericycle may not be the best stock to buy.

TOL is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Oct 31, 2022) results on Dec 6, after the closing bell.In the last-reported quarter, the company’s earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.2% and 0.4%, respectively. The said metrics also increased 25.7% and 10.6%, respectively, from the prior year on the back of higher pricing.On an encouraging note, earnings topped analysts’ expectations in 18 of the 19 trailing quarters.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings has decreased to $3.88 per share from $3.93 over the past 30 days. The said figure indicates a 28.5% rise from the year-ago earnings of $3.02 per share. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $3.22 billion, suggesting a 5.7% year-over-year rise.Toll Brothers Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseToll Brothers Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseToll Brothers Inc. price-eps-surprise | Toll Brothers Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteDespite unprecedented supply-chain issues and increased inflation, Toll Brothers’ fourth-quarter revenues are expected to have increased from the year-ago level, buoyed by a lack of available supply. Home sales of this luxury homebuilding company are expected to have increased in the fiscal fourth quarter from the year-ago level, given higher pricing.Also, its focus on luxury move-up buyers — who already possess a residence and are looking to shift to larger and better homes — has been commendable. Toll Brothers has been enjoying greater pricing power than other homebuilding companies as these homebuyers are less sensitive to price changes. The company has been benefiting from the strategy of broadening its product lines, price points and geographies.During the fiscal third-quarter earnings call, TOL highlighted that it expects home deliveries of 3,250-3,550 units (indicating a rise at the mid-point from 3,341 units delivered in the prior-year quarter) at an average selling price or ASP of $935,000-$955,000 (suggesting a rise from $883,100 a year ago).Toll Brothers expects the adjusted home sales gross margin to be 29.2%, implying a rise from 25.9% recorded in the year-ago period. SG&amp;A expenses are estimated to be 8.7% of home sales revenues, indicating a decline from 8.8% in the year-ago period. Also, the company expects the effective tax rate to be 24.8%.Meanwhile, higher land, labor and raw material costs are expected to have put pressure on fiscal fourth-quarter margins. Continued supply-chain disruptions in the industry are expected to have reflected in the company’s performance.EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the backlog is pegged at 8,768 units, indicating a decline from $10,302 million a year ago. The same for the average price of the backlog is pegged at $1,052,000, implying a rise from the year-ago figure of $922,000. The consensus estimate for net signed contracts is pegged at 1.463 units. This indicates a decline from the prior-year figure of 2,957 units.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Toll Brothers this time around. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -7.95%.

Horton’s fiscal 2022 results were highlighted by 42% improvement in pre-tax income, 350 basis point expansion in pre-tax profit margin and 21% increase in revenues. These results reflect production capabilities, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands.United Rentals, Inc. URI reported third-quarter 2022 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same. The company has been gaining from the sustained demand in its end markets and the strength of its core rental business.URI also lifted its full-year guidance for total revenues and adjusted EBITDA, given broad-based end-market activity, contractor backlogs, customer sentiment and solid visibility.Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.

The group received a warm welcome from American team members at the airport and a police escort to the hotel, where hundreds of people gathered for a welcome procession at Mandalay Bay. This weekend, they will participate in a variety of activities, including dinners, live performances, musicals, and a tour of the Hoover Dam and Red Rock Canyon. The trip promotes fun, relaxation, and healing and serves as a small thank you for their service.""This Veterans Day weekend serves as a unique opportunity for me and my fellow servicemembers to build on our experiences and the camaraderie that we've built during our service to this great nation,"" said Army Veteran Jeremy Haynes. ""But it would not be possible without the support of MGM Resorts, USO and American Airlines, as they put a lot of effort to ensure that we recognize and celebrate those who have served our country.""Story continuesAmerican supports the military community year-round, which includes supporting nonprofit organizations and utilizing its fleet of aircraft for special missions like Salute to the Troops.

Shares have added about 8.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Eaton due for a pullback?

Total revenues improved 7.9% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues gained from a 15% increase in organic sales and acquisitions added 1%. These positives were offset by a 4% decline from divestitures and a 4% decrease from a negative currency translation.Segmental DetailsElectrical Americas’ total third-quarter sales were $2,179 million, up 18% from the year-ago level.

Operating profits were $185 million, up 13% year over year.Vehicle’s total sales were $744 million, up 16% from the year-ago quarter due to an increase in organic sales, partially offset by negative currency translation. Operating profits were $125 million, up 9% year over year.The eMobility segment’s total sales were $137 million, up 63% year over year due to an improvement in organic sales and the acquisition of Royal Power Solutions, offset marginally by a negative currency translation.

Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D.

Their 71-year marriage rooted in faith and tradition, they loved family gatherings, and Sundays were reserved for singing in the church choir followed by a home-cooked lunch with children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and friends.Aflac Incorporated, Thursday, December 1, 2022, Press release picturePhoto: The Armstrong family celebrates the holiday season with their collection of Aflac Holiday Ducks from years past.""Every Sunday,"" recalled daughter Kim Wallace from her home in Hickory Tavern, South Carolina, a little less than a mile from the house her parents called home. ""We'd all stand in a circle, hold hands and my father would say the blessing. He'd always end with ‘now shake a little love' and we'd all shake the hands we were holding. Our little tradition.""Holidays held their own special family traditions, she says. When a Christmas shopping trip in 2001 led Nan and John into Macy's department store in nearby Greenville, they weren't expecting the small gift they left with to be such a hit. Known for her quick wit and love of fun, Nan was especially excited about their purchase, her daughter remembers.""They couldn't wait for us to all give it a squeeze,"" Kim said of the Aflac Holiday Duck her parents bought that Christmas. Introduced in 2001 by supplemental insurance company Aflac, the stuffed, collectible plush dressed in different holiday wear each year helps raise funds for pediatric cancer and blood disorders research and treatment. To date, net sales have provided over $3.7 million to hospitals around the U.S.""My parents were givers,"" said Kim. ""They loved to give to others, including charities and especially to their family. Combining their compassionate hearts with a fun gift was a win-win for them.""With each Christmas that followed, Kim and her brother, Keith, their spouses Andy and Robyn, and grandchildren Jason, Heather, Drew and Brad, looked forward to receiving that year's Aflac Holiday Duck from Nan and John. As each great-grandchild came into the family, so did another Aflac Holiday Duck.Story continues""It was part of Christmas for us, a new memory made every year,"" Kim said. ""Memories, they mean everything. Especially now.""On Sept. 22, 2018, John died at the age of 89. Three years later, on April 2, 2021, Nan passed away. She was 94.As the first holiday without either of their parents approached, Kim worried about how hard it would be to get through. Her thoughts turned to the Aflac Holiday Duck tradition her parents had started almost two decades before. ""I knew I had to keep it alive,"" she said.She wasn't prepared, she admits, for the emotional reaction that accompanied the delivery of 11 Holiday Ducks last year.""When they arrived and I opened the box and saw them, I just started crying. Seeing these little ducks all of a sudden made me feel like … like my mom and dad were still here.""I cried, but I was happy,"" she said.

409,6049f355-5d0c-31c5-8e6c-7cafab482001,AWK,2022-12-02,4 Water Utility Stocks to Watch in a Challenging Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-water-utility-stocks-watch-134101751.html,1669902061,STORY,"['AWK', 'YORW', 'GWRS']","[Water utilities work day in and day out to ensure an uninterrupted supply of clean potable water and reliable sewer services to millions of customers in the United States, which are essential for healthy and hygienic living.The aging of pipelines is concerning, but water utilities continue with their upgrade and maintenance projects to minimize disruptions in operations. American Water Works Company AWK, with its widespread operations, systematic capital expenditure, and organic and inorganic initiatives to further expand operations, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the water utility space. Other utilities worth retaining in one's portfolio are Essential Utilities WTRG, The York Water Company YORW and Global Water Resources, Inc. GWRS.About the IndustryThe Zacks Utility - Water Supply industry includes companies providing drinking water and wastewater services to industrial, commercial, residential customer classes and numerous military bases across the country. Water utility operators own nearly 2.2 million miles of pipelines that are getting old. Utilities continuously replace old pipelines and add new ones to expand operations. Utility operators own storage tanks, treatment plants and desalination plants to supply uninterrupted potable water across customer classes. Despite the ample presence of water across the globe, less than 1% of the total water volume is fit for human use.  Given the scenario, the water utilities, apart from ensuring proper infrastructure to supply water, utilize technology to treat saline water and make it fit for consumption.3 Trends Pivotal for Shaping the Water Supply Industry's FutureAging Infrastructure Needs Huge Investments: The water and wastewater infrastructure is aging and gradually nearing the end of its effective service life. Per the findings of the American Society of Civil Engineers (“ASCE”), water main breaks occur every two minutes in the United States due to the aging of the existing water infrastructure. The ASCE has provided a D+grade to the overall U.S. water and wastewater infrastructure. Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), an estimated $744-billion investment is necessary to maintain, and expand the drinking water and wastewater service to meet demand over the next 20 years. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $50 billion to EPA to strengthen the drinking water and wastewater systems of the United States. A major portion of the investment will be directed to upgrading water infrastructure serving disadvantaged communities.Story continuesEfficient Use is Saving Precious Water: An interesting trend in the water industry is reducing per-capita water usage. The reasons for the drop are the use of water-efficient techniques, raising awareness among customers by the water utilities, the use of advanced water-efficient appliances and actions taken to fix pipeline leaks. Lower use per person allows water utilities to meet the need of an expanding customer base without increasing capacity to a great extent. In a way, efficient usage and a reduction in wastage allow water utilities to keep their service rates unchanged for a longer period for consumers and assist water utility operators in increasing their earnings by serving a larger population with the same water supply capacity.Fragmented Water Industry Needs Consolidation:  Since the U.S. water utility industry is highly fragmented, upgrading aging assets to provide quality services is the need of the hour. Per ASCE, at present, 50,000 community water systems and 16,000 community wastewater systems in the United States are providing water solutions to customers. Per the ASCE finding, due to the delay in essential pipeline repairs and maintenance, 6 billion gallons of treated water is lost every day in the United States. The highly fragmented industry creates operational challenges in meeting the requirement for replacement, and adding to the aging water and wastewater infrastructure. Large water utility companies continue to acquire small companies to ensure the extension of high-quality services to customers and the investment required to upgrade old and acquired assets. Water conservation and initiatives taken by large water operators in educating their consumers on efficient use and appliances to detect leakage should help to prevent wastage.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Utility Water Supply industry is a 12-stock group within the broader Zacks Utilities sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #139, which places it in the bottom 45% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates weak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

Still, industry experts remain skeptical that battery electric trucks can take the strain of hauling hefty loads for hundreds of miles economically.At Musk's first Tesla reveal since taking over Twitter - an acquisition some investors worry has become a distraction - the company did not announce pricing for the Semi, provide details on variants of the truck it had initially projected or supply a forecast for deliveries to PepsiCo or other customers. Tesla said it would begin using the Semi to ship parts to its plant in Fremont, California.In 2017, Tesla had said the 300-mile range version of the Semi would cost $150,000, and the 500-mile version $180,000, but Tesla's passenger electric vehicle prices have increased sharply since then.Robyn Denholm, chair of Tesla, recently said the automaker might produce 100 Semis this year. Musk has said Tesla would aim to produce 50,000 of the trucks in 2024.PepsiCo, which completed its first cargo run with the Tesla truck to deliver snacks for those attending the Nevada launch event, had ordered 100 trucks in 2017.Story continuesBrewer Anheuser-Busch, United Parcel Service Inc and Walmart Inc were among other companies that had reserved the Semi. Tesla did not provide details on orders or deliveries to customers, nor an estimate on what the total cost of ownership for future buyers would be compared to diesel alternatives.'NOT IMPRESSIVE'Musk said the Semi has been doing test runs between Tesla's Sparks, Nevada factory and its plant in Fremont, California. Tesla said it had completed a 500-mile drive on a single charge, with the Semi and cargo weighing in at 81,000 pounds in total.Tesla did not disclose the weight of an unloaded Semi, one key specification analysts had hoped to learn and an important consideration for the efficiency of electric trucks.Musk has spoken in the past about the prospect of fully autonomous trucks. Tesla did not provide details on how Tesla's driver assistance systems would function in the Semi it unveiled on Thursday or future versions.The Semi delivery presentation ended without Musk taking questions, as he often does at Tesla events.""Not very impressive - moving a cargo of chips (average weight per pack 52 grams) cannot in any way be said to be definitive proof of concept,"" said Oliver Dixon, senior analyst at consultancy Guidehouse.Tesla had initially set a production target for 2019 for the Semi, which was first unveiled in 2017. In the years since, rivals have begun to sell battery-powered trucks of their own.Daimler's Freightliner, Volvo, startup Nikola and Renault are among Tesla's competitors in developing alternatives to combustion-engine trucks.Walmart, for instance, has said it has been testing Freightliner's eCascadia and Nikola's Tre BEV trucks in California.'LIKE A CHEETAH'The Semi is capable of charging at 1 megawatt and has liquid-cooling technology in the charging cable in an updated version of Tesla's Supercharger that will be made available to the Cybertruck, Musk said. The Cybertruck is scheduled to go into production in 2023.Trucks in Semi's category represent just 1% of U.S. vehicle sales but 20% of overall vehicle emissions, Tesla said.Tesla said other, future vehicles would use powertrain technology developed for the Semi without providing details. The Semi uses three electric motors developed for Tesla's performance version of its Model S, with only one of them engaged at highway speed and two in reserve for when the truck needs to accelerate, a feature that makes the truck more energy-efficient, Musk said.""This thing has crazy power relative to a diesel truck,"" Musk said. ""Basically it's like an elephant moving like a cheetah.""In a slide displayed as part of Musk's presentation, Tesla showed an image of a future ""robotaxi"" in development with a mock-up of the future car covered under a tarp.The presentation took place after Tesla shares closed at $194.70. The stock has fallen about 45% so far this year, losing about $500 billion in market capitalisation, down to about $615 billion.Among factors cited by investors have been Musk's sales of Tesla shares to finance his takeover of Twitter, signs that a slowing global economy has started to cut into demand for Tesla's premium-priced cars, and a warning by the company that it might not meet its target to grow deliveries by 50% this year.

Here's a look at their new campaign, featuring Lindsay Lohan, which launches today.[MUSIC PLAYING]LINDSAY LOHAN: That is one dirty soda, Santa.- If Lindsay likes it, who doesn't?SEANA SMITH: We have a lot to live up to in our reaction.- Follow Pepsi on Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok, share your creation, and you can actually win some cash. Seana and I are going to try this creation. We'll have to follow them and tag them as well, when we see--Dirty soda has been a trend on TikTok for a couple of years.SEANA SMITH: It has. Over a million mentions, I think, on TikTok, as well.- But I don't think this is exactly what we see on TikTok.SEANA SMITH: No. A lot of times they have syrup, I believe, and other things that are added in, heavy cream, I know was one. I don't know how to feel-- you're very excited for this. I'm a little skeptical. How much milk did you put in?- That's a pretty solid splash. So we went 2% on the Pepsi. And here we go.Hm. I don't see--SEANA SMITH: It's actually not bad.- I don't see anything wrong with the flavor. The only issue I have with it is I lose the carbonation of the Pepsi, which is really the reason I drink it. I like the bubbles.SEANA SMITH: It's actually good.- The flavor is excellent.SEANA SMITH: You know what? And you made this comparison during the break, and I'm going to steal it from you, it does remind me of the taste of if you were to have a root beer float, or a soda with ice cream. It does have a very, very similar taste. I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it was going to be dis-- well, you're going all in.Story continues- I'm going all in. This is an excellent combination. Our producers were a little skeptical, but they're going to have to come out here and try this.SEANA SMITH: I actually like it.- I don't know. So you dip the Oreo, is that what-- I guess Santa--SEANA SMITH: [INAUDIBLE] as a chaser, in case we didn't like it. No? I don't know.- If Santa comes by, he's going to dip the cookies in the pilk and--SEANA SMITH: Yeah. And eat them all.- Pilk and cookies is the hashtag, again, if you try to win some cash following Pepsi on Instagram, Twitter, or TikTok.SEANA SMITH: It's decent. I don't think I would go home and make this by myself, but it was much better than I thought it would. I think everyone should try it.- I'm going to finish it.SEANA SMITH: All right. Well, you can do that.All right. Well, while Dave finishes his drink, I'll think about it [INAUDIBLE]. That does it for us today.]"

The EV maker will unveil its 18-wheeler semi at a factory in Nevada tonight. And PepsiCo will receive the first delivery of Tesla semis tonight. This all comes after a three-year delay.Yahoo Finance's senior autos reporter Pras Subramanian joins us with the details. What do we know about this big boy?PRAS SUBRMANIAN: It'll be the first time seeing it, the production version, in the flesh here, this 18-wheeler semi truck, as they call it. It should possibly-- we're hearing that it will have around 500 miles of range, which is very impressive, towing 80,000 pounds, which is the max weight that a class A, I guess, vehicle can tow, so very impressive stats.We'll get the official-- hopefully get the official numbers later tonight at the reveal event in Giga Nevada. And like you said, PepsiCo will be the first recipient of these trucks. They're going to use them use them in their Frito-Lay facility in Modesto. So they're going to be kind of rejiggering that facility to kind of deal with electric trucks and those big kind of semis as well.So a big night for Tesla here. But I think there's some concern or some kind of skepticism if this thing can actually do that for the right price.SEANA SMITH: Yeah.[LAUGHTER]DAVE BRIGGS: Let alone if the power grid can support them.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, then that's another big factor in all this. Pras, there was also a couple of headlines crossing today just in terms of Tesla adjusting their prices on a couple of models in an effort to boost demand. Why are they doing this now?PRAS SUBRMANIAN: Yeah, I mean, it looks concerning on the face of it, right, cutting prices? ElecTrek reporting that they're sending out dealer notices to cut the Model Y and Model 3 price by $3,500 bucks each in the month of December to kind of boost deliveries in this month because of the fact that they're concerned, or they're seeing people canceling orders because they want to get that IRA tax credit that starts again for Tesla in January.Story continuesSo they're saying, hey, we'll give you half that credit now if you get this truck now or get this car now. So that's kind of the reason behind it, because they don't want to have a backlog of cars sitting on their lots in December when their numbers come out for Q4 deliveries. They want to get those cars out the door and restart it again in January for Q1.DAVE BRIGGS: And I think the semi has a $40,000 tax break. Yeah, so that's a big one.PRAS SUBRMANIAN: Which is a huge--DAVE BRIGGS: Big incentive there.PRAS SUBRMANIAN: And that's why we saw Elon Musk say, hey, we've got that truck coming soon, December 1. That came out of nowhere.SEANA SMITH: Hmm, all right, we'll see. I don't know. I guess it'll be entertaining.DAVE BRIGGS: It always is.SEANA SMITH: Unveils are always interesting. So we'll see.PRAS SUBRMANIAN: Real quick, there might be a surprise. So we'll see.SEANA SMITH: What do you think that will be?PRAS SUBRMANIAN: I might-- you might hear some news about the new Tesla Roadster, that supercar that they teased awhile ago. We'll see. We'll see.DAVE BRIGGS: Good tease, brother.SEANA SMITH: OK, we'll sit over here. All right, Pras, thanks so much for having on set--]"

Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about PepsiCo (PEP).PepsiCo currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.62, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.62 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy, representing 69.2% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PEPBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PEPCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for PepsiCo here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying PepsiCo, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in PEP?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for PepsiCo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $6.76.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for PepsiCo. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for PepsiCo.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Data from the study showed that children who added Evkeeza to other lipid-lowering therapies experienced an LDL-C reduction of 48% at week 24 on average.

The company is expected to report EPS of $2.83, up 6.39% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $6.37 billion, up 11.05% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $11.52 per share and revenue of $25.06 billion.

These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

""If you were modeling what not to do with an acquisition and modeling what not to do in terms of bringing your expenses back in line with your projected revenues, it probably had a lot of room for improvement.""Chambers explained that Musk should be showing more care toward Twitter employees instead of simply running roughshod throughout the organization.""I think he missed an opportunity here, and I think part of their wounds will now be self-inflicted,"" Chambers said, though he added that he wouldn't ""bet against"" Musk getting Twitter right given his track record of success at SpaceX and Tesla.SpaceX owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk smiles at the E3 gaming convention in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 13, 2019. REUTERS/Mike BlakeTwitter has been in a state of chaos since Musk assumed control of the platform earlier this month.Musk kicked off layoffs of roughly half of Twitter's 7,500-strong workforce several weeks ago as he seeks to reposition the social media platform for profitable growth after a $44 billion acquisition.After these initial layoffs, Musk demanded employees sign a pledge to work under ""extremely hardcore"" conditions or else be canned. The ultimatum was met with a revolt among Twitter's remaining employees, causing Musk to soften his stance.Musk has continued to lay off Twitter workers, including engineers on the day before Thanksgiving. The layoffs have reportedly left Twitter's key departments — notably its regulatory department — at dangerously low levels.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Other top leaders agree that Musk's approach to running Twitter in his early days is unconventional at best.""He's not starting something new,"" former Medtronic CEO Bill George said on Yahoo Finance Live. ""This is an ongoing enterprise. Millions of people are posting every minute on that site. So I think he's got a tiger by the tail. He's a brilliant guy, but I think he's going to need help. And I would like to see him bring in a CEO because I'm worried about Tesla too.""Story continuesBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

While they produce one-third of the world's food, many of them experience poverty themselves and, paradoxically, often don't have enough food to feed their families. The good news is, growth in agriculture could be up to two to four times more effective in raising incomes amongst the poorest, compared to growth in other sectors.With the audacious goal of solving global poverty in mind, One Acre Fund (OAF) has been working since 2006 to supply smallholder farmers in Sub Saharan Africa with the resources they need to improve their harvests, raise their incomes, adopt environmentally friendly farming practices and diversify crops to increase resilience to disasters. Among their services which are facilitated by over 6,000 field officers, across nine countries, OAF offers flexible financing wherein farmers can purchase high-quality seeds and fertilizers on credit and repay a dollar here or a dollar there as they get money; delivery of inputs to locations within walking distance of every farmer; training; insurance; and access to innovative products and technologies.Originally, OAF offered a once-a-year delivery of seeds, fertilizers, and other farming products from centralized warehouses to farmers' rural villages, just in time for planting season. In 2019, they launched the Tupande program in Kenya, which includes a one-stop shop for quality farm supplies in the form of bright yellow shipping containers called dukas (Swahili for ""shop""), set up in the rural villages closer to the farmers. These dukas are transformative because farmers can now access the supplies they need locally, all year round. To-date, OAF has opened 110 dukas across Kenya, with the goal of having 220 by end of year. Their goal is to expand to 330 dukas by mid-2023, with each scaled to serve about 1,500 Kenyan farmers; and ultimately launch the program in other countries in which they work.Story continuesTupande Goes DigitalWith the support of Cisco's Global Impact Grant program, OAF has developed the Tupande mobile application, which went live in Kenya in April 2022. The app enables farmers to browse OAF's product catalog, compare prices, view item photos and descriptions, determine what's in stock at their local duka, and order - all from their mobile phone. ""The digital penetration is a lot higher in Kenya than it is in many of the other nearby countries,"" explained Claire McGuinness, Senior Analyst of OAF's Strategy and Partnerships. ""It's a good area for us to test, learn, and roll out [new technologies] to farmers.""Julius Tovesi, an entrepreneur who supports his family and broader community in their farming endeavors, said ""I first heard about the mobile app through an Officer at the Tupande Kakamega duka who walked me through how to navigate it. I looked through it, compared prices and products on offer with those at the duka, and I was impressed, and haven't stopped using it since!"" Once an order is placed from the app, farmers can either go to their local duka to pick up their products, or they can have them delivered straight to their homes.The app is not only convenient for farmers, but it also significantly improves OAF's operations by reducing the amount of time field officers spend handling orders. With this time savings, they can engage with more farmers to deliver training and other value-added services. ""The point of leverage for us, historically, has been thinking about how our field officers can serve more people,"" explained Claire. ""Because the more people who can be served by one field officer, the more efficient the program becomes, and the more people you can reach. [The Tupande app] came to us as the logical next step of reaching even more farmers. It offers farmers a lot more flexibility, because while they can place an order with their field officer, they also don't have to wait for them to come around to place an order.""The Tupande app is also a way for OAF to better engage with a rising generation of young farmers who grew up with tech and prefer tech-led solutions. As older farmers are retiring, OAF is focused on leveraging technology to attract and retain this younger generation of farmer.Gearing up for scale to feed a growing populationWhile it's still an early-stage pilot, the Tupande mobile app could enable OAF to reach 50,000 to 100,000 entirely new Kenyan farming families within the next few years.""The app is a great way to leverage trust that we've built over time and allow us to use it to reach so many more people so much more efficiently."" Claire went on, ""There are 50 million smallholder farming families in Africa. We're laser focused on the idea of scale and how we can get to those additional farmers.""This is especially important since it is estimated that the world's population will grow by at least two billion people by 2050, and increasing smallholder farmers' yields will be a critical part of ensuring there will be enough food to go around. Cisco is proud to support organizations like One Acre Fund that are using technology to help to reduce poverty, increase food security and build thriving resilient communities.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: http://csr.cisco.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/729682/One-Acre-Fund-How-a-Mobile-App-Prepares-Smallholder-Farmers-for-a-Successful-Harvest]"
