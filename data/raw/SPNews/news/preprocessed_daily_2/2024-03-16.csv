Inflation is running hotter than expected, sparking concerns about the Fed interest rates cut in June. Per CME\'s FedWatch tool, the market has trimmed the odds of a cut of at least 25 bps at its June meeting to 62.9%, down from 81.7% a week ago (read: Ride the S&P 500 Wave With These ETFs).The uncertainty has raised the appeal for value investing. This is because value investing involves buying stocks or other financial assets that are believed to be undervalued or trading below their intrinsic worth. Value stocks seek to capitalize on the inefficiencies in the market and have the potential to deliver higher returns with lower volatility compared with their growth and blend counterparts. Value stocks are less susceptible to trending markets and their dividend payouts offer safety in times of market turbulence.While there are many options available in this space, investors could tap the trends with popular ETFs having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). Vanguard Value ETF VTV, iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF IWD, iShares S&P 500 Value ETF IVE, SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF SPYV and Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Value ETF SCHV look like compelling choices.Among the latest data, wholesale prices accelerated at a faster-than-expected pace in February. The producer price index, which measures pipeline costs for raw, intermediate and finished goods, jumped 0.6% in the month, higher than the 0.3% forecast by Dow Jones and 0.3% increase in January. Meanwhile, consumer inflation was hot as costs for gasoline, shelter, airfare and car insurance rose. The Consumer Price Index grew at an annual rate of 3.2% in February, marginally up from a 3.1% increase in January. Economists also expected an increase of 3.1% (read: Dividend ETFs to Consider Amid Hot Inflation Data).Last week, the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a U.S. Senate committee that the central bank is “not far"" from being confident that inflation is declining toward the 2% target, which would make rate cuts possible. However, Powell noted that policymakers still need “greater confidence” in its continued decline before cutting rates.Further, the improving economy backed by increased consumer confidence, rising wages and higher spending results in increased industrial activity and a pickup in consumer demand, thereby lifting value stocks. The forthcoming U.S. presidential election and conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza have resulted in some worries, which also make value stocks a better bet at present.', 'Vanguard Value ETF (VTV)Vanguard Value ETF targets the value segment of the broad U.S. stock market and follows the CRSP US Large Cap Value Index.

Many companies in this sector are busy inventing tomorrow's technologies, often prioritizing reinvestment over distributing cash profits through dividends."", 'Let me paint a picture for you. There are 2,457 stocks trading on American stock exchanges with a market cap of at least $1 billion, according to Finviz.\xa0Of them, 1,504, or 61%, offer some sort of dividend payout.', ""Narrow your view to the tech sector, and you'll find 111 dividend payers out of 373 billion-dollar companies. Only 30% of these companies offer any dividends at all."", ""The gap grows even wider if you're looking for generous dividend policies, too. Thirty-five percent of all billion-dollar companies provide an annual dividend yield of at least 2%. In the tech sector, the group of 2% yields shrinks to just 29 names, or 8% of the sector."", ""That being said, it's not impossible to find great dividend payers in the metaphorical Silicon Valley. Some of those 29 names are absolutely fantastic income investments right now."", 'Let me show you three of my favorite ideas in that category. Savvy income investors can set up an effective dividend portfolio around semiconductor veteran Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN), artificial intelligence (AI) expert IBM (NYSE: IBM), and materials science innovator Corning (NYSE: GLW).', 'Legendary chipmaker Texas Instruments has a long history of shareholder-friendly dividend payouts. The company sent its first dividend checks in the spring of 1962. The annual payouts have increased in every year since 2004.', ""Semiconductor companies tend to be very cyclical. Each sector member's key products face sharp swings in demand as they often focus on hyper-specific end markets."", ""But TI gets around. It generated 40% of its 2023 revenue from industrial customers and 34% from automotive clients. Personal electronics and communications equipment also made significant contributions to the company's top line. Moreover, TI makes both analog and digital chips, widening its exposure to different contract opportunities even within any particular target industry."", ""And don't forget that the company runs its own manufacturing facilities, too. When fabless chip designers compete for production capacity at one of the industry's third-party manufacturing giants, TI can just get to work with its own chipmaking machinery. So TI's diverse clientele buffers it against sector-specific downturns, unlike many of its peers."", ""And this paragon of business stability isn't even expensive. The stock has traded sideways over the last year, missing out on the tech sector's artificial intelligence (AI) boom. As a result, the effective dividend yield has soared to 3%."", ""Sure, TI's stock is down for a reason -- it ran into a rare tag-team attack as both automakers and industrial computing giants are holding back their infrastructure investments at the same time. But these paired market weaknesses won't last forever. You should consider locking in those juicy yields while they last, because TI will surely come back swinging when the global economy finally gets over the inflation-based flu."", ""The company behind the namesake glass-ceramic cookware has moved on to more advanced materials. You'll find Corning's hardened Gorilla Glass covering the screens on most smartphones nowadays, not to mention both the windshields and internal glass panels in modern cars. And fiber-optic cables accounted for $4 billion of top-line sales last year, or roughly one-third of Corning's total revenue."", ""Like Texas Instruments, Corning is resistant to single-industry downturns. Both companies were caught by multiple sector challenges, and Corning's stock is also back almost exactly where it was a year ago."", ""Its effective dividend yield is even richer at 3.4%. Smartphone sales can't stay slow forever, and the auto industry can't wait to take advantage of pent-up demand for modern vehicles whenever the interest rates on car loans start sliding down again. And the coronavirus pandemic halted the global expansion of 5G networking in its tracks, setting another important Corning market up for a strong upswing someday soon. Yes, high-speed wireless networks usually rely on even faster fiber-optic connections to the worldwide internet."", 'From cookware to cutting-edge networking and digital screens, Corning continues to innovate.', ""So Corning is also set up to recover over time, likely softening those robust dividend yields in the process. That's just how the math works -- higher buy-in prices result in weaker yields from the same dividend checks. That's why I recommend locking in the generous yields on Corning and Texas Instruments while they last."", ""Finally, you already missed the best possible time to lock in IBM's strongest yields, but Big Blue's stock should still deliver both strong price gains and robust dividends for years to come."", ""IBM's stock has gained nearly 60% over the last year. The strategy shift that started under CEO Ginni Rometty a decade ago is finally paying dividends, literally and metaphorically."", ""This company was a bit late to the AI party due to its unshakable focus on enterprise-class business solutions. IBM's Watson AI platform has been around for years, harking back to the Deep Blue chess computer that defeated world champion Garry Kasparov in a game-changing 1997 match."", 'Prospective customers in this category are rarely free to simply jump on the next red-hot bandwagon. New solutions must go through a gauntlet of performance, security, and cost-efficiency tests. Any large-scale deal may require signatures from multiple levels of management. But when that time-consuming process is completed, IBM ends up with a multiyear contract and a burly helping of customer loyalty. Replacing a system that cleared every hurdle will be even tougher.', ""So you're catching IBM in the early stages of an active upswing. The AI-driven success that inspired a 10% stock price jump the day after its latest earnings report should accelerate in 2024 and beyond. Thanks to the harsh reality of dividend calculations, a rising stock price will dilute IBM's muscular 3.4% yield over time."", ""Time in the market is always more important than timing the market, though. In other words, it's not too late to grab a few IBM shares in preparation for an AI-driven surge in the next few years. It may take decades before you see a 3.4% yield on new IBM investments again."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and International Business Machines wasn’t one of them.

Meanwhile, HRC prices remained 22% beneath their peak at the close of 2023 as they search for a new bottom. However, plate prices continued to diverge from flat rolled steel, remaining sideways. Prices appear to have found enough support to see at least a short-term pause in their slight downside bias since peaking in April 2022. However, this support has also proven too minimal for prices to form an uptrend.', 'As flat rolled markets began to form a new down cycle in recent months, U.S. steelmakers appeared eager to halt declines. By early March, bth Nucor and Cleveland-Cliffs announced price hikes for HRC, CRC, and HDG steel prices. Nucor brought its minimum HRC up to $825/st, while Cliffs topped the market, bringing its minimum HRC price up to $840/st.

Explore the models now.', 'By the end of the first week of March, the average HRC price stood at $837/st, not far from the newly-announced minimums. However, prices have yet to show any slowdown in their bearish momentum, leaving markets uncertain as to whether or not producers can shift the current trend.', 'The price hikes from Cliffs and Nucor came on the heels of a narrowing delta between future and spot prices. HRC prices opened the year in backwardation, with futures falling below spot. This was a clear indication that market participants expected lower prices. By January 11, spot prices carried a $244/st premium, the widest delta since June and well above the historical average premium of $22/st.', 'However, the ensuing weeks saw that premium narrow as futures prices flattened and spot prices continued to trend lower.

However, the two price points boast a longstanding, almost 94% correlation. Beyond that, future price direction typically shifts before any inversion of the spot price trend, making futures a reliable leading indicator of steel price direction.', 'Anecdotal reports appear to support a shift in market conditions as mills continue to note an increase in large-volume order inquiries. While the value of those inquiries fell beneath current HRC market pricing, their size would have the potential to shore up the supply glut that has continued to drag steel prices lower throughout Q1.', 'However, mill lead times showed no evidence of lengthening by the end of February, which suggests those inquiries had not yet translated to actual buying activity. While they remained above their historical average, increasingly shorter mill lead times suggest a still-oversupplied market.', 'Planned maintenance outages at a number of U.S. mills could also help tighten supply in the coming weeks. However, absent a rise in orders, they appear unlikely to shift market conditions on their own. That said, the steel price uptrend witnessed throughout Q4 2023 was underpinned by an increase in orders as well as suppressed production levels on the part of mills to maintain a tight supply balance.', 'Data from the American Iron and Steel Institute showed that domestic raw steel output remains robust, but that it found at least a temporary peak near the end of February.', 'If mills cannot stymie the ongoing downtrend in steel prices, they may begin to institute further production cuts despite increasing output throughout February.

CCL.', 'Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:', 'Meta Platforms continues to see estimates rise after their last quarterly report and so it remains a Zacks #1 Rank Strong Buy based on its earnings momentum.', 'My colleague Derek Lewis wrote about the resurgence of META in early February after their 10% EPS beat and raised guidance.', 'Q4 EPS of $5.33 bested the year-ago number by a whopping 200%, while revenues of $40.11 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.87% and jumped 24.7% year over year. At constant currency (cc), the top line improved 22%.', 'When Derek wrote about upward estimate revisions on February 7, analyst consensus for this year and next stood at EPS of $19.41 and $22.42 respectively.', 'Now those projections have risen to $19.94 and $23.09, representing 34% and 16% annual growth.', 'After Apple made a big splash with their new mixed reality device Vision Pro, I decided to check in to see how Zuck & Co. are fairing with their line of VR/AR headsets known as Quest.', ""The division that makes and sells Quest gear is still a money-losing operation, but that's by design for their long-term development plan."", ""I recently wrote about META's Reality Labs for my forthcoming special report on the Metaverse because I wanted to investigate how and when this king-pin of social media advertising, commerce and communication would realize profits from this new technology realm."", ""You can get on the waiting list for that report by emailing Ultimate@Zacks.com and tell 'em Cooker sent you."", ""Besides the stock ramping 400% since its nadir in Q4'22, META revenues troughed at $117 billion in that year and tagged $135B in 2023. Even better, topline growth this year is projected to approach $160B for an 18% advance."", ""That resurgence in META's core business growth gives them room to experiment with the new technology platforms."", ""Here's what I wrote recently in my Metaverse report..."", ""The launch of Meta Quest Pro was a small success, but it won't move the needle on META earnings as word is that this is still a money-losing business for them. Meta's Reality Labs unit brought in more than $1 billion in fourth-quarter sales (the holiday quarter) but recorded an operating loss of $4.65 billion. Clearly, this is a division that Zuck & Co. can afford to invest in for a while."", ""According to AR Insider, whose team does a breakdown of quarterly revenue for the Meta Reality Labs unit, MRL's topline was only $210 million in Q3 and they extrapolated that into $161.7 million for hardware sales. And these figures were down 24% sequentially and 27% year-over-year."", 'Plus, the cheaper Quest 2 still way out-sells the Quest Pro, with estimated revenue of $140 million. They concluded ""Considering an average unit price of $315, this means that Meta sold approximately 443,931 Quest 2s in Q3."" With Quest Pro\'s estimated revenue at barely $9 million and a Q3 ASP of $999 (the price dropped from $1,499 in Q1 the AR Insider team noted) this means that Meta sold approximately 8,934 Quest Pros in Q3.', 'So for now, the META story is still about its consumer engagement and the ability of the platform to sell more advertising and automate the shopping experience. If you\'ve scrolled Instagram or any Reels lately, you know how ""sticky"" these apps are.', 'And again, this is the base of 1-2 billion daily active users that will be able to leverage the next Metaverse experiences in social and ecommerce.

They expect its operating losses to increase year over year in 2024, but I expect Zuck & Co. to keep investing to eventually leverage Metaverse tools and apps for profits -- just like Apple is experimenting with what comes after the iPhone.', 'Bottom line on META: The Metaverse is a foot race of titans since the hardware development is so expensive.

EW’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimates in two of the past four quarters and came in line on two occasions, the average surprise being 0.8%.', 'EW is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by the promising prospects of the Critical Care spin-off for the Surgical Structural Heart business. The optimism led by a remarkable fourth-quarter 2023 performance, as well as nearing an inflection point with TMTT (Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies), is expected to contribute further. However, macroeconomic concerns and adverse currency impacts are major downsides.', 'Let’s delve deeper.', 'Critical Care Spin-Off Optimistic for Structural Heart Opportunities:\xa0In December 2023, Edwards announced the strategic decision to spin off the Critical Care segment at the end of 2024. The tax-free spin-off will allow the company to pursue more opportunities for TAVR (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement), TMTT and Surgical patients, as well as new investments in interventional heart failure technologies.', 'For investors’ note, Critical Care is one of the company’s rapidly growing businesses. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the business generated 11% year-over-year sales growth, driven by contributions from all product lines, including HemoSphere and Smart Recovery, with the strong adoption of the Acumen IQ sensor equipped with the Hypotension Prediction Index algorithm.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'As an independent public company following the spin-off, the segment will capitalize on its global leadership position in advanced patient monitoring, transforming care through AI-enabled smart monitoring solutions while expanding its reach to millions of patients around the world. With a rich legacy of pioneering innovations, the planned separation paves an even stronger future for this segment.', 'TMTT Portfolio Holds Potential: Leveraging insights from clinical trials and real-world experiences, the company has strategically developed a portfolio of leading transcatheter technologies to provide both repair and replacement solutions for mitral and tricuspid patients. In the fourth quarter of 2023, sales increased a staggering 71% year over year, driven by the accelerated adoption of the differentiated PASCAL precision platform and the activation of more centers across the United States and Europe.', ""The ongoing double-digit growth of the overall transcatheter edge-to-edge repair procedure highlights a largely unmet patient need. During the year, the company’s PASCAL Precision was approved in Japan to treat patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation. In mitral replacement, Edwards received FDA approval for the SAPIEN 3 continued access program. Further, the EVOQUE system became the world's first transcatheter valve replacement therapy to receive regulatory approval to treat TR (tricuspid regurgitation)."", 'Robust Q4 Performance: The company’s impressive 2023 fourth-quarter performance was driven by its broad portfolio of innovative therapies. Edwards Lifesciences delivered strong growth across each of its four product groups, which raises our optimism. The solid uptick in the top line also highlighted strengthening leadership in the TAVR segment. The ongoing expansion and adoption of the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA platform in the United States appears encouraging.', 'Macro Concerns Put Pressure on the Bottom Line: Despite the improved conditions post-COVID-19, Edwards Lifesciences acknowledges the lingering impacts felt throughout 2023, particularly in Japan and staffing shortages in the United States and Europe. Additionally, the company has been grappling with escalated expenses for a while. In the fourth quarter of 2023, both SG&A and R&D expenses increased 16.8% and 16.3%, respectively, year over year. The quarter’s gross margin crashed 416 basis points (bps) while the operating margin declined 532 bps.', 'Foreign Exchange Impacts:\xa0Foreign exchange is a major headwind for Edwards Lifesciences due to a considerable percentage of its revenues coming from outside the United States. In the fourth quarter of 2023, foreign exchange rates decreased reported sales growth by 80 basis points (bps) or $9 million compared to the prior year.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with WMT.', ""On March 15, 2024, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT), the leading retailer in the United States, released its 10-K filing, revealing a comprehensive financial performance for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. The company reported a significant increase in net sales, climbing to $642.6 billion, up from $605.9 billion in the previous year. This growth is a testament to Walmart's enduring appeal to consumers and its ability to maintain a competitive edge in the retail market.

This dependence on a single geographic region could expose the company to risks associated with economic downturns, regulatory changes, and competitive dynamics specific to the US market."", ""Operational Challenges in International Markets: Walmart's international operations, while contributing $115 billion in sales, face unique challenges, including currency volatility, local competition, and regulatory hurdles. The complexity of managing a diverse global portfolio can strain resources and divert focus from core markets, potentially impacting overall profitability."", ""Workforce Management: With a workforce of approximately 2.1 million associates globally, Walmart must navigate the intricacies of labor relations, wage pressures, and employee retention.

By tailoring its business model to local needs and leveraging its global supply chain, Walmart can capture additional market share and diversify its geographic revenue base."", 'Intense Competition: The retail landscape is highly competitive, with players ranging from traditional brick-and-mortar stores to eCommerce giants and omni-channel retailers. Walmart must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its competitive edge, as rivals may offer more favorable terms, greater brand recognition, or more advanced digital capabilities.', ""Economic and Geopolitical Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, energy costs, and currency fluctuations can impact consumer spending and Walmart's operational costs.

Last year, it extended its Express Delivery service hours and began testing a Live Shopper feature that allows customers to modify their orders last-minute and communicate in real-time with the order picker. ', 'CFO John David Rainey told investors in February that Walmart is improving e-commerce profitability as it taps into its extensive store fleet to help fulfill online orders, with delivery as a particular bright spot.

We've talked about both Zscaler and Palo Alto recently, a lot of focus on the spending fatigue comment that came out of Palo's call specifically talking about is adding incremental point products is not necessarily driving better security outcomes. It really doesn't seem like CrowdStrike is witnessing that same dynamic. Now it's a little bit of a different model."", ""They have this Falcon platform that ultimately offers these 27 modules and customers can subscribe to those modules based on what they feel like they need. Into that, 0.64% of CrowdStrike customers now have adopted at least five of those modules, 43% have adopted at least six, 27% have adopted at least seven. Altogether we're just seeing this company continuing to sign new deals and then expanding the relationship that they have with those signed customers. We saw dollar-based net retention rate held steady from a quarter ago at 119%. This really all resulted in strong revenue growth, 33% for the quarter in annual recurring revenue, which is really a number you want to focus on with these cybersecurity companies, that was up 34% to 3.44 billion. I think that's a big deal, particularly when you look at a competitor like Palo Alto in the space, they're clocking that in at around four billion right now and see this ultimate market opportunity maybe to get that recurring revenue number up to 15 billion. It'll be interesting to see where CrowdStrike sees that going. There's no question, Ron, you're going to love this. CrowdStrike is absolutely a business that is firing on all cylinders."", 'Ron Gross: Woah.', ""Dylan Lewis: Jason, the markets certainly like the result, shares were up over 20% following the company's update. One thing I wanted to check in on was a little curious to get your take on is they announced that they were buying flow security in a cash and stock deal. This has generally been a period where we've been seeing a lot of businesses clamp things down, clamped down spending and focus a little bit more on optimizing. What do you make of them going out there and being acquisitive right now?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, it's a very competitive space that makes a lot of sense when they see something out there that they feel like will be additive to the business. Their balance sheet is in terrific shape, somewhere in the neighborhood of $3.5 billion in cash versus just about $750 million in long-term debt, so they have the financial means to do something like this. I think it has resulted in a lot of optimism for the stock. I think really to me that's the biggest risk for investors interested in CrowdStrike today. It just a valuation, this is a wonderful business. Clearly, it's performing very well, but it's at 26 times sales now, a 160 times free cashflow. That's after adjusting for stock-based compensation, of course, but still it just goes to show you that there is a lot of enthusiasm behind this company right now. But I think that as time goes on, we'll see the big players in the space continue to consolidate, CrowdStrike, absolutely being one of those."", ""Dylan Lewis: After a year of inventory woes, it appears Target might be climbing its way out and getting back on track. Shares up over 10% this week and at a one-year high, following the company's holiday quarter results, Ron."", ""Ron Gross: Yes, still 33% off from its COVID high in mid-2021, but that's really where the problems started, where they were dis-merchandised, let's say, they did not have the right inventory on hand. It has taken quite some time for them to right-size into what people are looking for a way from the big ticket items away from the more expensive things. They're making progress, but we're not there yet. They did report higher holiday quarter earnings in this report on a smaller than expected sales decline, that's [laughs] progress. It's like a backhanded compliment, but progress is progress. Comp sales traffic trends improved sequentially for the second quarter in a row, I like that. Total comparable sales did decline 4.4% and that's a result of store declines of 5.4% and digital sales decline of 0.7%. We're still seeing declines at both the store level and at the internet, the digital level."", ""Doesn't sound great, but it is progress. Total revenue up a total of 1.7%. The bright-spot, and this is a continuing trend is same-day services, in-store pickup, drive up, and shipped, which they acquired several years back. Those represent more than 10% of sales and they were up 13.6% in the quarter. Continuing investments in same-day services, I think, is definitely things that we're going to continue to see. Operating and gross margins widened, less markdowns. That's good to see, which means inventories coming down back to where they need it to be. Earnings benefited from a reduced tax rate and earnings per share were actually up 58% as a result of all those things, despite a somewhat anemic report. They're getting there, they've made some really interesting moves. We can talk about a loyalty program they are putting in place, store remodeling. This is one that I've said for quite some months. It's a nice turnaround play and it looked pretty inexpensive six months ago. I still think it has room to run."", ""Dylan Lewis: Ron, you mentioned ship there and the focus on same-day delivery and logistics. They are highlighting that in their new membership program, they're adding more tears and they're refining a little bit of what members are going to be able to do. But they haven't circled 360. This is a paid membership program looking to compete with Amazon Prime and Walmart Plus. I look at this and I say, this is probably one of their solutions to those inventory woes and some of those traffic flagging issues that they've been seeing."", ""Ron Gross: It's also a retail law that you must have a loyalty program. [laughs] They're just complying with law. But no, I think it makes sense. Members will pay $99 a year. There will be an introductory rate of 49 for anyone who joins relatively quickly. You'll receive free two-day shipping as well as unlimited free same-day delivery in as little as an hour, they claim, as long as orders are over 35 dollars. More of this, I want it now mentality, I think there were certainly be some takers. I do think we all have monthly fee fatigue, whether it's Netflix, or Disney Plus, or Apple, or Target. Monthly fee spending fatigue is a real thing, at least it is in my household. Whenever somebody hits me up with another one of these things, I say, but I do think it's going to be popular."", ""Dylan Lewis: You're saying death, taxes, and retail membership programs, those are the constants in life, the inevitables."", 'Ron Gross: All inevitable.', ""Dylan Lewis: Perhaps death by retail program, it turns out with that spending fatigue. We're going to take a break from earnings and check in on Twilio. Jason, the cloud communications company reported back in February. But this week we have an update on their plans for its segment business, which has been in the cross-hairs of a lot of shareholders over the last couple of months."", ""Jason Moser: We've seen some activist interest here and we talked about this letter, but we covered earnings a few weeks back. With this company, the focus has moved from growth no matter the cost, to now making sure the company can grow with more fundamentally sound financials. As a shareholder, I'm absolutely on board with that. I think if you want to hold these shares, you need to be patient and understand that with a new CEO in place, we're going to have to give Khozema Shipchandler some time to try to execute this vision. But the big question really was with the segment section of the business and that used to be the data and applications business. They are going to keep that part of the business. There was some questions to whether they might try to spin it off. They feel like ultimately the juice wasn't worth the squeeze there. They believe that with their plan, they can get more out of it if they sell it. Time will absolutely tell there. Looking at it with just through a lens of more operational rigor, trying to innovate a little bit more and incorporated a little bit more into their communications business so that they work in tandem."", ""That really does make a lot of sense, but this all really comes back to an acquisition that was made a few years back that just hasn't really worked out so well yet. Remember folks, segment accounted for only about 7.5% of the company's total revenue in 2024 and ultimately resulted in an operating loss for the year. It's not like it's some big moneymaker. Understandable why activists might want to see them, maybe get rid of it and focus on the core communications business. But management clearly thinks that there's still something there. Worth also mentioning, they did announce an additional two billion dollars share repurchase authorization. In addition to the original one billion dollar authorization, which is almost completed. The target is to complete that buyback by the end of this year. They've got four billion dollars in cash on the balance sheet so they can afford it"", ""Dylan Lewis: Jason, I'm curious, this is a business that has generally had shares outstanding, moving up into the right. How do you feel about the management team being authorized to spend another two billion dollars on repurchases?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, that is absolutely something that has been a question for a lot of investors and analysts and management has responded by making sure to commit to bringing that stock-based compensation number down. They are doing that, I will give them credit for that. But you make a very good point there. These repurchases ultimately need to bring that share count down. But there's no doubt this is going to offset some of that stock-based compensation."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break, we've got three companies with so-so outlooks. What does it mean for retail? Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money."", ""Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis here with Ron Gross and Jason Moser. We're going to check it on three household names that have the market down after earnings. Ryan, let's start with Foot Locker shares down 25% after the quarter came in above expectations. But it didn't seem like outlook was to inspiring."", ""Ron Gross: No, the stock just got slammed. That stock has been a mess for a while now as they really tried to reshape the business model. Things actually look like they might be on track at least from a stock perspective, starting maybe around last September. But this is just another setback for a company that has had many setbacks for the last several years. The quarter ending of itself, as you say, wasn't actually that bad sales were up 2%, though comparable sales fell slightly 0.7%. The Champs brand for those familiar remains the weak spot amid, what they're trying to do is reposition that brand toward athletes and away from fashion. They're not seeing traction there yet, so that continues to be a weeks gross margins are down significantly 350 basis points as a result of higher markdowns needed to clear inventory."", ""Inventory is now down 8.2%, so that's a good thing, but it's at the cost of margin. If we adjust for some non-recurring charges, always a dicey thing to do, but earnings were down 60%. They've got some work to do. CEO Mary Dillon noted the company's fourth-quarter results were above its own expectations, but things are pretty weak. She said they did see meaningfully accelerated sales trends relative to the third quarter. Guidance was relatively lackluster. I think investors did not like that, they ran for the doors. The company will be investing heavily in digital. The store experience loyalty programs, brand-building. Most importantly, they delayed by two years their EBIT margin guidance, they're operating margin guidance. You have to wait another two years to get where you hope they were going to be by 2026. It's even later now and that is not good news for people who own the shares."", ""Dylan Lewis: Ryan, we're about a year into Mary Dillon's time at Foot Locker and she is someone who really had the magic touch over at Ulta. A lot of what you're getting at there with loyalty programs and those types of things to bring people into mix was her forte. How would you grade her time so far at Foot Locker. This is a tough business, so I don't want to put it all on her back. She was a star at Ulta, she was at McDonald's for five years before that I believe. She's a top-notch CEO. This is a tough business that was relying on brick-and-mortar and Nike for so long. They're trying to move to multi-channel, omni-channel. They're trying to move away from Nike. It's going to take some time. If anyone can do it, Mary Dillon can, but it's a tough business."", ""Dylan Lewis: Over the grocery aisle, we've got an update from Campbell's this week, not an aim in any of our portfolios, but Jason, accompany we look to for a sense of what's going on with the consumer."", ""Jason Moser: Yeah, exactly. I think this is an interesting one to look at, not because it's a great opportunity for investors because let me be clear, it's not. Not trying to be mean here, sorry, Campbell. But the fact of matter is in five and 10 years, this thing is just woefully under performed the market. Now with that said, it is a low margin business. We know groceries very difficult, so I'm not really holding that all against them, but I do believe looking at this call, it gives you a glimpse into what the consumer is dealing with it in that light. Management said in the call, consumers continue to prioritize value. Not terribly surprising. A lot of focus on home cooked meals, purchasing who that helped them prepare what they call stretchable meals and smaller and less frequent shopping trips. It'll be interesting to see how that trickles through the grocery stores, for example. Organic revenue down 1%. Not terribly surprising there. There are two interesting dynamics to this business that I think are worth keeping an eye on. Now one is near and dear to my heart, and that is the snacks segment."", ""We can't forget the value and snack still. Ryan, I know you guys like snacks and you love them as much as I do. Now you got brands like Lance and snack factory, late July, they reached five-year highs and volumes share and this is basically half of their business. It is material it matters. When you just look at the overall snacks market, it's a big opportunity statistic data says revenue in the US snack food market is set to hit $114 billion this year and grow about 4% annually through 2028. There's opportunity there."", ""The other thing that I think is worth keeping an eye on the acquisition of Sovos, which is going to bring the Rao's brand under their umbrella and I think a lot of people are familiar with that sauce and the restaurant concept and whatnot. I think Rao's, I think is an opportunity. They just announced they'd surpassed one billion dollars in annual net sales. Those sales were up 16% from a year ago. So for a company that's turning in such anemic growth, it's nice to see they're bringing in another little acquisition here in Sovos that could help boost that. I think that between the snack side of the business and this Rao's side of the business. There's the opportunity at least for them to try to push those organic revenue numbers up here in the coming years. But I don't know that necessarily changes this into a buy or any kind of a compelling thesis. But again, you get a good window into the state of the consumer."", ""Ron Gross: I think they should change the slogan to Rao's is good food [laughs], because it's quality sauce in my opinion."", ""Jason Moser: [laughs] Since snacks are close to my heart so is that sauce. I've never had Rao's sauce but I'm a big it up, we read a lot of Italian food in this house and I make all of my sauce, but you've convinced me Ryan, I really I need with intention, go to the store and buy this Rao's sauce to at least try it because that could work in a pinch if you don't have enough time."", ""Ron Gross: If you don't like it. I'll pay for it."", 'Jason Moser: [laughs] Good deal.', ""Dylan Lewis: You know, we're talking Campbell's results, but we're talking a lot about snacks and Rao's here. It is not out of the realm of possibility that they revisit the company name at some point. We've seen a lot of businesses [laughs] refocus on what has investors excited. We're going to wrap our earnings takes looking at Nordstrom, Foot Locker, not alone Ryan, on the retail struggle bus shares in Nordstrom down over 15% this week."", ""Ron Gross: The struggle bus, they were also reversing some positive momentum they had been enjoying. It's not that the quarter was so bad, but the guidance is really what got investors spooked though I think the share price decline seems a little bit of an overreaction to me. For the quarter sales grew only 2.2%, primarily due to the winding down of Canada operations. Not at fault here in the US, the Nordstrom branded stores were plus 3%. Growth was particularly strong at Nordstrom Rack, which is their off-price brand where sales were up 14.6% or 8.8% if we exclude the extra week in the quarter. Now interestingly, Macy's said they're going to focus on Bloomingdale's, their higher end brand, whereas Nordstrom is seeing success with Nordstrom Rack their off-price brand, digital sales down 1.7%, that's not great. You don't want to see that, that's 38% of total sales during the quarter. Earnings per share was up 11%. Guidance was fine, but not great and they seem to want to continue to be cautious as a result of the macro economy."", ""Dylan Lewis: Ron Gross, Jason Moser, appreciate the earnings rundown. Fellas we're going to see you guys a little bit later in the show. But up next, we've got tips for your Astralpool and where it'd be putting your money. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. The Oscars are next week, head of the awards and the red carpet, we caught up with Nell Minow. Motley Fool Money's go-to movie critic and corporate governance expert for a look at the movie biz and some of her favorite films of 2023. Before we got into taping, you mentioned that you were fresh off of your Disney proxy vote. This is a company that has, I think had a rough year and maybe one of the easiest or simplest ways to put it. Certainly, there are a lot of opinions from shareholders on the direction of the company, leadership and some of the major initiatives. When you were thinking about Disney and looking at some of the issues, what was in your mind?"", ""Nell Minow: I voted in favor of the Disney candidates. Yes, there are a lot of concerns about Disney, but there are more concerns about the people who are challenging Disney. Peltz keeps promising that he's going to come up with a detailed proposal about what he thinks the company should do. But his background has nothing in it to suggest that he understands this industry in any way. He is offering up so far financial engineering and that's not what a company like Disney needs. A company that's in every industry, they're in the hospitality industry, they're of course in the entertainment industry, they're in television. That's an industry that requires a lot of creativity. They're not putting things out on a conveyor belt and he's just one step away from suggesting they moved to AI. He has not persuaded me of anything whatsoever. I am cautiously optimistic that a vote in favor of the Disney insiders is the way to go."", ""Dylan Lewis: You mentioned AI there, so I'm going to take the bait [laughs]. As we start looking at content companies, whether they're in the film industry or traditional publishing. Thinking about using AI, how're you as a shareholder, looking at those types of decisions and the strategic direction that companies are looking to go with AI?"", ""Nell Minow: Well, everybody is jumping on it, which always happens with fads. The question is, who is jumping at it in a thoughtful way? I think AI, to tell you, the very last thing I thought was going to be the first use of AI was plumbing through the footnotes and PhD dissertations to find out who has been citing everybody correctly. But apparently that's what people are like Ackman are doing with it. I think that AI is going to be less important in content creation than it is in digging through a lot of data. I want to see pharma companies using AI. I want to see other companies improving their products through the use of AI. I think it's a mistake to think that it's going to take over in the entertainment industry, although I do note that Tyler Perry has canceled his 800 million studio facility that he was going to build in Georgia after seeing a demonstration of AI film making. Now, I suspect that what he'll do is he'll spend that 800 million on something a little bit more advanced. But he's not going to give up on the idea that scripts for the indefinite future will need to be written by people and performed by people."", 'Dylan Lewis: Have you seen any of the demos that have come out from companies like Pika or any of the AI companies that are really focused on basically using prompts to create video?', ""Nell Minow: I have and they haven't quite leaked it, I'm sure that when we talk to each other before the 2025 Oscars, we'll see a lot of progress, but they still have these very odd things like six fingers on somebody's hand. It reminds me, I was listening to a video on YouTube and I only realized that the narrator was a robot or AI because they didn't know the difference between read and read. There are some fine points that it's going to take. Live and live was another one that they got wrong. It's going to take a little while before they sort that all out. But I think there are tremendous opportunities on companies that need to go through a ton of data for their products. Pharma is where I'm looking for right now."", ""Dylan Lewis: The Oscars are coming up and I think maybe more than any other regular guest on Motley Fool Money, you watch more movies than [laughs] pretty much anyone that I'll sneak comes on the show. Say, I'm giving you $100 to put on any film, any actor, actress, any major category. What are you putting it on?"", ""Nell Minow: I think your surest bet there is got be Da'Vine Joy Randolph for The Holdovers as best supporting actress. Normally, the supporting Oscars are the toughest to predict, but she has one every preliminary award. Lord knows she deserves the award. She gave us a magnificent performance. She was so good also in Only Murders in the building, in the Dolemite movie with Eddie Murphy, I think she is the surest bet of the night. Then after that, I would say Oppenheimer is probably a very good bet for best picture and best director. The reason for that is not because I think it should be. There are two reasons. One is that they don't give Oscars for the best movie. They give Oscars for the most movie and that is the most movie. Hollywood likes to portray themselves as serious, as dealing with serious issues, as having a serious role in the cultural conversation. They like smart movies and it is a smart movie. But more important than that, you have to remember that the Oscar votes are by the people in that category. In other words, best director is only voted on by other directors. Christopher Nolan won the Directors Guild award, which means these exact same people that could change their mind between one vote and the next. I think that although the best picture is voted by the entire Academy, I have a feeling that Oppenheimer is going to make it."", 'Dylan Lewis: Knowing the history of how people like to vote, were you surprised at all to see Barbie in the best picture conversation?', ""Nell Minow: Not at all. It's impossible to ignore a movie that has broken so many records. It's done so well and everybody agrees. Again, it's a very smart movie, is a very entertaining movie. It's fun to look at. It's like eating candy, but there's a lot in it as well. I think that the surprise, even the Barbie people are surprised that it looks like I'm just Ken is going to win best song and I have to tell you why I'm happy about that. I get annoyed every year by the best song because they have the worst rules about the nominees for best song. They will allow you to have as best song, some song that a pop star wrote that only plays during the credits. It has nothing to do with the movie. I'm a big fan of a song that really plays an important role in the movie getting the award and certainly that song does. Plus I think it's very funny that in a movie that is entirely about Barbie and feminism, Ryan Gosling just did so brilliantly with that song that he's impossible to ignore."", ""Dylan Lewis: Well, I was right there in the theater tapping my foot along time [laughs],absolutely loved it. I'm curious. Are there any dark horses that you feel like you wouldn't be too surprised to see you have a pretty good night at the Oscars."", 'Nell Minow: Anatomy of a fall snuck its way into the best picture category, not just the best international picture. I think we will see it when Best International. But you never know. We did have Parasite winning a couple of years ago. That would be the dark horse, i think to keep an eye on.', ""Dylan Lewis: Outside of the Oscar field, a movie from the last year that you feel like didn't get enough attention and maybe you'd recommend for people to watch."", ""Nell Minow: I guess I would say, this is actually from the year before, but I would recommend The Outside Story. It's a very small movie about a guy gets locked out of his house in Brooklyn. But I thought and it's a first time movie and from first-time director and writer with a wonderful Brian Terry Henry and the lead role. That's just one that I really loved and really stuck with me, and I would recommend that to anybody."", ""Dylan Lewis: Let's talk a little bit about the movie industry itself. 2023 felt like a pretty good year back at the box office. Barbie and Oppenheimer got a lot of headlines. Super Mario Brothers movie right up there in terms of worldwide box office, over a billion. What I do see when I look at the worldwide box office though, is a lot of franchise extensions, a lot of licensed IP. It seems like we are still in this period with movies where stuff that is bankable is really what a lot of studios are putting their resources behind."", ""Nell Minow: I'm going to go with a Mackenzie, best of times, worst of times response on that. I think you did not mention two key concerns. What is the of course, the strike really tied everything up last year and we had hoped that the production would hit the ground running and everybody would catch up, but that has not been the case. Sixty percent of the people who are on strike still have not been employed. That is a serious concern and related to that. But separate from it is the constriction of the streaming services, which for awhile there were just, anybody could walk in the door and say, I want to make a 10-part series with a lot of CGI and they would go, sure that's fine. Those are concerns. That's one reason that this year is off to a slow start until we just had the surprise hit, to me of one loved the Bob Marley story which has done very well internationally and in the U.S. Of course Dune which is going to be number one for the next few weeks."", ""But I think now that I have done the worst of times, the best of times is that there are so many opportunities for people who, for very little money create their own movies. They'd go to the festivals and they get a nationwide release. I think outside the studio system there ton of opportunities. But the fact is if you're going to spend $100 million on a movie, your risk assessment is going to be very careful and you're going to want to build it. I'm saying this as somebody who's going to see Kung Fu Panda for tonight [laughs]. Yeah. But I'm a big fan girl. I go to San Diego Comic-Con. I love superheroes, but look at how badly the superhero movies, the franchise movies have done lately. Madame Web was a disaster at the Box Office. The Marvels did not do very well. They spent a ton of money on those, Flash was a total failure. So it's not always the case that the IP pays off the way that they hope it will."", ""Dylan Lewis: Do you think we're running into superhero fatigue?"", ""Nell Minow: I don't think so. I think that we have perhaps not continued at the quality of movies that we had for a long time. Robert Downey Jr., who I think we'll get the Oscar also for Oppenheimer this weekend was incredible as Tony Stark, they haven't found anybody in that category yet and they're just going to have to work around it. Kevin Feige, who of course is in charge of all the Marvel movies, has been really great about bringing in unexpected directors and people who are not normally known for action. That paid off for him for a long time and it is not lately. He's got to rethink that."", ""Dylan Lewis: How would you characterize the overall state of the entertainment industry at this point? Because we are past the strikes, but we're also past the period of easy money for a lot of these businesses that had content budgets. It seems like we are seeing a lot of the streamers past the easy growth period of acquiring users and customers. It feels like while we've figured out the labor side of things, there's still a lot of uncertainty brewing."", ""Nell Minow: There's no question about it. Partly it is because some of these big ticket movies have really faltered at the Box Office. I think we're in a time of retrenchment. But fortunately, as I say every January when I talk about the movies that are coming out this year, my favorite thing to look forward to is it by the end of the year there will be a writer, a director, a star I never heard of before, who is going to be my favorite by the end of the year. You have somebody like Pedro Pascal or Paul Mischelle, both of whom were not all that well known a couple of years ago and are now just really at the forefront. Wait to see what happens with the Sundance films, which got great response in January with Telluride, with the other festivals that are coming up. You'll see there's a lot of really, really great stuff coming."", ""Dylan Lewis: One thing I wanted to get your take on David Zaslav has been busy as the CEO of Warner Brothers Discovery, and as part of his leadership, they've decided to basically prevent several finished films from being released, notably Coyote versus Acme, featuring John Cena, written by James Gunn. But also Batgirl featuring Leslie Grace, Michael Keaton, Brendan Frazier. It seems there's been quite a bit of backlash from the creatives in the industry. What do you make of a company that size and someone of that stature in the industry like Zaslav, making those decisions."", ""Nell Minow: Zaslav is a nightmare. The only thing he has been busy at is counting his money because he has continuously been number one on the list of the most overpaid executives, meaning the worst ROI for every dollar you spend paying him. He knows nothing as far as I'm concerned about what it is to be a creative, what it is to create content that people want to see. If he thinks that he can make more money killing these projects than releasing them, then he has no idea what his job is. He sat just getting the creatives mad at him. He's getting the audiences mad at him. I'm hoping still that both of those movies will see the light of day at some point. When I think about the terrible movies that I have to sit through, its unthinkable to me that these movies which have a lot of good people behind them and which I think are worth saying, can't even go on streaming."", ""Dylan Lewis: Motley Fool Money listeners, what's your Oscars favorite? We want to hear from you, right in at podcasts.fool.com. Coming up next, we've got stocks on our radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about. The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Dylan Lewis, joined again by Jason Moser and Ron Gross. We're going to dive right into stocks on our radar, our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question. Ron, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?"", ""Ron Gross: Dylan, I'm going back to an oldie but a mediocre-y one. Titan International TWI manufacturer of large wheels for farming and industrial applications, a long term holding of mine years and years and years. The reason I'm going back is that they just announced a large acquisition for a company of its size. Prior to the acquisition, they were about a one billion dollar company. They announced an acquisition of Carlstar Group for 296 million. That's a pretty big acquisition for them to digest. Carlstar is a global manufacturer of specialty tires and wheels for a variety of end markets. It will get tighten into end markets that they're not really in. Outdoor power equipment, power sports, high-speed trailers. It's a way to diversify a bit. They paid only four times adjusted EBITDA. The company has profitable EBITDA of about $73 million. They expect it to be accretive or additive to earnings right away, which is fine. It's just that they only have $220 million in cash for Titan. They're going to use 127 million of it for this acquisition. They've got $425 million of debt. I'd rather the balance sheet was a little bit stronger for an acquisition of this size. But hey, Titan is only trading at four times forward EBITDA only 8.5 times earnings. I'm sticking with it for now."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, this sounds like a classic Ron company, Wheels.', ""Dan Boyd: Yeah, old economy Ron is back in action [laughs].

They ultimately build and manage automations and computer vision technology, does this through their UIPath business automation platform, which ultimately spans the full automation spectrum. They're trying to basically give their customers what they need in their automation and Computer Vision journey from soup to nuts, the whole kit and caboodle, as they say. Licenses and subscriptions make up the lion's share of revenue with both contributing fairly equally. They benefit from many of the drivers that we're focused on today in tech. Connectivity, automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning. They're playing a role actually even in the roll-out of 5G technology, they're helping telecom providers handled real-time challenges and personalized offerings ultimately get this 5G networks out and ultimately keeping customers happy. Because that's what it's all about. The thing is with this business, they've seen a lot of success.

People love it, and we love it too, because we learn a lot by just chatting with our customer while being there” added Roussel.', 'More from WWD', 'Tory Burch Hosts Celebration Dinner With Isabela Grutman and Rachael Russell Saiger in Miami', 'Miaou Unveils Paris-inspired Pop-up in Los Angeles', 'Cult Gaia Opens Fifth Store in the Miami Design District', 'Nordstrom officially kicked off the immersive customer event at the Aventura Mall store on March 8 with a pop-up that will run until March 24, offering customers a chance to view and shop Burch’s latest spring collection, which included a selection of ready-to-wear, shoes, accessories and handbags.', '“People are very excited to see the evolution of the brand. We have evolved a lot in the last couple of seasons and it’s great to see the customer excited with that,” Roussel said.', 'Customers who spend $400 or more will have the opportunity to meet and have their photo taken with the designer following a live conversation.', 'Burch’s pop-up shop will also make a stop in Nordstrom’s NorthPark Center mall in Dallas from April 25 through May 12, with Burch appearing for another conversation series and meet-and-greet on April 30.', 'Nordstrom will also host intimate luncheons for its top customers with Burch in Miami and Dallas prior to the in-store appearance.', '“I consider Tory to be a great and longtime friend. We have had a very successful partnership with the Tory Burch brand for years, and our customers’ enthusiasm for all things Tory are at the center of our plans to host activations and events,” said Pete Nordstrom, president and chief brand officer for Nordstrom.', 'Her most recent collections have featured sheer skirts, leather bodysuits, hooped hemlines and plunging necklines — uncharacteristically edgy yet elevated styles, just as the brand is celebrating its 20th anniversary. The brand is currently undergoing a renaissance, though fashion insiders have coined it a “Toryssaince.”', '“Twenty years sounds so long, but it’s so young. We feel like we’re really just starting and I have to say our first partner was in 2005 and it was Nordstrom. So when I think about just partnership and being there for each other, I remember doing a roadshow with Pete Nordstrom and we went to different cities. And in a way I’ve never been more excited about business, I was excited then too but it’s a different kind of business,” said Burch.', 'Burch made an in-person appearance this past Wednesday at the Aventura Mall locale for an in-store conversation with Nordstrom’s Fashion Director Rickie De Sole.', 'Below are key excerpts from the conversation.', 'Rickie De Sole: What were you like when you were starting your business?', 'Tory Burch: I was very novice, I knew nothing. I sort of had an idea and it was more about creativity, and I felt like I was personally missing something. And it wasn’t necessarily about the price at all. It was about beautiful pieces that I just couldn’t find in the market that were classic, timeless and beautifully made. Certainly there was the designer price point and then there was the Gap, and in 2004 there wasn’t that much in between. So I did feel that there was a white space in the market and that’s something that I was really interested in. But when I first started the company it was really about the creativity and the branding and the product that drove me and it was really how do we build a successful company to be able to afford to start a foundation. So it was a constant thought process.', 'R.D.S: Is there something that defines you today and maybe both within your collection, but also have you personally feel getting dressed every day?', 'T.B.: I think a lot about confidence when I get dressed or when we put pieces out for women to get dressed. When they tell me they wear something and they feel energized and confident, that’s a success. So we had a lot of pieces that were easy in shape, but they were really interesting fabrics, whether it’s bonded jersey pants and a very lightweight, almost cotton nylon polo shirt, it’s weightless but it’s not see-through. And those are things that I think about, like how do you really not be restricted and wear things that keep you energized through the day and feeling very chic but also not encumbered.', 'R.D.S: You are certainly always at the top of my list when I think about women with taste. Do you have any secrets you can impart on us about how you think about getting dressed or when you’re looking to buy something new? How do you work it into your own wardrobe?', 'T.B.: One of the things that I do is, when I look at things — and I’m not a huge shopper — I shop when I need things and then at special occasions. I look for things that last and things that you don’t need to associate it with a specific time. I love the idea of having a wardrobe that you build and you build over time, and then you jazz it up with things of the moment, but I think those things that last that you invest in I think are amazing ideas to start your wardrobe.', 'R.D.S: What’s next for Tory Burch, what is the next 20 years?', 'T.B.: When I started I really meant it, I feel like we are just starting and all kidding aside, I have a great CEO, my husband and an incredible operating team. And it’s allowed me to really explore my creative process and I would say over the years I haven’t had the ability to do that because I was being pulled in so many different directions. So the last five years we’ve really literally wiped the palette clean and started and said these are the pieces that we love. And this is how we’re going to address them for today. And I want to modernize everything that we’re doing and really keep at it. I don’t know that we’re going to change directions at all. I want to always evolve and always reinvent, but I never want to lose sight of who we are and that’s what I’m very proud of. We’ve built some incredible pillars but we’re going to really build on those.', 'Best of WWD', 'June Ambrose Style File From the Archive', ""Michael Kors' Fashion Moments Through the Years"", 'Bethann Hardison Fashion Moments Through The Years From The Archives']"

These results are indicative that the obstacles of 2023 have yet to fully abate.', '“We are still going to see challenges throughout 2024,” explained Carolyn McCall, founder and CEO of McCall Brand Advisors. “With the speed of the digital world, the expectation is a bit unrealistic as to how quickly turnaround plans can be executed.”', 'Plus, she added, a contentious U.S. presidential election will likely make for some additional anxiety for retailers and brands if consumers decide to pull back on spending during that time.', '“Even as major companies are doing a great job of implementing transformation plans, it’s not going to happen overnight,” McCall said. “And then you’ve got that snag at the end of the year with the presidential election that may cause consumers to put a few brakes on.”', 'Best of Footwear News', ""The Greatest Super Bowl Shoe Commercials of All Time: From Nike's 1993 'Hare Jordan' to Skechers' Snoop Dogg Ad"", 'Skechers Super Bowl Ads Through the Years: Kim Kardashian, Willie Nelson, Snoop Dogg and More', ""Nike's Tiger Woods Building: Everything to Know About the Two-Story Conference Center Built in 2001""]"

Oil prices (BZ=F, CL=F) have also been rising this week, at one point topping over $80 per barrel.', 'Path Trading Partners Co-Founder Bob Iaccino and Blue Line Futures Chief Market Strategist Phillip Streible join Yahoo Finance to discuss how investors should position themselves within the commodity sector.', 'Streible states that oil\'s rise is a simple function of supply and demand, highlighting a few demand-side drivers: ""Resiliency of the US economy has helped to support demand. We\'ve got driving season right here. Any kind of interest rate cut could really be a tailwind for the crude oil market. If you get some of this loan, some of this debt burden behind us with lower interest rates, people are gonna have more money to spend and they\'re probably going to do it the easiest way, which is travel. So we are starting to see 2024 demand increasing. And we could see upward revisions in \'25 and 2026.""', 'Investors may look to the futures market or to ETFs to join the oil rally, Iaccino explains: ""I always advise people the thing that\'s 100% correlated to crude oil is crude oil. So the best place...to play that out is WTI crude (MCL=F), that\'s my favorite. But, for the average investor, you can look at USO, that\'s one of the ETFs people generally default to.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", ""- Well, with less than 15 minutes left until the closing bell on Wall Street, we're looking at how to navigate the big picture with the Yahoo Finance playbook. Some of the biggest moves in the market this week have been in the commodities space. Cocoa prices extending their record run, topping $8,000 per metric ton."", ""And checking on the metals as well, copper hitting its highest level in nearly a year. And also there's oil. Let's mention that as well because it's closing up more than 3% this week, despite edging a little bit lower today."", ""Joining us now to break it all down, Blue Line Futures Chief Market Strategist Phil Streible and Path Trading Partners Co-founder and Chief Market Strategist Bob Iaccino. Guys, it's great to see you. Thanks so much for being here."", 'PHILLIP STREIBLE: Good to see you, Julie.', ""- So, obviously, there's a lot of commodities out there. We've been seeing a lot of action. So if you're an investor and you want to get involved here, you know, it's kind of a tricky thing to try to figure out. Bob, I want to start with you. Is there anything that can be said about commodities sort of writ large? Or do we really need to drill down and talk about each one individually?"", 'BOB IACCINO: Well, I think individual is valuable. And Phil is really good at that. But I just-- on a broader sense, you are talking about something that is really a pure supply and demand story. And I think that escapes a lot of people.', ""You're not going to have CEOs scandals with commodities. You're not going to have missed earnings with commodities. You're talking about how much is out there, what does the supply picture look like, and what does the demand picture look like. And that's all it is."", ""Now while it can get complex with different sort of geopolitical volatilities, especially in the place of crude oil-- we're talking about crude oil. That comes into play quite a bit-- inflation with gold, interest rates with some of the metals including copper. The bigger picture is supply and demand-- how much does there, and who wants to buy it?"", ""- So, Phil, let's bring you in here too and dig deeper into a few different areas. Walk me through, I guess to start, how you're thinking about the energy complex, Phil, and oil in particular here, highest level here since November. What's driving that, Phil? And what do you see ahead?"", ""PHILLIP STREIBLE: Yeah, so building out what Bob brought up-- and it's a great point here. You look at crude oil. You look at the demand. And the resiliency of the US economy has helped support the demand. We've got driving season right here."", ""And any kind of interest rate cut could really be a tailwind for the crude oil market. If you get some of this loan, some of this debt burden behind us with lower interest rates, people are going to have more money to spend. And they're probably going to do it the easiest way, which is travel."", ""So we're starting to see 2024 demand increasing. And we could see upward revisions in '25 and 2026. You look at the supply side of things. We saw Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries that could impact some of the Russian exports. We've also seen surprise drawdowns in the IEA inventories of 1.5 million barrels this week, taking the yearly decline down to 33 million barrels."", ""So you look at the bigger picture things. Like on the supply side, inventories are sitting at 446 million barrels versus the five-year average of 528. So one other thing that Bob didn't bring up was price momentum that also plays a big role. And you want to see those prices really moving in the direction that outlines and maps with the supply and demand picture. And crude oil prices look like they can go up to about $85 right now."", ""- So, Bob, do you agree-- I understand, you're a long whale. And I would ask--"", 'BOB IACCINO: Yup.', ""- --where you're expecting it to go and also how you think the best way is for people to play. I mean, you're a sophisticated investor in this stuff, right? So you're probably looking at crude oil futures, et cetera."", 'BOB IACCINO: Yes.', ""- For normal investors, should they be looking at ETFs? Should they go to the futures market? What's best?"", ""BOB IACCINO: Well, I always advise people that, you know, the thing that's 100% correlated to crude oil is crude oil. So the best place to play with that-- or play that out, I should say-- we don't play in investing-- is WTI crude. That's my favorite."", ""But for the average investor, you can look at USO. That's one of the ETFs people just generally default to. And for example, looking at [INAUDIBLE] newsfeed, which is a new product from them, I'm seeing that USO is projected to be lower than their average daily volume. But the activity is on the call side of things."", ""So to Phil's point about price momentum-- and he's right. I did leave that out. And it's very important-- my target on this was 82.50. Phil says 85. So I'm probably going to move it up to 85 now on the WTI. But the USO thing is very important because your average investor is looking at that. When the activity is to the call side, that means the market makers are going to be slowly buying up the USO if the volatility rises."", 'One thing about crude oil, volatility in the equity markets, we generally associate that with a down move. Volatility in something like crude could go either way. And a spike in volatility, in which case the calls would be active then, could come on an up move. And generally it does because we get a big supply disruption, like Phil mentioned, attacks on oil producers. That can cause supply disruptions and bring about volatility.']"

Well, let me start out with the International Energy Agency and OPEC don't agree on many things. But in this case, now the International Energy Agency is saying that there will be a deficit of oil this year.

Right now those production cuts are set through the second quarter of this year for now."", ""So the IEA again revising its supply forecasts, now anticipating a deficit and the OPEC plus production cuts by the way are 2.2 million barrels per day. Also the IEA revised its global demand growth upwards to 1.3 million barrels per day. All of this to say is that these are revisions which are bullish for oil prices. We have seen oil running up in the last few days.

We have seen attacks on Russian refineries. That is very much impacting supplies because those Russian customers have to go elsewhere in the world to get their supplies. So all of this boding, it's bullish for oil prices and we are now seeing year to date oil is up for Brent, 15% for WTI that is."", 'And for Brent crude prices also up about 12%.

JPMorgan analyst Cory Carpenter has given Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) a target of $100 per share, implying a 56% upside from its current price. Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss has set a bull-case target of $485 per share for Salesforce (NYSE: CRM),\xa0implying a 60% upside from its current price.', 'Investors should always view price targets with skepticism, especially when they come from individual analysts. But Roku and Salesforce warrant further consideration. They have strong positions in their respective markets, and both stocks trade at reasonable valuations compared to future growth prospects.', ""Here's what investors should know."", 'Roku reported disappointing financial results in the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 14% year over year to $984 million, but average revenue per user declined 4% to $39.92. Management attributed that to strong active account growth in international markets, where the company is still focused on building scale rather than monetization. But it could also signal a loss in pricing power due to competition from rival streaming platforms like Amazon and Netflix.', 'Meanwhile, the company reported a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) loss of $0.55 per share, but Wall Street anticipated a slightly smaller loss of $0.52 per share. Management also guided for a wider-than-expected loss of $0.90 per share in the first quarter. Even so, Roku remains confident in its ability to accelerate sales growth and achieve profitability in the future, and its strong competitive position in the growing connected TV (CTV) advertising market supports that conviction.', 'Roku is the leading streaming platform in the U.S. and Mexico as measured by viewing hours, and Roku OS was the best-selling TV operating system in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico last year. Additionally, its ad-supported streaming service, The Roku Channel, is the ninth-most-popular streaming service in terms of viewing time. That puts it ahead of Paramount+ by Paramount Global.', 'In short, Roku is well positioned to benefit as streaming media displaces traditional pay TV. That is especially true in its largest market, the U.S., where CTV ad spending is projected to grow at 15% annually through 2027, according to Statista. Roku has a good shot at matching that pace with its sales growth, which makes its current valuation of 2.6 times sales look quite reasonable.', 'Investors should monitor average revenue per user in the coming quarters. Continued declines would further support the idea that Roku is losing pricing power. But investors who are comfortable with that risk should consider buying a small position in this stock today, with the understanding that a 56% return in the next 12 months is by no means guaranteed. Revenue growth would need to accelerate and profitability would need to improve greatly for that outcome to be probable.', 'Salesforce reported solid fourth-quarter financial results, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 11% year over year to $9.2 billion due to particularly strong growth in data integration and analytics solutions. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (adjusted) net income increased 36% to $2.29 per diluted share as the company continued to focus on margin expansion.', 'In addition, management said its remaining performance obligation (RPO) increased 17% year over year in the fourth quarter. RPO measures contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, making it a good indicator of sales pipeline momentum. The fact that RPO is climbing faster than sales hints at a possible acceleration in top-line growth in the coming quarters. Either way, investors have good reason to be optimistic.', 'Salesforce is the market leader in customer relationship management (CRM) software. Its platform includes applications that help sales, marketing, commerce, and customer service teams work more productively. Salesforce also sells tools for analytics, application development, and data management, and it recently launched a generative artificial intelligence assistant called Einstein Copilot that can answer questions, summarize content, and surface insights.', 'The broad scope of the Salesforce CRM platform affords the company a considerable advantage, creating multiple ways to land new customers and expand those customer relationships over time. CFRA analyst Angelo Zino recently wrote that Salesforce offers ""the most comprehensive and feature-rich"" CRM platform for medium-sized businesses and large enterprises.', 'With that in mind, Grand View Research estimates that CRM spending will increase by 14% annually through 2030. Salesforce is arguably better positioned to benefit from that tailwind than any other software vendor. Wall Street expects the company to grow revenue at 10% annually over the next five years. But I think that estimate leaves room for upside if Einstein Copilot becomes a material revenue stream.', 'In any case, the current valuation of 8.6 times sales is tolerable compared to the sales growth forecast by Wall Street analysts. Investors should consider buying a small position today, but not with the expectation of a 60% return in the next year. Salesforce is best viewed as a long-term investment, meaning investors should plan to hold for at least three to five years.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.', 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

However, three rose to the top as the biggest payers: Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM). Here's a look at what they paid investors last year and whether these leading dividend stocks can continue enriching their investors through dividends. "", 'Microsoft paid $20.7 billion in dividends last year, which was the most of any company. The technology titan is routinely one of the top dividend-paying stocks. It was the leader in 2020, placed second in 2021, and was third in 2022. It was able to reclaim its spot at the top by increasing its dividend (it boosted its dividend per share by 10% in each of the last two years). Meanwhile, the leader of the last two years, mining giant BHP Group, has paid less in dividends due to lower commodity prices. ', 'Microsoft can easily afford its massive dividend outlay. Over the last six months, Microsoft has produced nearly $50 billion in net cash flow from operations while paying $10.6 billion in dividends. Meanwhile, it ended last year with $81 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet against $74 billion in debt. That strong financial profile helps support its elite AAA credit rating. ', 'The technology company is also investing heavily in its growth, including acquiring gaming company Activision and developing AI technology with OpenAI. These and other catalysts should enable Microsoft to grow its cash flow, giving it even more money to pay dividends.', 'Fellow tech giant Apple clocked in at No. 2, paying $14.9 billion in dividends last year. That was slightly more than it paid in 2022, thanks to dividend increases. Apple raised its per-share payment by 4.3% last year, following a 4.5% bump in 2022. ', 'Like Microsoft, Apple can easily afford its big-time payout. The technology giant produced $110.5 billion in cash from operating activities during 2023. It also boasts a fortress-like balance sheet. Apple ended the year with a jaw-dropping $162 billion of cash, equivalents, and marketable securities against $111 billion of debt. ', 'That also allows the company to invest heavily in research and development to launch innovative products that drive revenue and cash-flow growth. It recently launched its Vision Pro VR headset and is starting to invest more heavily in generative AI. These growth drivers should enable Apple to produce more cash that it could use to pay dividends in the future.', 'ExxonMobil was right behind Apple at around $14.9 billion in dividend payments last year. The oil giant has steadily increased its dividend. It raised its payment by 4.1% late last year, its 41st straight year of dividend growth. It also grew its payout by 3.4% in late 2022. ', 'The energy company produced a prodigious amount of cash last year despite lower oil and gas prices. Free cash flow actually increased by $1.9 billion last year to $36.1 billion, thanks to its focus on investing in high-margin capital projects. While ExxonMobil returned an industry-leading $32.4 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and repurchases, it still grew its cash balance to $31.6 billion. ', ""ExxonMobil's high-return investment strategy has it on track to double its earnings potential by 2027. On top of that, the company agreed to buy rival Pioneer Natural Resources in a deal worth more than $60 billion, which will further enhance its ability to grow its free cash flow. These and other catalysts should give ExxonMobil more than enough fuel to continue growing its monster dividend. "", 'Microsoft, Apple, and ExxonMobil led the world in dividend payments last year.

A version of the Windows 8 operating system ran on Arm-based chips, and Microsoft even released variants of its Surface tablet about a decade ago powered by them."", ""The big problem was compatibility. Applications compiled for standard x86 Windows wouldn't work. This created confusion among consumers expecting to be able to download whatever applications they wanted. The product and Arm-based Windows were mostly dead on arrival."", 'Apple is the only success story so far, thanks to its complete control over hardware and software for its Mac PCs. The company began switching from Intel CPUs to custom Arm-based CPUs in 2020, providing a translation layer called Rosetta that enabled old applications compiled for Intel-based Macs to run on new Arm-based Macs. The switch has given Apple an important edge over Windows laptops in terms of battery life.', 'For Microsoft, keeping Apple in check requires PCs to get better, particularly on the efficiency and battery-life fronts. While Intel made progress with its Meteor Lake chips launched late last year, more competition is likely necessary to push Windows PCs forward.', 'Microsoft has been once again trying to push an Arm-based version of Windows, this time with Windows 11 and a translation layer that enables traditional Windows applications to run. There are some laptops already available running Arm-based chips from Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), although they fall short in terms of performance. There are still some compatibility issues, and emulating x86 apps introduces a performance penalty that noticeably slows things down.', ""Microsoft and Qualcomm aren't giving up.

In fact, it has nearly doubled over the last six years. For fiscal 2024, Microsoft increased its dividend by more than 10%. Because it is such a large company, each 5% increase in the dividend translates to around $1 billion more in dividend expenses."", 'Meanwhile, Apple has made bare minimum dividend raises of 1 cent per share per year for the last few years. Apple prefers to return money to shareholders via stock buybacks rather than with dividends.', ""Microsoft has a below-average yield of just 0.7% -- but that's still the most of any Magnificent Seven stock, even when factoring in Meta Platforms' new dividend."", ""Microsoft has made sizable dividend hikes, but its stock price growth has well outpaced that dividend growth rate, which has resulted in a shrinking yield over time. Over the last decade, management has nearly tripled the dividend, yet the yield has fallen from more than 2.5% to 0.7% simply because of the stock's monster 900% gain over that time."", ""If you're looking to build passive income streams for the long haul, then a company's ability and willingness to raise its dividend will prove more important than its current yield. Microsoft stands out because it can afford to raise its dividend regularly, buy back stock, fund its operations, invest in research and development, and still maintain a balance sheet with more cash than debt."", ""Essentially, Microsoft can do it all. It's better to view its dividend as a cherry on top of its investment thesis instead of looking at it in isolation."", ""There are three basic ways a company can reward its shareholders -- capital gains, dividends, and stock repurchases. When considering whether to invest in a stock, it's important to understand which of those levers the company is most focused on pulling."", ""For many companies, it's all about capital gains. Amazon and Tesla, for example, fit in that category: They don't pay dividends and have large stock-based compensation programs, which increase their outstanding share counts and dilute their existing shareholders."", 'For a stodgy dividend-payer like Procter & Gamble, dividends and buybacks are arguably a bigger part of the investment thesis than potential share price gains. Although P&G can still surprise to the upside -- the stock is up by more than 9% year to date and is beating the S&P 500.', 'Then there are the rare companies that both have plenty of room to grow and also reward their shareholders with buybacks and dividends. Microsoft is in this elite category. Over the last five years, the company has reduced its share count by 3%, raised its dividend by 63%, and its stock price is up by more than 255%. It has delivered the trifecta for shareholders.', 'Microsoft stands out as one of the most well-rounded buys in the stock market right now because it is a relatively low-risk but high potential-reward company. With such high cash flow and a strong balance sheet, Microsoft can afford to make mistakes, fund acquisitions, try something new, and take risks at times when many other companies lack the capital or market position to do so. Microsoft also has a clear path toward monetizing artificial intelligence (AI). It has multiple high-margin business units that are related but still diversified.', ""Microsoft Copilot is an AI assistant that works across multiple applications, among them the Microsoft 365 programs and GitHub. On Microsoft's fiscal 2024 second-quarter earnings call, management went into detail about the many ways that Copilot is helping its customers save time and drive efficiency, and it's contributing to the bottom line."", ""Even if Copilot hits a snag and its impact on growth across all these products turns out to be limited, it's not the company's only AI play. There's also Azure AI for Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which serves a completely different industry than Copilot targets."", ""In sum, Microsoft's AI aspirations don't hinge on a single product or idea. AI is already boosting the company's profitability and contributing to growth, and there's no reason to believe that trend will slow down anytime soon."", 'Expect that to produce a snowball effect. Microsoft could choose to accelerate its share price growth, return capital to shareholders through larger buybacks, or raise its dividend at a faster rate. Investors stand to benefit no matter which lever Microsoft chooses to pull.', ""The only issue with Microsoft is its valuation. It trades at a 36.8 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is well above its historical average and the S&P 500's 27.8 average P/E ratio. The stock isn't cheap, which shows that investors already have high expectations for Microsoft."", 'Don\'t expect Microsoft\'s valuation expansion to continue.

Management's long-term goal is to deliver adjusted earnings growth in the high-single-digit range on an annualized basis."", ""PepsiCo's above-average yield highlights the value in the shares right now.

That, along with share buybacks, should drive earnings growth this year, and over the longer term, the company should benefit from the expected decline in interest rates and a recovery in the housing market, which will promote spending on home furnishings."", 'Williams-Sonoma also reaffirmed its guidance of mid- to high-single-digit annual revenue growth and operating margin in the mid to high teens.', 'With a dividend yield of 1.6%, the retailer might not wow income investors, but it has the right formula for consistent dividend increases and steady earnings growth, and it looks well set up to reward long-term investors.', ""Jennifer Saibil (Starbucks): Starbucks is by far the largest coffee shop chain in the world, with more than 38,500 stores.

That could propel it to the largest restaurant chain in the world."", ""At this point, Starbucks runs a smooth operation. It can open hundreds of stores in a quarter and hit the ground running with a model that works and customers love, leading to high profits and strong comparable sales (comps) growth. It has continued to generate increased sales after a pandemic dip despite global economic and geopolitical volatility. And when it was worried about getting stale, it brought in a new CEO to refresh and improve.

Operating margin widened to 15.8%, and earnings per share were up 20% to $0.90.', ""As Starbucks has moved from a growth stock to a value stock, it's focusing on its dividend to create shareholder value. It yields 2.5% at the current price, well above the S&P 500 average of 1.5%. On top of that, it has increased its dividend by 340% over the past 10 years, far more than classic dividend stocks like Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble."", 'Starbucks has been dealing with many problems lately, including high union sentiment at many of its branches, and its stock is down 7% over the past year.

The experience combined the company’s Starbucks Reward loyalty program with NFTs to enhance customer experiences, TechCrunch previously reported.', '“We’re able to help people find their tribe,” Kaczynski said. “I’ve seen that people who live in California in the Starbucks Odyssey community are really good friends with people in Chicago and they have met up in real life at times. This never would have happened if not for web3.”', 'Starbucks opens up its web3 loyalty program and NFT community to first beta testers', 'The loyalty program has a five-tiered system with over 58,000 active participants at least on level one, Kaczynski said. “I can promise you those aren’t mostly or all web3 native people … it’s not just web3 people who are participating.”', 'Those who hit tier five of the program bought a “decent amount” off the secondary marketplaces, Kaczynski said. In December, for example, Starbucks announced that it’s sending the top 20 participants to Costa Rica to visit the coffee giant’s farms where beans are produced.', 'There are other “third-party utilities” to be developed through NFTs, not just by big companies like Starbucks or Nike but by local businesses that want to spin up loyalty programs or use tickets as an asset they can anchor and incentivize.', 'Kaczynski brought up this example: Let’s say Hot Pockets, the food brand, put out a promotion where it would give a 20% discount to gamers if they bought the brand’s Fortnite skin and connected it to a crypto wallet. “The purchaser is happy, the eater is happy and they get a discount and they’re in the ecosystem,” he said. “This person isn’t just a gamer, they’re an active gamer who’s participating and willing to spend disposable income on third-party things.”', 'When people think of NFTs, they often think of just expensive monkey pictures on the internet — and to be fair, that’s one part of it with Bored Ape Yacht Club — but there’s more value to be held in owning NFTs, Kaczynski says.', '“Imagine you go into a museum and you see a beautiful painting on the wall, you can take a picture of that painting but it’s not worth any money. The picture on the wall is worth money because the museum owns it, it’s the original and they can prove both of those things,” Kaczynski said. “Up until recently you couldn’t do that with digital items” until NFTs came out.', 'Brands and companies having the ability to buy and sell and “truly own your loyalty is a new concept that makes it less one-way,” Kaczynski said. “While not all the community members engage in buying and selling … I think for a lot of people, having that optionality is so important.”', 'This story was inspired by an episode of TechCrunch’s podcast Chain Reaction.

As you may know, Dividend Aristocrats are S&P 500 stocks with a 25-year or longer track record of annual dividend increases.', 'While those stocks represent many of the best dividend stocks to buy and hold, many other non-aristocratic S&P 500 components are worth a closer look due to their merits as long-term dividend stocks.', 'Weighing all factors (not just dividend yield), a few names stand out in terms of both the dependability and consistency of payouts, as well as their dividend growth track records.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'With all of this in mind, let’s take a look at these seven best dividend stocks in the S&P 500 to buy this month. Consider each aristocrat and non-aristocrat a worthwhile buy at current prices.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock', 'I laud shares in payroll and HR services firm Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) quite often in my coverage of top dividend stocks. For example, back in February, I included it on a list of stocks with ironclad dividend payouts.', 'However, it’s not only Dividend Aristocrat status (signaling payout consistency) that makes ADP stock one of the top dividend stocks. The company has also increased its payouts by a double-digit amount (12.36%) each year, on average, over the past 5 years. Other aristocrats raise their payouts by just a few percentage points each year.', 'While ADP’s payout ratio (nearly 60%) may seem a tad high, as forecasts call for 9-10% earnings growth in the coming years, further steady increases to this dividend, not to mention further steady price appreciation for shares, appear within reach. At current prices, Automatic Data Processing stock has a forward dividend yield of 2.3%.', 'Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com', 'Besides being perhaps one of the top tech stocks, growth stocks and AI stocks, did you know Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is arguably one of the best dividend stocks in the S&P 500? That’s based on how shares in this leading purveyor of semiconductors and infrastructure software stack up based on the aforementioned dividend stock criteria.', 'AVGO stock is about halfway towards becoming a dividend aristocrat (13 years of consecutive annual dividend increases). The company has also increased its payout by an average of 19.25% annually over the past five years.', 'While not certain, more double-digit annual increases may lie ahead. Between Broadcom’s success capitalizing on the AI chips trend, as well as from the cost/growth synergies stemming from last year’s merger with VMWare, much suggests sufficient continued earnings growth to fund such increases. At current prices, AVGO has a forward dividend yield of 1.6%.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'Jacksonville, Florida-based CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) is one of six class-one freight railroads in the United States. As an operator in this oligopoly, providing an essential service that sustains national and global commerce, this company has high margins, consistent profitability and a deep economic moat.', 'With all of this, it’s not a surprise that CSX stock ranks well among S&P 500 dividend stocks. With 19 years of consecutive dividend growth under its belt, CSX’s dividend has increased by an average of 8.45% annually over the past five years.', 'The most recent increase was enacted last month when the company raised its quarterly payout from 11 to 12 cents per share, or around a 9.1% increase. Alongside this dividend, CSX also returns capital to shareholders through stock buybacks. In 2022 and 2023, the railroad made share repurchases of $4.7 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively.', 'Source: JennLShoots / Shutterstock.com', 'L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) is another of the best dividend stocks in S&P 500 that I have discussed in glowing terms in prior dividend stock articles. As I have pointed out before, this defense firm has increased dividend payouts 22 years in a row. Shares currently have a forward yield of 2.16%.', 'If dividend increases continue, LHX stock will become a Dividend Aristocrat within the next few years. Further increases appear likely, given forecasts calling for strong earnings growth during this time frame. Chalk up these solid prospects to both increased geopolitical tensions, plus L3’s success at making “bolt-on” acquisitions of smaller companies in its industry.', 'Trading for around 16.8 times forward earnings today, achieving aristocrat status could help LHX bridge the valuation gap between it and rivals that already are aristocrats, like General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), which trades for 18.7 times forward earnings.', 'Source: maeching chaiwongwatthana/Shutterstock', 'Cleveland, Ohio-based Parker-Hannafin (NYSE:PH) is a manufacturer of motion and control technology systems. This industrial stock currently has a moderate-to-low forward dividend yield (1.1%), but keep in mind this dividend could increase substantially over time, as the company’s dividend growth track suggests.', 'Parker-Hannafin payouts have increased by an average of 14.26% annually over the past five years. Furthermore, not only is PH stock a Dividend Aristocrat, it’s a Dividend King as well. In fact, with 67 years of consecutive dividend growth, Parker-Hannafin has long since passed the king threshold of 50 years.', 'Even after big dividend increases in recent years, PH still sports a relatively low payout ratio (23.92%). Coupled with the prospect of high single-digit/low double-digit earnings growth in the coming years — based on sell-side forecasts — there’s a good chance that above-average levels of payout increase will continue in the years ahead.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Ask someone which restaurant stock is among the best dividend stocks in S&P 500, and the first answer may be McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD). However, instead of owning the golden arches, dividend investors may want to opt for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) instead.', 'Why? In terms of dividend yield, SBUX stock (2.5% forward yield) only marginally beats out MCD stock (2.28%) in this category. While Starbucks is on its way to becoming a Dividend Aristocrat (with 13 years of consecutive payout increases), MCD earned its regal title decades ago.', 'However, while MCD has increased its payout over the past five years by an average of around 8% annually, SBUX’s payout has gone by an average of 9.78% by this same metric. Most importantly, while trading at similar forward multiples, Starbucks’ expected future earnings growth exceeds that of McDonald’s, suggesting stronger long-term upside potential for shares.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'Growth at a reasonable price (GARP) is an apt descriptor for UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) shares. The health insurance and services giant trades for only 17.1 times forward earnings. That’s a low valuation, given how UNH has continued to increase earnings by double-digits each year.', 'Granted, a big reason why you can pick up UNH stock at a reasonable price today has to do with recent negative developments—namely, an antitrust probe and a ransomware attack. However, once headwinds resolve, shares could bounce back to their historic valuation — 20 to 25 times forward earnings.', 'That’s not all. The fact UnitedHealth is using its earnings growth to ramp up its dividend also bodes well for long-term investors. While its 1.58% yield is tiny today, with payouts increasing by 15.87% on average over the past five years, these payouts could become an even greater contributor to total returns in time.', 'On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

IRM, Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. HST and Gladstone Commercial Corp. GOOD.', 'Industry: Equity REITs', 'Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2240759/3-equity-reit-stocks-worth-betting-on-despite-industry-hiccups', 'The REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry constituents are likely to be affected by the uncertain business environment. Following the recent job report and inflation data, the Fed is likely to continue the cautious approach to lowering interest rates in the short term. Amid this, REITs’ interest expenses are likely to remain elevated in the near term. Moreover, supply-chain constraints and high material costs may raise development costs.', 'Given this backdrop, investors should consider betting on defensive asset categories within the industry that portray resiliency and have solid fundamentals that will drive growth. Players like Iron Mountain Inc., Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. and Gladstone Commercial Corp. are likely to prosper.', 'The Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other sector comprises a diverse collection of REIT stocks representing various asset categories, including industrial, office, lodging, healthcare, self-storage, data centers, infrastructures and more. Equity REITs lease out space within these properties to tenants, generating income through rental payments.', 'Economic growth assumes a central role within the real estate sector as economic expansion directly correlates with higher demand for real estate, increased occupancy rates and greater bargaining power for landlords to command higher rental rates. Moreover, the performance of Equity REITs hinges on the specific dynamics of their underlying assets and the geographic location of their properties. Therefore, it is imperative to thoroughly explore the fundamentals of these asset categories before making any investment decisions.', 'Economic Uncertainty to Hurt Activity in the Near Term: An uncertain business environment is likely to affect occupier sentiment. Investors are expected to maintain a cautious approach in the near term, especially regarding significant business transactions. Clients are exhibiting reduced urgency in making new commitments and are still waiting for further price discovery.', 'Asset-category-wise, though continued job expansion is expected to boost demand for office space, leasing activity is likely to be affected amid hybrid work setups and ongoing uncertainty in the broader business climate. In the self-storage asset category, there is new customer price sensitivity, and this headwind from lower new customer rates is likely to affect these REITs’ performance in the near term. Further, given that the initial surge in tower activity related to the early stage of the 5G investment cycle has peaked, demand for tower REITs is expected to mellow down in the quarters ahead, hurting profitability.', 'Supply-Chain Woes & High Material Costs Linger: Overall economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest continue to lead to supply-chain constraints at various stages. This, coupled with elevated interest rates, has pushed up the cost of raw materials, resulting in higher development costs. In addition, REITs are highly dependent on the debt market to carry out their development and redevelopment activities.', 'Also, following the recent job report and inflation data, the Federal Reserve is likely to continue adhering to the cautious approach to lowering interest rates in the short term. As a result, interest expenses are still likely to be on the higher end in the near term, affecting their ability to purchase or develop real estate with borrowed funds. Further, with high interest rates still in place, the dividend payout of REITs might seem less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money market accounts.', 'Resilient Demand Across Certain Asset Classes Gives Scope for Growth: Demand for certain asset categories is likely to remain healthy in the near term. Expected acceleration in the senior citizen population and a rise in healthcare spending by this age cohort in the upcoming period, as well as pent-up demand for medical services, augur well for Healthcare REITs’ medical property demand.', 'Meanwhile, the e-commerce boom and supply-chain strategy transformations have continued to provide an impetus to the industrial and logistics real estate space over the past years. Though there has been some cool-off in the warehouse and the manufacturing sectors, the healthy labor market is likely to keep U.S. consumers strong and keep demand for industrial real estate healthy.', 'For hotels, the scenario seems encouraging as growth in income is likely to support consumer spending and keep leisure demand steady. Also, with a continued improvement in the group business and a steady recovery in the business transient, the operating environment is likely to be stable.', 'Further, in this digital era, there is high demand for inter-connected data center space, with enterprises and service providers continuing to integrate artificial intelligence into their strategies and offerings and advance their digital transformation agendas. This will enhance growth prospects for data center REITs.', 'The Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry is housed within the broader Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #143, which places it in the bottom 43% of more than 250 Zacks industries.', 'The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dim near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.', 'The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the southward revision of funds from operations (FFO) per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate FFO per share estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s growth potential of late.

You have to choose the right stocks, monitor them, and make sure they don't turn into yield traps -- dividend payers that offer a high yield only because the business is declining, putting them at risk of a dividend cut. It's also a challenge to find dividend stocks that can grow their stock price over time as well as their dividend."", ""Some of these high-yield dividend stocks, however, do have the potential to safely deliver solid gains on both fronts. Let's look at two such stocks that could double in price under the right circumstances."", ""Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM) might seem like a surprising choice. After all, it's no secret that cigarette consumption has been declining for years, but Philip Morris is more than a conventional tobacco company."", ""The No. 1 brand in its portfolio for growth had long been Marlboro, but that is no longer the case. It's now Iqos, its heat-not-burn product that has been growing rapidly around the world, paving the way for the company's transition away from smoking. Iqos now accounts for more than 50% of revenue in 25 of the company's markets, and smoke-free products generated nearly 40% of revenue and gross profit of more than 40% year over year in the fourth quarter."", ""Of Philip Morris' $9 billion in revenue, $3.6 billion came from smoke-free products, and revenue from that category jumped 13.6% year over year in the quarter, driving overall revenue up 8.3% to $9 billion."", 'Management has also managed the decline of its cigarette business well; cigarettes sold fell by just 1.4% to 613 billion in 2023, while heated tobacco units grew by 14.7% to 125 billion.', 'In addition to Iqos, the company has a number of other fast-growing smoke-free products, including nicotine pouches like Zyn, and Snus, a Swedish oral tobacco product, both of which it gained in its acquisition of Swedish Match in 2022. Sales of nicotine pouches more than tripled year over year in the U.S. in the fourth quarter to 116.3 million units, and sales of Scandinavia-focused Snus rose 41% year over year to 57.1 million, a clear sign of success with those products.', 'Profits continued to grow despite the decline in cigarette volumes, with adjusted operating income up 3.3%, or 3.7% on an organic basis to $13.3 billion. And profit growth could accelerate as its rising smoke-free business makes up more of overall revenue.', 'Though the stock has shown a slow climb over the past decade, Philip Morris offers a 5.7% yield, making it an attractive dividend stock, and the share price has the ability to double over time with the growth of next-gen products.', 'It could take a decade, but as the smoke-free business grows, the share price should move higher over time.', ""Seasoned investors know that real estate investment trusts (REITs) are great places to look for dividends, and there's one REIT that offers both a high yield and the potential for the stock to double. That's Outfront Media (NYSE: OUT), one of the largest out-of-the-home (OOH) advertising companies in the world with a focus on billboard, transit, and mobile assets in North America. In addition to having a growing and modernizing category to penetrate, the stock currently offers a dividend yield of 7.5%."", 'Growth in the OOH category is starting to accelerate as it transitions to digital advertising that has the potential to update outdoor ad campaigns to adjust to weather and traffic, and even target individual passersby using their smartphones.', 'Outfront could be one of the biggest winners from this trend because it offers programmatic buying for OOH displays, allowing marketers to automate their campaigns based on data. Its digital direct ad server improves ad targeting.', 'New technology generally means a monetization opportunity, and Outfront looks to be in a good position to take advantage of the transition to digital billboards, having cited new technologies for higher prices in its fourth-quarter report.

As that market recovers, shares should continue to gain; they're already up roughly 65% from their low just a few months ago."", ""Even better, there's room for its $0.30 per share in quarterly dividends to go higher if it returns to its pre-pandemic dividend level of $0.38 per share per quarter."", 'If the ad market recovery remains on track, Outfront could double in the next year or two as investors return to this high-yielding cyclical REIT.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Outfront Media right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Outfront Media, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Outfront Media wasn’t one of them.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts."", 'Hasbro reported tepid fourth-quarter 2023 results, wherein earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined year over year.The quarter’s downtrend was primarily attributable to the low contributions from the Consumer Products and Entertainment segments, partially offset by growth in the Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment. The challenging macroeconomic scenario was discouraging for the company’s prospects.Nonetheless, the company’s intent focus on enhancing and diversifying its product portfolio, inventory optimization and resetting the cost structure will aid it in building its growth momentum through 2024.', 'In the fourth quarter of 2023, the company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 38 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents by 40.6%.

The Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, to which Schlumberger belongs, has gained 11.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Schlumberger is expected to post earnings of $0.75 per share, indicating a change of +19.1% from the year-ago quarter.

Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.', ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Revenues witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.5% over the last three years (2020-2023). This was primarily driven by rising non-interest income and net interest income (NII), with some annual volatility. The NII benefited from higher rates and loan balances.

The company expects sustained organic growth in the Asset Servicing and Wealth Management segments, primarily due to robust loan pipelines.The company is focused on expense management efforts to restore its operating leverage over the upcoming quarters. This includes disciplined headcount management, vendor consolidation, rationalization of its real estate footprint and process automation. Through such efforts, the company aims to boost productivity and meet financial targets.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So, when we ran our eye over Phillips 66's (NYSE:PSX) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Phillips 66, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.13 = US$8.0b ÷ (US$76b - US$16b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""Therefore, Phillips 66 has an ROCE of 13%.

If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Phillips 66 ."", ""While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 13% and the business has deployed 31% more capital into its operations. Since 13% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders."", ""In the end, Phillips 66 has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. And long term investors would be thrilled with the 105% return they've received over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further."", 'On a final note, we found  2 warning signs for Phillips 66 (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable)  you should be aware of.', ""While Phillips 66 may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Since then, the CEH has regularly tested products from those companies to verify those promises.', '“With each year of testing, we noticed that lead levels in fashion accessories seemed to decline,” it said. “In fact, it became more difficult over the years to find fashion accessories sold at big-box, department, and fast fashion retailers in California with any detectable lead, a testament to the overwhelming success of the public health-focused agreements we reached with large companies and their commitment to remove lead from fashion accessories.”', 'At the same time, it found that the problem persisted with off-priced retailers, which, as McKinsey & Co. once described them, operate on a business model that “relies on the purchase of overproduced, or excess… goods at a lower price to sell to consumers at a discounted rate.” Burlington and Ross, in particular cater to lower-income consumers, the CEH said. Compared to TJX Companies’ better-off customer base, the people who shop at Ross and Burlington typically report below-average income levels, according to a 2018 Coresight study.', 'Many of the stores are also located in communities that already face disproportionate environmental, health and socioeconomic pressures, per census data. This, the CEH added, makes the situation even more problematic, since “working or shopping at these stores should not put people at greater risk of exposure to toxic chemicals.”', 'In 2022, the organization found that more than half of the lead-containing accessories that it purchased at Burlington and Ross had Proposition 65 warnings, though some of them were “hidden” in small print on tags inside handbags or on the soles of shoes. It also observed that the interior lining of faux leather handbags and wallets more frequently contained lead than the exterior surface. Ersatz leather derived from PVC or polyurethane also generally contained more lead than their cowhide counterparts.', '“Burlington, Ross, TJX and any other off-price retailers are obligated to protect their customers and workers,” the report said. “These multi-billion dollar companies have attempted to implement chemical management policies in recent years (Burlington, 2022, TJX, 2021), but we were still finding lead-containing fashion accessories sold by them. They need to prioritize getting lead off of their store shelves, by not only adopting stricter chemical management policies, but also enforcing compliance of them and ensuring their effectiveness.”']"

Some of the biggest moves in the market this week have been in the commodities space. Cocoa prices extending their record run, topping $8,000 per metric ton."", ""And checking on the metals as well, copper hitting its highest level in nearly a year. And also there's oil. Let's mention that as well because it's closing up more than 3% this week, despite edging a little bit lower today."", ""Joining us now to break it all down, Blue Line Futures Chief Market Strategist Phil Streible and Path Trading Partners Co-founder and Chief Market Strategist Bob Iaccino. Guys, it's great to see you. Thanks so much for being here."", 'PHILLIP STREIBLE: Good to see you, Julie.', ""- So, obviously, there's a lot of commodities out there. We've been seeing a lot of action. So if you're an investor and you want to get involved here, you know, it's kind of a tricky thing to try to figure out. Bob, I want to start with you. Is there anything that can be said about commodities sort of writ large? Or do we really need to drill down and talk about each one individually?"", 'BOB IACCINO: Well, I think individual is valuable. And Phil is really good at that. But I just-- on a broader sense, you are talking about something that is really a pure supply and demand story. And I think that escapes a lot of people.', ""You're not going to have CEOs scandals with commodities. You're not going to have missed earnings with commodities. You're talking about how much is out there, what does the supply picture look like, and what does the demand picture look like. And that's all it is."", ""Now while it can get complex with different sort of geopolitical volatilities, especially in the place of crude oil-- we're talking about crude oil. That comes into play quite a bit-- inflation with gold, interest rates with some of the metals including copper. The bigger picture is supply and demand-- how much does there, and who wants to buy it?"", ""- So, Phil, let's bring you in here too and dig deeper into a few different areas. Walk me through, I guess to start, how you're thinking about the energy complex, Phil, and oil in particular here, highest level here since November. What's driving that, Phil? And what do you see ahead?"", ""PHILLIP STREIBLE: Yeah, so building out what Bob brought up-- and it's a great point here. You look at crude oil. You look at the demand. And the resiliency of the US economy has helped support the demand. We've got driving season right here."", ""And any kind of interest rate cut could really be a tailwind for the crude oil market. If you get some of this loan, some of this debt burden behind us with lower interest rates, people are going to have more money to spend. And they're probably going to do it the easiest way, which is travel."", ""So we're starting to see 2024 demand increasing. And we could see upward revisions in '25 and 2026. You look at the supply side of things. We saw Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries that could impact some of the Russian exports. We've also seen surprise drawdowns in the IEA inventories of 1.5 million barrels this week, taking the yearly decline down to 33 million barrels."", ""So you look at the bigger picture things. Like on the supply side, inventories are sitting at 446 million barrels versus the five-year average of 528. So one other thing that Bob didn't bring up was price momentum that also plays a big role. And you want to see those prices really moving in the direction that outlines and maps with the supply and demand picture. And crude oil prices look like they can go up to about $85 right now."", ""- So, Bob, do you agree-- I understand, you're a long whale. And I would ask--"", 'BOB IACCINO: Yup.', ""- --where you're expecting it to go and also how you think the best way is for people to play. I mean, you're a sophisticated investor in this stuff, right? So you're probably looking at crude oil futures, et cetera."", 'BOB IACCINO: Yes.', ""- For normal investors, should they be looking at ETFs? Should they go to the futures market? What's best?"", ""BOB IACCINO: Well, I always advise people that, you know, the thing that's 100% correlated to crude oil is crude oil. So the best place to play with that-- or play that out, I should say-- we don't play in investing-- is WTI crude. That's my favorite."", ""But for the average investor, you can look at USO. That's one of the ETFs people just generally default to. And for example, looking at [INAUDIBLE] newsfeed, which is a new product from them, I'm seeing that USO is projected to be lower than their average daily volume. But the activity is on the call side of things."", ""So to Phil's point about price momentum-- and he's right. I did leave that out. And it's very important-- my target on this was 82.50. Phil says 85. So I'm probably going to move it up to 85 now on the WTI. But the USO thing is very important because your average investor is looking at that. When the activity is to the call side, that means the market makers are going to be slowly buying up the USO if the volatility rises."", 'One thing about crude oil, volatility in the equity markets, we generally associate that with a down move. Volatility in something like crude could go either way. And a spike in volatility, in which case the calls would be active then, could come on an up move. And generally it does because we get a big supply disruption, like Phil mentioned, attacks on oil producers. That can cause supply disruptions and bring about volatility.']"

Oil prices (BZ=F, CL=F) have also been rising this week, at one point topping over $80 per barrel.', 'Path Trading Partners Co-Founder Bob Iaccino and Blue Line Futures Chief Market Strategist Phillip Streible join Yahoo Finance to discuss how investors should position themselves within the commodity sector.', 'Streible states that oil\'s rise is a simple function of supply and demand, highlighting a few demand-side drivers: ""Resiliency of the US economy has helped to support demand. We\'ve got driving season right here. Any kind of interest rate cut could really be a tailwind for the crude oil market. If you get some of this loan, some of this debt burden behind us with lower interest rates, people are gonna have more money to spend and they\'re probably going to do it the easiest way, which is travel. So we are starting to see 2024 demand increasing. And we could see upward revisions in \'25 and 2026.""', 'Investors may look to the futures market or to ETFs to join the oil rally, Iaccino explains: ""I always advise people the thing that\'s 100% correlated to crude oil is crude oil. So the best place...to play that out is WTI crude (MCL=F), that\'s my favorite.

Some of the biggest moves in the market this week have been in the commodities space. Cocoa prices extending their record run, topping $8,000 per metric ton."", ""And checking on the metals as well, copper hitting its highest level in nearly a year. And also there's oil. Let's mention that as well because it's closing up more than 3% this week, despite edging a little bit lower today."", ""Joining us now to break it all down, Blue Line Futures Chief Market Strategist Phil Streible and Path Trading Partners Co-founder and Chief Market Strategist Bob Iaccino. Guys, it's great to see you. Thanks so much for being here."", 'PHILLIP STREIBLE: Good to see you, Julie.', ""- So, obviously, there's a lot of commodities out there. We've been seeing a lot of action. So if you're an investor and you want to get involved here, you know, it's kind of a tricky thing to try to figure out. Bob, I want to start with you. Is there anything that can be said about commodities sort of writ large? Or do we really need to drill down and talk about each one individually?"", 'BOB IACCINO: Well, I think individual is valuable. And Phil is really good at that. But I just-- on a broader sense, you are talking about something that is really a pure supply and demand story. And I think that escapes a lot of people.', ""You're not going to have CEOs scandals with commodities. You're not going to have missed earnings with commodities. You're talking about how much is out there, what does the supply picture look like, and what does the demand picture look like. And that's all it is."", ""Now while it can get complex with different sort of geopolitical volatilities, especially in the place of crude oil-- we're talking about crude oil. That comes into play quite a bit-- inflation with gold, interest rates with some of the metals including copper. The bigger picture is supply and demand-- how much does there, and who wants to buy it?"", ""- So, Phil, let's bring you in here too and dig deeper into a few different areas. Walk me through, I guess to start, how you're thinking about the energy complex, Phil, and oil in particular here, highest level here since November. What's driving that, Phil? And what do you see ahead?"", ""PHILLIP STREIBLE: Yeah, so building out what Bob brought up-- and it's a great point here. You look at crude oil. You look at the demand. And the resiliency of the US economy has helped support the demand. We've got driving season right here."", ""And any kind of interest rate cut could really be a tailwind for the crude oil market. If you get some of this loan, some of this debt burden behind us with lower interest rates, people are going to have more money to spend. And they're probably going to do it the easiest way, which is travel."", ""So we're starting to see 2024 demand increasing. And we could see upward revisions in '25 and 2026. You look at the supply side of things. We saw Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries that could impact some of the Russian exports. We've also seen surprise drawdowns in the IEA inventories of 1.5 million barrels this week, taking the yearly decline down to 33 million barrels."", ""So you look at the bigger picture things. Like on the supply side, inventories are sitting at 446 million barrels versus the five-year average of 528. So one other thing that Bob didn't bring up was price momentum that also plays a big role. And you want to see those prices really moving in the direction that outlines and maps with the supply and demand picture. And crude oil prices look like they can go up to about $85 right now."", ""- So, Bob, do you agree-- I understand, you're a long whale. And I would ask--"", 'BOB IACCINO: Yup.', ""- --where you're expecting it to go and also how you think the best way is for people to play. I mean, you're a sophisticated investor in this stuff, right? So you're probably looking at crude oil futures, et cetera."", 'BOB IACCINO: Yes.', ""- For normal investors, should they be looking at ETFs? Should they go to the futures market? What's best?"", ""BOB IACCINO: Well, I always advise people that, you know, the thing that's 100% correlated to crude oil is crude oil. So the best place to play with that-- or play that out, I should say-- we don't play in investing-- is WTI crude. That's my favorite."", ""But for the average investor, you can look at USO. That's one of the ETFs people just generally default to. And for example, looking at [INAUDIBLE] newsfeed, which is a new product from them, I'm seeing that USO is projected to be lower than their average daily volume. But the activity is on the call side of things."", ""So to Phil's point about price momentum-- and he's right. I did leave that out. And it's very important-- my target on this was 82.50. Phil says 85. So I'm probably going to move it up to 85 now on the WTI. But the USO thing is very important because your average investor is looking at that. When the activity is to the call side, that means the market makers are going to be slowly buying up the USO if the volatility rises."", 'One thing about crude oil, volatility in the equity markets, we generally associate that with a down move. Volatility in something like crude could go either way. And a spike in volatility, in which case the calls would be active then, could come on an up move. And generally it does because we get a big supply disruption, like Phil mentioned, attacks on oil producers. That can cause supply disruptions and bring about volatility.']"

These futures are measured in pounds and you can see today's action up more than 1 and 1/2%."", ""Look, a lot of this rally that we're seeing year to date, copper is up more than 6%, part of this has to do with a tightening in global mine supplies. A giant mine in Panama that shut down last year, worries of interruptions in Zambia as well. And then you have smelters in China that have been joining forces to combat a drop in processing fees, basically short of a coordinated production cut."", 'So all of this has been helping to drive up copper futures.

So there's some analysts are saying, if you don't see a reversal in the stockpiles and investors could be, sort of, questioning this recent rally. But investors that have-- or analysts that I've also been talking to have been saying, look, copper is very much needed for the energy transition.

Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) are the only two companies outside of China able to design x86 processors destined for PCs.', ""There have been efforts to break the x86 stranglehold, but until recently, they've fallen short. A version of the Windows 8 operating system ran on Arm-based chips, and Microsoft even released variants of its Surface tablet about a decade ago powered by them."", ""The big problem was compatibility. Applications compiled for standard x86 Windows wouldn't work. This created confusion among consumers expecting to be able to download whatever applications they wanted. The product and Arm-based Windows were mostly dead on arrival."", 'Apple is the only success story so far, thanks to its complete control over hardware and software for its Mac PCs. The company began switching from Intel CPUs to custom Arm-based CPUs in 2020, providing a translation layer called Rosetta that enabled old applications compiled for Intel-based Macs to run on new Arm-based Macs. The switch has given Apple an important edge over Windows laptops in terms of battery life.', 'For Microsoft, keeping Apple in check requires PCs to get better, particularly on the efficiency and battery-life fronts. While Intel made progress with its Meteor Lake chips launched late last year, more competition is likely necessary to push Windows PCs forward.', 'Microsoft has been once again trying to push an Arm-based version of Windows, this time with Windows 11 and a translation layer that enables traditional Windows applications to run. There are some laptops already available running Arm-based chips from Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), although they fall short in terms of performance. There are still some compatibility issues, and emulating x86 apps introduces a performance penalty that noticeably slows things down.', ""Microsoft and Qualcomm aren't giving up. Qualcomm's next-generation PC CPU, the Snapdragon X Elite, may be powerful enough to overcome the performance gap with traditional laptops when it starts showing up in devices in mid-2024. There are even rumors circulating that Microsoft will announce a new Surface laptop later this month packing one of Qualcomm's new chips."", ""In early pre-release testing, the Snapdragon X Elite has put up some impressive results.

Up against Intel's Core 7 Ultra 155H, the 12-core Snapdragon X Elite held its own in some tests, while beating the Intel chip by wide margins in others."", ""While it will take time for Arm-based laptops to win over consumers, it seems inevitable that the PC CPU duopoly's days are numbered. More competition is bad news for both Intel's and AMD's PC CPU businesses."", 'However, Intel has a way to benefit from Arm-based PC chips proliferating, while AMD does not. Intel may lose PC CPU market share, but its foundry business could eventually be pumping out Arm-based PC chips for Qualcomm and others.', 'Intel expects to surpass semiconductor foundry leader TSMC technologically early next year with its Intel 18A process, which packs a new transistor design and will be the first process node to use backside-power delivery, which can boost power efficiency. This will be particularly important for chips aiming to maximize battery life.', 'Intel and Arm Holdings struck a deal last year to co-optimize the Arm architecture and the Intel 18A process. Intel has scored some Arm-based design wins -- notably, a server chip using Arm Neoverse cores. If Arm-based PCs take off, the downside of potentially losing share in the PC CPU market can be offset by design wins in the foundry business.', ""AMD doesn't manufacture its own chips, so increased competition in the PC CPU market is all downside. The company is already in a distant second place in the PC CPU market with a unit share of about 20%. Viable Arm-based PCs powered by CPUs from Qualcomm and potentially others -- Nvidia is rumored to be working on PC chips -- will eat away at that market share."", ""One could argue that Intel has more to lose, given that its PC CPU market share is much higher. That may be true, but it also has more to gain. As Intel pushes to become the world's second-largest foundry by 2030, Arm-based PC chips are likely to roll off the company's assembly lines as its manufacturing technology catches up with TSMC."", 'While Arm-based PCs introduce uncertainty for both Intel and AMD, they represent an opportunity for Intel, while only a risk for AMD.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Lockheed Martin the TSR over the last 5 years was 69%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!', ""Investors in Lockheed Martin had a tough year, with a total loss of 3.8% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 32%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 11%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend.

It generates billions in revenue and profit every year and its products are used all over the world. It's a truly global organization that has achieved considerable success over the years."", 'It also pays a dividend that it has increased for decades, giving investors plenty of incentive to buy and hold the stock, simply collecting that recurring payout along the way.', ""In the past 10 years, the stock's total returns (which include dividends) have come in around 125%, creating significant value for shareholders. It has been a great investment, particularly for risk-averse investors who wanted a stock they could just buy and forget about."", ""Here's why it isn't a great buy anymore."", 'For decades, Johnson & Johnson has arguably been a beloved name in healthcare. Many consumers associate the brand with quality and safety. However, that may not necessarily be the case anymore. Of late, the healthcare company has been battling countless lawsuits, particularly with its talc-based products, which plaintiffs allege were contaminated with materials that led them to develop cancer.', ""These are serious claims and J&J is fighting against them vigorously. This isn't just about protecting its image, however; it's also about the significant amount of money that is at stake. Johnson & Johnson has gone to considerable lengths to try and put the issue to rest. It tried to use a subsidiary, LTL Management, to assume responsibility for all the lawsuits and then bankrupt it, thus limiting its overall liability. Judges rejected this attempt -- twice."", ""If the plan had been approved, Johnson & Johnson would have put $8.9 billion into LTL to fund a settlement. If it's willing to settle on that amount, you can be sure that it's worried its total liability is likely to otherwise be far higher than that. With tens of thousands of lawsuits outstanding just related to talc, it becomes nearly impossible to estimate the total liability the business faces. One way the company has been able to effectively offload some liability is through the spinoff of its consumer health business into Kenvue (NYSE: KVUE), which will be responsible for any talc lawsuits that arise outside of the U.S. and Canada."", ""Given the uncertainty regarding the talc lawsuits, investors should tread very carefully with Johnson & Johnson's stock. It's tempting to assume that since it makes billions, it can absorb these legal costs, but these legal bills keep on mounting. It has also faced litigation related to other products, including Risperdal, opioids, and vaginal mesh implants."", 'Last year, Johnson & Johnson reported $13.3 billion in profit, with revenue totaling $85.2 billion. But what the future holds is a question mark because the company is facing the loss of exclusivity for top-selling psoriasis medication Stelara, which could face competition in the U.S. as early as next year. In 2023, Stelara generated $10.9 billion in revenue.', 'Between 2025 and 2030, Johnson & Johnson projects that it will generate annual growth between 5% and 7%, hoping the development of new drugs to will help offset the loss of exclusivity for Stelara. But the relatively modest single-digit expansion rate may not be sufficient for the company to both be an attractive growth investment and be financially strong enough to absorb the possible legal battles ahead.', ""While Johnson & Johnson's recent results are still impressive, the company's future has never been cloudier than it is now. Rising legal costs could burden the business and potentially impact the safety of its dividend, especially as it focuses more on growth and creating innovative medicines."", ""In the past, Johnson & Johnson may have been a good healthcare stock to comfortably hold in your portfolio. But that's no longer the case. Until there is a resolution to the talc-related issues, the stock is simply too big of a risk these days. The legal bills pose a threat to the company's dividend and its long-term growth objectives. And with many other dividend stocks and top healthcare companies to invest in, there's just not a compelling reason to put money into J&J when there are much better and safer options out there."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Johnson & Johnson right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Johnson & Johnson, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Johnson & Johnson wasn’t one of them.

Boston received approval for its own PFA device in January, and J&J is developing its own version of the technology.\xa0', 'Medtronic is also working to carve out a new market in renal denervation, an ablation procedure intended to help reduce blood pressure as a supplement to drugs and lifestyle changes. The company and Recor both received approval for the first renal denervation devices last year, although an FDA advisory panel did not recommend Medtronic’s device as it had missed the primary endpoint in a clinical trial.\xa0', 'MedTech Dive spoke with Sean Salmon, Medtronic’s cardiovascular president, about the road ahead for these new devices and how the company views its competition.\xa0', 'This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\xa0', 'SEAN SALMON: In 2009, when we first made the decision to invest in this little startup company called Ardian, it was intriguing. I’ve worked in the high blood pressure space before. I know just how unsatisfying the status quo is. It’s probably the largest public health problem we have. One in every two adults has high blood pressure right now — 700,000 deaths are either directly caused or associated with it in the U.S. alone.', ""A lot of these patients don't just have high blood pressure, they’ve got high cholesterol, diabetes, and they're taking 12 to 15 prescribed medicines every single day. A lot of those medicines, particularly hypertension ones, have side effects. It’s not an easy thing for patients to do.\xa0"", 'The promise of having a procedure that you can do in a day. It lasts 24 hours a day, seven days a week and has no side effects. It’s not a cure. It’s not a panacea. It is a huge adjunct help to good lifestyle choices and adherence to medications.\xa0', ""There's a lot to do. CMS, in particular, has a couple of facilities for novel things that can come out that you can get temporary payment until you have enough evidence to satisfy a national coverage determination.\xa0"", ""It's also important because a lot of private payers’ coverage policies are largely informed by what determinations CMS makes. We've got to do the short-term work of trying to get add-on payments, both for the inpatient and outpatient setting and for a national coverage determination through multiple different pathways, including those with evidence development.\xa0"", ""On the private or commercial side, we've got to work state by state. We’ll be busy on reimbursement for a really long time.\xa0\xa0"", ""Once we get that established, I think there's a lot [of work] to drive awareness among patients. There's a lot of interest, but it's also important that their family doctor knows what this is about. Training the doctors, making sure they know how to do the procedure, and helping them set up hypertension clinics, which will help sort out who is or isn't appropriate for something like this."", 'The ablation market exists already. It’s about an $8 billion market that’s growing in the high-single digits. We play in a part of it. For atrial fibrillation, you can isolate the pulmonary veins, which are known to be the major source of where that arrhythmia comes from.\xa0', ""Pulsed field doesn't use any temperature. You’re not using hot or cold to create scar to block those irregular heartbeats from getting through. It uses a high field of electricity that we pulse out in pulse trains. What that does is it essentially pokes a hole in the cell membrane, water comes in and the cell dies. And what's interesting about that is you can tune that pulse train so that it's very specific to what you want to die out. No collateral damage — you don’t worry about the esophagus, you don't worry about the nerves that are right behind where you're doing all this ablation in the heart. The potential for complications goes way down."", 'Our clinical study beared that out. We had one of the lowest complication rates recorded at sub-1%. The energy is also really fast. Doing complex procedures that take lots of hours, five or six hours, can be done in a fraction of that time.', ""We have an organically developed program, which we call PulseSelect, that's what just got approved. We also acquired a program that does the more traditional point-by-point [ablation] but with a very novel catheter and a very novel mapping system, which is something we haven’t had all these years.\xa0"", ""When other competitors are doing it, you feel comfort that you're doing the right thing. A lot of what you want with good competition is to drive your own creativity, and you want help in building markets out, so awareness among patients and providers and even hospital administrators.\xa0"", ""Being highly differentiated on products and taking some of the work steps out, that's how we win in the trenches."", 'We keep reinventing ourselves in our oldest business, cardiac rhythm. The most recent iteration of that is a new way of doing the ICD market.\xa0', 'With an ICD traditionally, you have these leads that go into the heart. You have a big device under your collarbone on the side of your chest. Leads are great. They’ve been proven that you can deliver energy. Importantly, what you can do with a lead in the heart is you can pace the patient rather than just shock them.\xa0', ""That’s important because a shock is scary and painful. You don’t want to do that if you don't have to do that.\xa0"", ""There is another device — Boston Scientific sells one — for what they call leadless. You reduce the potential for infection, but that can't pace. That device can only shock. It’s twice the size, and it doesn’t last as long.\xa0"", ""The big innovation we had for what we call an extravascular ICD is that we tunnel a lead underneath the breastbone. And from that position, we're close enough that we can pace the heart. The device works like a traditional ICD. It's a big opportunity. That market today is $300-ish million dollars.

As GE Vernova (the power, renewable energy, and electrification business) prepares to debut on the market on April 2, the remaining entity, GE Aerospace, holds significant potential."", ""Despite the stock's impressive performance, is it still a value proposition? Let's delve into the details."", ""As I've previously highlighted in a comprehensive analysis, GE Vernova's market cap is conservatively estimated at around $27.3 billion. However, the current value of GE stock is around $183 billion. Notwithstanding the fact that the $27.3 billion estimate for GE Vernova is conservative (meaning it's a good investment at that level), is the implied $155.7 billion a reasonable valuation for GE Aerospace?"", ""There's little doubt that the market has revalued the GE Aerospace portion of the company over the last year, and I think there are a few reasons for this:"", 'GE Aerospace has operationally outperformed other large-cap commercial aerospace giants like RTX and Boeing.', 'The company is also less exposed to some of the margin and supply chain issues in the defense industry that have affected and continue to affect RTX, Lockheed Martin, and, to an extent, Boeing.', 'Investors stopped pricing GE as an industrial conglomerate and started thinking about the company as ""GE Aerospace+GE Vernova"" and valued it accordingly (aerospace companies tend to trade at valuation premiums to industrial companies).', ""GE Aerospace's rival engine maker RTX (the two offer competing engines on the Airbus A320 neo family) had a disappointing 2023 after discovering a potential contamination of powder coating used in turbine discs on its engines, which requires engines to be removed inspected, resulting in a multibillion-dollar hit to earnings and cash flow."", ""In addition, RTX's defense business continues to be pressured by delivering on fixed-price development programs signed in less inflationary times (Boeing and Lockheed Martin also have this issue)."", ""Meanwhile, Boeing's commercial aerospace business has no shortage of problems, and there are question marks around the timing of its production ramp up and, more importantly, the kind of profit margin it will achieve. In contrast, GE Aerospace's lack of issues has made it the favored stock in the large-cap aerospace sector."", 'As noted above, aerospace companies trade at a valuation premium to industrial companies to reflect the long-term earnings and cash-flow streams from their services revenue. For example, the aircraft engine model (GE and RTX both follow this) is to sell engines at a loss only to generate decades of higher-margin parts and service revenue.', 'As such, when equipment deliveries are ramping up (as they are now with the LEAP engine on the Airbus A320 neo family and the Boeing 737 MAX, the GEnx engine on the Boeing 787, and in the future the GE9X on the Boeing 777X), profitability is depressed in relation to what it will be when the engines are in use for a few years and the revenue mix shifts to higher-margin parts and services.', ""As such, nobody is pricing GE Aerospace for what it is now, but rather what its future earnings and cash flow will be. For example, my estimate for the implied value of GE Aerospace of $155.7 billion means GE Aerospace is valued at 31.1 times management's estimate for free cash flow (FCF) in 2024, as shown below."", 'GE Aerospace', '2023', '2024', '2025', 'Adjusted revenue', '$32 billion', 'Low double-digit growth', 'Low double-digit growth', 'Operating profit', '$5.6 billion', '$6 billion to $6.5 billion', '$7.1 billion to $7.5 billion', 'Free cash flow', '$4.7 billion', '$5 billion', 'Greater than 100% conversion from net income', 'Data source: GE Aerospace presentations.', ""It's an extremely high figure for an industrial conglomerate but comparable to the valuations accorded to other aerospace-focused companies (see chart below). In addition, note that GE Aerospace will see some margin pressure in the coming years as engine deliveries ramp up and their share of the revenue mix grows. In other words, GE's earnings and cash flow in the near term don't reflect its long-term potential."", ""Based on the numbers above, GE is starting to look close to being fully valued. One Wall Street analyst thinks there's still high-single-digit upside potential to the stock price, which looks reasonable, albeit unexciting."", 'That said, GE\'s valuation has possibly been bolstered by the perception that it is a ""go to"" stock in the aerospace and defense sector in light of the Boeing, RTX, and Lockheed Martin issues. That could change if the three start improving operationally.', 'The best way to consider the investment opportunity is to look at what GE Vernova and GE Aerospace are valued at after the spin. Anything less than $27.3 billion for GE Vernova is an excellent value opportunity, while less than $155.7 billion for GE Aerospace provides a little upside.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in General Electric right now?', 'Before you buy stock in General Electric, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and General Electric wasn’t one of them.

They can be a great way to do that, as the rental income can usually cover the expenses and then some.', ""However, rental properties have their pitfalls. A big one is that they're not exactly passive investments. Unless you hire a property manager, you'd have to manage tenants and maintenance. Meanwhile, unplanned repair costs can quickly turn a rental property from a moneymaker into a money pit."", 'Because of that, those thinking about buying a rental property might want to consider purchasing shares in a real estate investment trust (REIT) instead. REITs enable anyone to invest in real estate to enjoy truly passive income. Realty Income (NYSE: O), Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE: MAA), and Invitation Homes (NYSE: INVH) are great REITs to consider buying.', ""Most beginning real estate investors will buy a single-family home to rent out. However, these have a high upfront cost (the down payment and any needed repairs to make the property rent-ready). On top of that, owning a single property is risky because if the tenant unexpectedly moves out, you'll have no rental income to cover your mortgage and other expenses."", ""Investing in Invitation Homes is a great alternative because it focuses on owning single-family rental homes. It owns or manages over 100,000 of them across 16 high-growth markets, which benefit from strong demand. That gives you instant diversification. Meanwhile, investing in Invitation Homes won't break the bank. You can buy as little as one share for around $35 apiece. "", 'Each share you buy would entitle you to a quarterly dividend payment of $0.28 (about a 3.2% yield on the initial cost at the recent share price). The more shares you buy, the more income you can make. For example, a $1,000 investment in Invitation Homes would produce about $32 of annual dividend income. That income should rise each year as the REIT increases its dividend, driven by rent growth across its existing properties and the steady expansion of its portfolio. It gave investors an 8% raise last year. ', 'Mid-America Apartment Communities, MAA is another great alternative to buying a rental property. The REIT owns over 102,000 apartment units across 16 states, predominately in the Sun Belt region. ', 'The company focuses on the fast-growing Sun Belt region because the demand for housing is strong and growing. This regional focus enables it to benefit from high occupancy levels, which allow it to steadily increase rents and develop new apartment communities. Those catalysts provide it with growing rental income to support its dividend. ', ""The company has increased its dividend payment for 14 straight years, including by 5% late last year. It costs about $130 to buy one share, entitling the owner to $5.88 of dividend income each year (paid in quarterly installments of $1.47). That's a 4.5% yield on the recent price. "", 'Realty Income is a splendid REIT to buy for those seeking recurring income. It pays a monthly dividend of $0.257 per share ($3.078 annualized). That gives the REIT a 6% dividend yield at the recent price of around $52 per share. The company routinely increases its dividend. It has raised the payout 124 times since its public market listing in 1994, including for the last 106 straight quarters. ', 'The diversified REIT focuses on owning free-standing commercial properties net leased to quality tenants in durable industries that are relatively resilient to economic downturns and the threat of e-commerce. Those leases make the tenants responsible for building insurance, maintenance, and real estate taxes. These features enable the REIT to generate a very stable rental income stream to support its dividend.', 'Realty Income has an increasingly diversified portfolio. It owns retail, industrial, gaming, consumer-centric medical, vertical farming, and data center properties across the U.S. and Europe. It routinely invests in new income-producing properties, which grow its rental income, allowing it to steadily raise its dividend.', ""Rental properties can be a good way to make some additional income. However, the income isn't exactly passive, nor is it always stable. Because of that, those considering buying a rental property should evaluate whether investing in REITs would be a better option. They enable you to collect truly passive income that's typically very stable and steadily rises over time."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Realty Income wasn’t one of them.

When considering valuation metrics, the price-to-earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice. This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy. However, the price-to-sales ratio is convenient for determining the value of stocks that are incurring losses or in an early development cycle, generating meager or no profit.', ""While a loss-making company with a negative price-to-earnings ratio falls out of investor favor, its price-to-sales can indicate the hidden strength of the business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure a company's growth is not overvalued.A stock’s price-to-sales ratio reflects how much investors pay for each dollar of revenue generated by a company.If the price-to-sales ratio is 1, investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company. A stock with a price-to-sales below 1 is a good bargain as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar’s worth. \xa0Thus, a stock with a lower price-to-sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price-to-sales ratio.The price-to-sales ratio is often preferred over price-to-earnings, as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.However, one should keep in mind that a company with a high debt and a low price-to-sales ratio is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance, a rise in market cap, and, ultimately, a higher price-to-sales ratio.In any case, the price-to-sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick.

In this context, turboprop aircraft play a critical role and have witnessed a significant rise in demand.To this end, it is imperative to mention that Textron Aviation’s Cessna Grand Caravan EX aircraft is a multi-utility vehicle, operated by regional airlines, charter operators and cargo carriers worldwide. With an impressive output of 867 horsepower and a rate of climb of 1,275 feet per minute, the aircraft is engineered for challenging special missions, high payloads and short, rough runways while delivering single-engine economy and simplicity.Undoubtedly, the latest award reflects the solid demand that Textron’s turboprop aircraft enjoy globally.

In the military sector, the demand for turboprop aircraft is recently on the rise, backed by the global increase in military spending and the need for fleet modernization. Per a report from the Mordor Intelligence firm, the turboprop aircraft market size is estimated to witness a CAGR of 1.88% during 2024-2029.This offers strong growth opportunities for Textron, with the company’s Textron Aviation unit offering a robust portfolio for turboprop jets like the Cessna Grand Caravan EX, Caravan, SkyCourier and Beechcraft King Air 360, King Air 260 and King Air 360R. Its Beechcraft Denali, a high-performance single engine turboprop aircraft, is under developmentDuring 2023, Textron Aviation delivered 153 commercial turboprops. Regarding recent achievements in this field, in 2024, SkyCourier was selected by Australia’s regional airline Hinterland Aviation. Further, at the Singapore Airshow, Textron won orders for one SkyCourier passenger variant and four Grand Caravan EXs. These, along with the latest contract win, should boost TXT’s revenues.', 'Apart from TXT, other companies expected to benefit from the growing turboprop aircraft market are Lockheed Martin LMT, Northrop Grumman NOC and Airbus Group EADSY.Lockheed Martin’s C-130J Super Hercules is a four-engine turboprop military transport aircraft.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NIKE Inc. NKE, PVH Corp. PVH and Carnival Corp. CCL.', 'Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:', 'Meta Platforms continues to see estimates rise after their last quarterly report and so it remains a Zacks #1 Rank Strong Buy based on its earnings momentum.', 'My colleague Derek Lewis wrote about the resurgence of META in early February after their 10% EPS beat and raised guidance.', 'Q4 EPS of $5.33 bested the year-ago number by a whopping 200%, while revenues of $40.11 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.87% and jumped 24.7% year over year. At constant currency (cc), the top line improved 22%.', 'When Derek wrote about upward estimate revisions on February 7, analyst consensus for this year and next stood at EPS of $19.41 and $22.42 respectively.', 'Now those projections have risen to $19.94 and $23.09, representing 34% and 16% annual growth.', 'After Apple made a big splash with their new mixed reality device Vision Pro, I decided to check in to see how Zuck & Co. are fairing with their line of VR/AR headsets known as Quest.', ""The division that makes and sells Quest gear is still a money-losing operation, but that's by design for their long-term development plan."", ""I recently wrote about META's Reality Labs for my forthcoming special report on the Metaverse because I wanted to investigate how and when this king-pin of social media advertising, commerce and communication would realize profits from this new technology realm."", ""You can get on the waiting list for that report by emailing Ultimate@Zacks.com and tell 'em Cooker sent you."", ""Besides the stock ramping 400% since its nadir in Q4'22, META revenues troughed at $117 billion in that year and tagged $135B in 2023. Even better, topline growth this year is projected to approach $160B for an 18% advance."", ""That resurgence in META's core business growth gives them room to experiment with the new technology platforms."", ""Here's what I wrote recently in my Metaverse report..."", ""The launch of Meta Quest Pro was a small success, but it won't move the needle on META earnings as word is that this is still a money-losing business for them. Meta's Reality Labs unit brought in more than $1 billion in fourth-quarter sales (the holiday quarter) but recorded an operating loss of $4.65 billion. Clearly, this is a division that Zuck & Co. can afford to invest in for a while."", ""According to AR Insider, whose team does a breakdown of quarterly revenue for the Meta Reality Labs unit, MRL's topline was only $210 million in Q3 and they extrapolated that into $161.7 million for hardware sales. And these figures were down 24% sequentially and 27% year-over-year."", 'Plus, the cheaper Quest 2 still way out-sells the Quest Pro, with estimated revenue of $140 million. They concluded ""Considering an average unit price of $315, this means that Meta sold approximately 443,931 Quest 2s in Q3."" With Quest Pro\'s estimated revenue at barely $9 million and a Q3 ASP of $999 (the price dropped from $1,499 in Q1 the AR Insider team noted) this means that Meta sold approximately 8,934 Quest Pros in Q3.', 'So for now, the META story is still about its consumer engagement and the ability of the platform to sell more advertising and automate the shopping experience. If you\'ve scrolled Instagram or any Reels lately, you know how ""sticky"" these apps are.', 'And again, this is the base of 1-2 billion daily active users that will be able to leverage the next Metaverse experiences in social and ecommerce. ""I think the software and social platform might be the most critical part of what we\'re doing, but software is just a lot less capital intensive to build than the hardware,"" Zuckerberg said in February of 2023.', 'Meta Reality Labs reported $13.7 billion in operating losses for 2022 and lost $16.1 billion in 2023. They expect its operating losses to increase year over year in 2024, but I expect Zuck & Co. to keep investing to eventually leverage Metaverse tools and apps for profits -- just like Apple is experimenting with what comes after the iPhone.', 'Bottom line on META: The Metaverse is a foot race of titans since the hardware development is so expensive. While AAPL growth stagnates at 6.5 times sales, I think META is a buy here trading 7X sales with 15% topline growth.', ""Be sure to grab my Metaverse report to find out which other stocks I'm picking in that race."", 'MongoDBis a $27 billion provider of datacenter solutions and is a key alternative to AWS and Azure because developers seem to love the platform.', 'Mongo has established itself as the clear next-generation, NoSQL, general purpose database leader with over $2B of annualized revenue growing at 20%+ and its core Atlas product growing high double-digits. Based on its large total addressable market, their growing platform capabilities position MongoDB for strong growth for many years.', 'But despite a big earnings beat on March 7, MongoDB slipped into the cellar of the Zacks Rank this week on weaker guidance that forced analysts to lower their growth projections.', ""MongoDB forecast revenue growth in a range of +13% to +15% for its current FY'25 that began Feb. 1.

The company’s last quarterly results benefited from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Productivity and Business Processes revenues rose due to a strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 78.4 million. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Solid adoption of Azure AI, which now has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers holds promise.However, Office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remains a concern.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)Shares of Coca-Cola have gained +3.5% over the past year against the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry’s gain of +7.9%.

At a lower price point and growth potentially on the horizon again, could this be a stock that helps you become a millionaire?"", ""One thing I've liked about Pfizer's strategy is that as it has been generating billions thanks to its COVID-19 vaccine, it has been putting that money to work. The drugmaker has been acquiring businesses and making investments that should set it up for future growth down the road. It wasn't hoping for the revenue to continue flowing in from its COVID products forever; rather, it was preparing for the next phase of its growth. That's a great sign of a growth-oriented business."", 'While Pfizer has been involved with several deals, the largest has been its $43 billion acquisition of cancer company Seagen.

It will, however, take some time for the business to get back to growing.

At $25,000, it would need to deliver a more modest 40x return. But for Pfizer to become a 40-bagger, you would need to assume the company will one day have a $6.4 trillion market value.

But over shorter timelines, it's also proven to be unpredictable and quite volatile. Over the previous four years, Wall Street's major stock indexes have alternated between bear and bull markets in successive years. These swings have been especially noticeable for the growth stock-driven Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC)."", ""During the 2022 bear market, the Nasdaq Composite shed a third of its value. But since the start of 2023, it's been nothing but green pastures for growth stocks, with the Nasdaq Composite gaining a blistering 54% and reaching an all-time high. There's absolutely no question that Wall Street and the Nasdaq are in the midst of a new bull market."", 'But just because the Nasdaq Composite has soared, it doesn\'t mean amazing deals can\'t be found. With the ""Magnificent Seven"" accounting for an outsized percentage of the Nasdaq\'s ascent, deals remain for opportunistic investors willing to seek them out.', ""What follows are four extraordinary growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market."", ""The first phenomenal growth stock that could have investors kicking themselves for not taking the plunge -- even with the Nasdaq hitting new highs -- is fintech leader PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL). Despite concerns about increased competition in the digital payments space, PayPal's operating results suggest it maintains a competitive edge."", 'Before digging into the specifics, understand that fintech should be a sustained double-digit growth opportunity throughout the remainder of the decade, if not well beyond. The adoption rate for digital payments is still ramping up, which should produce a hearty growth runway for PayPal.', ""What's really stood out about PayPal has been the sheer volume of payments traversing its network, which includes Venmo. Last year, total payment volume surged 12% to $1.53 trillion on a currency-neutral basis."", 'More importantly, active accounts are completing a greater number of transactions over time. When 2020 came to a close, active PayPal accounts averaged just shy of 41 transactions over the trailing-12-month (TTM) period. As of the close of 2023, payment transactions per active account had risen to 58.7 on a TTM basis.', ""PayPal is predominantly a fee-driven business. If transactions per active accounts continues to climb, PayPal's gross profit should rise, too."", ""Investors would also be wise not to overlook the importance of new CEO Alex Chriss's plans to improve upon existing product offerings and launch new services, all while keeping the company's costs under control. Prior to joining PayPal in late September, Chriss was one of the leading figures at Intuit's Small Business division. He has a keen understanding of what smaller businesses want, as well as how to keep costs in check."", 'The cherry on top is that PayPal shares can be scooped up for a little north of 11 times forward-year earnings, which is historically cheap for this fintech innovator.', ""A second extraordinary growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio with the Nasdaq Composite decisively entering a bull market is online-services marketplace Fiverr International (NYSE: FVRR). In spite of persistent concerns that artificial intelligence (AI) could hamper its freelancer-fueled operating model, Fiverr's abundance of competitive advantages suggests it's nothing short of a bargain."", 'On a macro basis, Fiverr has benefited handsomely from a shift in the labor market following the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. While some people have returned to the office, a considerably higher percentage of workers are now remote. This is excellent news for a company that aims to connect freelancers with businesses that need their services.', ""Fiverr's online marketplace is another reason for its success. Whereas many of its competitors allow freelancers to list their services at an hourly rate, Fiverr freelancers are pricing their jobs as completed tasks. This provides unparalleled price transparency, which has steadily increased spending per buyer on the platform."", ""To add to this, Fiverr's investments in AI have driven gross merchandise value higher. While the returns have been modest, thus far, AI looks to be a help, not a hindrance, to this top-notch gig economy stock."", 'However, the single greatest reason to trust in Fiverr, from an investment standpoint, is the company\'s take rate. The ""take rate"" describes the percentage of each deal negotiated on its platform, including fees, it gets to keep. While most of its peers have take rates in the mid-to-high teens, Fiverr\'s expanded to 31.8% in the December-ended quarter. It\'s taking a bigger piece of the pie and seeing active buyers spend more each quarter. This is a recipe that should generate a superior operating margin within its industry.', ""The third marvelous growth stock that's begging to be bought in the young Nasdaq bull market is specialty biotech company BioMarin Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ: BMRN). Though BioMarin's TTM price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of nearly 100 is bound to scare some value investors away, a consensus annualized earnings growth rate of 43% over the next five years should be music to growth investors' ears."", ""To start with, BioMarin enjoys the benefits of being in the highly defensive healthcare sector. Regardless of what's happening with the U.S. or global economy, patients taking brand-name drugs developed by BioMarin will continue to need those therapies in any climate. This means the company's cash flow is always predictable and transparent."", 'What tends to differentiate BioMarin Pharmaceutical from other drug developers is its focus on ultrarare-disease drugs. Brand-name treatments that are focused on small groups of patients can be risky, but also rewarding. In addition to tackling an ailment that has few or no treatment options, ultrarare-disease drugs have limited competition and face minimal pushback on their list prices from health insurers.', ""BioMarin's biggest growth opportunity at the moment lies with dwarfism drug Voxzogo. Increased uptake, strong pricing power, and potential label expansion opportunities for Voxzogo have the ability to eventually propel annual sales to north of $1 billion. For context, Voxzogo sales rose by 178% in 2023 to about $470 million."", 'To round things out, BioMarin Pharmaceutical is well capitalized and fully capable of continuing to successfully develop rare-disease drugs internally. It closed out 2023 with $1.68 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and various short-and-long-term investments. New drug launches, label expansions, and pricing power have the potential to sustain sales growth of 10% or more throughout the decade.', ""The fourth extraordinary growth stock you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market is none other than Magnificent Seven member Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). In spite of a challenging advertising environment, Alphabet makes for a genius buy."", 'Although recessions are known for wreaking havoc on ad-driven businesses, these impacts tend to be short lived. While only three of 12 U.S. recessions since the end of World War II have lasted at least 12 months, there have been two periods of growth that reached at least 10 years over the same span. Patient investors tend to prosper in ad-focused companies.', ""Alphabet's primary cash-flow driver for the moment is its world-leading internet search engine, Google. In February, Google accounted for nearly 92% of global internet search share. In fact, it's been nine years since Google last held less than a 90% monthly share of worldwide internet search. Being a practical monopoly in internet search means Google can command exceptional ad-pricing power."", ""But what shareholders are likely to be most excited about is growth from Alphabet's ancillary operations. For instance, Google Cloud has grown into the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service provider by spending, according to tech analysis firm Canalys. More importantly, Google Cloud generates considerably juicier margins than advertising, and this segment delivered its first profitable year in 2023."", ""Don't sleep on YouTube, either. YouTube is the second-most visited social site on the planet, with approximately 2.5 billion monthly active users."", 'One of the fastest-growing innovations within YouTube is short-form videos known as ""Shorts."" Since being introduced in 2021, the average number of daily views of Shorts has grown from 6.5 billion to north of 50 billion in early 2023. Whether it\'s additional ad revenue or premium subscriptions, Shorts are a cash-flow driver for YouTube and its parent company.', ""Lastly, Alphabet stock is historically inexpensive. Among the Magnificent Seven stocks that have lifted the Nasdaq to new heights, it's the cheapest relative to both forward P/E ratio and multiple to cash flow."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Many companies in this sector are busy inventing tomorrow's technologies, often prioritizing reinvestment over distributing cash profits through dividends."", 'Let me paint a picture for you. There are 2,457 stocks trading on American stock exchanges with a market cap of at least $1 billion, according to Finviz.\xa0Of them, 1,504, or 61%, offer some sort of dividend payout.', ""Narrow your view to the tech sector, and you'll find 111 dividend payers out of 373 billion-dollar companies. Only 30% of these companies offer any dividends at all."", ""The gap grows even wider if you're looking for generous dividend policies, too. Thirty-five percent of all billion-dollar companies provide an annual dividend yield of at least 2%. In the tech sector, the group of 2% yields shrinks to just 29 names, or 8% of the sector."", ""That being said, it's not impossible to find great dividend payers in the metaphorical Silicon Valley. Some of those 29 names are absolutely fantastic income investments right now."", 'Let me show you three of my favorite ideas in that category. Savvy income investors can set up an effective dividend portfolio around semiconductor veteran Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN), artificial intelligence (AI) expert IBM (NYSE: IBM), and materials science innovator Corning (NYSE: GLW).', 'Legendary chipmaker Texas Instruments has a long history of shareholder-friendly dividend payouts. The company sent its first dividend checks in the spring of 1962. The annual payouts have increased in every year since 2004.', ""Semiconductor companies tend to be very cyclical. Each sector member's key products face sharp swings in demand as they often focus on hyper-specific end markets."", ""But TI gets around. It generated 40% of its 2023 revenue from industrial customers and 34% from automotive clients. Personal electronics and communications equipment also made significant contributions to the company's top line. Moreover, TI makes both analog and digital chips, widening its exposure to different contract opportunities even within any particular target industry."", ""And don't forget that the company runs its own manufacturing facilities, too. When fabless chip designers compete for production capacity at one of the industry's third-party manufacturing giants, TI can just get to work with its own chipmaking machinery. So TI's diverse clientele buffers it against sector-specific downturns, unlike many of its peers."", ""And this paragon of business stability isn't even expensive. The stock has traded sideways over the last year, missing out on the tech sector's artificial intelligence (AI) boom. As a result, the effective dividend yield has soared to 3%."", ""Sure, TI's stock is down for a reason -- it ran into a rare tag-team attack as both automakers and industrial computing giants are holding back their infrastructure investments at the same time. But these paired market weaknesses won't last forever. You should consider locking in those juicy yields while they last, because TI will surely come back swinging when the global economy finally gets over the inflation-based flu."", ""The company behind the namesake glass-ceramic cookware has moved on to more advanced materials. You'll find Corning's hardened Gorilla Glass covering the screens on most smartphones nowadays, not to mention both the windshields and internal glass panels in modern cars. And fiber-optic cables accounted for $4 billion of top-line sales last year, or roughly one-third of Corning's total revenue."", ""Like Texas Instruments, Corning is resistant to single-industry downturns. Both companies were caught by multiple sector challenges, and Corning's stock is also back almost exactly where it was a year ago."", ""Its effective dividend yield is even richer at 3.4%. Smartphone sales can't stay slow forever, and the auto industry can't wait to take advantage of pent-up demand for modern vehicles whenever the interest rates on car loans start sliding down again. And the coronavirus pandemic halted the global expansion of 5G networking in its tracks, setting another important Corning market up for a strong upswing someday soon. Yes, high-speed wireless networks usually rely on even faster fiber-optic connections to the worldwide internet."", 'From cookware to cutting-edge networking and digital screens, Corning continues to innovate.', ""So Corning is also set up to recover over time, likely softening those robust dividend yields in the process. That's just how the math works -- higher buy-in prices result in weaker yields from the same dividend checks. That's why I recommend locking in the generous yields on Corning and Texas Instruments while they last."", ""Finally, you already missed the best possible time to lock in IBM's strongest yields, but Big Blue's stock should still deliver both strong price gains and robust dividends for years to come."", ""IBM's stock has gained nearly 60% over the last year. The strategy shift that started under CEO Ginni Rometty a decade ago is finally paying dividends, literally and metaphorically."", ""This company was a bit late to the AI party due to its unshakable focus on enterprise-class business solutions. IBM's Watson AI platform has been around for years, harking back to the Deep Blue chess computer that defeated world champion Garry Kasparov in a game-changing 1997 match."", 'Prospective customers in this category are rarely free to simply jump on the next red-hot bandwagon. New solutions must go through a gauntlet of performance, security, and cost-efficiency tests. Any large-scale deal may require signatures from multiple levels of management. But when that time-consuming process is completed, IBM ends up with a multiyear contract and a burly helping of customer loyalty. Replacing a system that cleared every hurdle will be even tougher.', ""So you're catching IBM in the early stages of an active upswing. The AI-driven success that inspired a 10% stock price jump the day after its latest earnings report should accelerate in 2024 and beyond. Thanks to the harsh reality of dividend calculations, a rising stock price will dilute IBM's muscular 3.4% yield over time."", ""Time in the market is always more important than timing the market, though. In other words, it's not too late to grab a few IBM shares in preparation for an AI-driven surge in the next few years. It may take decades before you see a 3.4% yield on new IBM investments again."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and International Business Machines wasn’t one of them.

Companies were spinning a positive narrative — pushing the idea that AI wouldn’t destroy jobs, but rather represented a once-in-a-generation opportunity to modernize a multitude of industries.', 'International Business Machines Corp. Chief Human Resources Officer Nickle LaMoreaux told a SXSW panel that AI will instead alleviate labor shortages that are set to worsen as birth rates decline across developed economies. And while only a tiny percentage of jobs can be completely automated, the vast majority won’t disappear — but will change dramatically.', '“It is our responsibility to go out there and set the record straight on this,” LaMoreaux said. “The thing we need to be rightfully scared about is job change — and how are we going to get ready for that.”', 'The sparring over AI at SXSW, a conference known as a venue to vet new ideas, was a sampling of the debate over whether AI is a force for good or bad — especially for workers. While 42% of office workers say they’re excited for AI to take over some of their tasks at work, some 27% find the prospect concerning, according to a global survey from Slack of over 10,000 employees conducted in January.', 'IBM made news last May when Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna told Bloomberg the company expects to pause hiring for back-office roles it thinks could be replaced with AI in the coming years. “Any of you that support CEOs, you know that sometimes the worst thing they can do is go talk to the media — it makes your job a little harder,” LaMoreaux said, adding that Krishna’s comments were taken a “little out of context.”', 'Read More: AI Regulation Is Needed to Support US Workers in Future, Business Officials Say', 'Still, recent reports have stoked fears about AI job replacement. On Tuesday, IBM reportedly told employees it was cutting staff in its marketing and communications department, prompting more headlines about AI-related layoffs. Fintech firm Klarna said last month that its new AI chatbot tool is already doing the work of 700 full-time customer-service agents, putting the company on track to improve profits by $40 million this year.', 'Responding to a question about Klarna’s announcement, Jim Link, chief human resources officer of the Society for Human Resource Management, said that the research is mixed on what impact AI will have on jobs. “There’s other research out there that shows that AI will actually generate more jobs than it eliminates,” he said. But nearly a year and a half into the current AI hype cycle, it remains unclear what those new AI jobs will be, aside from the much-cited “prompt engineer” and the new c-suite entrant, “chief AI officer.”', 'Read More: AI Is Driving More Layoffs Than Companies Want to Admit', 'Ultimately, Link said, the moment has come for companies and workers to invest in AI training, a sentiment echoed by other executives at the conference. “Those people who are AI-savvy and have AI skills could replace those who do not have the skills,” he said. “There’s absolutely no doubt about that.”', 'On another panel, Donald Knight, chief people officer of hiring software company Greenhouse, waved off concerns about entry-level jobs automated away by AI. Instead, armed with new technologies, he argued younger workers will be able to do more fulfilling work and make more meaningful contributions right away, instead of shouldering the grunt work that’s traditionally been a right of passage.', '“These types of tools that they’re growing up on are going to allow them to deploy creativity in your companies like you’ve never seen before,” Knight said. “It’s going to be phenomenal.”', 'In other rooms, the tone was more cautious. Major TV and film studios’ use of AI was a point of contention in contract talks with Hollywood writers and actors, prolonging the strike by SAG-AFTRA. Though the final deal included some protections from automation, many industry luminaries worry the provisions didn’t go far enough.', ""“If you’re anxious about AI, while everyone is saying, ‘Chase it! Get ahead of it!,’ it’s because you know deep down, ‘Oh, we’re next,’” Daniel Kwan, co-director of Everything Everywhere All at Once, said in a keynote address. “Even if the jobs aren't going to be lost, the value of the job will go down.”"", 'That’s not to say we shouldn’t use AI, Kwan said: “AI is here. It is going to be rapidly deployed in every aspect of our lives.”', '(A previous version of the article misstated Donald Knight’s title at Greenhouse.)', 'Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek', 'Elon Musk’s Don Lemon Implosion', 'Weight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds', 'Magnificent Seven?

Even though the monthly gain was in line with estimates, the annual gain was slightly above expectations of an increase of 3.1%.', 'Core CPI, which eliminates the volatile energy and food costs, increased 0.4% on a month-on-month basis and 3.8% from a year ago. Both the readings were slightly higher than forecast.', 'The headline inflation number primarily increased due to an uptick in the prices of energy and shelter. Energy costs increased 2.3%, while shelter costs rose 0.4%. Home prices, in reality, are expected to continue to rise this year. Separately, airline fares, apparel costs and the cost of used vehicles were up 3.6%, 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively.', 'Elevated inflation, regrettably, decreases the purchasing power of dollars.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad."", ""So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like General Motors (NYSE:GM). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it."", ' Check out our latest analysis for General Motors ', ""The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. It certainly is nice to see that General Motors has managed to grow EPS by 26% per year over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about. Getting in to the the finer details, it important to know that the EPS growth has been helped by share buybacks, demonstrating that the business is positioned to return capital to its shareholders."", ""Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Not all of General Motors' revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. On the revenue front, General Motors has done well over the past year, growing revenue by 9.6% to US$172b but EBIT margin figures were less stellar, seeing a decline over the last 12 months. So if EBIT margins can stabilize, this top-line growth should pay off for shareholders."", ""You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$127m. This comes in at 0.3% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value."", ""If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into General Motors' strong EPS growth. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. We should say that we've discovered 3 warning signs for General Motors (2 don't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here."", 'While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.', 'Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.', 'Have feedback on this article?

For example, back in February, I included it on a list of stocks with ironclad dividend payouts.', 'However, it’s not only Dividend Aristocrat status (signaling payout consistency) that makes ADP stock one of the top dividend stocks. The company has also increased its payouts by a double-digit amount (12.36%) each year, on average, over the past 5 years. Other aristocrats raise their payouts by just a few percentage points each year.', 'While ADP’s payout ratio (nearly 60%) may seem a tad high, as forecasts call for 9-10% earnings growth in the coming years, further steady increases to this dividend, not to mention further steady price appreciation for shares, appear within reach. At current prices, Automatic Data Processing stock has a forward dividend yield of 2.3%.', 'Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com', 'Besides being perhaps one of the top tech stocks, growth stocks and AI stocks, did you know Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is arguably one of the best dividend stocks in the S&P 500? That’s based on how shares in this leading purveyor of semiconductors and infrastructure software stack up based on the aforementioned dividend stock criteria.', 'AVGO stock is about halfway towards becoming a dividend aristocrat (13 years of consecutive annual dividend increases). The company has also increased its payout by an average of 19.25% annually over the past five years.', 'While not certain, more double-digit annual increases may lie ahead. Between Broadcom’s success capitalizing on the AI chips trend, as well as from the cost/growth synergies stemming from last year’s merger with VMWare, much suggests sufficient continued earnings growth to fund such increases. At current prices, AVGO has a forward dividend yield of 1.6%.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'Jacksonville, Florida-based CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) is one of six class-one freight railroads in the United States. As an operator in this oligopoly, providing an essential service that sustains national and global commerce, this company has high margins, consistent profitability and a deep economic moat.', 'With all of this, it’s not a surprise that CSX stock ranks well among S&P 500 dividend stocks. With 19 years of consecutive dividend growth under its belt, CSX’s dividend has increased by an average of 8.45% annually over the past five years.', 'The most recent increase was enacted last month when the company raised its quarterly payout from 11 to 12 cents per share, or around a 9.1% increase. Alongside this dividend, CSX also returns capital to shareholders through stock buybacks. In 2022 and 2023, the railroad made share repurchases of $4.7 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively.', 'Source: JennLShoots / Shutterstock.com', 'L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) is another of the best dividend stocks in S&P 500 that I have discussed in glowing terms in prior dividend stock articles.

Furthermore, not only is PH stock a Dividend Aristocrat, it’s a Dividend King as well. In fact, with 67 years of consecutive dividend growth, Parker-Hannafin has long since passed the king threshold of 50 years.', 'Even after big dividend increases in recent years, PH still sports a relatively low payout ratio (23.92%). Coupled with the prospect of high single-digit/low double-digit earnings growth in the coming years — based on sell-side forecasts — there’s a good chance that above-average levels of payout increase will continue in the years ahead.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Ask someone which restaurant stock is among the best dividend stocks in S&P 500, and the first answer may be McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD).

In terms of dividend yield, SBUX stock (2.5% forward yield) only marginally beats out MCD stock (2.28%) in this category. While Starbucks is on its way to becoming a Dividend Aristocrat (with 13 years of consecutive payout increases), MCD earned its regal title decades ago.', 'However, while MCD has increased its payout over the past five years by an average of around 8% annually, SBUX’s payout has gone by an average of 9.78% by this same metric. Most importantly, while trading at similar forward multiples, Starbucks’ expected future earnings growth exceeds that of McDonald’s, suggesting stronger long-term upside potential for shares.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'Growth at a reasonable price (GARP) is an apt descriptor for UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) shares. The health insurance and services giant trades for only 17.1 times forward earnings. That’s a low valuation, given how UNH has continued to increase earnings by double-digits each year.', 'Granted, a big reason why you can pick up UNH stock at a reasonable price today has to do with recent negative developments—namely, an antitrust probe and a ransomware attack. However, once headwinds resolve, shares could bounce back to their historic valuation — 20 to 25 times forward earnings.', 'That’s not all. The fact UnitedHealth is using its earnings growth to ramp up its dividend also bodes well for long-term investors. While its 1.58% yield is tiny today, with payouts increasing by 15.87% on average over the past five years, these payouts could become an even greater contributor to total returns in time.', 'On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 13% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Tapestry. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.', 'Are you a shareholder? Since TPR is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TPR for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy TPR.

Let's look at the reasons why investors who have missed Nvidia's stunning rally over the past year would do well to buy ASML right now."", ""There is no doubt that Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) play a central role in training large language models, but making those GPUs wouldn't have been possible without ASML's machines. More specifically, Nvidia's flagship H100 AI GPU is manufactured using a custom 5-nanometer process node from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC."", ""However, TSMC can only manufacture these 5nm chips using ASML's machines. As it turns out, any semiconductor foundry that's looking to manufacture advanced chips made on process nodes that are 7nm or smaller will have to turn to ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. That's because ASML has a monopoly on the market for EUV lithography machines."", 'This puts the company in a solid position to make the most of the increasing demand for the advanced chipmaking equipment that will be needed to manufacture AI chips. According to third-party estimates, the EUV lithography market could clock a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22% through 2032, generating $63 billion in annual revenue at the end of the forecast period. The overall semiconductor equipment market, meanwhile, is expected to generate a whopping $222 billion in revenue in 2032, up from $83 billion in 2022.', ""ASML's massive order backlog makes it clear that it is well on its way to making the most of this multibillion-dollar opportunity. The company finished 2023 with a backlog of 39 billion euros. This impressive backlog was driven by a sharp jump in ASML's bookings last quarter. More specifically, ASML recorded net bookings of 9.2 billion euros in the fourth quarter of 2023, a big jump over the 2.6 billion euros worth of bookings it received in the third quarter."", ""The company saw a sharp jump in orders last year, with its net bookings increasing by more than 50% to 30.7 billion euros from 20 billion euros in 2022. It is worth noting that 60% of the orders ASML received in the previous quarter were for EUV systems. That wasn't surprising, as chipmakers are scrambling to place orders for ASML's systems so that they can manufacture AI chips."", ""The company's robust order backlog is the reason why it is predicted to deliver robust growth over the next couple of years."", ""ASML's healthy top-line growth explains why its earnings are predicted to increase at an annual rate of 22% for the next five years. Based on its 2023 earnings of $21.78 per share, ASML's bottom line could jump to just under $59 per share in 2028."", ""Using the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple of 31 as a proxy for tech stocks and multiplying it by ASML's projected earnings after five years points toward a stock price of $1,829. That would be a 90% increase from current levels. ASML currently trades at 46 times trailing earnings and 13 times sales, so it is significantly cheaper than Nvidia. This makes ASML an ideal bet for investors looking for a cheaper AI alternative to Nvidia, and they would do well to buy it before it soars further following 27% gains in 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?', 'Before you buy stock in ASML, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ASML wasn’t one of them.

What separates Supermicro from competitors is its highly configurable models, as the company is willing to work with each customer to ensure they get exactly what they want."", 'As more companies raced to build out their computing power with the rise of data-heavy tasks like AI model training, Supermicro stood to benefit.', ""While it didn't see the initial wave of growth Nvidia saw in 2023, it is now starting to see the demand. This makes perfect sense, as Nvidia must provide its GPUs to Supermicro before they can sell the data center product."", ""In Q2 FY 2024 (ending December 31), Supermicro's growth began to tip the scales, much like Nvidia did in 2023. Its revenue rose 103% year over year, and management gave guidance for 188% to 219% growth for Q3. Because the market didn't want to miss a meteoric rise like Nvidia again, investors piled into Supermicro's stock, causing it to rise more than 300% in 2024 alone."", ""Now that it has crossed the $1,000 threshold, it's in prime territory for a stock split."", ""Because a stock split affects shareholders, it must be voted upon. While a company can call a special vote whenever it deems necessary, it's more common for companies to do it during an annual meeting when they vote on other items like board of director appointees, pay packages, or which accounting firm audits them."", 'In 2023, that meeting was held on May 19. But the propositions and voting occur much earlier than that.

It's still a sizable gap to close, but it may happen sooner than you think if the right circumstances occur."", 'Nvidia is at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race, as it provides the computing power necessary to make these models work. Its primary product, the GPU (graphics processing unit), excels at crunching through arduous workloads. GPUs are connected to create powerful supercomputers, which often have over 1,000 GPUs.', ""With Nvidia's flagship GPU, the H100, rumored to cost about $30,000, there's a lot of potential revenue for Nvidia.

After starting Duquesne Capital Management in 1981, Druckenmiller's hedge fund never had a down year, a period that included the Black Monday crash, the dot-com bust, and the great financial crisis. Duquesne Capital Management averaged an annual return of 30% from 1986 to 2010, crushing the broad market."", 'Druckenmiller closed his fund in 2010, but he didn\'t stop investing. Today, he runs the Duquesne Family Office, which has about $3.4 billion in assets as of its fourth-quarter update. Recently, the famed investor has been an outspoken bull on AI stocks. Like a number of other CEOs and investors, the billionaire sees it as a major innovation, saying last year, ""AI could be as transformative as the internet.""', ""Not surprisingly, AI stocks make up a sizable portion of his portfolio. In fact, just three AI stocks account for 40% of his holdings. Let's take a look at those stocks and see if any are worth buying today."", ""It might not be a surprise to see Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) at the top of this list. Nvidia has dominated the AI narrative, and it's been the biggest winner by market cap, up by more than $1.5 trillion since the start of 2023."", 'At the end of 2023, Druckenmiller owned 617,494 shares worth roughly $306 million and call options on the stock worth another $242 million. Combined, those holdings make up 16% of his portfolio. Considering that Nvidia has soared since the start of the year, those options could have paid off handsomely for the billionaire investor.', 'Druckenmiller began buying Nvidia in the fourth quarter of 2022, indicating that he jumped on the stock after ChatGPT was launched, which signaled the start of the AI boom. The investor said in the fall that Nvidia stock was in ""nosebleed territory,"" but shares have continued to rally, and his call buying in Q4 indicates he changed his mind on that synopsis, though he did cut his stake in Nvidia stock by 30% in Q4. It\'s unclear if he\'s sold any of his Nvidia stock in Q1 so far, but based on its current price, the right move would have been to hold onto it.', ""After Nvidia, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) may be the next-best-known AI stock. The tech giant has been a close partner of ChatGPT parent OpenAI, having invested billions into the AI start-up, and that's given it an edge in the new technology. It's incorporated OpenAI features across its products, including Azure, GitHub, Bing, and its Office suite, and it's designed its own ChatGPT-like Copilot to answer questions, improve communications, and guide users."", ""Druckenmiller isn't a newcomer to Microsoft. He first began buying the stock in 2015, and he added to his stake in Q4, buying 68,860 shares to bring the total to 1.09 million, or $408.4 million. Microsoft is his largest outright stock holding and accounts for 12% of his portfolio."", ""Notably, in Q4, Druckenmiller dumped his entire stake in Alphabet, Microsoft's rival, indicating a clear preference for Microsoft. That decision seems to have paid off, as Microsoft is up 10% this year, while Alphabet is down slightly."", 'South Korean e-commerce leader Coupang (NYSE: CPNG) may not be an AI stock in the traditional sense, but the company is doing things with artificial intelligence that earn it a place in the category.', 'Coupang uses artificial intelligence in a variety of ways, including robots at its fulfillment center that can carry more than 2,000 pounds and are called autonomously guided vehicles as they direct themselves around the warehouse. They have cut the human workload by about 65%.', 'Coupang also uses AI to help warehouse workers, giving each employee a personal digital assistant (PDA) that will assign work and optimize routes using AI and machine learning.', ""Druckenmiller owned 22.9 million shares of Coupang as of the end of the year, adding 2 million shares to his holdings in Q4 to bring the total stake to $371 million, or 11% of his portfolio. He's owned the Korean e-commerce stock since before it went public. It's not fully clear why Druckenmiller is betting on Coupang, but the stock offers appealing growth at a good value right now."", 'Of these three stocks, I think Nvidia and Microsoft look like solid buys. Yes, the shares have run up considerably over the last year, but these companies are the respective leaders in their segments of AI (Nvidia in hardware and Microsoft in software), and those leadership positions are likely to pay off in the coming years.', 'Coupang seems promising as well but riskier. The company is delivering solid growth and trades at a reasonable valuation. However, its long-term growth seems to depend on expanding beyond South Korea and into new markets, as it\'s already heavily penetrated in its home market. That could pay off for the company, especially as ""developing offerings"" delivered 105% revenue growth to $273 million in Q4, but it\'s a riskier strategy.', ""Overall, investors are better off sticking with Nvidia and Microsoft here. If you're an AI investor, it makes sense to follow Druckenmiller's comments and moves as the investing landscape develops. The billionaire called the Nvidia rally, and he may have some foresight into where the AI boom goes next."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool Money starts now.', ""It's the Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Dylan Lewis joining me over the airwaves, Motley Fool senior analysts, Ron Gross and Jason Moser. Gentlemen, great to have you both here."", 'Ron Gross: Hey.', 'Jason Moser: How you doing Dylan?', ""Dylan Lewis: We've got another strong sign for cybersecurity, a sneak peek at next week's Oscars and of course, stocks on our radar. We're going to kick off though with a look at the continued great run for companies in the cybersecurity space. Jason, last week on the show, we talked through Okta's earnings and the strength of cybersecurity spend, seeing that trend continue this week with results from CrowdStrike."", ""Jason Moser: It sure does seem like it's CrowdStrike's world these days and everyone else is just living in it. We've talked about both Zscaler and Palo Alto recently, a lot of focus on the spending fatigue comment that came out of Palo's call specifically talking about is adding incremental point products is not necessarily driving better security outcomes. It really doesn't seem like CrowdStrike is witnessing that same dynamic. Now it's a little bit of a different model."", ""They have this Falcon platform that ultimately offers these 27 modules and customers can subscribe to those modules based on what they feel like they need. Into that, 0.64% of CrowdStrike customers now have adopted at least five of those modules, 43% have adopted at least six, 27% have adopted at least seven. Altogether we're just seeing this company continuing to sign new deals and then expanding the relationship that they have with those signed customers. We saw dollar-based net retention rate held steady from a quarter ago at 119%. This really all resulted in strong revenue growth, 33% for the quarter in annual recurring revenue, which is really a number you want to focus on with these cybersecurity companies, that was up 34% to 3.44 billion. I think that's a big deal, particularly when you look at a competitor like Palo Alto in the space, they're clocking that in at around four billion right now and see this ultimate market opportunity maybe to get that recurring revenue number up to 15 billion. It'll be interesting to see where CrowdStrike sees that going. There's no question, Ron, you're going to love this. CrowdStrike is absolutely a business that is firing on all cylinders."", 'Ron Gross: Woah.', ""Dylan Lewis: Jason, the markets certainly like the result, shares were up over 20% following the company's update. One thing I wanted to check in on was a little curious to get your take on is they announced that they were buying flow security in a cash and stock deal. This has generally been a period where we've been seeing a lot of businesses clamp things down, clamped down spending and focus a little bit more on optimizing. What do you make of them going out there and being acquisitive right now?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, it's a very competitive space that makes a lot of sense when they see something out there that they feel like will be additive to the business. Their balance sheet is in terrific shape, somewhere in the neighborhood of $3.5 billion in cash versus just about $750 million in long-term debt, so they have the financial means to do something like this. I think it has resulted in a lot of optimism for the stock. I think really to me that's the biggest risk for investors interested in CrowdStrike today. It just a valuation, this is a wonderful business. Clearly, it's performing very well, but it's at 26 times sales now, a 160 times free cashflow. That's after adjusting for stock-based compensation, of course, but still it just goes to show you that there is a lot of enthusiasm behind this company right now. But I think that as time goes on, we'll see the big players in the space continue to consolidate, CrowdStrike, absolutely being one of those."", ""Dylan Lewis: After a year of inventory woes, it appears Target might be climbing its way out and getting back on track. Shares up over 10% this week and at a one-year high, following the company's holiday quarter results, Ron."", ""Ron Gross: Yes, still 33% off from its COVID high in mid-2021, but that's really where the problems started, where they were dis-merchandised, let's say, they did not have the right inventory on hand. It has taken quite some time for them to right-size into what people are looking for a way from the big ticket items away from the more expensive things. They're making progress, but we're not there yet. They did report higher holiday quarter earnings in this report on a smaller than expected sales decline, that's [laughs] progress. It's like a backhanded compliment, but progress is progress. Comp sales traffic trends improved sequentially for the second quarter in a row, I like that. Total comparable sales did decline 4.4% and that's a result of store declines of 5.4% and digital sales decline of 0.7%. We're still seeing declines at both the store level and at the internet, the digital level."", ""Doesn't sound great, but it is progress. Total revenue up a total of 1.7%. The bright-spot, and this is a continuing trend is same-day services, in-store pickup, drive up, and shipped, which they acquired several years back. Those represent more than 10% of sales and they were up 13.6% in the quarter. Continuing investments in same-day services, I think, is definitely things that we're going to continue to see. Operating and gross margins widened, less markdowns. That's good to see, which means inventories coming down back to where they need it to be. Earnings benefited from a reduced tax rate and earnings per share were actually up 58% as a result of all those things, despite a somewhat anemic report. They're getting there, they've made some really interesting moves. We can talk about a loyalty program they are putting in place, store remodeling. This is one that I've said for quite some months. It's a nice turnaround play and it looked pretty inexpensive six months ago. I still think it has room to run."", ""Dylan Lewis: Ron, you mentioned ship there and the focus on same-day delivery and logistics. They are highlighting that in their new membership program, they're adding more tears and they're refining a little bit of what members are going to be able to do. But they haven't circled 360. This is a paid membership program looking to compete with Amazon Prime and Walmart Plus. I look at this and I say, this is probably one of their solutions to those inventory woes and some of those traffic flagging issues that they've been seeing."", ""Ron Gross: It's also a retail law that you must have a loyalty program. [laughs] They're just complying with law. But no, I think it makes sense. Members will pay $99 a year. There will be an introductory rate of 49 for anyone who joins relatively quickly. You'll receive free two-day shipping as well as unlimited free same-day delivery in as little as an hour, they claim, as long as orders are over 35 dollars. More of this, I want it now mentality, I think there were certainly be some takers. I do think we all have monthly fee fatigue, whether it's Netflix, or Disney Plus, or Apple, or Target. Monthly fee spending fatigue is a real thing, at least it is in my household. Whenever somebody hits me up with another one of these things, I say, but I do think it's going to be popular."", ""Dylan Lewis: You're saying death, taxes, and retail membership programs, those are the constants in life, the inevitables."", 'Ron Gross: All inevitable.', ""Dylan Lewis: Perhaps death by retail program, it turns out with that spending fatigue. We're going to take a break from earnings and check in on Twilio. Jason, the cloud communications company reported back in February. But this week we have an update on their plans for its segment business, which has been in the cross-hairs of a lot of shareholders over the last couple of months."", ""Jason Moser: We've seen some activist interest here and we talked about this letter, but we covered earnings a few weeks back. With this company, the focus has moved from growth no matter the cost, to now making sure the company can grow with more fundamentally sound financials. As a shareholder, I'm absolutely on board with that. I think if you want to hold these shares, you need to be patient and understand that with a new CEO in place, we're going to have to give Khozema Shipchandler some time to try to execute this vision. But the big question really was with the segment section of the business and that used to be the data and applications business. They are going to keep that part of the business. There was some questions to whether they might try to spin it off. They feel like ultimately the juice wasn't worth the squeeze there. They believe that with their plan, they can get more out of it if they sell it. Time will absolutely tell there. Looking at it with just through a lens of more operational rigor, trying to innovate a little bit more and incorporated a little bit more into their communications business so that they work in tandem."", ""That really does make a lot of sense, but this all really comes back to an acquisition that was made a few years back that just hasn't really worked out so well yet. Remember folks, segment accounted for only about 7.5% of the company's total revenue in 2024 and ultimately resulted in an operating loss for the year. It's not like it's some big moneymaker. Understandable why activists might want to see them, maybe get rid of it and focus on the core communications business. But management clearly thinks that there's still something there. Worth also mentioning, they did announce an additional two billion dollars share repurchase authorization. In addition to the original one billion dollar authorization, which is almost completed. The target is to complete that buyback by the end of this year. They've got four billion dollars in cash on the balance sheet so they can afford it"", ""Dylan Lewis: Jason, I'm curious, this is a business that has generally had shares outstanding, moving up into the right. How do you feel about the management team being authorized to spend another two billion dollars on repurchases?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, that is absolutely something that has been a question for a lot of investors and analysts and management has responded by making sure to commit to bringing that stock-based compensation number down. They are doing that, I will give them credit for that. But you make a very good point there. These repurchases ultimately need to bring that share count down. But there's no doubt this is going to offset some of that stock-based compensation."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break, we've got three companies with so-so outlooks. What does it mean for retail? Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money."", ""Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis here with Ron Gross and Jason Moser. We're going to check it on three household names that have the market down after earnings. Ryan, let's start with Foot Locker shares down 25% after the quarter came in above expectations. But it didn't seem like outlook was to inspiring."", ""Ron Gross: No, the stock just got slammed. That stock has been a mess for a while now as they really tried to reshape the business model. Things actually look like they might be on track at least from a stock perspective, starting maybe around last September. But this is just another setback for a company that has had many setbacks for the last several years. The quarter ending of itself, as you say, wasn't actually that bad sales were up 2%, though comparable sales fell slightly 0.7%. The Champs brand for those familiar remains the weak spot amid, what they're trying to do is reposition that brand toward athletes and away from fashion. They're not seeing traction there yet, so that continues to be a weeks gross margins are down significantly 350 basis points as a result of higher markdowns needed to clear inventory."", ""Inventory is now down 8.2%, so that's a good thing, but it's at the cost of margin. If we adjust for some non-recurring charges, always a dicey thing to do, but earnings were down 60%. They've got some work to do. CEO Mary Dillon noted the company's fourth-quarter results were above its own expectations, but things are pretty weak. She said they did see meaningfully accelerated sales trends relative to the third quarter. Guidance was relatively lackluster. I think investors did not like that, they ran for the doors. The company will be investing heavily in digital. The store experience loyalty programs, brand-building. Most importantly, they delayed by two years their EBIT margin guidance, they're operating margin guidance. You have to wait another two years to get where you hope they were going to be by 2026. It's even later now and that is not good news for people who own the shares."", ""Dylan Lewis: Ryan, we're about a year into Mary Dillon's time at Foot Locker and she is someone who really had the magic touch over at Ulta. A lot of what you're getting at there with loyalty programs and those types of things to bring people into mix was her forte. How would you grade her time so far at Foot Locker. This is a tough business, so I don't want to put it all on her back. She was a star at Ulta, she was at McDonald's for five years before that I believe. She's a top-notch CEO. This is a tough business that was relying on brick-and-mortar and Nike for so long. They're trying to move to multi-channel, omni-channel. They're trying to move away from Nike. It's going to take some time. If anyone can do it, Mary Dillon can, but it's a tough business."", ""Dylan Lewis: Over the grocery aisle, we've got an update from Campbell's this week, not an aim in any of our portfolios, but Jason, accompany we look to for a sense of what's going on with the consumer."", ""Jason Moser: Yeah, exactly. I think this is an interesting one to look at, not because it's a great opportunity for investors because let me be clear, it's not. Not trying to be mean here, sorry, Campbell. But the fact of matter is in five and 10 years, this thing is just woefully under performed the market. Now with that said, it is a low margin business. We know groceries very difficult, so I'm not really holding that all against them, but I do believe looking at this call, it gives you a glimpse into what the consumer is dealing with it in that light. Management said in the call, consumers continue to prioritize value. Not terribly surprising. A lot of focus on home cooked meals, purchasing who that helped them prepare what they call stretchable meals and smaller and less frequent shopping trips. It'll be interesting to see how that trickles through the grocery stores, for example. Organic revenue down 1%. Not terribly surprising there. There are two interesting dynamics to this business that I think are worth keeping an eye on. Now one is near and dear to my heart, and that is the snacks segment."", ""We can't forget the value and snack still. Ryan, I know you guys like snacks and you love them as much as I do. Now you got brands like Lance and snack factory, late July, they reached five-year highs and volumes share and this is basically half of their business. It is material it matters. When you just look at the overall snacks market, it's a big opportunity statistic data says revenue in the US snack food market is set to hit $114 billion this year and grow about 4% annually through 2028. There's opportunity there."", ""The other thing that I think is worth keeping an eye on the acquisition of Sovos, which is going to bring the Rao's brand under their umbrella and I think a lot of people are familiar with that sauce and the restaurant concept and whatnot. I think Rao's, I think is an opportunity. They just announced they'd surpassed one billion dollars in annual net sales. Those sales were up 16% from a year ago. So for a company that's turning in such anemic growth, it's nice to see they're bringing in another little acquisition here in Sovos that could help boost that. I think that between the snack side of the business and this Rao's side of the business. There's the opportunity at least for them to try to push those organic revenue numbers up here in the coming years. But I don't know that necessarily changes this into a buy or any kind of a compelling thesis. But again, you get a good window into the state of the consumer."", ""Ron Gross: I think they should change the slogan to Rao's is good food [laughs], because it's quality sauce in my opinion."", ""Jason Moser: [laughs] Since snacks are close to my heart so is that sauce. I've never had Rao's sauce but I'm a big it up, we read a lot of Italian food in this house and I make all of my sauce, but you've convinced me Ryan, I really I need with intention, go to the store and buy this Rao's sauce to at least try it because that could work in a pinch if you don't have enough time."", ""Ron Gross: If you don't like it. I'll pay for it."", 'Jason Moser: [laughs] Good deal.', ""Dylan Lewis: You know, we're talking Campbell's results, but we're talking a lot about snacks and Rao's here. It is not out of the realm of possibility that they revisit the company name at some point. We've seen a lot of businesses [laughs] refocus on what has investors excited. We're going to wrap our earnings takes looking at Nordstrom, Foot Locker, not alone Ryan, on the retail struggle bus shares in Nordstrom down over 15% this week."", ""Ron Gross: The struggle bus, they were also reversing some positive momentum they had been enjoying. It's not that the quarter was so bad, but the guidance is really what got investors spooked though I think the share price decline seems a little bit of an overreaction to me. For the quarter sales grew only 2.2%, primarily due to the winding down of Canada operations. Not at fault here in the US, the Nordstrom branded stores were plus 3%. Growth was particularly strong at Nordstrom Rack, which is their off-price brand where sales were up 14.6% or 8.8% if we exclude the extra week in the quarter. Now interestingly, Macy's said they're going to focus on Bloomingdale's, their higher end brand, whereas Nordstrom is seeing success with Nordstrom Rack their off-price brand, digital sales down 1.7%, that's not great. You don't want to see that, that's 38% of total sales during the quarter. Earnings per share was up 11%. Guidance was fine, but not great and they seem to want to continue to be cautious as a result of the macro economy."", ""Dylan Lewis: Ron Gross, Jason Moser, appreciate the earnings rundown. Fellas we're going to see you guys a little bit later in the show. But up next, we've got tips for your Astralpool and where it'd be putting your money. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. The Oscars are next week, head of the awards and the red carpet, we caught up with Nell Minow. Motley Fool Money's go-to movie critic and corporate governance expert for a look at the movie biz and some of her favorite films of 2023. Before we got into taping, you mentioned that you were fresh off of your Disney proxy vote. This is a company that has, I think had a rough year and maybe one of the easiest or simplest ways to put it. Certainly, there are a lot of opinions from shareholders on the direction of the company, leadership and some of the major initiatives. When you were thinking about Disney and looking at some of the issues, what was in your mind?"", ""Nell Minow: I voted in favor of the Disney candidates. Yes, there are a lot of concerns about Disney, but there are more concerns about the people who are challenging Disney. Peltz keeps promising that he's going to come up with a detailed proposal about what he thinks the company should do. But his background has nothing in it to suggest that he understands this industry in any way. He is offering up so far financial engineering and that's not what a company like Disney needs. A company that's in every industry, they're in the hospitality industry, they're of course in the entertainment industry, they're in television. That's an industry that requires a lot of creativity. They're not putting things out on a conveyor belt and he's just one step away from suggesting they moved to AI. He has not persuaded me of anything whatsoever. I am cautiously optimistic that a vote in favor of the Disney insiders is the way to go."", ""Dylan Lewis: You mentioned AI there, so I'm going to take the bait [laughs]. As we start looking at content companies, whether they're in the film industry or traditional publishing. Thinking about using AI, how're you as a shareholder, looking at those types of decisions and the strategic direction that companies are looking to go with AI?"", ""Nell Minow: Well, everybody is jumping on it, which always happens with fads. The question is, who is jumping at it in a thoughtful way? I think AI, to tell you, the very last thing I thought was going to be the first use of AI was plumbing through the footnotes and PhD dissertations to find out who has been citing everybody correctly. But apparently that's what people are like Ackman are doing with it. I think that AI is going to be less important in content creation than it is in digging through a lot of data. I want to see pharma companies using AI. I want to see other companies improving their products through the use of AI. I think it's a mistake to think that it's going to take over in the entertainment industry, although I do note that Tyler Perry has canceled his 800 million studio facility that he was going to build in Georgia after seeing a demonstration of AI film making. Now, I suspect that what he'll do is he'll spend that 800 million on something a little bit more advanced. But he's not going to give up on the idea that scripts for the indefinite future will need to be written by people and performed by people."", 'Dylan Lewis: Have you seen any of the demos that have come out from companies like Pika or any of the AI companies that are really focused on basically using prompts to create video?', ""Nell Minow: I have and they haven't quite leaked it, I'm sure that when we talk to each other before the 2025 Oscars, we'll see a lot of progress, but they still have these very odd things like six fingers on somebody's hand. It reminds me, I was listening to a video on YouTube and I only realized that the narrator was a robot or AI because they didn't know the difference between read and read. There are some fine points that it's going to take. Live and live was another one that they got wrong. It's going to take a little while before they sort that all out. But I think there are tremendous opportunities on companies that need to go through a ton of data for their products. Pharma is where I'm looking for right now."", ""Dylan Lewis: The Oscars are coming up and I think maybe more than any other regular guest on Motley Fool Money, you watch more movies than [laughs] pretty much anyone that I'll sneak comes on the show. Say, I'm giving you $100 to put on any film, any actor, actress, any major category. What are you putting it on?"", ""Nell Minow: I think your surest bet there is got be Da'Vine Joy Randolph for The Holdovers as best supporting actress. Normally, the supporting Oscars are the toughest to predict, but she has one every preliminary award. Lord knows she deserves the award. She gave us a magnificent performance. She was so good also in Only Murders in the building, in the Dolemite movie with Eddie Murphy, I think she is the surest bet of the night. Then after that, I would say Oppenheimer is probably a very good bet for best picture and best director. The reason for that is not because I think it should be. There are two reasons. One is that they don't give Oscars for the best movie. They give Oscars for the most movie and that is the most movie. Hollywood likes to portray themselves as serious, as dealing with serious issues, as having a serious role in the cultural conversation. They like smart movies and it is a smart movie. But more important than that, you have to remember that the Oscar votes are by the people in that category. In other words, best director is only voted on by other directors. Christopher Nolan won the Directors Guild award, which means these exact same people that could change their mind between one vote and the next. I think that although the best picture is voted by the entire Academy, I have a feeling that Oppenheimer is going to make it."", 'Dylan Lewis: Knowing the history of how people like to vote, were you surprised at all to see Barbie in the best picture conversation?', ""Nell Minow: Not at all. It's impossible to ignore a movie that has broken so many records. It's done so well and everybody agrees. Again, it's a very smart movie, is a very entertaining movie. It's fun to look at. It's like eating candy, but there's a lot in it as well. I think that the surprise, even the Barbie people are surprised that it looks like I'm just Ken is going to win best song and I have to tell you why I'm happy about that. I get annoyed every year by the best song because they have the worst rules about the nominees for best song. They will allow you to have as best song, some song that a pop star wrote that only plays during the credits. It has nothing to do with the movie. I'm a big fan of a song that really plays an important role in the movie getting the award and certainly that song does. Plus I think it's very funny that in a movie that is entirely about Barbie and feminism, Ryan Gosling just did so brilliantly with that song that he's impossible to ignore."", ""Dylan Lewis: Well, I was right there in the theater tapping my foot along time [laughs],absolutely loved it. I'm curious. Are there any dark horses that you feel like you wouldn't be too surprised to see you have a pretty good night at the Oscars."", 'Nell Minow: Anatomy of a fall snuck its way into the best picture category, not just the best international picture. I think we will see it when Best International. But you never know. We did have Parasite winning a couple of years ago. That would be the dark horse, i think to keep an eye on.', ""Dylan Lewis: Outside of the Oscar field, a movie from the last year that you feel like didn't get enough attention and maybe you'd recommend for people to watch."", ""Nell Minow: I guess I would say, this is actually from the year before, but I would recommend The Outside Story. It's a very small movie about a guy gets locked out of his house in Brooklyn. But I thought and it's a first time movie and from first-time director and writer with a wonderful Brian Terry Henry and the lead role. That's just one that I really loved and really stuck with me, and I would recommend that to anybody."", ""Dylan Lewis: Let's talk a little bit about the movie industry itself. 2023 felt like a pretty good year back at the box office. Barbie and Oppenheimer got a lot of headlines. Super Mario Brothers movie right up there in terms of worldwide box office, over a billion. What I do see when I look at the worldwide box office though, is a lot of franchise extensions, a lot of licensed IP. It seems like we are still in this period with movies where stuff that is bankable is really what a lot of studios are putting their resources behind."", ""Nell Minow: I'm going to go with a Mackenzie, best of times, worst of times response on that. I think you did not mention two key concerns. What is the of course, the strike really tied everything up last year and we had hoped that the production would hit the ground running and everybody would catch up, but that has not been the case. Sixty percent of the people who are on strike still have not been employed. That is a serious concern and related to that. But separate from it is the constriction of the streaming services, which for awhile there were just, anybody could walk in the door and say, I want to make a 10-part series with a lot of CGI and they would go, sure that's fine. Those are concerns. That's one reason that this year is off to a slow start until we just had the surprise hit, to me of one loved the Bob Marley story which has done very well internationally and in the U.S. Of course Dune which is going to be number one for the next few weeks."", ""But I think now that I have done the worst of times, the best of times is that there are so many opportunities for people who, for very little money create their own movies. They'd go to the festivals and they get a nationwide release. I think outside the studio system there ton of opportunities. But the fact is if you're going to spend $100 million on a movie, your risk assessment is going to be very careful and you're going to want to build it. I'm saying this as somebody who's going to see Kung Fu Panda for tonight [laughs]. Yeah. But I'm a big fan girl. I go to San Diego Comic-Con. I love superheroes, but look at how badly the superhero movies, the franchise movies have done lately. Madame Web was a disaster at the Box Office. The Marvels did not do very well. They spent a ton of money on those, Flash was a total failure. So it's not always the case that the IP pays off the way that they hope it will."", ""Dylan Lewis: Do you think we're running into superhero fatigue?"", ""Nell Minow: I don't think so. I think that we have perhaps not continued at the quality of movies that we had for a long time. Robert Downey Jr., who I think we'll get the Oscar also for Oppenheimer this weekend was incredible as Tony Stark, they haven't found anybody in that category yet and they're just going to have to work around it. Kevin Feige, who of course is in charge of all the Marvel movies, has been really great about bringing in unexpected directors and people who are not normally known for action. That paid off for him for a long time and it is not lately. He's got to rethink that."", ""Dylan Lewis: How would you characterize the overall state of the entertainment industry at this point? Because we are past the strikes, but we're also past the period of easy money for a lot of these businesses that had content budgets. It seems like we are seeing a lot of the streamers past the easy growth period of acquiring users and customers. It feels like while we've figured out the labor side of things, there's still a lot of uncertainty brewing."", ""Nell Minow: There's no question about it. Partly it is because some of these big ticket movies have really faltered at the Box Office. I think we're in a time of retrenchment. But fortunately, as I say every January when I talk about the movies that are coming out this year, my favorite thing to look forward to is it by the end of the year there will be a writer, a director, a star I never heard of before, who is going to be my favorite by the end of the year. You have somebody like Pedro Pascal or Paul Mischelle, both of whom were not all that well known a couple of years ago and are now just really at the forefront. Wait to see what happens with the Sundance films, which got great response in January with Telluride, with the other festivals that are coming up. You'll see there's a lot of really, really great stuff coming."", ""Dylan Lewis: One thing I wanted to get your take on David Zaslav has been busy as the CEO of Warner Brothers Discovery, and as part of his leadership, they've decided to basically prevent several finished films from being released, notably Coyote versus Acme, featuring John Cena, written by James Gunn. But also Batgirl featuring Leslie Grace, Michael Keaton, Brendan Frazier. It seems there's been quite a bit of backlash from the creatives in the industry. What do you make of a company that size and someone of that stature in the industry like Zaslav, making those decisions."", ""Nell Minow: Zaslav is a nightmare. The only thing he has been busy at is counting his money because he has continuously been number one on the list of the most overpaid executives, meaning the worst ROI for every dollar you spend paying him. He knows nothing as far as I'm concerned about what it is to be a creative, what it is to create content that people want to see. If he thinks that he can make more money killing these projects than releasing them, then he has no idea what his job is. He sat just getting the creatives mad at him. He's getting the audiences mad at him. I'm hoping still that both of those movies will see the light of day at some point. When I think about the terrible movies that I have to sit through, its unthinkable to me that these movies which have a lot of good people behind them and which I think are worth saying, can't even go on streaming."", ""Dylan Lewis: Motley Fool Money listeners, what's your Oscars favorite?

We're going to dive right into stocks on our radar, our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question. Ron, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?"", ""Ron Gross: Dylan, I'm going back to an oldie but a mediocre-y one. Titan International TWI manufacturer of large wheels for farming and industrial applications, a long term holding of mine years and years and years. The reason I'm going back is that they just announced a large acquisition for a company of its size. Prior to the acquisition, they were about a one billion dollar company. They announced an acquisition of Carlstar Group for 296 million. That's a pretty big acquisition for them to digest. Carlstar is a global manufacturer of specialty tires and wheels for a variety of end markets. It will get tighten into end markets that they're not really in. Outdoor power equipment, power sports, high-speed trailers. It's a way to diversify a bit. They paid only four times adjusted EBITDA. The company has profitable EBITDA of about $73 million. They expect it to be accretive or additive to earnings right away, which is fine. It's just that they only have $220 million in cash for Titan. They're going to use 127 million of it for this acquisition. They've got $425 million of debt. I'd rather the balance sheet was a little bit stronger for an acquisition of this size. But hey, Titan is only trading at four times forward EBITDA only 8.5 times earnings. I'm sticking with it for now."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, this sounds like a classic Ron company, Wheels.', ""Dan Boyd: Yeah, old economy Ron is back in action [laughs]. Other analysts, they bring in robots and AI and biotech. Ron, he's still thinking about the Wheel, Dylan."", ""Ron Gross: Let's see us all live without the wheel."", ""Dylan Lewis: Well, if you're hungering for AI, I think you might be getting it with your next stock, Jason, what's on your radar this week?"", ""Jason Moser: Yeah. Taking a closer look at UIPath, ticker's P-A-T-H, they have earnings coming up on March 13th, next week. This is one of the companies that's bringing automation and computer vision to enterprises everywhere and in this day of AI and machine learning and automation and whatnot, it's clearly pursuing something where there are some tailwinds there. They ultimately build and manage automations and computer vision technology, does this through their UIPath business automation platform, which ultimately spans the full automation spectrum. They're trying to basically give their customers what they need in their automation and Computer Vision journey from soup to nuts, the whole kit and caboodle, as they say. Licenses and subscriptions make up the lion's share of revenue with both contributing fairly equally. They benefit from many of the drivers that we're focused on today in tech. Connectivity, automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning. They're playing a role actually even in the roll-out of 5G technology, they're helping telecom providers handled real-time challenges and personalized offerings ultimately get this 5G networks out and ultimately keeping customers happy. Because that's what it's all about. The thing is with this business, they've seen a lot of success. But it is one of those younger tech companies still working its way toward profitability and cash flow. It's valued at 10 times sales still. The valuation is what really has been on the side line here, more than anything. I'd love to see some pullback in the stock."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about UIPath.', ""Dan Boyd: Yeah. I thought this was going to be one of those Jason Med tech stocks that has something to do with urinary tract infections, but I'm glad it's not."", ""Dylan Lewis: Dan, Wheel, Cutting-edge tech, which one's gone on your watch list?"", ""Dan Boyd: I'm going with Wheel, baby."", ""Dylan Lewis: The old economy.

So now we have a little bit more context, a little bit more information when it comes to this skinny bundle between ESPN, Warner Brothers Discovery, and Fox. Like you said, Julie, Pete Distad is going to be the new CEO. He's a former executive at-- at both Hulu and Apple. So he has that connection with Disney, which I think is important because he's going to be working across three different companies. So the fact that he's already been at one of those three, I think, is important."", ""Now he was at Apple for a decade. Prior to that, he was at Hulu for six years. But while he was at Apple, he was responsible for the business operations and global distribution of the tech giant's video and sports efforts.

When the climate starts to get kinder -- and money market funds and freshly issued bonds start offering lower rates -- yield-seeking investors will turn to dividend-paying stocks where the distributions should grow over time."", ""You don't need a lot of money to build out a diversified portfolio of income-generating stocks. I believe that AT&T (NYSE: T), Sirius XM (NASDAQ: SIRI), and Disney (NYSE: DIS) should be strong considerations for the next $400 you put to work in the market."", 'After years of losing to the market and grappling with the aftermath of poor acquisitions, AT&T is looking pretty good. The telco giant has seen its stock move 16% higher over the past six months, and its chunky 6.5% yield is going to look even better as short-term rates head lower later this year.', ""AT&T is no longer a stodgy media conglomerate or operating a satellite TV business. It's keeping folks connected as a leader in wireless phone service and online connectivity. It's also more than happy to provide businesses and homes with more old-school offerings. And it's a lot cheaper than most of the stocks you already own, trading for just 7 times trailing adjusted earnings."", ""Growth at AT&T isn't going to be impressive. Revenue rose just 2% in AT&T's latest quarter, as a 10% decline for its business wireline segment was more than offset by a 4% uptick for its flagship mobile services and gains elsewhere. Adjusted earnings delivered a rare miss after beating analyst quarterly profit targets for more than a year."", ""AT&T's guidance also disappointed investors, but this money machine is still working. After generating $16.8 billion in free cash flow in 2023, AT&T's projecting $17 billion to $18 billion in free-cash-flow generation in 2024. Put another way, the playing field is set for a dividend hike this year."", ""AT&T sees its already strong presence in wireless growing this year as more customers embrace the merits of faster 5G service. The telecom bellwether sees its fiber broadband service -- where it's grown by at least 1 million net subscribers for six straight years -- growing even faster."", ""Our next turn on the radio dial of promising dividend payers is Sirius XM. The country's lone provider of satellite radio is also cranking out unimpressive top-line growth. Revenue declined 0.6% last year, its first year of negative growth in more than two decades. However, Sirius XM continues to consistently serve up 10-figure free cash flow ever year."", ""Sirius XM uses its premium subscriptions and ad sales to build up content programming that terrestrial radio can't match. It uses its free cash flow to pay down debt, aggressively buy back shares, and -- yes -- pay a growing dividend. The current 2.6% yield is a lot less than AT&T, but it also has a strong catalyst for returning to growth. Sirius XM lives and dies by the time folks spend in their cars where satellite radio is primarily consumed. Commuters are hitting the road again as companies call workers back to in-office posts. Leisure travel is also on the rise as prices continue to move lower after peaking two summers ago. Sirius XM is ready to put the pedal to the metal."", ""You won't get rich from Disney's semiannual cash distributions. Even after announcing that it will hike its payout by 50% this summer, the entertainment giant will yield less than 0.7% in the year ahead. It doesn't mean that the House of Mouse can't make dividend investors happy on the capital appreciation front."", ""Disney shares are rolling in 2024 after losing badly to the market for three consecutive years. The stock has risen 24% year to date. Suddenly that meager payout doesn't seem so bad, as long as the upticks keep coming."", ""A lot is happening at Disney. You know the bad stuff. It's had recent struggles at the box office. Cord-cutters are hurting Disney's linear media networks. Its flagship streaming business has posted billions in losses over the past couple of years. Even its theme parks -- the steadiest of its operating segments -- have been meandering lately, particularly at its largest resort in Florida."", ""Enough looking back. The near-term outlook is surprisingly bright. Disney has a potential blockbuster hitting the silver screen every month from May through the end of the year. Disney+ should be profitable by the end of September, and top-line growth there is already offsetting the revenue sting for its traditional TV business. You also don't need to worry about the theme parks. Disney is spending aggressively in the next 10 years to invest in capacity-expanding attractions for its gated attractions and cruise ships."", ""Disney shares are trading for a little more than half of their all-time peak set three years ago. Disney would go on to post a profit of $2 billion on $67.4 billion in fiscal 2021. Analysts see $7.3 billion in reported net income with nearly $92 billion on the top line.

Let's discuss its business model, growth strategies for the cloud and AI markets, and its valuations to find out."", ""Oracle is the one of the world's biggest database software companies. Its largest competitors are Microsoft and Amazon, which both integrate their own database services directly into their public cloud infrastructure platforms."", ""Microsoft and Amazon's cloud-based services initially lured businesses away from Oracle's on-premise software. But over the past decade, Oracle transformed those applications into cloud-based services. It also expanded its cloud ecosystem with more enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management, healthcare IT, and infrastructure services."", 'Oracle accelerated that transformation by acquiring higher-growth companies such as cloud software giant NetSuite and healthcare IT services provider Cerner. Today, Oracle is a more broadly diversified enterprise software company, even though it still trails far behind Amazon and Microsoft in the public cloud infrastructure market.', 'As Oracle expanded inorganically, it repatriated a lot of its overseas cash for big buybacks. Over the past five years, it bought back 20% of its outstanding shares to consistently grow its earnings per share (EPS) even as it generated uneven sales growth.', 'Oracle started disclosing its growth in cloud services -- which include its software as a service (SaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) segments -- separately from its license and support revenues in fiscal 2022, which ended in May 2022.', ""The company's total revenue growth in fiscal 2023 was inflated by its acquisition of Cerner, but its organic growth in total cloud services revenue, including Cerner, has remained robust throughout the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, even as the macro headwinds drove many companies to rein in the cloud-based spending."", 'Metric', 'FY 2022', 'FY 2023*', 'Q1 2024', 'Q2 2024', 'Q3 2024', 'Total revenue growth (YOY)', '7%', '22%', '8%', '4%', '7%', 'Total cloud services revenue growth (YOY)', '22%', '50%', '29%', '24%', '24%', 'Data source: Oracle.

All those moves could help OCI carve out a niche in the crowded cloud infrastructure market."", 'Oracle\'s remaining performance obligations for its cloud services -- or the remaining value of its contracts that haven\'t been booked as revenue yet -- rose 29% year over year last quarter as it secured more large cloud infrastructure contracts from the booming AI market.

If it maintains that forward multiple, matches analysts' estimates, and grows its EPS at a CAGR of 20% from fiscal 2026 to fiscal 2030, its stock price could rise nearly 160% and boost its market cap to around $900 billion.

So hopefully, McDonald's can figure out what exactly happened here."", ""BRAD SMITH: Yeah, I was even taking a look at the McDonald's Japan account and doing my best to try and translate.

We know that their loyalty programs, which stems from digital, that's been a really important aspect of the company. So when you affect things like loyalty programs and the access for consumers, they're not going to be too happy about that.

Steve has formed a team to really think deeply on how gen AI not only will impact how the company functions internally but how gen AI will impact that customer or consumer-facing experience.', ""And number two, one number that caught my attention going down the release is this year American Express is supposed to release about 40 new products or improvements on existing products.

Just zooming out, $18 billion in sales added since 2021. Cash pile up almost $25 billion since 2021. More than $1 earnings added since 2021, and they added 20 million more cards in force than 2021. That's some big growth numbers for a company that's been around, I believe, since 1850."", ""And then if you're thinking about-- and like, Brad, you mentioned, American Express just off its record highs. You had Visa trading near its record highs. MasterCard touching all-time high.

Notably this week, maybe the retail sales report wasn't that bad, but can this pace of sales and spending on services, can it continue at this rate? One of the biggest growth areas right now and it has become the biggest growth area for American Express is actually dining within their transit and entertainment side of the business. Can these things continue? because they have been driving the stock over the past two years. Unclear to me, but for right now, they seem to be doing pretty well."", ""SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Brian, digging into that last point that you were just making, I think so many people are asking if we do see a bit more of a slowdown if we're in this higher-for-longer environment than maybe what the Street is forecasting at this point. The pressure that we typically see on names like American Express or names like Visa or MasterCard, how does that stack up to the outperformance that we have seen over the last couple of quarters?"", ""BRIAN SOZZI: I'm glad you asked that, Seana, because I'm also thinking why these stocks are trading near record highs is, yeah, the spending numbers have been good, but they're really being viewed as defensive-type plays. The moats around Visa, MasterCard, and American Express is significant. A couple of weeks ago, I got to spend some time with Visa's new CEO and hear what he's thinking about digital coins and crypto and overseas growth is fascinating, and I can't find a lot of companies that are doing what these three companies are doing, nor is there any chance of any company at least coming out today catching any three of these companies over the next 10, 15, 20 years."", 'BRAD SMITH: When you think about that revenue figure, just lastly while we have you, I was looking back to perhaps the best prepandemic marker that we have in 2019. And even though we saw that growth that you cited a moment ago versus 2021, I mean, it still seems like many of these companies are trying to get these growth numbers lapping the prepandemic markers as well where the revenues in total were actually higher than that 2021 figure.', ""BRIAN SOZZI: That's a good point. I didn't go back to 2020 because it would, I think, show even more just higher periods of growth. To me, 2021 to 2023 is a real good snapshot on how these businesses have been doing postpandemic."", ""But to your point, Brad, there is an opportunity to get back to where it was as more-- as more just workers, let's say in the case of American Express, come back to offices. There's more entertainment. There's more services they can spend on these corporate cards, and they get back to the way they were growing beforehand, but it will take time. I mean, the pandemic has fundamentally changed a lot of companies, and these cardholders are one of them."", 'Not everybody is back in the office.

Card fees are expected to witness growth, supported by AXP’s new card acquisitions.', 'The emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises positions AmEx for sustained long-term growth. It partnered with American Express Global Business Travel, to aid them in managing expenses efficiently. This move bodes well for its Commercial Services segment.

That was the most crude oil produced by any country in history (and well ahead of rivals Russia, with 10.1 million BPD, and Saudi Arabia's 9.7 million BPD). It shattered the country's previous record of 12.3 million BPD in 2019. The country's output also reached a record high of 13.3 million BPD in December. No other country has come close to reaching that level. Saudi Arabia recently scrapped plans to boost its output to 13 million BPD by 2027, suggesting the U.S. will continue to reign supreme. "", 'The U.S. oil production boom is driving growth for many top oil stocks. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG) stand out as three of the top ones to buy right now for those seeking a way to cash in on the boom.', 'Occidental Petroleum produced an average of 1.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) during the fourth quarter of last year. That was its highest quarterly total in over three years. The company benefited from strong production growth in the Rockies and Permian Basin, which offset weaker output in the Gulf of Mexico due to a third-party pipeline outage. ', ""The oil company's strong production rate enabled it to generate lots of cash. It produced $5.5 billion of free cash flow for the year. That gave it the money to invest in growing its production, return cash to shareholders through a growing dividend (22% increase) and share repurchases (including some of the preferred shares owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway), and strengthen its balance sheet. "", 'Occidental is in the process of bolstering its already strong position in the Permian Basin after it agreed to acquire CrownRock in a $12 billion deal. That purchase will boost its production rate and free cash flow. The company anticipates the deal will expand its free cash flow by $1 billion over the first year, assuming oil averages $70 a barrel (it\'s currently over $80). That will give it the cash to quickly repay debt so that it can return more money to shareholders. The company\'s strong position has made it a stock that Warren Buffett considers a potential ""forever"" holding. ', ""Chevron has also caught the attention of Warren Buffett. It's the fifth-largest holding of Berkshire Hathaway, at 5.4%. Occidental is right behind it at 4.2%. His company recently bought some more shares of Chevron. "", ""The oil giant is coming off a record year, delivering record worldwide and U.S. oil production. It grew its total output by 4% last year, fueled by its acquisition of U.S. producer PDC Energy and a 10% increase in production from the Permian Basin. The company's growing production enabled it to produce a gusher of cash. That allowed it to send investors a record $26.3 billion to shareholders last year in dividends and share repurchases. It recently boosted its dividend by another 8%. "", ""Chevron is investing heavily in growing its production in high-margin regions like the Permian Basin. It has also agreed to make another acquisition. It sealed a deal to buy Hess for around $60 billion. The transaction will enhance and extend its production and free-cash-flow growth outlook into the 2030s. Hess would bolster Chevron's U.S. business by adding the Bakken and enhancing its operations in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, it would give the company a stake in the oil-rich Stabroek Block offshore Guyana. While that deal isn't a sure thing, Chevron can grow just fine without it. "", ""Diamondback Energy has also agreed to a megadeal to bolster its operations. It's buying Endeavor Energy Resources for $26 billion to create the premier pure-play producer in the Permian Basin. That deal will enable the company to produce more oil and free cash flow. "", 'As a stand-alone company, Diamondback Energy expects to produce 458,000 to 466,000 BOE/d this year, with its oil output rising by around 3%. That will enable it to generate more than $3.4 billion in free cash flow, or over $19 per share, at the current oil price point of around $80 per barrel.

Boston received approval for its own PFA device in January, and J&J is developing its own version of the technology.\xa0', 'Medtronic is also working to carve out a new market in renal denervation, an ablation procedure intended to help reduce blood pressure as a supplement to drugs and lifestyle changes. The company and Recor both received approval for the first renal denervation devices last year, although an FDA advisory panel did not recommend Medtronic’s device as it had missed the primary endpoint in a clinical trial.\xa0', 'MedTech Dive spoke with Sean Salmon, Medtronic’s cardiovascular president, about the road ahead for these new devices and how the company views its competition.\xa0', 'This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\xa0', 'SEAN SALMON: In 2009, when we first made the decision to invest in this little startup company called Ardian, it was intriguing. I’ve worked in the high blood pressure space before. I know just how unsatisfying the status quo is. It’s probably the largest public health problem we have. One in every two adults has high blood pressure right now — 700,000 deaths are either directly caused or associated with it in the U.S. alone.', ""A lot of these patients don't just have high blood pressure, they’ve got high cholesterol, diabetes, and they're taking 12 to 15 prescribed medicines every single day. A lot of those medicines, particularly hypertension ones, have side effects. It’s not an easy thing for patients to do.\xa0"", 'The promise of having a procedure that you can do in a day. It lasts 24 hours a day, seven days a week and has no side effects. It’s not a cure. It’s not a panacea. It is a huge adjunct help to good lifestyle choices and adherence to medications.\xa0', ""There's a lot to do. CMS, in particular, has a couple of facilities for novel things that can come out that you can get temporary payment until you have enough evidence to satisfy a national coverage determination.\xa0"", ""It's also important because a lot of private payers’ coverage policies are largely informed by what determinations CMS makes. We've got to do the short-term work of trying to get add-on payments, both for the inpatient and outpatient setting and for a national coverage determination through multiple different pathways, including those with evidence development.\xa0"", ""On the private or commercial side, we've got to work state by state. We’ll be busy on reimbursement for a really long time.\xa0\xa0"", ""Once we get that established, I think there's a lot [of work] to drive awareness among patients. There's a lot of interest, but it's also important that their family doctor knows what this is about. Training the doctors, making sure they know how to do the procedure, and helping them set up hypertension clinics, which will help sort out who is or isn't appropriate for something like this."", 'The ablation market exists already. It’s about an $8 billion market that’s growing in the high-single digits. We play in a part of it. For atrial fibrillation, you can isolate the pulmonary veins, which are known to be the major source of where that arrhythmia comes from.\xa0', ""Pulsed field doesn't use any temperature. You’re not using hot or cold to create scar to block those irregular heartbeats from getting through. It uses a high field of electricity that we pulse out in pulse trains. What that does is it essentially pokes a hole in the cell membrane, water comes in and the cell dies. And what's interesting about that is you can tune that pulse train so that it's very specific to what you want to die out. No collateral damage — you don’t worry about the esophagus, you don't worry about the nerves that are right behind where you're doing all this ablation in the heart. The potential for complications goes way down."", 'Our clinical study beared that out. We had one of the lowest complication rates recorded at sub-1%. The energy is also really fast. Doing complex procedures that take lots of hours, five or six hours, can be done in a fraction of that time.', ""We have an organically developed program, which we call PulseSelect, that's what just got approved. We also acquired a program that does the more traditional point-by-point [ablation] but with a very novel catheter and a very novel mapping system, which is something we haven’t had all these years.\xa0"", ""When other competitors are doing it, you feel comfort that you're doing the right thing. A lot of what you want with good competition is to drive your own creativity, and you want help in building markets out, so awareness among patients and providers and even hospital administrators.\xa0"", ""Being highly differentiated on products and taking some of the work steps out, that's how we win in the trenches."", 'We keep reinventing ourselves in our oldest business, cardiac rhythm. The most recent iteration of that is a new way of doing the ICD market.\xa0', 'With an ICD traditionally, you have these leads that go into the heart. You have a big device under your collarbone on the side of your chest. Leads are great. They’ve been proven that you can deliver energy. Importantly, what you can do with a lead in the heart is you can pace the patient rather than just shock them.\xa0', ""That’s important because a shock is scary and painful. You don’t want to do that if you don't have to do that.\xa0"", ""There is another device — Boston Scientific sells one — for what they call leadless. You reduce the potential for infection, but that can't pace. That device can only shock. It’s twice the size, and it doesn’t last as long.\xa0"", ""The big innovation we had for what we call an extravascular ICD is that we tunnel a lead underneath the breastbone. And from that position, we're close enough that we can pace the heart. The device works like a traditional ICD. It's a big opportunity. That market today is $300-ish million dollars.

So, you know, we still feel good about their performance this year, and potentially, you know, their guidance could prove conservative."", ""SEANA SMITH: Susan, how much do you think the new product lines, the launches that we're expecting here is going to add to Ulta's top line?"", ""SUSAN ANDERSON: Yeah, I think it's definitely going to be very helpful. They just recently rolled out Charlotte Tilbury and Sol de Janeiro, which are starting to ramp in the stores now. So I think that will be helpful. And then in the back half they talked about they have more newness coming out. So I think typically newness is about 20% to 30% of Ulta's sales. Last year, I think that newness was towards the lower end of that range. So this year I think it's going to be much stronger, and it's going to be very important to the sales."", ""BRAD SMITH: You know, it's really interesting. This is perhaps the third or fourth conversation where I've heard this word newness tossed around quite a bit here, and we hear it with some of the athletic footwear and apparel companies especially. What is newness? Is it a result of innovation and research and development that these companies are doing, or is it just a matter of rebranding something that may have been popular that they're looking to resurface again?"", ""SUSAN ANDERSON: No, it's really-- so it could be anywhere from a new brand that they're launching in stores such as this Charlotte Tilbury, or it could be new products coming from existing brands. So it's kind of all of the above, but it's not necessarily just repackaging or rebranding something that was already there. It's really something that is new that the consumer is looking for that's driving them into that store."", ""BRAD SMITH: Thank goodness, Susan, because I didn't want to be out here getting duped by something that I might have bought that's already in the closet or in the bathroom shelf. So thank you for that."", 'SUSAN ANDERSON: Sure.']"

The gene-editing specialist has made tremendous clinical and regulatory progress since its 2016 initial public offering, leading to market-beating returns even if it hasn't always been smooth sailing. And there may yet be plenty of upside left for the company. Gene editing could help revolutionize how we treat many challenging conditions -- and the frontrunners in the field will likely be well-rewarded."", ""However, investors might also be worried that the best is in the rearview mirror for CRISPR Therapeutics. Can the mid-cap biotech still deliver outsized returns? Let's find out."", ""CRISPR Therapeutics' crowning achievement, at least so far, has been the approval of Casgevy, a one-time curative therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT). Various regulatory bodies in the U.S., Europe, and the Middle East have granted Casgevy the green light since late last year."", ""TDT and SCD are blood-related diseases that cause severe hardship to patients, are extremely difficult to manage, and impose costly burdens on health systems. Casgevy's approval was a breakthrough for that reason, but that's not all. It also became the first CRISPR-based gene-editing therapy on the market. The pioneers of this particular gene-editing technique won a Nobel prize in chemistry for their work."", ""It will take some time before Casgevy, developed with the help of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, starts contributing to CRISPR Therapeutics' top line. The partners will split the profits and costs associated with it on a 60/40 basis, with 40% going to CRISPR Therapeutics."", ""Gene-editing treatments require a long and complex administration process. But once the logistics are up and running, CRISPR and Vertex could make a fortune. They estimate that 35,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe could benefit from Casgevy. The therapy will cost $2.2 million in the U.S. It may not be priced at the same level elsewhere, but it won't be cheap either."", ""At the very least, the market opportunity here is worth tens of billions of dollars. Could the competition steal significant market share from CRISPR and Vertex? That seems unlikely. The only competitor to note (for now) is Bluebird Bio, a small-cap biotech that doesn't have nearly as much money in the bank as Vertex. Further, Bluebird Bio only operates in the U.S., and its competing SCD therapy, Lyfgenia, comes with a boxed warning for blood cancer. It's also priced higher at $3.1 million."", 'There are other gene-editing specialists on the trail, but they will need to cross plenty of clinical and regulatory hurdles before challenging Casgevy. The bottom line is that this medicine could go on to reach blockbuster status even if it captures only a relatively small portion of its target market, say 30%. That should lead to solid financial results for CRISPR Therapeutics.', ""Maybe CRISPR Therapeutics just got lucky by stumbling upon an effective gene-editing therapy for a couple of diseases that had largely eluded researchers. But that seems unlikely, especially since Casgevy is the first CRISPR-based treatment on the market. Others have tried to emulate these feats. So far, most attempts have been abject failures. The best explanation for CRISPR Therapeutics' Casgevy success, in my view, is that it has a team of excellent scientists and researchers, an important factor for any biotech company."", ""CRISPR Therapeutics is running clinical trials for a handful of gene-editing candidates. It is targeting various cancers, a pair of cardiovascular diseases, and type 1 diabetes. There are more programs in pre-clinical testing that should start human clinical trials in the next few years. Don't expect a 100% success rate. No drugmaker can pull that off. However, given the company's pipeline -- and the fact that it shouldn't have trouble with funding, partly thanks to Casgevy -- we can expect CRISPR Therapeutics to make solid clinical progress from here on out."", ""So, it isn't too late to buy the company's shares, at least for long-term investors. There's plenty of upside left."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in CRISPR Therapeutics right now?', 'Before you buy stock in CRISPR Therapeutics, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and CRISPR Therapeutics wasn’t one of them.

However, consistent supply-chain issues might continue to adversely impact jet deliveries and thereby, remain a threat to the industry players.\xa0 Nevertheless, the Defense Bill, worth $886 billion signed by the U.S. President in December 2023, is expected to boost aerospace-defense companies that are primarily engaged in combat space. The frontrunners in the aerospace-defense industry are Safran SAFRY, Textron TXT and Leidos Holdings LDOS.', 'About the Industry', 'The Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry comprises of companies that primarily design and manufacture heavy-built products like commercial as well as military jets and helicopters, tankers and other combat vehicles, missiles, combatant ships as well as auxiliary ships, submarines, bombs, guns, space transportation vehicles, military satellites and a few more. The industry also includes cyber security players who offer information technology services and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions. A portion of its revenues comes from defense contractors offering spare parts, aircraft modification, ship repair and overhaul services, and supply-chain management services.', '4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense Industry', ""Improved Air Traffic Outlook Boosts Prospects: Recovering global air traffic data in recent times has boosted the near-term growth prospects of the industry. As stated in the latest report published by the IATA, industry-wide global revenue-passenger kilometers (RPKs) increased 16.6% year over year in January 2024, thereby reaching just 0.4% below the 2019 level. Looking ahead, IATA projects 2024 air passenger revenues to grow 12% from the 2023 level to $717 billion. Such impressive projections bode well for commercial aerospace manufacturers that have long borne the brunt of poor air travel in the form of delayed jet deliveries and, in some cases, cancellation of orders by airlines.Expanding Defense Budget Remains a Growth Catalyst: While the commercial aerospace market has been recovering steadily over the past couple of quarters, the defense side of the industry stood its ground amid the COVID-19 crisis, cushioned by steady government support. To this end, it is imperative to mention that in December 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden signed the U.S. defense policy bill that authorizes a record $886 billion in annual military spending, thereby increasing the nation's total national security budget by about 3%.\xa0 Such improved budgetary provisions set the stage for industry players focused on the defense business to win more contracts, which is likely to boost their top line.Supply-Chain Issues May Hurt: Significant supply-chain disruption impacted the Aerospace and Defense industry, thanks to the pandemic-induced lower aircraft demand and restrictions on the movement of people and goods. This primarily affected small suppliers like aircraft part manufacturers, especially those with heavy exposure to commercial aerospace, and the aftermarket business. Although the global economy has started to improve, supply-chain issues are still expected to continue to play a part as a growth inhibitor, at least in the first half of 2024. This, in turn, might constrict the growth trajectory of the U.S. Aerospace and Defense industry, to some extent, in the near term.Strengthening Dollar Adds to Industry Woes: The recently appreciating U.S. dollar is adding another layer of cost to airlines that are already burdened with high inflation and rising jet fuel prices. The Federal Reserve’s policy rate was between 5.25% and 5.50% during February 2024, having started at 0.25% in 2022. All U.S. dollar-denominated costs are rising for airlines that earn revenues in non-U.S. currency. Similarly, the debt burden has increased for all non-dollar-based entities that have borrowed in dollars. Such a burden on airlines might lead to lower aircraft delivery, thereby hurting aerospace-defense industry players that particularly operate in the commercial aerospace."", 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects', 'The Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry is housed within the broader Zacks Aerospace sector.

The beverage giant's yield is sitting just above 3% as of this writing, which means you could receive an income of $400 per year by putting about $13,000 to work in the stock."", ""Of course, you'd want to make an investment like this in the context of a diversified portfolio that includes exposure to many other sectors and business types. But Coke can be a highly positive force in such a portfolio. Let's look at a few reasons why."", ""Coke's\xa0mid-February earnings report contained plenty of good news for its shareholders. Organic sales were up a robust 12% in the fourth quarter, management said, outpacing rival PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP). Coke benefits from its higher proportion of on-the-go beverage sales and its more focused portfolio. It is also helping it right now to not have a large exposure to snack foods as PepsiCo does."", 'Coke is also finding success with its push into non-traditional beverage categories like energy drinks and sparkling waters. ""We\'re confident that our all-weather strategy, powerful portfolio, and harmonized system will continue to create value for our stakeholders,"" CEO James Quincey said in the Q4 press release. Yet Wall Street has modest expectations for the business. Most analysts project that sales will be flat this year, which helps explain why Coke\'s stock is available at a relative discount after having sat out the market\'s rally over the past year.', ""Meanwhile, its earnings are expanding quickly, putting shareholders in a great position to patiently hold this stock while they collect passive income. Coke's operating margin rose to an industry-leading 23% of sales in Q4, helping power an earnings jump of 13% for the year. That 2023 increase rises to a blazing 21% after adjusting for currency exchange rate shifts."", ""Cash production looks just as strong, with free cash flow again landing at about $10 billion for 2023. This performance allowed management to direct nearly $2 billion toward stock buybacks. But Coke's bigger priority is clearly its dividend. Coke spent $8 billion on dividend payments in 2023, up from $7.6 billion in 2022. Look for another significant payout boost later in 2024, which will mark Coke's 62nd consecutive annual hike."", ""You'll have to pay a bit of a premium for Coca-Cola stock, at least compared to some other consumer staples giants. PepsiCo shares trade at 2.5 times annual sales, less than half of Coke's valuation."", ""But Coke is much more profitable, sporting a 28% profit margin compared to Pepsi's 14%. The company is growing more quickly, too, with both sales volumes and profits rising in the past full year.

Solid adoption of Azure AI, which now has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers holds promise.However, Office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings.

That single transaction was for US$7.4m worth of shares at a price of US$204 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$211. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Waste Management insiders own about US$153m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders."", ""Insiders haven't bought Waste Management stock in the last three months, but there was some selling.

However, macroeconomic concerns and adverse currency impacts are major downsides.', 'Let’s delve deeper.', 'Critical Care Spin-Off Optimistic for Structural Heart Opportunities:\xa0In December 2023, Edwards announced the strategic decision to spin off the Critical Care segment at the end of 2024. The tax-free spin-off will allow the company to pursue more opportunities for TAVR (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement), TMTT and Surgical patients, as well as new investments in interventional heart failure technologies.', 'For investors’ note, Critical Care is one of the company’s rapidly growing businesses.

During the year, the company’s PASCAL Precision was approved in Japan to treat patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation. In mitral replacement, Edwards received FDA approval for the SAPIEN 3 continued access program. Further, the EVOQUE system became the world's first transcatheter valve replacement therapy to receive regulatory approval to treat TR (tricuspid regurgitation)."", 'Robust Q4 Performance: The company’s impressive 2023 fourth-quarter performance was driven by its broad portfolio of innovative therapies. Edwards Lifesciences delivered strong growth across each of its four product groups, which raises our optimism. The solid uptick in the top line also highlighted strengthening leadership in the TAVR segment. The ongoing expansion and adoption of the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA platform in the United States appears encouraging.', 'Macro Concerns Put Pressure on the Bottom Line: Despite the improved conditions post-COVID-19, Edwards Lifesciences acknowledges the lingering impacts felt throughout 2023, particularly in Japan and staffing shortages in the United States and Europe. Additionally, the company has been grappling with escalated expenses for a while. In the fourth quarter of 2023, both SG&A and R&D expenses increased 16.8% and 16.3%, respectively, year over year. The quarter’s gross margin crashed 416 basis points (bps) while the operating margin declined 532 bps.', 'Foreign Exchange Impacts:\xa0Foreign exchange is a major headwind for Edwards Lifesciences due to a considerable percentage of its revenues coming from outside the United States. In the fourth quarter of 2023, foreign exchange rates decreased reported sales growth by 80 basis points (bps) or $9 million compared to the prior year.

Labcorp is the first company to nationally avail of an ATN profile — a blood-based test that combines three well-researched blood biomarkers to identify and assess biological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease, Amyloid-Tau Alzheimer's and neurodegeneration targeted for patients being evaluated for mild dementia."", 'Labcorp price | Labcorp Quote', ""Further, Labcorp boasts a robust pipeline of potential hospital and local laboratory acquisitions, which present ample opportunities for growth. The company also continues to progress in terms of integrating hospital partnerships and acquisitions.In the fourth quarter of 2023, the momentum from the health systems and regional local lab partnership strategy remained strong. Labcorp announced a strategic partnership with Baystate Health in Western Massachusetts to acquire its outreach laboratory business and select operating assets. It also completed the acquisition of select assets from Legacy Health and currently manages Legacy's inpatient hospital laboratories, serving patients throughout Oregon and Southwest Washington.On the flip side, with the end of the pandemic, Labcorp witnessed a significant decline in COVID-19 PCR testing volumes. In the fourth quarter of 2023, testing revenues were down 73% and affected some of the company’s key metrics.Besides, Labcorp’s operations are also subject to the effects of macroeconomic factors in the United States and globally. These include significant economic fluctuations as a result of the disturbed geopolitical situation and inflation, all leading to an increase in the costs of goods and services. Throughout most of the months of 2023, Labcorp.’s Early Development Research Laboratories business grappled with non-human primate (NHP)-related supply chain issues. The company experienced higher-than-normal cancellations and lower orders, primarily due to small biotech funding."", 'Meanwhile, Labcorp faces intense competition from its major competitor, Quest Diagnostics, and other commercial laboratories and hospitals. In a $55 billion U.S. lab market, hospitals control an estimated 55% of the diagnostic test market, compared to Labcorp’s 10% share. While pricing is an important factor in choosing a testing lab, hospital-affiliated physicians expect a high level of service, including accurate and rapid turnaround of testing results. As a result, Labcorp and other commercial labs compete with hospital-affiliated labs, primarily on the basis of quality of service.', 'Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita DVA, Cardinal Health CAH and Stryker SYK.

But if you try your hand at stock picking, your risk returning less than the market. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) shareholders, since the share price is down 51% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 22%. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 11% in the last three months."", ""Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business."", ' View our latest analysis for Whirlpool ', ""In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", ""Whirlpool became profitable within the last five years. We would usually expect to see the share price rise as a result. So it's worth looking at other metrics to try to understand the share price move."", ""We note that the dividend seems healthy enough, so that probably doesn't explain the share price drop. However, the weak share price might be related to the fact revenue has been disappearing at a rate of 3.2% each year, over three years. In that case, the current EPS might be viewed by some as difficult to sustain."", 'You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).', 'We know that Whirlpool has improved its bottom line lately, but what does the future have in store? So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecasts', 'As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Whirlpool, it has a TSR of -44% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!', ""While the broader market gained around 31% in the last year, Whirlpool shareholders lost 13% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 0.8% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

For example, the aircraft engine model (GE and RTX both follow this) is to sell engines at a loss only to generate decades of higher-margin parts and service revenue.', 'As such, when equipment deliveries are ramping up (as they are now with the LEAP engine on the Airbus A320 neo family and the Boeing 737 MAX, the GEnx engine on the Boeing 787, and in the future the GE9X on the Boeing 777X), profitability is depressed in relation to what it will be when the engines are in use for a few years and the revenue mix shifts to higher-margin parts and services.', ""As such, nobody is pricing GE Aerospace for what it is now, but rather what its future earnings and cash flow will be. For example, my estimate for the implied value of GE Aerospace of $155.7 billion means GE Aerospace is valued at 31.1 times management's estimate for free cash flow (FCF) in 2024, as shown below."", 'GE Aerospace', '2023', '2024', '2025', 'Adjusted revenue', '$32 billion', 'Low double-digit growth', 'Low double-digit growth', 'Operating profit', '$5.6 billion', '$6 billion to $6.5 billion', '$7.1 billion to $7.5 billion', 'Free cash flow', '$4.7 billion', '$5 billion', 'Greater than 100% conversion from net income', 'Data source: GE Aerospace presentations.', ""It's an extremely high figure for an industrial conglomerate but comparable to the valuations accorded to other aerospace-focused companies (see chart below). In addition, note that GE Aerospace will see some margin pressure in the coming years as engine deliveries ramp up and their share of the revenue mix grows. In other words, GE's earnings and cash flow in the near term don't reflect its long-term potential."", ""Based on the numbers above, GE is starting to look close to being fully valued. One Wall Street analyst thinks there's still high-single-digit upside potential to the stock price, which looks reasonable, albeit unexciting."", 'That said, GE\'s valuation has possibly been bolstered by the perception that it is a ""go to"" stock in the aerospace and defense sector in light of the Boeing, RTX, and Lockheed Martin issues. That could change if the three start improving operationally.', 'The best way to consider the investment opportunity is to look at what GE Vernova and GE Aerospace are valued at after the spin. Anything less than $27.3 billion for GE Vernova is an excellent value opportunity, while less than $155.7 billion for GE Aerospace provides a little upside.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in General Electric right now?', 'Before you buy stock in General Electric, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and General Electric wasn’t one of them.

In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' View our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Estée Lauder Companies is:', '7.4% = US$483m ÷ US$6.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.07."", ""By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Estée Lauder Companies has a lower ROE than the average (13%) in the Personal Products industry classification."", ""Unfortunately, that's sub-optimal. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved. You can see the 4 risks we have identified for Estée Lauder Companies by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here."", ""Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking."", ""Estée Lauder Companies clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.26. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it."", 'Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.', 'But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

You logged some big gains, either realized or unrealized. Better yet, if you're a multidecade shareholder, this stock has likely become a massive -- and massively rewarding -- piece of your portfolio."", ""There's another familiar name out there, however, that's quietly turned even more of its investors into millionaires. It's just done so for a slightly different but important reason. That company? Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG)."", ""The thing is, the reason P&G was so rewarding to shareholders in the past is still in place. The same can't necessarily be said of Costco."", ""It's tough to make a true apples-to-apples comparison of these two consumer-oriented companies. They aren't exactly in the same business, after all, and one's been around far longer than the other. They each also have their own unique goals when it comes to rewarding shareholders."", 'Still, to the extent investors understand that every stock has its unique qualitative as well as quantitative characteristics, we can reasonably hold one of these names up against the other.', ""To this end, from nothing other than a price-based viewpoint, Costco is technically the better performer. Its stock has advanced more than 8,000% since it went public back in 1985. Wow. Procter & Gamble's been around for nearly two centuries, conversely, and has been publicly traded for decades. Since the mid-80s, though, P&G stock has gained a little less than 5,000%. Both are solid performances, but clearly, one's better than the other."", ""However, there's a dimension that is not being reflected by these numbers. That's\xa0dividends. Costco pays them, but only minimally. Procter & Gamble is much more serious about dishing them out. Not only does it make bigger dividend payments, but it's raised its annual payout every year for the past 67 years."", 'The end result? Since 1985, reinvesting the dividends paid by Procter in more shares of the company would have netted you a market-beating average annualized return of nearly 13%. If dividends were reinvested during this period, a $10,000 investment in Procter & Gamble then would be worth more than\xa0$1.1 million today.', ""Surprised? Don't be. Although most investors seem to prioritize their search for growth prospects these days, dividend income remains a big part of the market's overall returns. Numbers from mutual fund company Hartford indicate dividends accounted for 41% of the\xa0S&P 500's total returns between 1930 and 2022. And the numbers become even more impressive when you reinvest them in the index itself. Hartford goes on to say that 69% of the S&P 500's total returns between 1960 and 2022 were ultimately attributed to reinvested dividends."", 'The secrets of this success? For Procter, consistency is a big one. The company continued to dish out dividend payments even when economic turbulence was dragging the stock down. This ultimately meant more shares were bought at a discount, magnifying the rebounds once they took shape.', ""There's also the nature of Procter & Gamble's business and how well it does it."", ""Consumers\xa0will always need laundry detergent, toothpaste, and diapers. Procter is a leading name in all three categories, with its Tide, Crest, and Pampers brands. And that's just a sampling. It owns several category-leading brands, including Dawn dish detergent, Oral-B, and Gillette razors, just to name a few. It remains a market leader because it can afford to simply outspend its competitors when marketing its goods -- something Costco can't say."", 'It matters simply because this capacity to out-promote its rivals facilitates the very consistency that makes Procter a name worth reinvesting dividends in.', ""None of this is to suggest you absolutely must own Procter & Gamble over Costco. There's still a pretty good bullish case for holding Costco, too. Indeed, the stock is up more than 50% in just the past year and higher by more than 200% for the past five years. P&G shares are generating nowhere near that sort of performance."", 'That big gain from Costco is arguably an exception to the norm rather than its norm, however.', ""It's also not likely to hold. The stock is now trading at a\xa0forward-looking price/earnings ratio of 46, which is stunningly expensive for any retailer's stock. The market may well be rethinking this run-up soon, correcting the mistake with a sizable pullback."", ""Procter & Gamble shares aren't running that same degree of risk, valued at only 25 times this year's projected per-share profits."", ""That sets the stage for yet another reason P&G has created more millionaires than Costco has -- investors can comfortably, confidently hold onto it in good times and bad, whereas Costco's often-volatile nature means it isn't a name that's always easy to stick with. When a stock is uncomfortable to continue holding, however, that is often the time it's most important to do so."", ""Bottom line? You don't necessarily need to own sexy growth stocks to become a millionaire. Boring, slow-and-steady names are just as able to get the job done, if not more so. Moreover, the attributes that made Procter & Gamble such a great millionaire-maker over the course of the past 40 years could do the same in the coming 40 years. People are always going to need to do laundry and brush their teeth, after all."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Procter & Gamble right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Procter & Gamble, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Procter & Gamble wasn’t one of them.

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.

PepsiCo is one of the best consumer brands to consider. It has a leading position in snacks and beverages, with a large portfolio of brands like Quaker Oats, Doritos, and Gatorade. Last year, the company generated $9 billion in profit, which funded its 52nd year of dividend increases.', 'PepsiCo is still capable of delivering growth to keep growing the dividend for many years. Management sees tremendous opportunities in developing markets and fast-growing categories like energy drinks.', ""The dividend should continue to increase as the business expands. Management's long-term goal is to deliver adjusted earnings growth in the high-single-digit range on an annualized basis."", ""PepsiCo's above-average yield highlights the value in the shares right now.

The combination of earnings growth and the yield should deliver total shareholder returns on par with the major market indexes."", 'Jeremy Bowman (Williams-Sonoma): You might be surprised to learn that shares of Williams-Sonoma, the high-end home furnishings retailer, have more than doubled over the last year.', 'Even in a challenging market for home goods with sluggish real estate sales and high interest rates, Williams-Sonoma continues to generate strong profits and has kept nearly all of its revenue gains from the pandemic.', 'Even as comparable sales fell 6.8% year over year in the fourth quarter, reflecting the sector-wide challenges, Williams-Sonoma drove impressive margin expansion with gross margin up 480 basis points to 46%. As a result, its operating margin rose from 19.2% to 20.1%, and earnings per share increased from $5.28 to $5.44 as the bottom line continued to benefit from share repurchases.', 'Better yet, Williams-Sonoma surprised investors with a 26% increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.13 a share, and announced a new $1 billion share buyback program, a sign of confidence in the business and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders.', ""The company's guidance indicates the worst of the sector downturn is behind it as it sees revenue stabilizing this year, calling for flat top-line growth, and for operating margin to improve from 16.1% to 16.5%-16.8%. That, along with share buybacks, should drive earnings growth this year, and over the longer term, the company should benefit from the expected decline in interest rates and a recovery in the housing market, which will promote spending on home furnishings."", 'Williams-Sonoma also reaffirmed its guidance of mid- to high-single-digit annual revenue growth and operating margin in the mid to high teens.', 'With a dividend yield of 1.6%, the retailer might not wow income investors, but it has the right formula for consistent dividend increases and steady earnings growth, and it looks well set up to reward long-term investors.', ""Jennifer Saibil (Starbucks): Starbucks is by far the largest coffee shop chain in the world, with more than 38,500 stores. However, it's nowhere near finished in its expansion efforts, and management thinks it can reach 55,000 stores over the next few years. That could propel it to the largest restaurant chain in the world."", ""At this point, Starbucks runs a smooth operation. It can open hundreds of stores in a quarter and hit the ground running with a model that works and customers love, leading to high profits and strong comparable sales (comps) growth. It has continued to generate increased sales after a pandemic dip despite global economic and geopolitical volatility. And when it was worried about getting stale, it brought in a new CEO to refresh and improve. It has launched several recent initiatives to revitalize the brand, such as on-demand single-cup brewing machines and a larger food menu. It's focusing on its membership program, which builds Starbucks' relationship with its most loyal customers and leads to higher engagement and sales."", 'In the 2024 fiscal first quarter (ended Dec. 31), sales were up 8% year over year driven by a 5% increase in comps. Operating margin widened to 15.8%, and earnings per share were up 20% to $0.90.', ""As Starbucks has moved from a growth stock to a value stock, it's focusing on its dividend to create shareholder value. It yields 2.5% at the current price, well above the S&P 500 average of 1.5%. On top of that, it has increased its dividend by 340% over the past 10 years, far more than classic dividend stocks like Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble."", 'Starbucks has been dealing with many problems lately, including high union sentiment at many of its branches, and its stock is down 7% over the past year.

PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) is one such company. This stalwart of the consumer staples sector has seen its share price drop over the past few months, but its long-term potential as a cash flow powerhouse is still compelling.', 'Since July 1, 2023, PepsiCo shares are trading down almost 11%. Over that same timeframe, the S&P 500 gained 16% while Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) stayed roughly flat.', ""Pepsi's stock is lagging for a few different reasons. The company has struggled with revenue and volume growth over the past year. It increased prices in reaction to rising costs, which hurt demand among price-conscious consumers who are struggling with inflation across the board."", 'Some of its distributors have raised concerns that the price hikes are excessive, so the company is unlikely to drive growth from additional price hikes moving forward. It needs to rely on rising unit volume to keep expanding, at least in the short term. Unfortunately, some investors are speculating that weight loss drugs could seriously curb the consumption of snack foods and that widespread use of those pharmaceuticals could hurt PepsiCo, along with its industry peers.', ""PepsiCo's 10% stock price drop isn't an enormous one, but it's enough to warrant a look from income investors. If the recent concerns are overblown, then this could be an opportunity to lock in a long-term dividend stream at a more attractive yield."", ""PepsiCo operates a business that isn't exciting from a growth perspective, but it doesn't have many rivals when it comes to stability. That should be a priority for dividend stocks, because those investments tend to thrive when the underlying business has predictable cash flow expansion."", ""There are dozens of household brand names under the PepsiCo umbrella, spanning various beverage, snack, and grocery categories. These include Frito-Lay, Quaker, Doritos, Gatorade, Smartfood, Sabra, and others that most people don't even realize fall under the PepsiCo umbrella. Its Frito-Lay and Quaker divisions accounted for more than half of its North American revenue last year, so the product diversification is meaningful financially. Contrary to what people might think, PepsiCo isn't just a rival to Coca-Cola -- it has a unique and broad product portfolio."", ""PepsiCo is also geographically diversified, with a presence in more than 200 countries around the world. It still has heavy concentration in North America, which accounts for nearly 60% of total company revenue, but this is a truly global business that doesn't depend on any one nation's economy to prosper."", ""PepsiCo is a Dividend King with 51 consecutive years of dividend growth. The stock currently sports a 3% yield after raising its quarterly dividend to $1.265 per share. Over the past decade, the company's revenue and cash flows have slowly marched higher, with an average annual growth rate in the 3% to 5% range."", ""PepsiCo's dividend payout ratio of 73% has been somewhat volatile in recent years, which could cast doubt on its ability to continue raising its dividend if sales growth struggles with macroeconomic headwinds. That's something to monitor moving forward, but the company generated $1 billion more free cash flow than it distributed to shareholders last year."", 'If the broader economy keeps improving over the next year or two, PepsiCo is likely to deliver suitable financial results. The company is forecasting 4% revenue growth and 8% earnings growth in 2024, after adjusting for the effect of currency fluctuations, acquisitions, divestitures, and additional reporting weeks that occur every fifth or sixth fiscal year.', 'Fundamental performance over the past two years makes the divergence from Coca-Cola look exaggerated. On a percentage basis, PepsiCo has nearly kept pace with its rival on the top line, and it compares favorably when it comes to earnings, cash flow, and dividends.', ""PepsiCo isn't immune from challenges moving forward, but it's a dividend powerhouse with a diverse business and strong competitive position that contributes to reliable cash flows.

Organic sales were up a robust 12% in the fourth quarter, management said, outpacing rival PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP). Coke benefits from its higher proportion of on-the-go beverage sales and its more focused portfolio. It is also helping it right now to not have a large exposure to snack foods as PepsiCo does."", 'Coke is also finding success with its push into non-traditional beverage categories like energy drinks and sparkling waters. ""We\'re confident that our all-weather strategy, powerful portfolio, and harmonized system will continue to create value for our stakeholders,"" CEO James Quincey said in the Q4 press release. Yet Wall Street has modest expectations for the business. Most analysts project that sales will be flat this year, which helps explain why Coke\'s stock is available at a relative discount after having sat out the market\'s rally over the past year.', ""Meanwhile, its earnings are expanding quickly, putting shareholders in a great position to patiently hold this stock while they collect passive income. Coke's operating margin rose to an industry-leading 23% of sales in Q4, helping power an earnings jump of 13% for the year. That 2023 increase rises to a blazing 21% after adjusting for currency exchange rate shifts."", ""Cash production looks just as strong, with free cash flow again landing at about $10 billion for 2023. This performance allowed management to direct nearly $2 billion toward stock buybacks. But Coke's bigger priority is clearly its dividend. Coke spent $8 billion on dividend payments in 2023, up from $7.6 billion in 2022. Look for another significant payout boost later in 2024, which will mark Coke's 62nd consecutive annual hike."", ""You'll have to pay a bit of a premium for Coca-Cola stock, at least compared to some other consumer staples giants. PepsiCo shares trade at 2.5 times annual sales, less than half of Coke's valuation."", ""But Coke is much more profitable, sporting a 28% profit margin compared to Pepsi's 14%. The company is growing more quickly, too, with both sales volumes and profits rising in the past full year. Pepsi, in contrast, had to rely exclusively on price hikes to keep its overall sales rising."", ""The good news is that dividend investors can sit back and collect passive income from Coca-Cola while they wait for its stock returns to better match up with its excellent financial metrics. Whether you can put $1,300 or $13,000 to work in this business today, you'll likely be happy with the over 3% immediate yield. Sure, there are faster-growing stocks available outside of the consumer staples niche.

By now, everyone should have access to the earnings results press release which was issued earlier today before the market opened at 7:30 AM Eastern Time. This call is being webcast and will be available for replay. In our remarks today, we will include statements that are considered forward looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including forward-looking statements about future results of operations, business strategies and plans, our relationships with our customers, as well as market and potential growth opportunities. In addition, management may make additional forward-looking statements in response to your question. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current knowledge and expectations as of today and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions related to factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. We offer no assurance that these expectations and beliefs will prove to be correct. A detailed discussion of such risks and uncertainties are contained in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K.

And with that, I would now like to introduce Paltalk's, Chief Executive Officer, Jason Katz."", 'Jason Katz', ""Thank you, Kara, and good morning, everyone. We greatly appreciate you taking the time to join us on today's call. We will discuss our operating highlights and financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. Additionally, we will provide an update on our business and near-term business objectives. After my opening statement, our CFO, Kara Jenny will give a summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. Following our prepared remarks, we will move into the Q&A portion and answer any questions that were pre-submitted prior to this call. With that, I would now like to walk you through the recent financial and operating highlights and near-term business objectives. We are very pleased with our continued efforts to bring down our costs and streamline our operations, which has resulted in the 69% improvement in net losses and the 62% reduction in adjusted EBITDA losses for 2023, despite our revenue remaining flat. We continue to shrewdly execute on our revenue growth plans and believe we are well positioned for profitability with our current expense infrastructure. On the sales side, our marketing efforts have become more efficient, and we have expanded ManyCam to the enterprise segment. We believe we are well positioned for organic and acquisitive growth as our current expense infrastructure can support additional revenue, and our cash position as of December 31, 2023 remains strong at $13.6 million. On the strategic opportunities front, we have continued to actively identify and analyze potential mergers or acquisitions of assets or entities that are synergistic to our businesses, which we believe have the potential to increase shareholder value. Moving on to an update on our trial against Cisco WebEx, on July 23, 2021, a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, Paltalk Holdings, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Cisco Systems, Inc. in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas. We allege that certain of Cisco's products have infringed US patent number 6683858, and that we are entitled to damages. A Markman hearing took place on February 24, 2022. On September 7, 2022, the United States Patent Office issued a reexamination of US patent number 6683858. And on January 19, 2023, the examiner issued an ex parte reexamination certificate, ending the reexamination and confirming the patentability of claims 1 through 10 of US patent number 6683858. On June 29, 2023, the court held a pretrial conference with the parties and denied Cisco's motion for summary judgment. The trial is expected to begin on April 8, 2024. If we receive a jury verdict in our favor or receive settlement proceeds in connection with the foregoing litigation, the exact amount of such proceeds to be received by us will be determined based on a number of factors and will reflect the deduction of significant litigation-related expenses, including legal fees. Consequently, we will not receive the majority of any gross proceeds resulting from any potential verdict or settlement. For the foregoing reasons, we are unable to predict the outcome of this litigation and its ultimate cost. Now I'd like to pass it to Kara for a financial summary of our fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023."", 'Kara Jenny', ""Thank you, Jason. Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2023 decreased by 4% to $2.7 million compared to $2.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022.

Loss from operations for the three months ended December 31, 2023, improved by 38% to a loss of $0.5 million compared to a loss of $0.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The improvement in loss from operations was attributed to a decrease in sales and marketing, product development, and general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023. Net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2023, improved by over 42% to $0.3 million compared to a net loss of $0.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in net loss was due to the reduction of operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA loss for the three months ended December 31, 2023, improved by over 52% to $0.2 million compared to adjusted EBITDA loss of $0.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Now turning to the year ended December 31, 2023. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 remain relatively unchanged at $11 million. Decreases in subscription and virtual guest revenue in the Paltalk and Camfrog applications were offset by increases in revenue from the Vumber and ManyCam. Loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, improved by 43% to a loss of $2.1 million compared to a loss of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The improvement in loss from operations was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue and reduced operating expenses in connection with the implementation of operating efficiencies. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 improved by over 68% to $1.1 million compared to a net loss of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The improvement in net loss is attributed to a decrease in operating expenses as well as an increase in other income in connection with the company's recording of a refundable employee retention tax credit. Adjusted EBITDA loss for the year ended December 31, 2023, improved by over 61% or $1.6 million to $1 million compared to adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Cash and cash equivalent totaled $13.6 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $1.1 million compared to $14.7 million at December 31, 2022.

The first question, can you provide any color on how ManyCam renewals are tracking?', 'Jason Katz', ""Sure. While we do not comment on the metrics of the individual products, we're continuing to focus on ways to streamline the renewal process for our users and to provide users value such that they will want to continue to renew with us."", 'Kara Jenny', 'Next. Are you working on any new features and/or product launches for 2024? If so, can you discuss?', 'Jason Katz', ""Part of our business strategy is to continue working on application functionality. Of note, we're excited about the launch of ManyCam version 9 which is currently scheduled for release during Q2 2024. ManyCam provides a multitude of tools to help customize your video experience, and we hope that our new version will allow users to start working with ManyCam's powerful video features faster than ever."", 'Kara Jenny', 'Next question. Is international growing, slowing, or staying flat?', 'Jason Katz', ""We're continuing to see new users registering from emerging markets such as Africa and India, and we're investigating ways to help grow and monetize these new user bases."", 'Kara Jenny', 'Finally, the last question, do you expect to close on an acquisition in 2024, as you have been looking now for 12 to 18 months?', 'Jason Katz', ""While we're continuing to look for accretive acquisitions, we obviously cannot comment on when or if we expect to close the transaction. We reiterate that consummating an accretive acquisition remains a top priority for the company. I want to stress that we're very thoughtful on our process as we evaluate targets against the matrix of criteria, including being accretive to our revenue, being positive contributor to our bottom line, as well as representing a good value for our shareholders."", 'Kara Jenny', 'Great. Jason, back to you to close out the presentation.', 'Jason Katz', ""Thank you, everyone, for your support and for joining us today. We're very grateful for your interest in our business. We look forward to updating the market and our stockholders with our progress on our business objectives, pending patent litigation against Cisco WebEx with the trial now scheduled to start on April 8, 2024, and potential strategic accretive acquisitions, which we continue to identify and analyze. Have a great day."", 'Operator', ""Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day.

That effort has resulted in nearly a 50 percent gain in sales due to offering more “on-trend” merchandise and additional technology offerings, according to Kaleigh Bisconti, program lead for the Cisco Store. Pop-ups that would be open to the public are being considered, and the company has staged some at Cisco events such as “Cisco Live.”', 'Declining to identify any of the apparel retailers that have visited, she said big-box stores, department stores and other retailers with 1,000-plus locations have toured the store, as well as executives from other retail sectors. “When people come to our stores, they can understand how things work and they can think about how that applies to their spaces.”', 'For example, visitors can get a better understanding of how the latest Meraki cloud-managed smart cameras can be used for native engagement mapping, people counting and better quality of being able to see what’s happening in the stores. The cameras can be used to map engagement zones to see which collections are getting the most attention in-store. There are also ship-to-home stations so that people can order online for at-home deliveries. Through EveryAngle, a vision AI specialist for retail analytics, Cisco culls demographics about in-store customers — in terms of gender and age range, as well as the conversion rate from online shoppers to in-store ones.', 'Acknowledging how many companies have employee merchandise stores and create merchandise, Bisconti said, “We’ve taken it to a new level where we look at ourselves as a competitive retailer amongst all of the retailers out there.”', 'However far-reaching that might sound, Cisco’s store generated $2.2 million in sales last year and this year’s sales are tracking 25 percent ahead of last year, Bisconti said. Cisco employees and clients are generating that revenue.', 'As of now, there aren’t any plans for freestanding stores, but consumers can shop online or schedule appointments with Cisco account managers to tour its home office store. “Our customers are shopping at everyday retailers and to them, the Cisco store is no different. It doesn’t matter that we’re a corporate merchandise store. They expect to see cool things that are on trend with what they see when they are out shopping,” Bisconti said.', 'The merchandise is cooked up by Bisconti, who handles the trend reporting and previously worked in that field, and her team with Cisco’s internal creative agency “The Hatch.” The next collection, which will be released in June, was inspired by the quiet luxury trend and will have a minimalist feel. No longer limited to Cisco logo apparel, the offerings expanded last year to include graphics patterns that signal what Cisco is doing for sustainability and diversity.', 'When the company staged a Travel Store, if a customer picked up Cisco’s sustainability T-shirt, the camera detected that and sent a signal that triggered a nearby screen to play the company’s sustainability campaign. The aim is to create more engaging experiences to encourage customers to come into stores versus shopping online, Bisconti said. ', 'In keeping with Cisco’s “powering an inclusive future for all,” the company has sourced goods from sustainability-minded and purpose-driven companies like AS Colour, a member of the Better Cotton Initiative and supporter of the women’s empowerment organization Reemi, as well as Fill It Forward, which has a charitable component. The Cisco store also practices conservation in terms of WiFi and electrical power.', 'That being what it is, polo shirts are the most popular item — thanks largely to Cisco’s sales force, who like to wear them on the job. Backpacks are also in demand, given how transient workers are in the fast-paced tech industry.', 'With crime increasingly a concern for major retailers, Cisco’s Meraki cameras can be used for theft prevention, due to such features as “Smart Search,” which can visually track when an item is moved in a store. Merakis are what Cisco uses for surveillance and it has set up panic buttons on its registers should anything untoward happen. Sales associates can hit the button to notify security and seek assistance. An image from the time that the button was pushed will also be transmitted, Bisconti said.', 'The combination of EveryAngle and Meraki cameras can detect any “sweethearting” at point of sale, as in if an item is placed in a shopping bag by a sales associate, but the customer is not charged for that item. More than anything, the Cisco stores are meant to show how much technology can help its retail customers, Bisconti said.
