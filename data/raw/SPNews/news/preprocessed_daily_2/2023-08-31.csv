You should consider the Schwab 1000 Index ETF (SCHK), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 10/11/2017.The fund is sponsored by Charles Schwab. It has amassed assets over $2.93 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.Blend ETFs usually hold a mix of growth and value stocks as well as stocks that exhibit both value and growth characteristics.CostsCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.05%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.41%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 27.40% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 6.76% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon Com Inc (AMZN).The top 10 holdings account for about 27.26% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSCHK seeks to match the performance of the Schwab 1000 Index before fees and expenses. The Schwab 1000 Index is a float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that includes the 1,000 largest stocks of publicly traded companies in the United States, with size being determined by market capitalization. The index is designed to be a measure of the performance of large- and mid-cap U.S. stocks.Story continuesThe ETF has gained about 18.11% so far this year and is up roughly 12.56% in the last one year (as of 08/30/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $34.56 and $44.27.The ETF has a beta of 1.02 and standard deviation of 18.60% for the trailing three-year period. With about 988 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab 1000 Index ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SCHK is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF has $353.22 billion in assets, SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF has $414.70 billion.

5,78687429-358e-3a09-8761-79bfdb257c81,SCHW,2023-08-31,Is Schwab Core Equity (SWANX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-core-equity-swanx-strong-110005993.html,1693393205,STORY,['SCHW'],"[Mutual Fund Equity Report fund seekers may want to consider taking a look at Schwab Core Equity (SWANX). SWANX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerSWANX finds itself in the Schwab Funds family, based out of San Francisco, CA. The Schwab Core Equity made its debut in June of 1996 and SWANX has managed to accumulate roughly $1.27 billion in assets, as of the most recently available information. A team of investment professionals is the fund's current manager.PerformanceInvestors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of 9.36%, and is in the bottom third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 11.62%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. The standard deviation of SWANX over the past three years is 17.02% compared to the category average of 18.07%. The standard deviation of the fund over the past 5 years is 18.64% compared to the category average of 18.97%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsThe fund has a 5-year beta of 0.98, so investors should note that it is hypothetically as volatile as the market at large. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&amp;P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. Over the past 5 years, the fund has a negative alpha of -2.33. This means that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, SWANX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.73% compared to the category average of 0.91%. From a cost perspective, SWANX is actually cheaper than its peers.This fund requires a minimum initial investment of $0, while there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.Bottom LineOverall, Schwab Core Equity ( SWANX ) has a neutral Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively weak performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, this fund looks like a somewhat average choice for investors right now.For additional information on the Mutual Fund Equity Report area of the mutual fund world, make sure to check out www.zacks.com/funds/mutual-funds.

There are slo concerns about the company's margins. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down the story.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: And also taking a look at Texas Instruments. They were hit with a downgrade from Bernstein this morning from market perform to underperform, citing the company's quote, ""Longer investment horizon,"" as it raises its spending. I mean, a lot of focus also on what we're looking at with gross margins. I mean, Rasgon saying that, look, it's likely headed towards a 60% level or worse in short order.So a lot of concern here coming out of that note and really wondering what the long-term plan is. And I think people are going to want to hear a lot more details before they sort of get behind this company at the moment. But looking at the numbers, it's at the lower end of the street as far as gross margins and revenues also taking a toll as well. So we're seeing this very, very cautious attitude around them over the past week. As we can see, they're down about 1.6%. But as we look at the past three months, it's been a roller coaster for them this summer.And you figure with back-to-school spending as well, perhaps they should see some pickup that will show up in their later-on earnings. But for now, really under pressure at the moment.BRAD SMITH: Are you talking about that TI-84 Plus Calculator? I love a shout-out for the good old graphing calculators out there. Look to shout-outs, though, as well or to call-outs from this note. They said the street models do not appear to contemplate the consequences of Texas Instruments plans, and gross margin expectations appear far too high for us. It seems highly likely to us that gross margins are headed towards the 60% level in short order or worse, well below current expectations here.So that alluding to part of what you were saying a moment ago, Rachelle, and they went on to say we're not suggesting Texas Instruments is wrong or bad in their strategy. They just have a longer investment horizon than most other companies. However horizon also likely longer than many investors have as well here.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly. Top 5 Upgrades: Goldman Sachs upgraded PDD Holdings (PDD) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $129, up from $99, following what the firm calls a ""significant"" Q2 earnings beat, driven mostly from domestic online ad revenue being up 50% year-over-year.Citi upgraded Sunrun (RUN) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $21, down from $25. While headwinds from higher interest rates and net energy metering impacts appear to be largely priced into the shares, Sunrun is not getting due credit for its market share gains from third party owner shift, path to free cash flow generation, no corporate level equity raises, projected component cost deflation, and success in selling battery storage, the firm says.Scotiabank upgraded UDR (UDR) to Outperform from Sector Perform with a price target of $45, up from $44. The firm sees a relative valuation discount in UDR shares that ""offers an attractive entry point.""Compass Point upgraded Hercules Capital (HTGC) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $17.50, up from $17. Hercules raised $108M in fresh capital through a syndicated equity offering of 6.5M shares in early August and the ""only reason to do a syndicated equity offering is that originations are accelerating faster than expected,"" the firm notes.JPMorgan upgraded Cemig (CIG) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of R$16, up from R$14.50. The firm believes state-owned utilities controlled by the state of Minas Gerais are being mispriced by the market. Top 5 Downgrades:Bernstein downgraded Texas Instruments (TXT) to Underperform from Market Perform with an unchanged price target of $145. The firm says Street models do not appear to contemplate the consequences of Texas Instruments' capex and inventory plans. TD Cowen downgraded Ambarella (AMBA) to Market Perform from Outperform with a price target of $65, down from $90, following the Q2 report. The company announced ""another hard expectation cut"" as customer inventory burn accelerates, leaving Ambarella with little visibility in the near and intermediate term, the firm notes.Craig-Hallum downgraded Box (BOX) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $30, down from $35. Growth at Box is slowing to a halt as customers continue to lower their rate of seat expansion, the firm says.Morgan Stanley downgraded Centene (CNC) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $73, down from $94. The firm has lowered confidence in the visibility and stability of the company's long term earnings growth profile. Barclays downgraded Rockwell Automation (ROK) to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $287, down from $300. The company has attractive end market exposures and an un-levered balance sheet, but the stock's valuation is ""quite rich"" after rallying 20% year-to-date, the firm argues.Top 5 Initiations: WestPark Capital initiated coverage of Palo Alto Networks (PANW) with a Buy rating and $340 price target. The firm believes Palo Alto is ""leaving competitors far behind"" and that the company's growing scale will provide additional competitive benefits versus smaller point solutions.HSBC initiated coverage of Align Technology (ALGN) with a Buy rating and $450 price target. The firm believes the dental market is under-penetrated, with an addressable size of $20B and a solid growth profile, and says ageing demographics and consumer spending patterns are long- and mid-term drivers of growth.Citi initiated coverage of Cognex (CGNX) with a Neutral rating and $52 price target. The firm says softer near-term demand trends across most of the company's end markets and its ""still relatively elevated"" valuation could keep shares relatively range-bound in the near-term.B. Riley initiated coverage of AZZ Inc. (AZZ) with a Buy rating and $64 price target.  The firm believes the company has ""several compelling investment attributes,"" including the durability of cash flows, a leading position in its respective markets, and disciplined capital allocation.Janney Montgomery Scott initiated coverage of BCB Bancorp (BCBP) with a Buy rating and $18.50 fair value estimate. The traditional lender focused on commercial lending, not thrift-related assets, in Northern New Jersey is an ""inexpensive community bank"" that currently trades at a 30% discount to tangible book value, or TBV, per share, the firm tells investors.]"

The agreement includes sharing essential due diligence information within the confines of these confidentiality agreements. The primary goal is to establish an equitable and competitive process that maximizes value for the shareholders, concurrently reducing potential risks linked with the execution of various transactions.The letter, jointly penned by Chairman David Sutherland and CEO David Burritt, outlines the company's plan to share due diligence information as it delves deeper into these unsolicited proposals. With transparency as a cornerstone, U.S. Steel is committed to involving its board and external advisors in thoroughly evaluating all available options. Crucially, the company's intent to make this review process public is seen as an open invitation for interested parties to contribute their perspectives.While a definite timeline for this process remains uncertain, U.S. Steel is committed to an expedited yet thorough evaluation. The company's emphasis on the swift movement of its board, management team and external advisors reflects its seriousness in completing this review efficiently.One of the prominent players in this acquisition landscape is Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. CLF, which has made a substantial $7.3 billion cash-and-stock offer. Last week, a bid fromprivately-held steel company Esmark for U.S. Steel had fallen through, leaving ArcelorMittal SA MT as the sole known contender, apart from Cleveland-Cliffs. With Esmark's withdrawal, the competitive landscape has narrowed, possibly indicating a head-to-head showdown in the acquisition race.U.S. Steel has strategically invested in state-of-the-art electric arc furnace steelmaking and finishing capabilities, alongside focusing on carbon footprint reduction.Story continuesU.S. Steel’s second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.92 per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.86.

For the second quarter, we delivered another strong performance. We grew revenue by 4% on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency, and we beat the expectations on our bottom line on a non-GAAP basis, driven by our disciplined execution of the PVH+ Plan, our long-term brand building growth plan. In the quarter, we again drove double-digit growth in our direct-to-consumer businesses with double-digit increases in both our stores and in our owned and operated e-commerce, which are the channels where we are able to impact the shopping experience the fastest. Our D2C business will increasingly create a halo for our brands that benefit the entire marketplace, and we are excited about the accelerated momentum we are building there. Looking ahead, we are increasing our full year outlook for our non-GAAP EPS guidance based on the confidence we have in our ability to execute the PVH+ Plan in the back half of the year. By focusing on what we can control for the full year 2023, we remain well positioned to deliver solid top line growth in addition to double-digit EPS growth. We have strong conviction in the long-term potential of our brands and business. And one of the ways we show it is through our share buybacks. In just the second quarter alone, we completed $200 million in buybacks, which was our initial plan for the full year. We are now planning to increase our buybacks for a total of up to $400 million for the full year. Independent of the macro climate, the PVH+ Plan, combined with our strong ability to execute, will enable us to drive profitable, long-term brand accretive growth, and geared towards our vision to build Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger into the most desirable lifestyle brands in the world and made PVH one of the highest-performing brand groups in our sector. Each of the 5 key growth drivers of our PVH+ Plan plays an important role on its own. And when we make them play altogether, which we increasingly do, we create something really powerful. Let me bring this to life across both brands with a few examples of how we are activating our consumer-facing growth drivers to win with product, win with consumer engagement and win in the digitally led marketplace. First, within Tommy, the team is doing a lot of exciting work around our talent amplification, which is starting to create a flywheel effect across product and consumer engagement, all the way through commercial impact. For Q2, the team connected our most iconic Tommy products like the Polo shirt, the Oxford shirt and the chinos with the network of the most influential talent [at some of the] spring and summer's biggest cultural events, ranging from New York Fashion Week to Formula 1 Grand Prix around the world to really cut through in the marketplace. One example where the team executed this really well was with a focused activation with talent toward our iconic Oxford shirt, styled in their unique way at the Tommy New York Fashion Week dinner and Formula 1 Grand Prix in Miami, and they then engage their own audiences through personal and authentic social content, which in turn drove significant engagement on our channels and ultimately drove traffic into our stores and e-commerce.And through the network effect of this initiative, the brand drove triple-digit increases in sales of the Oxford shirt, which were up nearly 170% in the week following our campaign. In parallel to this, our talent partnerships continue to gain momentum in the quarter as part of the launch of our Mercedes-AMG Formula 1 and Awake collaboration, we rolled out dedicated activations across Europe and the U.S., including a launch event in Miami with super talent like Lewis Hamilton. In addition, retail activations were held across Europe with personal appearances by George Russell in Budapest and Lewis Hamilton in Milan. Approximately 70% of Mercedes-AMG Formula 1 fans, named the Tommy Hilfiger Awake collaboration as the most exciting and memorable partner content of the weekend, with half of fans highlighting they are much more likely to consider purchasing Tommy Hilfiger as a result of seeing the collaboration. And to cap it off, with super relevant timing, we are leveraging the sports rising popularity to connect on new levels with our customers, boosted by Netflix's Drive to Survive and our recently announced Formula 1 film sponsorship featuring Brad Pitt and Damson Idris.So what you can see here from these Tommy examples is how we leverage the unique strength of our iconic Tommy brand, combined with very engaged long-term ambassadors who love the brand, then we supercharged everything by connecting it all to culturally relevant global events to really cut through in the marketplace. This is a systematic and repeatable approach, but we are only just in the beginning to tap into.So looking ahead, we will continue to build out this work, starting with Tommy's fall campaign, which is right now underway, featuring seasonally relevant key categories and iconic American families. Let me now share a few Calvin Klein examples. The Calvin Klein brand is continuing to generate historically high levels of impact and engagement with our consumers in all key global markets, propelled by our strategy of launching cut-through campaigns and igniting the talent engine. And in May, the brand launched a highly successful collaboration with Jennie Kim, sold through globally within days. They also launched an exciting partnership with some of the world's most iconic female athletes ahead of the much viewed World Cup. Across the quarter, this strategy generated a significant PR and social reach. Specifically, in Q2, the Calvin Klein influencer engine was ignited by brand ambassadors, including Jennie Kim, Kendall Jenner, Jungkook, Kid Cudi and more. These digital first campaign initiatives drove a stunning 828 million social impressions and 770 million PR impressions, both up significantly versus last year. Calvin added 1.7 million new followers to Instagram and now has well over 1.5 million followers on TikTok. The brand recently launched its fall 2023 campaign, highlighting iconic underwear, denim. And in the first time in many years, more refined sportswear products that we know our Calvin Klein consumers really love. When looking specifically at Calvin product progress, and we have a lot of progress coming there, as we focus on winning with the best product in the market, our teams have created the best global hero products for men's and women's that will be consistent across global assortments, which together with core essentials will account for 20% of SKUs and a much bigger share of the total sales from the fall '24 season and onwards. We're also accelerating innovation within our core product categories. For example, in underwear, we're bringing new fabrication platforms and performance elements into established programs, such as the iconic modern cotton. Just like in the example from Tommy, Calvin is fueling a very strong product category focus, creating the best hero products in the market than engaging their long-term talent partnerships and combining both to cut through in the marketplace.In parallel to improving the consumer-facing growth drivers, we're also committed to develop a demand and data-driven supply chain for both brands, and we are making a significant progress here. Our supply chain improvements continue to accelerate and will provide us with drastically improved inventory to sales ratio over the coming years. With much higher on-time and accuracy in deliveries, shorter transportation lead times, more responsive production models and more data-driven planning tools across our supply chain, we are now targeting a 25% decrease of our inventory levels as percent of sales. This decrease will be accomplished progressively as we move through the balance of this year and throughout 2024.And the exciting part with this is that we will be able to do this while at the same time, improving product availability for our consumers across channels and geographies. Importantly, this will significantly improve our ability to match inventory to demand, one of the highest value drivers in our business. There are several additional positive outcomes of this, including improving our cash flow and capital employed ratio from a financial perspective and even more importantly, reduce the pressure on operational cost of our logistics infrastructure.Lastly, as we are investing to fuel growth, we remain focused on driving cost efficiencies, enabling us to reinvest in the key growth drivers I just took you all through. During the quarter, we took the concrete actions we have previously shared in rightsizing our organization to simplify how we work, allow us to get even closer to the consumer and increase speed in our decision-making. Now turning to our regional performance and how we are connecting our brands and executing the PVH+ Plan across each region.Let me start with Europe. We continue to intensify our execution of the PVH+ Plan to further strengthen our market position in the region. For the second quarter, we delivered high single-digit year-over-year growth on a reported basis and low single-digit growth in euros. Our European business is now nearly 30% larger than pre-pandemic levels in euros. For the quarter, we drove strong performance in our direct-to-consumer business, where we continue to focus our efforts around elevating the consumer experience.For Tommy, through our hero product focus, we drove success in our key categories, like the shirt category, which was tied to impactful summer marketing programs around key essentials. We also continue to reinforce our key product categories by leaning into our top performers, such as the 1985 Program. And at the same time, continuously evolving our essential product programs across men's, women's and kid's.And for Calvin in Europe, we are further sharpening our hero product focus and exciting with newness across categories. We are deepening our hero product offer and lifestyle expansion with cut-through marketing, while at the same time, creating brand heat for exclusive product activations in power cities like London, Paris, Milan.A notable highlight for the region in Q2 was the grand opening of the Tommy Hilfiger store in Rome, Italy. It's our first ever owned and operated store in the city, situated on Via del Corso, Rome's prime and best shopping street at the heart of the Italian capital.Looking ahead, our forward wholesale order book for the spring 2024 season on a constant currency basis is expected to increase low single digits on top of very strong high single-digit growth this past year as accounts remain conservative. And as we have mentioned before, we are well positioned to capitalize on stronger demand in season through our never-out-of-stock programs. Moving on to Asia Pacific. The region continues to deliver very strong performance by engaging consumers with product campaign launches and driving brand heat with locally relevant talent, underpinned by our hero product strategy, which generated double-digit increases at higher gross margins.Our strong execution drove revenue growth of 16% in the second quarter on a constant currency basis, including over 20% growth in China in local currency and continued strong double-digit growth in Japan and Korea. We drove very strong e-commerce performance of nearly 25% growth in constant currency as we successfully captured key consumer moments, including 618. During the holiday, both brands moved up the rankings on digital platforms and achieved live streaming records of over 10 million.Newer digital platforms, such as Douyin continue to drive engagement. Looking ahead, we will continue to supercharge e-commerce and are gearing up for major consumer moments such as Double 11 and the Year of the Dragon with exclusive product capsules. We are driving consumer excitement with product-led campaigns featuring regionally relevant and [globally impactful] talent such as Jennie and Jungkook for Calvin to expand brand awareness in the region. In China alone, we are leveraging more than 100 talent catalysts to amplify Calvin Klein hero product storytelling. And for Tommy for fall, we are looking forward to introducing new brand ambassadors as part of the global campaign.We're also seeing proof points in Japan as international tourists are starting to rebound. We recently refit our Tommy Omotesando flagship store in best location in Tokyo, which has generated strong improvements in sales with our central business growing plus 70% versus last year. By leaning into the core growth drivers of the PVH+ Plan in Asia, we continue to have major untapped growth potential for both our brands by tapping into the underpenetrated brand awareness in China and across the region.Turning to our business in North America. We continue to strengthen our North America PVH+ Plan execution across both brands, led by our direct-to-consumer businesses, which increased mid-single digits across Tommy and Calvin, driven by much stronger execution across all key elements of the PVH+ Plan.We have also enhanced experience and performance of our owned and operated e-commerce businesses, and we drove double-digit growth there. All this drove significantly improved profitability across the North America businesses in the quarter. And we are gaining very good traction in building a sustainable foundation for profitable brand accretive growth for the region. We're driving increased product strength with pricing power and improving the overall consumer experience and marketplace execution.Beyond D2C, we continue to drive progress with key wholesale partners, working very closely with them to improve our brand's presentation in top doors and drive consumer demand by sharpening our category offense and leaning into our hero products and securing the inventory we need to fuel that demand.Let me share some important proof points, which highlights how our efforts to build our brands and businesses in North America are driving positive results. First, we are advancing our category offense with a reestablished base of key essentials and hero products that resonate strongly with our domestic consumer and driving growth across Tommy and Calvin stores as well as e-commerce sites.At wholesale, while our partners are more conservatively managing their business in a choppy macro, we are building a much stronger business with key partners such as Macy's. In fact, for Tommy Indoors where we have strategically increased investments behind the brand to improve the consumer experience and inventory availability on the floor, we generated high single-digit growth versus the prior year.Also for Tommy, we drove over 20% year-over-year increases in key categories such as tees, woven shirts, underscoring the success of our global best seller initiative that we have scaled over the last year in D2C and now scaling in wholesale. Polos were once again the #1 category, up over 30% year-over-year with higher AURs as we are elevating these key essentials. For Calvin, core premium essentials in D2C were the standout, up nearly 30%. And as we have done with Tommy, we have expanded this initiative to wholesale where the performance has also been strong.Similarly, we also drove double-digit growth in refined product in D2C as well as continue to strengthen our offering in performance, very well received by the consumer, and we will further expand both these areas as we move forward. Operationally across the regions, we have made significant progress with our delivery times, now shorter than pre-pandemic levels.Lastly, with respect to bringing our North America women's business back from G-III, we have made very strong progress, and we're in a great place with a multiyear integration work, both related to product development and the sourcing aspects needed, and we are working very closely with our wholesale partners on co-creating the take-back plan.Looking ahead in North America, we continue to focus our efforts around the domestic consumer to drive the business forward and see significant opportunity to unlock our full potential in the region.And before I close the Americas section, I would like to take a moment to address the recent wildfires in Maui, where we operated a Calvin Klein store that was completely destroyed in the fire. All our team members are safe, luckily, our hearts go out to our Lahaina team and the entire Maui community. We are doing everything we can to make sure our associates, their families and the broader community have the support they need during this incredibly difficult time.In closing, we executed another strong quarter. I feel very good about how well our teams continue to deliver on our long-term PVH+ growth plan with a relentless focus on driving brand desirability for both Calvin and Tommy, where we connect a very strong product (inaudible), highly engaging marketing with a winning marketplace execution. We are encouraged by our results, particularly our continued strong growth in D2C. And we are looking forward to tapping into the more than 90% of potential that still lies ahead of us.With half of the year behind us, the other half still to go, we will continue our disciplined execution and successfully navigate this choppy macro environment as we have done so far, all while keeping our eyes locked on the long-term opportunity ahead of us to build Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger into the most desirable lifestyle brands in the world and make us one of the highest performing brand groups in our sector.And with that, I'll turn the call over to Zac.Zachary James CoughlinThanks, Stefan, and good morning. My comments are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. As Stefan discussed, we are pleased with our strong results for the second quarter, driven by our iconic brands and disciplined execution of the PVH+ Plan. We continue to build on our track record of strong performance, delivering on our top line guidance while exceeding bottom line guidance as we compete to win in this highly dynamic global environment.We delivered reported revenue growth of 4% for the quarter, with constant currency revenue growth of 2%, in line with our guidance, and we exceeded our earnings guidance with earnings per share of $1.98, driven by lower expenses and a lower tax rate. Additionally, we returned $200 million to shareholders during the second quarter through the repurchase of 2.4 million shares of common stock, which was earlier than planned and enabled by our strong balance sheet.Importantly, our inventory levels at quarter end are well positioned, up 6% compared to last year and fully aligned with our projected sales growth. And as Stefan mentioned, with the significant progress we are making to deliver a demand and data-driven supply chain, we now expect our inventory levels to be significantly lower than 2022 in the second half of 2023, and that improvement will continue through 2024 with our announced 25% reduction in inventory as a percentage of sales.As we look forward to the rest of the year, we expect our strong first half performance to continue into the second half. And as a result, our full year business outlook remains largely unchanged. We are reaffirming our full year revenue guidance and operating margin outlook and raising our non-GAAP EPS outlook to a record $10.35.In addition to the continued strong delivery of our plan, the improvement in EPS is driven by 2 main factors: an increase in share buybacks and a decreased tax rate. On the share buybacks, we are increasing our planned buybacks from $200 million previously up to $400 million. This supports our conviction in the execution of the PVH+ Plan and its long-term value creation as well as our priority to deliver shareholder value. For the tax rate, our outlook for our full year rate is decreasing from approximately 24% to approximately 22%. This is another step towards our multiyear commitment to deliver a sustainable rate in the low 20s.While our revised outlook reflects our growing confidence in our second half plan, we are also continuing to plan for 2023 with a healthy balance of optimism and prudence. I will now discuss our second quarter results in more detail and then move on to our outlook. Revenue was up 4% for the quarter, which reflected a 2% positive impact from exchange.Second quarter revenue for our international business was up a strong 6% on a constant currency basis, with growth in both Asia Pacific and Europe. Revenues for Asia Pacific were up 12% on a reported basis, including a 4% negative impact from exchange, led by China, where revenues in local currency were up over 20% compared to last year. Revenue in our European business was up low single digits in euros, in line with our expectations, driven by strong growth in the direct-to-consumer business.In North America, our focus remains on driving strength in the direct-to-consumer business. We delivered another quarter of growth in both our retail stores and owned and operated digital commerce business with total DTC up mid-single digits and importantly, another quarter of improvement in sales to domestic consumers compared to the prior year. We were especially pleased with the double-digit growth we drove in our digital commerce business in both brands as the investments we have made in the platform and overall site experience have begun to resonate with consumers. Wholesale sales in North America were down as planned, primarily in our Calvin Klein business as retailers continue to take a cautious approach and we focus on driving sell-through and healthy inventory across the channel.From a channel perspective, we continue to drive strong performance across all regions in our direct-to-consumer businesses, where we have the closest connection to our consumer and can deliver the PVH+ Plan with greatest impact. We delivered another quarter of strong growth in both our stores and our owned and operated digital commerce business with constant currency revenues up 10% and 11%, respectively, compared to last year. Our total DTC revenue was up 10% on a constant currency basis in the quarter and up approximately 350 basis points as a percentage of our total revenue compared to last year.Wholesale revenue was down 6% on a constant currency basis as retailers continue to take a cautious approach, specifically in the U.S. On a reported basis, DTC revenue was up 11% and wholesale revenue was down 3%.Our global brands also continued to deliver solid growth, with Tommy Hilfiger revenues up 6% and Calvin Klein revenues up 3% as reported, driven by our hyper focus on investing to drive consumer engagement. As Stefan described in depth earlier, across both brands, we work with culturally relevant global talent and influencers like Jennie Kim and Lewis Hamilton to authentically connect consumers to our iconic hero products and through some of the biggest events like New York Fashion Week, F1 Grand Prix and the World Cup and drove significant engagement and demand for the brands. On a constant currency basis, revenue for both brands was up low single digits.In the second quarter, we delivered gross margin of 57.6%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to last year despite a 120 basis point negative impact to product costs due to exchange. Gross margin reflects a significant favorable shift in mix with our higher gross margin DTC and international businesses making up a larger portion of total revenue and a favorable impact from freight compared to the prior year, consistent with the first quarter as we used virtually no airfreight this quarter.While we did experience a benefit from planned price increases, this was more than offset by higher product costs, including the negative impact of exchange previously mentioned and the full impact of abnormally high raw material costs in effect when orders were placed in the latter half of 2022 as that inventory sold through during this quarter.Raw material costs have improved in 2023 and will benefit our gross margins as we move through the second half of the year and especially in 2024. SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenue for the second quarter was better than planned at 49.4%, largely due to timing of expenses between the second and third quarter. We continue to make targeted investments to fuel growth throughout the quarter to drive the PVH+ Plan, including an increase in marketing compared to the prior year. SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenue was approximately 210 basis points higher than last year, reflecting the impact of the shift in mix to our DTC and international businesses, along with a planned increase in the investments mentioned earlier.In total, EBIT for the quarter was $182 million, exceeding our expectations. Operating margin was 8.3%, which included the 120 basis point negative impact of exchange on our gross margin. Earnings per share was $1.98 compared to $2.08 in last year's second quarter and exceeded our guidance by $0.28 with approximately half of that beat driven by the improvement in [EBIT I] discussed earlier and the other half driven by a lower tax rate. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 22%.We continue to work relentlessly to drive results. Our strong second quarter performance is a testament to the power of our 2 iconic global brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, our systematic progress toward developing a demand and data-driven operating model and driving cost efficiencies to enable us to invest in brand-building growth.And now moving on to our outlook. For the full year, we are reaffirming our revenue and operating margin guidance and raising our EPS guidance by $0.35 from approximately $10 to approximately $10.35. We continue to project revenue to increase by 3% to 4% as reported and 2% to 3% on a constant currency basis and operating margin for the year to be approximately 10%.Regionally, our outlook for Europe is unchanged, planned up low single digits in euros. Asia Pacific is now planned up low teens compared to previously up low double digits with broad-based growth in the region, led by China, where easing of COVID restrictions has led to a strong rebound in demand for both brands.In North America, we are now planning full year revenue down low single digits compared to previously up low single digits, which reflects a more tempered outlook on the improvement in the international tourist traffic in our U.S. stores for the balance of the year based on continued trends. Our second half outlook for our North America business is otherwise unchanged as we continue to expect strong growth in our owned and operated digital commerce business and the current wholesale trends to continue for the remainder of 2023.We continue to expect our full year gross margin rate to increase over 100 basis points compared to 2022 despite approximately 100 basis points of higher cost due to exchange. The improvement in our gross margin reflects an approximately 100 basis point benefit from a favorable shift in channel and regional mix as we continue to drive growth in our higher-margin DTC business in line with our PVH+ Plan strategies and our DTC and international businesses make up a larger portion of total revenue.And as we've indicated previously, we can say with confidence that we will deliver approximately 100 basis points of improvement due to lower freight costs, a combination of both significantly lower airfreight spend and a decrease of over 50% in ocean freight rates, both of which are an outcome of the significant improvements we've driven in stabilizing our supply chain. We expect gross margin improvement to grow an impact in each of the third and fourth quarters.We continue to expect that SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenue for the full year will increase approximately 70 basis points compared to 2022, with our investments in DTC and mix of international business driving higher expenses. Additionally, as we discussed last quarter, we continue to invest in key areas that drive growth, including increased levels of marketing with our full year target at approximately 6% of revenue for the year compared to approximately 5.5% last year.We've also made significant progress in our plans to implement the people cost actions we have shared previously. With the actions taken in July and additional actions planned in the third quarter, we will have completed our target 10% people cost reduction in our global offices by the end of the third quarter, earlier than initially planned with an initial cost savings ahead of our targeted $100 million of savings net of strategic people investments.Our full year operating margin projection continues to be approximately 10% and reflects high single-digit percentage EBIT growth. Interest expense is projected to be approximately $100 million, and our tax rate for the year is projected to be approximately 22% versus approximately 24% previously.We are confident in the strength of the PVH+ Plan and our ability to execute in the back half of the year. And as such, for the full year 2023, we are now increasing our non-GAAP earnings per share projection to approximately $10.35, up 15% compared to 2022 and a record high for PVH. Turning to the third quarter. Our overall revenue is in line with original plans and is projected to increase mid-single digits as reported and low single digits on a constant currency basis compared to last year.Third quarter earnings per share is projected to be approximately $2.70 compared to $2.60 in the prior year. As I mentioned, gross margin improvement in the third quarter is expected to grow an impact as the benefits we realized in the second quarter continue, including an even greater benefit from freight as we realize the full impact of lower ocean rates and the impact of abnormally high raw material costs begin to ease.We are also planning higher SG&amp;A investments in the third quarter with a particular focus again on marketing, where our spend is planned to increase approximately 20% versus last year as we invest in cut-through brand campaigns that ignite our talent and influencer engine globally and elevate the brands across consumer touch points, driving our continued momentum for the rest of the year. Our tax rate for the third quarter is estimated at approximately 22% and interest expense is projected to be approximately $25 million.Before we open it up for questions, I want to reiterate that we are pleased with another strong quarter. As Stefan talked about earlier, we are laser-focused on delivering our commitments by executing the 5 key growth drivers of the PVH+ Plan, bringing together the consumer-facing value drivers of product, consumer engagement and marketplace with the underlying operating engines and delivering consistent results in a systemic and repeatable way.And with that, operator, we would like to open it up to questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim.Robert Scott DrbulJust a couple of questions for you. On North America, can you just elaborate a bit more just on the traction that you are gaining in North America, especially an update on the profitability? And then I guess the second question around North America is just some of the commentary you made around U.S. wholesale. Can you just expand a little bit more in terms of what you're seeing in your assumptions into the back half of the year on the U.S. wholesale business?Stefan LarssonWell, thanks, Bob. What's really exciting for us to see and to share this quarter is that the critically important work that we started a year ago to build this sustainable, strong foundation for brand accretive growth in our home market, both Calvin and Tommy be loved in America. We haven't put enough focus on the domestic consumer.So as part of PVH+, we put laser focus on building this sustainable foundation. And as we have mentioned through the quarters, we have seen under-the-surface improvement, but this is a pivotal quarter because you can all see it. And starting with Calvin and Tommy, both driving mid-single-digit growth in D2C in a very choppy macro. And we're driving this growth, both in stores and in e-commerce. And it's directly driven by the PVH+ execution in product, marketing and the marketplace execution.So what do we see? We see that AURs are up. We see that the gross margin rate is up. We see that through the simplification of how we work and get things done, we see that [the] flow through in EBIT rate improvements, and Zac will be able to take you through a little bit more details on that. But it's really a pivotal moment where you now see the proof points that we have been working on over the past year. And mentioning a little bit more about how we do this from a PVH+ perspective.Because across both Calvin and Tommy, we start with leveraging the strength and the brand love for the brands. Then we build out category offense and best hero products. And you can see in Tommy, this quarter, the global bestsellers drove 20% growth. And this is -- again, in these market conditions, 20% growth. And in Calvin, the premium essentials drove 20% growth as well.So we see that the category offense and the hero products are paying off, resonating really well with the consumer. And then we have gotten better and better on connecting the brand and the products with the talent partnerships that we are building out. So we are building out long-term talent partnerships where we have talent amplifying our products, amplifying our brands, and then we connect the product -- the brand, the products, the talent with big events that are culturally relevant, whether it's New York Fashion Week or its Formula 1 in Miami.So we are starting to create a flywheel with bringing the brands to life closer to their full potential. And then -- so that's the consumer-facing brand desirability improvements. But then we combine that with the underlying business engine. So as I shared in my prepared remarks, what's really exciting is that this quarter, we're also able to take a big next step towards a demand-driven supply chain.So think about it, we're setting out to drive higher growth with 25% lower inventory. And then you might ask, how is that possible? Well, it comes back to 3 things. It comes back to the category focus, the hero product focus, the increased discipline in how we build the assortment and then how we plan that closer to demand, we're cutting our lead times and then how we improve the allocations.So you have the consumer-facing improvements and then you have this underlying business engine. And then on top of that, you have the efficiencies and the simplification of how we do the work. And that is what you start to see now in the P&amp;L. So Zac, if you want to complement that?Zachary James CoughlinYes. I mean a significant step-up in profitability for both Tommy and Calvin (inaudible) in North Americas, greater than 6% in Tommy, greater than 8% in Calvin. I think what we love about that result is how widespread that improvement was, improvement across both brands, improvement across all channels, across both brands and higher gross margin percent and stronger SG&amp;A management. So really a widespread step forward. So mid- to high single digits is really only the first step in our commitment towards low teens, but it's an important one and a sizable one this quarter.Stefan LarssonYes. Thanks, Zac. And Bob, when it comes to U.S. wholesale, we know that the channel is choppy and challenged. But what's exciting under the surface here, again, is that when we lean in with our most important partners like Macy's, and we focus on bringing PVH+ to life for Calvin and Tommy together, we see some really encouraging results. So this past quarter, as we mentioned, we were able to drive significant growth in the pilot doors in the doors where the top doors where we execute the category offense secure products, we have the inventory.We have the vendor. We work with Macy's to have more staffing on the floor. So we treat it more as the best expression of our stores. And then we see immediately the performance driving. So it's another proof point that over the next few quarters, we will build out together with our best wholesale partner.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Jay Sole with UBS.Jay Daniel SoleGreat. Stefan, I'm interested in your comments on delivery times improving, the inventory reduction you're talking about, you just mentioned simplification. Can you maybe just talk about the developments in the supply chain side of the PVH+ Plan over the last 90 days and give us such an idea about how that part of the plan is trending and what you're seeing there and how you're getting some of these improvements that you're talking about?Stefan LarssonYes, absolutely. Thanks, Jay. So let's just start with -- we really strengthened our supply chain leadership when David joined us with his H&amp;M Group experience. And he was able to work with our strong team to just get them more focused on -- get us more focused on getting the basics right to start with on-time delivery, shorter transportation lead times, more responsive production solutions and models, more data-driven planning tools.And in doing that work, like -- and this is my experience, having deep experience in the supply chain side is you have to get the foundational pieces right, then you have to work super closely upstream with the product creation teams. And once you have that done, which we got done sooner than expected, then we started looking at what could be a next breakthrough step. And then we realized that, that breakthrough is much closer than what we expected. So that's what enabled us to set the target of 25% less inventory in relation to sales by the end of 2024. And we are already internally driving to [our staff].And that comes back to what I mentioned earlier. It's just -- it starts with how we plan the assortment, how we build the assortment and having an intention behind every single product and then connecting that to better demand planning and then connecting that to better allocation. And we see some part of the D2C growth in North America right now is fueled by that better planning and that better allocation.But we're just in the beginning, but the 25% is significant. And if you look at the value creation potential is that it's real. And then you look at even the sustainability component of -- instead of running the business with too much inventory at any given time that most do in our sector, we're able to get much better match between what we create, plan and produce is actually much closer to what the consumer wants. So yes, very exciting.OperatorWe'll take our next question from [Ike Boruchow] with Wells Fargo.Unidentified AnalystThis is Robert on behalf of Ike. Just had a quick question on -- do you have [any reads] on your fall product by brand?Stefan LarssonYes. Thanks, Rob. So early days for fall, but positive response. So both Zac and I mentioned that we are in great shape inventory-wise. And there are 2 perspectives -- 2 dimensions of inventory. One is the level. So we're in great shape across the brands and across regions when it comes to the levels. We're also in great shape when it comes to the composition.So we all know that it's so important in our sector to have fresh inventory too, when you start the fall season to have more full see some product, more fresh products this year than what we had last year, and that's exactly where we are. And then we look at the initial sell-through [reads of] fall and positive across both brands, all regions, early, but very positive.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Chris Nardone with Bank of America.Christopher Michael NardoneI wanted to talk a little bit more about some of the moving pieces in SG&amp;A. First, if you could talk about the cadence and when we should start recognizing the $100 million in net savings. I think you actually said it might be greater than that. And then secondly, in terms of marketing, is the 6% target this year a level where you feel comfortable over the medium term to drive towards your PVH+ targets? Or is there a need to continue to drift that percentage higher?Stefan LarssonYes. Thanks, Chris. So let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Zac. But from a cost efficiency perspective, what's most -- what's always been most important for us is to find the most simple, close to consumer way of working that gives us speed in decision-making. And that's what made us set out the initiative this year to rightsize the organization to the PVH+ Plan. And Zac will take you through more in detail how we executed on this.And that's going to be a continuous work for us to get closer to the consumer, to get faster because at the end of the day, we have the brands, we have the vision, we have the plan to win and outcompete our competition on medium, long term is our ability to execute. And most big companies get slow, gets bureaucratic. And that's -- I'm out a lot working with our teams to say, how can we work like a small company? How can we get the speed of when we are out seeing in stores what we need from the consumer? How can we cut the time in half to take action? So that's the beginning on the efficiency part.The second part is then connected to the marketing piece, which is investing into growth. So part of the efficiencies we free up is to invest in the growth. And marketing, the 20% increase in marketing, as Zac mentioned, it's -- we feel really good about that on the near term and medium term to your perspective because there is also a lot of effectiveness work we have to do in terms of how are we spending those investments.So are we spending them to cut through? Are we spending them in consumer-facing initiatives? Are we spending them in the talent? Are we spending them in the big events that we have to cut through? So it's both the investment levels that we are increasing, which I feel really good about. And then it's the effectiveness. And then we just continuously monitor to see that we are investing enough to cut through.Zachary James CoughlinYes. Thanks, Chris. I think we're really proud of the work we started last year on redefining how we spend SG&amp;A. So we've seen already in the first half of the year, significant investments in DTC, which comes with margin expansion and the marketing spend we've talked about, which we know comes to the benefits there.So as we look forward into the second half, we absolutely expect to continue on those investments of driving DTC growth and marketing (inaudible) investments. But to your point, on the other side of things, what starts to become an increasingly powerful impact is the work we've done on our previously committed 10% people cost reduction. So the program, we took some significant steps in the second quarter. We will finish the program in the third quarter. So a quarter early from what we had planned previously, and the impact is slightly ahead of the $100 million we've committed.So I think we'll see some impact of that in the third quarter. But in reality, we start to see that pick up most impactfully into fourth quarter, and then that will carry forward into how that annualizes for next year.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Paul Kearney with Barclays.Paul David KearneyGreat to see the progress in North America. A question on guidance. I think it was mentioned that the change in guidance was mostly driven from the lower tax and share repurchases. Given the supply chain improvements and finishing the SG&amp;A improvements a quarter early, just wondering whether you're seeing anything incremental offset this benefit in the back half? Or if it's just some conservatism on the demand side?Stefan LarssonThanks, Paul. So this is Stefan. Let me just start by saying we're able to take our guidance up because we continue to deliver what we said we were going to do from an operational standpoint of how we drive desirability in the brands and how we execute those in the marketplace.And then that leaves us to be able to invest back in the business and invest in growth. And that leads to -- that's the foundational strength that leads to us taking up the guidance. And then Zac, if you want to mention what it means in terms of our ability to -- because when that works really well, we are first investing back into growth. And then secondly, as we shared this quarter, we're able to invest back more into ourselves through the increased doubling of the share buyback.Zachary James CoughlinYes. I think the year continues to shape up nearly exactly as we had planned (inaudible) across all dimensions from there. So the small sort of puts and takes on the business. But -- so that's leading us with significant confidence. And I think if we take a look at the second half, really gaining confidence in our ability to drive the continued profitability improvements that we've got committed.On the increase side of things, 2 important impacts. One is on the share buybacks. And I think it's really important to comment on the value of that inventory improvement we're seeing that frees up working capital to turn around and invest in either other elements of the PVH+ Plan to drive growth or as we saw with the announcement we made on the share buybacks, a significant increase from $200 million to $400 million full year, including $200 million of share buybacks in the second quarter alone.And so as you mentioned, some of that work around inventory (inaudible) the plans, what that does is it frees up capital there to return back to shareholders. And the other half of that is the tax improvement from 24% to 22%. That increasing as well, representing the rest of the increase as we continue to work a tax rate down as we've committed to over the prior year.So I think overall, we feel great about where the operating business is coming in and what that sort of certainty is allowing us is to free up the capacity to return cash back to shareholders via the share buyback, and that's what's leading to the increase.Stefan LarssonOperator, we have time for one more question.OperatorThat question will come from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.Brooke Siler RoachStefan, I was hoping that you could elaborate a bit more on the outlook that you see for AUR and pricing opportunity as you balance the brand and product investments you're making as you develop a PVH+ Plan? And then secondly, Zac, can you remind us the opportunities that you see ahead to recapture some of the outsized promotions that you saw last holiday as you move into this holiday season?Stefan LarssonThanks, Brooke. So on the AUR side, it's exciting to see because I spend a lot of my time in product category, work and product category reviews and looking at product development and the pricing opportunity. So we have a significant AUR opportunity [all the] time, leaning into the category offense.And every time we lean into a category, every time we develop the best hero products in the market, better than our competition, we see an opportunity to sell through at a higher AUR. So very encouraged early days still. And that is something that, [all the time], we just continue to create better product value for the consumer.Zachary James CoughlinYes. And I think on the promotion side, Brooke, we, of course, will continue to participate actively in competing to win in the marketplace (inaudible) this is. But one of the reasons why we're so excited about where the inventory levels are today and will continue to improve throughout the back half of the year is that, that's going to allow us to make sure that we're able to ourselves practically make those choices. And I think we can think about annualizing what last year holiday season was. There was a lot of things in the industry on the other side of this. We will have the chance to choose whether to participate or not. And so we would expect to see gross margin improvement versus last year because of that strength of getting our inventories into the spot. We feel great about them heading into the back half of the year.Stefan LarssonThanks, Zac. And just to wrap up. So what we have is Tommy and Calvin, 2 unique -- absolutely unique and globally iconic brands. And what the PVH+ Plan is all about is us leaning into the DNA of each of these brands and drive brand desirability in product, marketing, marketplace and then at the same time, build out that underlying growth engine, business engine that enable us to build the brand and drive growth in an increasingly systematic repeatable way.So the real strength and the real value will come from the compounded effect of us doing this quarter after quarter, month after month, week after week, like consistent in direction, consistent in focus and just relentless in step by step by step. So thank you for being on this journey with us, and have a great week, everyone.OperatorThis concludes the PVH Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.]"

22,d2d338ea-608c-3f5e-8864-fe25defe295e,TMO,2023-08-31,3 Millionaire-Maker Robotics Stocks to Hold Through Thick and Thin,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-millionaire-maker-robotics-stocks-015425073.html,1692928465,STORY,"['ISRG', 'TMO', 'EMR']","[The world is becoming increasingly automated paving the way for robotics stocks moving forward. Sector growth is expected to reach double digits on an annualized basis and ranges from the low to mid-teens depending on the sourceIn either case, capital invested in the sector has a reasonable chance of increasing in value. The firms highlighted here are well-established companies with long track records. Thus, investors sacrifice some level of sheer return potential for stability. Investing through thick and thin – aka the long term – requires such a sacrifice. With enough time and sufficient capital, it’s entirely reasonable to assume that an investment in the companies below could grow to exceed $1 million in value.  So here are the best robotics stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) robotic arms over medical bed symbolizing medical roboticsSource: shutterstock.com/MAD.vertiseInvesting in Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is a very good example of what it means to stay with something through thick and thin. The company has seen dramatic shifts in demand for its devices and services over the past few years. The company is famous for its Da Vinci Surgical device but also for Ion Endoluminal systems. The emergence of the pandemic dealt a serious blow to the company. Suddenly, everyone was afraid to go to the hospital and that sent elective surgery demand plummeting. ISRG stock has gone up and down since. Here’s a simple argument in favor of investing for the long term. On Jan. 1, 2020, ISRG shares traded at $197.78. They now trade at $290 following several ups and downs. 2020 revenues declined at Intuitive Surgical. They’ve increased by double digits in almost every measurable period since. Da Vinci is the most prominent robot in the healthcare space. Its place is stable as is its underlying sector. That makes ISRG one of those strong robotics stocks.Emerson Electric (EMR) a computer rendering of Miso Robotics's ""Flippy"" robotSource: Miso RoboticsEmerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) is another well-known robotics firm. The stock derives some of its potential upside due to the emergence of automation and the economic promise therein. Automation promises to increase business efficiency in ways we can’t yet fully understand. The notion is simple, though: machines are faster than humans when programmed for a given task. Story continuesEmerson has an entire business dedicated to factory automation. It focuses not only on disruptive technologies in the space but also on established automation technology. As with anything, automation won’t go from 0-60 without passing through multiple speeds. Emerson is working on those intermediate levels as we speak. Thus, it’s likely to iterate toward new paradigms and create breakthrough automation tech. That’s the general bullish outlook on Emerson for the long term as it relates to robotics. EMR shares are highly undervalued at present compared to their levels over the past decade based on the price-to-earnings ratio. That truth provides a reasonable argument in favor of investing now. Doing so includes a bit of dividend income to boot. Thermo Fisher (TMO)a robotic hand reaching out to a human hand against a black background, with the pointer fingers touching. robotics stocksSource: shutterstock.com/sdecoretThermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) stock is closely associated with lab sciences. Most people recognize the firm for lab equipment, research, diagnostics, and the like. That said, Thermo Fisher also includes robotics research. The firm has all kinds of lab robotics solutions which can be viewed here. The portfolio spans a lot of various end applications as well as software. It’s a safe firm to invest in for generalized exposure to robotics growth. It’s also difficult to bet against Thermo Fisher as an investment given how well the stock has done over the past decade. It has returned nearly 20% on an annualized basis during that period. That’s roughly double the return an investor could expect over a similar timeframe through indexed ETFs. Of course, it’s not smart to invest in a single stock so the comparison isn’t perfectly apt. However, the returns speak for themselves. Thermo Fisher is cooling some as its pandemic revenues wane but remains a strong investment nonetheless with revenues that are expected to continue growing overall. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

25,09f93bbc-9670-3221-99da-78452c35cb76,WMT,2023-08-31,15 Biggest Startup Failures in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-startup-failures-world-231810633.html,1693437490,STORY,"['SPOT', 'WMT', 'MSFT', 'SQ']","[In this article, we will be covering the biggest startup failures in the world. We will cover different aspects that have impacted the startup industry. If you want to skip our analysis, go directly to the 5 Biggest Startup Failures in the World. Startups are young companies founded with a new idea looking to disrupt the market. Entrepreneurs are driven by innovation and want to create entirely new products or services to cater to existing deficiencies in the market. We can also say that a startup has two main characteristics; innovation and growth. A startup's ability to scale really defines its potential impact on different markets. That’s why most of the startups are known for the disruption in their respective industries. But, not all startups succeed and the majority of them are prone to failure. According to Startup Genome, about 90% of startups completely fail, while 1.5% of startups end up with a successful exit of $50 million across the top eight U.S. startup networks. The data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that almost 20% of new businesses fail within their first year. In Startup Genome’s Global Startup Ecosystem Report 2023, the President of Global Entrepreneurship Network (GEN) Jonathan Ortmans said:“Entrepreneurship is messy, and while ecosystems benefit from systems thinking, big and creative ideas bubble up from disorder and serendipity.”Aftereffects of COVID-19 on StartupsWhere online operations soared during the pandemic, many startups also had a good time. According to Startup Genome’s report, for tech startups 2021 was a benchmark with extensive global growth. The growth trend for startups continued through the first quarter of 2022 before the COVID-19 impacts started to implode. Gradually, the supply-chain disruptions became a bigger global issue led by higher interest rates and an increase in inflation. Things started to escalate with the Russia-Ukraine war which led to the European energy crises creating economic uncertainty and instability in markets. Story continuesDue to uncertain economic conditions, investors have halted their investments in startups, in large numbers. The Startup Genome report highlights that venture capital (VC) funding started to contract in the first quarter of 2022. The VC funding in Q1 2022 plunged 13% compared to the total amount raised in Q4 2021. Overall, 2022 was a drastic year for startups as the VC investment fell by 35% year over year. The fear of recession across the Americas and Europe has kept VC investors on the back foot. Recessions dry up sources of capital, and VC investors and banks are hesitant to provide funds to startups. This results in fewer funding rounds, lower valuations, and takes more time to materialize. Therefore, economic vulnerabilities expose startups to wavering challenges such as scalability issues and increases in costs. Downfall in VC InvestmentThe downfall in VC funding has continued in 2023. On April 5 Crunchbase posted the VC funding data for the first quarter of 2023. Global VC funding dropped 53% to $76 billion year over year in Q1 2023, including the two massive funding rounds in the U.S. Tech giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) invested around $10 billion in OpenAI to enhance ChatGPT services in the AI world. Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) further investment in OpenAI will strengthen its Azure cloud and also provide OpenAI with designated supercomputers to run complex AI models and enhance its research. According to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anurag Rana, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) will potentially benefit from this deal and expand its cloud business. “This could even help Microsoft close the gap further with AWS,” added Rana, pointing to Amazon.com Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud service. In addition, this year's second big investment was Stripe Inc.’s $6.5 billion funding round, which was announced by the company on March 15. Apart from these two big investments in the U.S., it has been a dry spell so far.Similarly, VC investments in Latin America were down by 84% in Q1 2023, year over year. That’s a drastic drop considering Central and South America were ranked as one of the fastest-growing startup investment regions in the world, a year ago. We can understand the investment sentiment in the region from SoftBank Latin America Ventures’ participation in only two rounds in 2023, compared to 34 rounds in 2021 and 2022. While European startups only raised $10.6 billion in funding in Q1 2023, as American investors retreated. Whereas, VC funding in Asia dropped to a three-year low in Q1 2023 as it fell to $15.2 billion, declining 57% year over year. However, it doesn’t mean that investment in the startup world has died altogether. If there are projects that have clear signs of revenue growth and profitability, investors do take risks in investing in the idea. Successful StartupsDuring the recession years of 2008 and 2009, there was a lot of uncertainty in the market. However, a few startups still made it to the top and increased their valuation over the years. The prominent examples of startup successes in a recession include Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) completed its first fund round in 2009, Spotify Technology SA (NYSE:SPOT) raised a Series A in 2008, and Flipkart in 2009. On May 9, 2018, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) announced that it was becoming the largest shareholder in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart. Later that year, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) acquired a 77% stake in Flipkart for $16 billion. On July 30, the Wall Street Journal reported that Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has paid $1.4 billion to buy shares of Flipkart owned by Tiger Global Management. Flipkart has been running a successful business in India since its launch in January 2007. In September 2009, Flipkart received its first funding of $1 million from Accel Partners. Spotify Technology SA (NYSE:SPOT) is another success story in the startup world that has disrupted the music world. As of August 30, Spotify Technology SA (NYSE:SPOT) had a market cap of $28.13 billion. For the music industry, Spotify has created a huge platform for artists to get their talent recognized. Millions of users all over the world visit the music platform on a monthly basis. Some of the top countries by Spotify users are Luxemburg, Poland, Iceland, and Spain - to name a few. Multinational firm, Block Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is known for its financial services. Launched as Square, in 2021 the company changed its name to Block Inc. (NYSE:SQ). Growing into a top-ranked financial services platform, Block also offers banking services through Square’s banking affiliate, Square Financial Services, Inc.Failure of startups has many reasons and economic uncertainty is one of the biggest reasons why startups fail. In recent times, the COVID-19 pandemic has badly affected startups, leading to low investments and cash problems. Startups can work on their roadmaps, adapt to ongoing situations, and understand the demands of the markets. Low-cost startups have a high rate of survival considering the low VC investments and high inflation and interest rates.With this in mind, let's take a look at the biggest startup failures in the world.15 Biggest Startup Failures in the WorldAntonio Guillem/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyFor the biggest startup failures in the world, we took the failed startup’s data from CB Insights, Startup Graveyard, TMS Outsource, Crunchbase, and Failory.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points: The overall earnings picture remains stable and resilient, with the outlook beginning to improve in recent months. The revisions trend has notably stabilized lately, with estimates for several key sectors increasing. This evolving earnings outlook remains inconsistent with the long-feared ‘earnings cliff’ narrative. Q2 was the 3rd consecutive quarter of earnings declines. The expectation is for 2023 Q3 earnings to be the last period of decline, with growth resuming from Q4 onwards. For 2023 Q3, S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to be down -1.5% on +0.7% higher revenues. Excluding the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +3.4% on +3.2% higher revenues.The somewhat mixed showing from the traditional retailers in their Q2 earnings reports was primarily due to management execution and less a function of any significant moderation in consumer spending.We discussed Target TGT in recent days, which missed top-line and comp estimates but did better on margins and inventories. We noted that while management appeared satisfied with current inventory levels, investors will be justified in wondering whether Target has really addressed the issue if Q2’s weak sales and traffic trends will result in unsold inventory in the coming periods.Unlike Walmart, whose quarterly report showed all-around strength, Target has struggled in the post-Covid period, failing to foresee shifts in consumer spending away from discretionary categories like apparel, home furnishings, and electronics, resulting in unsold inventory that then needed to be cleared through markdowns.Walmart stumbled last year following its Q1 report, as did Target, but it recovered quickly. In its Q2 report, Walmart benefited from broad market share gains and momentum in key growth initiatives.Story continuesWhile Walmart has a much bigger grocery business, Target has all along been seen as more of a play on discretionary merchandise, demand for which has moderated in the post-Covid period. That said, Target appears to have lost out more than other retailers that sell comparable merchandise, with TJX Companies TJX as a good example of one such retailer.The challenge for retailers like Target, Walmart, TJX, and others is not only to have the correct merchandise but also to deal with higher expenses related to freight, payroll, and other items.We have provided the updated Q2 earnings season scorecard for the Zacks Retail sector in the detailed report.Beyond the Retail sector, the 2023 Q2 reporting cycle has come to an end for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with results from 98.4% of the S&amp;P 500 index companies already out.2023 Q2 is on track to be the third consecutive quarter of declining S&amp;P 500 earnings. The expectation currently is for another earnings decline in Q3 of -1.5%, after which growth turns positive in Q4 and continues in 2024. In fact, Q3 earnings would be positive had it not been for the Energy sector drag.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see from these quarterly earnings-growth expectations, the long-feared recession doesn’t show up in this near-term earnings outlook. A big-picture view of corporate profitability on a long-term basis doesn’t leave much room for a recession either, as you can see in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThese growth expectations reflect current bottom-up consensus earnings estimates for the individual S&amp;P 500 companies that, in turn, are based on the estimates from individual sell-side analysts that cover those companies.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have flagged a notable stabilization in the estimate revisions trend since the start of 2023 Q2, reversing the persistently negative trend that had been in place for almost a year prior.Earnings estimates in the aggregate for the S&amp;P 500 index have come down only a touch since the start of April, with a number of key sectors starting to see modest positive estimate revisions. These sectors include Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Tech, Medical, and Retail. These trends have been confirmed and strengthened by the Q2 earnings results and management’s guidance and commentary for the current and coming quarters.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(HPQ) plunged over 8% in early trading on Wednesday as persistent tepid demand for computers led to a full-year profit warning.HP now sees full-year adjusted earnings of $3.23 to $3.25 a share, down from $3.30 to $3.50 previously. Free cash flow is targeted at $3 billion compared to a prior outlook of $3.25 billion.""This outlook is largely driven by the continued aggressive pricing environment in PCs, sluggish demand in China, and enterprise demands,"" HP CEO Enrique Lores told analysts on the earnings call. ""Notwithstanding the actions we are taking to mitigate these headwinds, we believe it's prudent to lower our outlook based on near-term market reality.""The market reality led to a challenging quarter for HP.Fiscal third quarter sales fell 9.9% from a year ago to $13.2 billion. Consumer PC sales dropped 12%, while sales to businesses fell 11%. And adjusted earnings per share declined 17% from a year earlier.HP isn't alone in shedding light on the continued challenges of getting consumers to upgrade their pandemic PC purchases.Best Buy (BBY) said on Tuesday that its comparable store sales in the computing and mobile phone category declined by 6.4%.

JWN need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct 20, 2023 $2.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Nordstrom shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Nordstrom is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry that ranks in the Top 43% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while five have revised the estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 33 cents per share to 19 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Nordstrom right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

35,ea42567a-7476-3fa6-8939-da8dd2beb0db,UAA,2023-08-31,TV anchor had a secret phone for conversations with Under Armour founder Kevin Plank,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tv-anchor-had-secret-phone-130000822.html,1693400400,STORY,['UAA'],"[A court case has uncovered the unusual relationship between Under Armour founder Kevin Plank and MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle—revealing the two communicated at ""all hours"" via a secret phone and email address.According to newly unsealed court documents, the 51-year-old billionaire allegedly shared confidential financial information about the sportswear giant with Ruhle when she was a Bloomberg Television news anchor. He also sought her assistance in countering concerns about declining sales.The duo’s close ties were first reported by the Wall Street Journal in 2019, but now their relationship—which included trips on Plank's private jet—is under the lens in court.Plank, the current executive chairman of Under Armour, stands accused of providing Ruhle with ""non-public financial information"" about the company.The lawsuit, filed by shareholders in 2017 in a federal court in Maryland, alleges that Under Armour artificially inflated its share price, resulting in losses for them.Shareholders claim that Plank and his associates were aware of a decline in sales and so employed improper tactics to sustain the growth momentum.This allegedly included enlisting Ruhle’s help to undermine a January 2016 report by Morgan Stanley which highlighted the weakening sales data.A spokesperson for Under Armour told Fortune the documents have ""no bearing on the case,"" adding that Plank had ""utilized confidential advice or counsel from a number of outside advisors from different fields of expertise, and that is what these documents show. Furthermore, none of the information was used improperly.""Highlighting that a federal judge in the Southern District of New York has previously ruled against the plaintiffs, the company added: ""The claims asserted by plaintiffs’ counsel are meritless and are being defended vigorously in the ongoing Maryland litigation, which has been pending for more than six years.""Story continuesBloomberg did not immediately respond to Fortune's request for comment.An unlikely confidantPlank has grown Under Armour—founded in 1996—from a moisture-wicking shirt maker for football players into a global brand with approximately $5.9 billion in annual sales and thousands of employees.But the sportswear giant has struggled to move on from a scrappy company culture, having been embroiled in various complaints from strip club visits to inappropriate behavior by executives.Now the latest filings around Plank and Ruhle's relationship raise a host of ethical questions about the boundary reporters must maintain with the powerful people that they cover—and vice versa.Former and current executives reportedly told the WSJ Plank’s use of the jet and his relationship with Ruhle were among the many ways the CEO blurred the distinction between his personal and professional activities.“There are clear lines between the company and Mr. Plank’s private interests, and he is accountable to the board for this,” Kelley McCormick, Under Armour’s senior vice president of communications told the publication.During a deposition earlier this year, Plank, who stepped down as Under Armour CEO in 2019 before taking the role of chairman, was asked to describe the nature of his relationship with Ruhle.""She's a confidant,"" he responded, according to the WSJ. ""I would give her counsel on her career and she would give me counsel on things I was dealing with that were either banking or media or human nature in relation.""When asked during his deposition about the Morgan Stanley report, Plank said the two “had an understanding of trust.”“She didn’t trade in this, her family doesn’t trade in this. She’s simply giving me input,” Plank said.When Ruhle sat for her deposition, she admitted to taking at least two trips with Plank on his private jet: once from Cannes, France, to New York and another time from New York to Baltimore.When pressed on whether she took the trips as Plank's friend or as a journalist, Ruhle said: ""I was flying on his plane as myself, Stephanie Ruhle. I’m not really in a category as one or the other.”The MSNBC anchor also confirmed that she had three phones: a work phone, a personal phone and a so-called “Kevin Plank phone”.""We were friends and I covered his company,"" the anchor added.Morgan Stanley email chain uncoveredOn January 10, 2016, Morgan Stanley released a report in which it downgraded the rating of Under Armour stock and lowered its price target, citing a slowdown in sales trends.Despite being in a ""quiet period"" that prevented public communication, Plank discussed privately with Ruhle how to dismiss the report, according to documents in the lawsuit.The following day, Ruhle emailed Under Armour's former communications executive Diane Pelkey for data that would contradict the report—and then advised they send it to media outlets.″This content is perfect just in case anyone decides to cover the Morgan Stanley thing—it combats any risk of negativity,” Ruhle wrote in an email littered with typos to the executive, according to the WSJ.Later that afternoon, Ruhle reportedly raised doubts about the data presented in the Morgan Stanley report on Bloomberg.A couple of weeks later, when Under Armour reported positive quarterly results, Plank emailed Ruhle “look at that stock!!!” before allegedly helping her bag an interview with basketball player and Under Armour athlete Stephen Curry.Court documents allege Plank told his communications executive in an email that the Curry interview was “a great thank you for being the only member of media to get UA’s back when [Morgan Stanley] came out against us.”On Feb. 2, Bloomberg posted the interview, which included Ruhle playing basketball with Curry.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure of a stock's intrinsic value, computed based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line represents the ideal fair trading value of the stock.According to GuruFocus' valuation method, Xylem (NYSE:XYL) appears to be modestly undervalued. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overpriced and likely to yield poor future returns. Conversely, if it's significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued, indicating higher future returns. Given Xylem's current price of $103.69 per share, the stock seems modestly undervalued.As Xylem is relatively undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Story continuesUnveiling Xylem (XYL)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right?

Revenues in the digital channel declined roughly 10% in the quarter under review.The company's gross profit amounted to $1,272.3 million, up 4.3% year over year, surpassing our estimate of $1,267.2 million. The gross margin contracted 40 bps to 57.6% due to price increases, lower freight costs, and a favorable shift in regional and channel mix, which more than offset elevated inventory costs stemming from adverse currency.Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 7.8% year over year to $1,099.5 million and lagged our estimate of $1,107.9.This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s adjusted earnings before interest and taxes totaled $182 million compared with $211 million in the prior-year quarter.

One such stock that merits attention is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NYSE:NCLH). The stock, which is currently priced at 16.54, recorded a loss of 2.19% in a day and a 3-month increase of 11.54%. The stock's fair valuation is $59.95, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NCLH. Click here to check it out. NCLH 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NCLHThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors: Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of -0.21, and the company's revenues and earnings have been on a downward trend over the past five years, which raises a crucial question: Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings a hidden gem or a value trap?Understanding the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesCompany IntroductionNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd is the world's third-largest cruise company by berths, operating 30 ships across three brands, offering both freestyle and luxury cruising. Despite its impressive operations, the company's financial health is concerning, as indicated by its low Altman Z-score and declining revenues and earnings.Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's Altman Z-score reveals Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's historical data, 2021: -0.13; 2022: -0.33; 2023: -0.38, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The Bearish Signs: Declining Revenues and EarningsOne of the telltale indicators of a company's potential trouble is a sustained decline in revenues. In the case of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, both the revenue per share (evident from the last five years' TTM data: 2019: 28.67; 2020: 21.68; 2021: 0.08; 2022: 5.74; 2023: 16.54; ) and the 5-year revenue growth rate (-32%) have been on a consistent downward trajectory. This pattern may point to underlying challenges such as diminishing demand for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's products, or escalating competition in its market sector. Either scenario can pose serious risks to the company's future performance, warranting a thorough analysis by investors.Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapThe Red Flag: Sluggish Earnings GrowthDespite its low price-to-fair-value ratio, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's falling revenues and earnings cast a long shadow over its investment attractiveness. A low price relative to intrinsic value can indeed suggest an investment opportunity, but only if the company's fundamentals are sound or improving. In Steelcase's case, the declining revenues, EBITDA, and earnings growth suggest that the company's issues may be more than just cyclical fluctuations.Without a clear turnaround strategy, there's a risk that the company's performance could continue to deteriorate, leading to further price declines. In such a scenario, the low price-to-GF-Value ratio may be more indicative of a value trap than a value opportunity.ConclusionGiven the company's declining revenues and earnings, coupled with its low Altman Z-score, it is prudent to conclude that Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings might be a potential value trap. Therefore, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .Investors can find stocks with good revenue and earnings growth using GuruFocus' Peter Lynch Growth with Low Valuation Screener.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Little interest has so far emerged for replacement cargoes, with terminal inventories in northeast Asia largely remaining high as power sector cooling demand begins to wane with the seasonal fall in temperatures across much of the region.""He added that based on weather forecasts, winter heating demand in northeast China is also unlikely to begin until late October, and even further into winter for South Korea and Japan.Two major LNG production facilities operated by Chevron could face daily work stoppages of up to 10 hours next week after unions on Tuesday threatened labour action in a dispute over pay and conditions.Workers at Gorgon and Wheatstone downstream facilities plan to stop work for seven hours in two-time blocks on Sept. 7, escalating to 10 hours on Sept. 8 and 11 hours on Sept. 9. A smaller stoppage of three hours is planned at the Wheatstone production platform from Sept. 7.Rising inventories in East Asian consumers have also kept a lid on prices.""After concerns of Japan sitting on low stockpiles and potential supply disruptions on the horizon, Japan has finally snuck above the 5-year average for this time of the year,"" said Dominic Gallagher, head of LNG broking at Tullett Prebon.Story continues""China is also looking well stocked with some forecasts suggesting it could reach 90% of total capacity next month.""In Europe, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights assessed its daily north-west Europe LNG Marker (NWM) price benchmark for cargoes delivered in October on an ex-ship (DES) basis at $12.082/mmBtu on Aug. 30, a $0.40/mmBtu discount to the October gas price at the Dutch TTF gas hub, said Allen Reed, managing editor, Atlantic LNG.""After weeks of Atlantic price reactions and market focus on Australia, the market saw muted response following the announcement of industrial action at Chevron facilities,"" he said.""European traders have said the expectation of the strikes was already priced in and that high gas inventory levels in Europe and Asia have been the primary reason prices haven't risen on the news.""Argus assessed the north-west Europe DES price at $11.75/mmBtu.Meanwhile, spot LNG freight rates rose this week, with Atlantic rates gaining $7,500 week-to-date to $121,750/day on Thursday.

Ultimately, the five sites will collectively generate 50 megawatts of renewable energy. One megawatt of solar energy powers a national average of 173 homes, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.The PSC previously granted initial approval for the construction pending final approval once the companies had subscribed enough industrial, commercial and residential customers to use approximately 85% of the renewable energy produced by the sites. The three sites planned in Monongalia, Marion and Berkeley counties have met this requirement. The companies plan to seek approval from the PSC to build the additional two solar sites once customers subscribe to the energy they will produce.""Mon Power and Potomac Edison are committed to the environment and enhancing reliability for customers by bolstering and diversifying the region's energy mix,"" said Jim Myers, president of FirstEnergy's West Virginia operations. ""Renewable energy is a large economic driver in attracting new industry to West Virginia so it is important to have this voluntary option available to customers.""The companies recently cleared brush, leveled the ground and installed roads and fences to prepare the initial site for solar panel installation in the near future.The Commission also approved the construction surcharge requested by the companies, which is about a third of the amount originally proposed. Beginning in 2024, the average residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours per month will pay an additional 14 cents each month. The companies anticipate the surcharge will remain the same for 2025 and is expected to reduce to 11 cents per month in 2026.

The company’s expanding customer base and rising demand act as tailwinds.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has to face risks related to failure of transmission and distribution lines.TailwindsXcel Energy aims to spend $29.5 billion during the 2023-2027 period, excluding $2-$4 billion of potential incremental investment opportunities planned in the same time frame. These investments are aimed to strengthen and expand its transmission, distribution, electric generation and renewable projects.High quality and reliable services provided by the company attract new customers and allow Xcel Energy to serve an expanding electric and natural gas customer base. In second-quarter 2023, the electric and natural gas’ customer base increased 1.1% each. In the same time frame, sales volumes for the electric segment improved 0.6% and natural gas volumes increased 0.1% year over year.Xcel Energy is focusing on clean-energy transition. After completing six wind projects with 1,500 MW capacities in 2020, the company completed four wind farms, adding another 800 MW of clean energy generation capacity to its portfolio. XEL got key regulatory approval for the Minnesota resource plan, which includes the closing of coal plants like the A.S. King Plant and Sherco 3 by 2028 and 2030, respectively.HeadwindsXcel Energy’s natural gas and electric transmission and distribution operations are exposed to several risks, including explosions, leaks and mechanical setbacks. These incidents can affect the company’s operations, thereby impacting its financial performance.XEL has plans to borrow additional funds to meet its capital expenditure target. It is likely to add an additional debt of $8.2 billion in the 2023-2027 period to meet its expenses.

The stock has risen more than 60% so far this year.Salesforce bumped up its annual forecast for adjusted operating margin on Wednesday to about 30% from 28%, with CFO Amy Weaver stressing the new figure ""is a floor, not a ceiling"".Wall Street analysts lauded the move, noting the benefits from an aggressive profitability push at a company that has traditionally focused on growing bigger through acquisitions.After a nudge from activist investors earlier in the year, the Marc Benioff-led firm has laid off thousands, reduced office space and dialled back employee perks this year to prop up profitability that has for years trailed rivals.The ""ceiling is the roof"" for margins, analysts at Raymond James said. The brokerage was among the 26 that lifted their price targets on the stock, pushing the median view to $255, according to Refinitiv data. That is nearly 19% higher than the stock's last close.Wednesday's report also eased some concerns about slowing growth at the company.While the 11% rise in second-quarter revenue was much slower than historic growth rates of around 20% to 30%, the figure breezed past Wall Street expectations, and Salesforce also raised its annual revenue forecast.The company has tried to navigate a downturn in tech spending by rolling out a suite of artificial intelligence features and raising prices for the first time in seven years.The results should drive up investor confidence in the company, brokerage Raymond James said, adding that ""shares are simply too low priced"" for a company executing well in a tough economy.Salesforce trades at 25 times its forward 12 months earnings estimates, compared with the industry median of 15.14.(Reporting by Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)]"

For the third quarter in a row, Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff showed he heard the message.Most Read from BloombergHuawei Teardown Shows Chip Breakthrough in Blow to US SanctionsChina Slowdown Means It May Never Overtake US Economy, Forecast ShowsReturn-to-Office Is a $1.3 Trillion Problem Few Have Figured OutBillion-Dollar Corporate Bond Deals Hit Treasuries: Markets WrapUnited Airlines Resumes US Flights After Temporary Grounding on Tech IssueThe software giant gave a revenue and profit forecast for the current period that topped analysts’ estimates, signaling progress in the campaign to cut costs and quelling some anxiety about a sales slowdown. The shares jumped 5.1% as trading got underway in New York on Thursday.While Wall Street has been pleased by Salesforce’s profit focus, investors began worrying about lower rates of revenue growth for a company used to gains of 20% to 30% a quarter. The outlook for future sales “will likely pour cold water on fears of a slowdown,” said Anurag Rana, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.The company took multiple steps in the quarter toward reigniting revenue growth. In June, Salesforce announced a suite of new artificial intelligence features that will cost roughly $7,200 per user each year, and followed in July with the first price increase in seven years. The company is also working to make Slack and Tableau relevant for more of its existing customers. And Salesforce recently promoted Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham to oversee a larger swath of the company and appointed a new chief revenue officer, Miguel Milano.Sales will be about $8.71 billion in the period ending in October, the company said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, projected $8.66 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Current remaining performance obligations, a measure of contracted sales, will grow just more than 11%, meeting analysts’ estimates.Story continuesSalesforce also raised its outlook for fiscal-year sales to a high of $34.8 billion, from $34.7 billion, and its operating margin to 30% from 28%, “based on our performance and what we see in the back half of the year,” Benioff said in the statement.Consulting firm Bain &amp; Co. has finished a review of the business, and the software company is now focused on longer-term profit-boosting initiatives like altering procurement and real estate procedures, Mike Spencer, Salesforce executive vice president of investor relations, said in an interview.After announcing large job cuts earlier this year, Salesforce has approved a budget for new hiring, particularly in research and development areas like artificial intelligence, Spencer said. Even with those additional employees, the company’s headcount will be 10% lower at the end of the fiscal year, he said. That’s due to continuing trims and performance-based reductions such as one in Ireland earlier this month that are separate from the major workforce cuts announced in January, Spencer said.Salesforce had 70,456 full-time employees at the end of the fiscal second quarter on July 31, a 10% decline from a year earlier, according to the statement.In the quarter, revenue increased 11% to $8.6 billion, compared with the $8.53 billion average projected by analysts. Profit, excluding some items, was $2.12 a share. Analysts, on average, estimated $1.90. Operating margin was 31.6%.Customers continued to hold off on large “transformational deals” in the quarter, Millham said on a conference call after the results were released.Benioff said new product features, including those powered by artificial intelligence, will be demonstrated at the company’s annual conference in September. The event, called Dreamforce, is held in the company’s hometown of San Francisco, which Benioff said is becoming “the No. 1 AI city in the world” with the growing presence of the emerging industry. Still, Benioff told the San Francisco Chronicle on Tuesday that the conference could move out of the city if it’s affected by homelessness that has plagued San Francisco.A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst on the conference call Wednesday told Benioff he hoped Dreamforce would stay in San Francisco — and the CEO didn’t respond.A city of San Francisco spokesperson said the city “is committed to making Dreamforce a world-class event, as we do year after year.” City staff are working to make sure “the resources are in place to make it safe and welcoming, and we’ll continue to do so to ensure this year’s event is also successful like in years past,” the spokesperson added.The shares rose to a high of $227.25 in premarket trading after closing at $215.04 in New York. While the stock has jumped 62% this year through Wednesday’s close, it has dropped about 4% since Salesforce’s last earnings report on May 31, lagging behind most of its peers.Most of the activist investors that emerged over the last year have cut their positions in Salesforce following the steep share gain this year, Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote ahead of the results. During activist volatility earlier in the year, “it seemed like Marc Benioff’s job was on the line,” Pat Walravens, an analyst at JMP Securities, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. Now after a few good quarters, “he has good things in front of him.”--With assistance from Karen Breslau.(Updates shares in second paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekLyme Disease Has Exploded, and a New Vaccine Is (Almost) HereIs Carlos Alcaraz the Next Billion-Dollar Tennis Player?How a Tiny Mexican Border City Built a Budget Dental EmpireNigeria’s Train to Nowhere Shows How Not to Build Public TransitThe Hostile Takeover of Blue Cities by Red States©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the financial sector and its performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Financial Dividend Stocks To Invest In.Over the years, the finance industry in the US has gone through several changes. The onset of the pandemic and the recent banking crisis have made these changes even more intense. Following the failure of three major US banks in March this year, worried customers and investors rushed to withdraw their funds. CNN reported that these banks had about $559 billion in total assets, surpassing the $523 billion held by 25 banks that collapsed in 2008 when accounting for inflation.The effects of the pandemic have resulted in financial companies from Wall Street shifting away from New York City and moving to the Sun Belt region. According to Bloomberg, the firms are taking almost $1 trillion worth of managed assets with them. This move is being driven by factors like taxes and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also by practical and cultural reasons. Amid the pandemic, factors like no state income tax, pleasant weather, and business-friendly offers encouraged New York-based hedge fund billionaires to move their businesses to Florida. The report also mentioned that between the beginning of 2020 and the end of March 2023, over 370 investment companies, which is about 2.5% of all US investment firms, shifted their main offices to a different state. These companies collectively managed assets worth $2.7 trillion.In one of the recent developments, shares of several US banks dropped on August 22. This happened after S&amp;P Global, a rating agency, lowered credit ratings for certain regional banks that are heavily involved in commercial real estate. These banks include KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA), and Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE:ASB). This action came after a similar move by Moody's. Both of these rating agencies are making these changes because of an ongoing banking crisis that started in March.Story continuesS&amp;P Global mentioned challenging conditions affecting the banking sector. Here is what the credit agency said in its report:""The sharp rise in interest rates and quantitative tightening deployed since March 2022 to combat high inflation are weighing on many U.S. banks' funding, liquidity and spread income. These factors have also caused the value of banks' assets to fall and raised the odds of asset quality deterioration.""Investing in financial stocks means putting money into the top businesses that offer banking, insurance, credit cards, and various other financial services around the world. Since the financial sector is central to the worldwide economy, it's a smart idea for investors to seriously think about including financial stocks as a significant part of their investment collections. Due to the ongoing issues in the finance industry, the sector is struggling to match the pace of the market. The S&amp;P 500 Financials, which tracks the performance of some of the most prominent finance companies such as Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), is down by 1.11% year-to-date. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 gained 14.44% this year so far.Also read: 12 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy NowInvesting in dividend stocks within the finance sector can be a prudent strategy for income investors. However, it's essential to note that the finance sector can be sensitive to economic fluctuations and regulatory changes.

Winds calmed throughout the afternoon, and by 5 p.m. the utility issued a weather “all-clear,” saying it would begin the process of restoring electricity.The gusty northerly winds were generated in the wake of a trough of low pressure that moved through Northern California on Tuesday, the weather service said.Public safety power shutoffs are intended to prevent fires from starting when power lines are downed by winds or struck by falling trees or windblown debris. Such fires have caused extensive destruction and deaths in California.The issue of power shutoffs surfaced in Hawaii after the deadly fire that destroyed the Maui community of Lahaina. Maui County claims the Hawaiian Electric Company negligently failed to cut power despite high winds and dry conditions. The utility acknowledges its lines started the fire, but it faults county firefighters for declaring the blaze contained and leaving the scene.Wednesday's proactive power cuts were PG&amp;E's first since 2021. PG&amp;E first implemented the shutoffs in 2019, leaving nearly 2 million people in the San Francisco Bay Area and elsewhere in Northern California without power and drawing fierce criticism.The utility has since been able to reduce the impact by adding more circuit switches to its grid, allowing it to more precisely determine which customers will lose power, said Paul Moreno, a PG&amp;E spokesperson.Story continuesPG&amp;E also added hundreds of weather stations in areas prone to wildfires, and now it has nearly 1,500 units that provide information on when fire conditions are present and when those conditions have passed, he said.California has so far avoided widespread wildfires this year following an extraordinarily wet winter and cool spring that melted the mountain snowpack slowly. Downpours from recent Tropical Storm Hilary further dampened much of the southern half of the state.Major fires have been limited to the southeastern desert and the lightly populated far northwest corner of the state where lightning ignited many blazes this month.___Antczak reported from Los Angeles.]"
66,064693b3-7f0d-3b40-85e4-626a36d8cd27,NWS,2023-08-31,Realtor.com® August Housing Report: Home Prices Tick Up After Two Months of Declines,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/realtor-com-august-housing-report-100000379.html,1693476000.0,STORY,"['NWS', 'NWSA', 'NWSAL']","[In August, active inventory shrank compared to last year (-7.9%), despite an unusual increase from July in newly listed homes, signaling a potential return of seller activity heading into fallSANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug. 31, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Following two months of year-over-year declines, home prices rose in August (+0.7%) as the number of homes on the market decreased for the second month in a row, down -7.9% year-over-year, according to the Realtor.com® August Monthly Housing Trends Report released today. Active inventory remained -47.8% below typical 2017 to 2019 levels, although an unseasonable increase in newly listed homes from July to August (+3.5%) this year provides more options for home shoppers as the fall buying season approaches.""While the uptick in new listings is good news for home shoppers, inventory remains persistently low, even with record-high mortgage rates putting a damper on demand,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""The inventory crunch continues to put upward pressure on home prices, amplifying affordability concerns and shutting some potential buyers out of the market. However, we anticipate mortgage rates will gradually ease through the end of the year and, despite this month's bump in home prices, we'll be unlikely to see a new price peak this year.""What it means for homebuyers, sellers, and the housing marketAlthough home sellers were less active in August compared to last year, the increase in newly listed homes for sale from July to August creates a nice boost for shoppers heading into fall, which is typically the best time to buy a home. Homeowners who have been on the fence about selling will likely find eager buyers looking for fresh listings.""As fall buying activity heats up, the newly available homes for sale aren't likely to remain on the market long, so sellers and hopeful homebuyers will need to be prepared to move quickly,"" said Realtor.com® Executive News Editor Clare Trapasso. ""Home shoppers can save searches on Realtor.com® to receive real-time alerts, receive mortgage pre-approvals, and pore over their budgets to determine what they can realistically afford with today's higher mortgage rates.""Story continuesAffordability remains a significant concern. Although sales of new homes are on the rise, construction activity isn't sufficiently robust to offset the inventory shortage and ease prices, which are up nearly 38% from August 2019 levels. Additionally, elevated mortgage rates have raised the monthly financing cost of the average home by about $417, up 21.7% from August 2022. This greatly exceeds both wage growth (4.4%) and inflation (3.2%).August 2023 Housing Metrics – NationalMetricChange over Aug 2022Change over Aug 2019Median listing price+0.7% (to $435,000)+37.9 %Active listings-7.9 %-45.8 %New listings-7.5 %-19.3 %Median days on market+5 days (to 46 days)-13 daysShare of active listings with price reductions-3.1 percentage points (to 16.2%)-1.4 percentage points Year over year home prices rise in August after two months of annual declinesIn August, national home listing prices rose slightly compared to last year, ending a two-month streak of year-over-year price declines in June and July, buoyed by a scarce inventory of homes for sale across the country. Despite listing prices being slightly higher than in August of last year, the median list price is unlikely to surpass last year's record peak of $449,000 in June 2022 as we head into the fall months and when home prices typically see a slight seasonal decline.The U.S. median list price fell to $435,000 in August, down from $440,000 in July, but is up slightly (+0.7%) from August of last year.While all regions saw listing prices in larger metros increase on average, Northeastern metros had the highest growth rate in active listing prices, with an average increase of 9.7% over the past year.Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, only 7 saw their median list price decline compared with this time last year, down from 12 last month. The greatest year-over-year price declines were seen in Raleigh (-4.6%) and Las Vegas (-2.8%). Larger southern metros saw the lowest listing price growth rate among the regions (3.2%).Nationally, the share of homes with price reductions decreased from 19.3% in August of last year to 16.2% this year, and remains below typical levels seen in 2017 to 2019.Among the 50 largest metros, the largest increases in the percentage of homes with price reductions compared to last year were in San Antonio (+3.9 percentage points), Memphis (+3.7), and Oklahoma City (+1.9).Newly listed homes improve from July, but inventory crunch continuesWhile the market saw an unusual bump in newly listed homes for sale between July and August this year, the overall number of homes actively for sale shrank for the second consecutive month, reversing the consistent growth trajectory seen since April 2022. Some of this drop can be attributed to an off-season surge in inventory during a market slowdown last summer. Although active inventory still remains below typical pre-pandemic levels seen between 2017 and 2019, the modest rise in new homes listed for sale this summer could give buyers grappling with affordability issues more options.Nationally, active inventory shrank -7.9% year over year in August compared to last year. On average, active inventory in August was -47.8% below typical 2017–2019 levels.Pending listings, or homes under contract, declined by 11.5% compared to the same time last year, which is slightly smaller than July's 12.6% decline and much improved from December's peak decline (-36.9% year over year).Newly listed homes were 7.5% below last year's levels, but this rate of decline is much improved from a decline of 20.8% in July. Newly listed homes increased by 3.5% from July to August.In all regions, the inventory of homes actively for sale was down 30%–60% from pre-pandemic levels. Inventory declined least in the South, by 1.5% compared to the same time last year, followed by a decline of 13.5% in the Midwest, 19.3% in the Northeast, and 31.5% in the West.In August, only Milwaukee (+6.8%) and Jacksonville (+4.0%) saw new listings increase over the same time last year. Declines in new listings were greatest in Nashville (-27.2%) Cincinnati (-25.0%) and Seattle (-24.7%).As inventory shrinks, homes in several large markets sell faster compared to last yearThe time homes spend on the market is approaching last year's quicker figures, with buyers again vying for fewer available options than the prior year in most parts of the country. Should this pattern continue, by the coming month homes in every region except the South are likely to sell faster than they did during the same period last year.In August, the typical home spent 46 days on the market, 5 days longer than this time last year, but 13 fewer days than they did on average from August 2017–2019.Time on market increased in August compared to last year in 35 of the 50 largest metro areas. Larger metros in the South saw the greatest increase (+6 days), followed by the Northeast (+2 days), Midwest (+1 day) and West (+0 days).At the market level, time on market increased the most in Austin and New Orleans (+15 days), as well as in Miami (+13 days). August 2023 Housing Overview by Top 50 Largest Metros  Metro AreaMedian Listing PriceMedian Listing Price YoYMedian Listing Price per Sq.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly. Top 5 Upgrades: Goldman Sachs upgraded PDD Holdings (PDD) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $129, up from $99, following what the firm calls a ""significant"" Q2 earnings beat, driven mostly from domestic online ad revenue being up 50% year-over-year.Citi upgraded Sunrun (RUN) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $21, down from $25. While headwinds from higher interest rates and net energy metering impacts appear to be largely priced into the shares, Sunrun is not getting due credit for its market share gains from third party owner shift, path to free cash flow generation, no corporate level equity raises, projected component cost deflation, and success in selling battery storage, the firm says.Scotiabank upgraded UDR (UDR) to Outperform from Sector Perform with a price target of $45, up from $44. The firm sees a relative valuation discount in UDR shares that ""offers an attractive entry point.""Compass Point upgraded Hercules Capital (HTGC) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $17.50, up from $17. Hercules raised $108M in fresh capital through a syndicated equity offering of 6.5M shares in early August and the ""only reason to do a syndicated equity offering is that originations are accelerating faster than expected,"" the firm notes.JPMorgan upgraded Cemig (CIG) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of R$16, up from R$14.50. The firm believes state-owned utilities controlled by the state of Minas Gerais are being mispriced by the market. Top 5 Downgrades:Bernstein downgraded Texas Instruments (TXT) to Underperform from Market Perform with an unchanged price target of $145. The firm says Street models do not appear to contemplate the consequences of Texas Instruments' capex and inventory plans. TD Cowen downgraded Ambarella (AMBA) to Market Perform from Outperform with a price target of $65, down from $90, following the Q2 report. The company announced ""another hard expectation cut"" as customer inventory burn accelerates, leaving Ambarella with little visibility in the near and intermediate term, the firm notes.Craig-Hallum downgraded Box (BOX) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $30, down from $35. Growth at Box is slowing to a halt as customers continue to lower their rate of seat expansion, the firm says.Morgan Stanley downgraded Centene (CNC) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $73, down from $94. The firm has lowered confidence in the visibility and stability of the company's long term earnings growth profile. Barclays downgraded Rockwell Automation (ROK) to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $287, down from $300. The company has attractive end market exposures and an un-levered balance sheet, but the stock's valuation is ""quite rich"" after rallying 20% year-to-date, the firm argues.Top 5 Initiations: WestPark Capital initiated coverage of Palo Alto Networks (PANW) with a Buy rating and $340 price target. The firm believes Palo Alto is ""leaving competitors far behind"" and that the company's growing scale will provide additional competitive benefits versus smaller point solutions.HSBC initiated coverage of Align Technology (ALGN) with a Buy rating and $450 price target. The firm believes the dental market is under-penetrated, with an addressable size of $20B and a solid growth profile, and says ageing demographics and consumer spending patterns are long- and mid-term drivers of growth.Citi initiated coverage of Cognex (CGNX) with a Neutral rating and $52 price target. The firm says softer near-term demand trends across most of the company's end markets and its ""still relatively elevated"" valuation could keep shares relatively range-bound in the near-term.B. Riley initiated coverage of AZZ Inc. (AZZ) with a Buy rating and $64 price target.  The firm believes the company has ""several compelling investment attributes,"" including the durability of cash flows, a leading position in its respective markets, and disciplined capital allocation.Janney Montgomery Scott initiated coverage of BCB Bancorp (BCBP) with a Buy rating and $18.50 fair value estimate. The traditional lender focused on commercial lending, not thrift-related assets, in Northern New Jersey is an ""inexpensive community bank"" that currently trades at a 30% discount to tangible book value, or TBV, per share, the firm tells investors.]"

The software giant said Thursday that it plans to offer business customers the chance to buy a lower-priced version of its productivity suites that doesn’t include the videoconferencing app. New customers would still have the option of purchasing Teams separately if they want the service.Continue reading]

For its core enterprise customers, which represent most of its business in the region, Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, will cut the price by 2 euros ($2.17) per month for the Office package without Teams. Existing customers can stick with their current plan or switch to the version without Teams.Story continuesNew business customers will be able to buy a separate standalone version of Teams for 5 euros a month.Linde said Microsoft would give software developers more support, including by providing more information on how data can be removed from Teams and used in other software. The company will also make it easier for competitors to use Microsoft's functionality instead of building their own.Microsoft and other U.S. tech giants have been facing pressure from Brussels over worries about their market dominance. The commission has investigated Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook and Instagram owner Meta.Microsoft, which last faced an EU antitrust investigation more than a decade ago, is also trying to save its $69 billion purchase of video game maker Activision. That deal was cleared by the Commission, but has been bogged down in Britain.]"

This acquisition complements the recent transition of Signet's Blue Nile Seattle Fulfillment Center to a new enterprise-wide repair facility called Signet Services Washington.These additions expand the Company's repair network to a total of more than 260 locations with over 1,800 jewelers. Signet's national network enables it to keep setting the bar higher including the ability to now offer Business to Business repair services, watch repair services and mail-in capabilities, among other offerings.Balance Sheet and Statement of Cash Flows Highlights:Year to date cash used for operating activities was $253.3 million compared to cash used for operating activities of $114.9 million at this time last year. Cash and cash equivalents were $690.2 million as of quarter end, compared to $851.7 million at the end of Q2 of FY23. The year over year change to cash and cash equivalents was driven by the acquisition of Blue Nile and payment of legal settlements which totaled nearly $600 million combined. The Company ended the second quarter with an Adjusted Debt to Adjusted EBITDAR ratio of 2.3x on a trailing 12-month basis, well below the stated goal of less than 2.75x, and was 1.8x on an Adjusted Net Debt basis.Inventory ended the quarter at $2.1 billion, down $96.9 million to Q2 of FY23 and excluding the acquisition of Blue Nile inventory was down more than $167 million, or 8% below Q2 of FY23, driven by Signet's consumer insights to predict dynamic conditions like the current engagement trough. Compared to Q2 of FY20, inventory excluding acquisitions is down more than 20% on higher revenue and clearance inventory is down approximately 50%.Capital Returns to Shareholders:Signet's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on common shares of $0.23 per share for the second quarter of Fiscal 2024, payable November 24, 2023 to shareholders of record on October 27, 2023, with an ex-dividend date of October 26, 2023.During the first half of Fiscal 2024, Signet repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares at an average cost per share of $69.88, or $82.4 million including $43.3 million during the second quarter. Approximately $718 million remains under the Company's multi-year authorization.Third quarter and Full year Fiscal 2024 Guidance:Forecasted non-GAAP operating income and diluted EPS provided below excludes potential non-recurring charges, such as restructuring charges, asset impairments or integration-related costs associated with the acquisition of Blue Nile. However, given the potential impact of non-recurring charges to the GAAP operating income and diluted EPS, we cannot provide forecasted GAAP operating income or diluted EPS or the probable significance of such items without unreasonable efforts. As such, we do not present a reconciliation of forecasted non-GAAP operating income and diluted EPS to corresponding forecasted GAAP amounts.Signet's third quarter and full year Fiscal 2024 guidance for sales, operating income and diluted EPS is provided on a non-GAAP basis.Third QuarterFiscal 2024 (2)Total sales$1.36 billion to $1.41 billion$7.10 billion to $7.30 billionOperating income (1)$10 million to $25 million$635 million to $675 millionDiluted EPS (1)$9.55 to $10.14(1) See description of non-GAAP financial measures below.(2) Fiscal 2024 is a 53-week fiscal year for Signet, ending February 3, 2024, driven by the retail industry calendar.

The Company's guidance contemplates annual market share gains against this total industry performance range.Planned capital investments up to $200 million, reflecting investments in banner differentiation, including stores, Connected Commerce capabilities, and digital and technology advancement.The Company continues to expect headwinds in engagements with recovery beginning later in Fiscal 2024, and further rebound over the next three years. Bridal overall, inclusive of engagements, historically represents nearly 50% of Signet's merchandise sales.Annual tax rate of approximately 19% excludes additional discrete items.Diluted EPS for Fiscal 2024 includes the repurchase of an additional 0.7 million shares during Q2 of FY24, the dilutive effect of the 8.2 million preferred shares and excludes the impact of any further share repurchases beyond what is reported today.Our Purpose and Sustainable Growth:As a company with a Purpose-inspired business strategy, Signet is committed to ongoing leadership in Corporate Citizenship &amp; Sustainability and views Environmental, Social and Governance (""ESG"") initiatives as an important growth driver.

The Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, can provide more information to assist investors in evaluating historical trends and current period performance and liquidity. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, the GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release and the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.The Company reports the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (""EPS""), free cash flow, sales changes on a constant currency basis, and adjusted debt and adjusted net debt leverage ratios.Non-GAAP operating income is a non-GAAP measure defined as operating income excluding the impact of certain items which management believes are not necessarily reflective of normal operational performance during a period. Management finds the information useful when analyzing operating results to appropriately evaluate the performance of the business without the impact of these certain items. Management believes the consideration of measures that exclude such items can assist in the comparison of operational performance in different periods which may or may not include such items. Management also utilizes non-GAAP operating margin, defined as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of total sales, to further evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the Company's flexible operating model.Non-GAAP diluted EPS is a non-GAAP measure defined as diluted EPS excluding the impact of certain items which management believes are not necessarily reflective of normal operational performance during a period. Management finds the information useful when analyzing financial results in order to appropriately evaluate the performance of the business without the impact of these certain items. In particular, management believes the consideration of measures that exclude such items can assist in the comparison of performance in different periods which may or may not include such items. The Company estimates the tax effect of all non-GAAP adjustments by applying a statutory tax rate to each item. The income tax items represent the discrete amount that affected the diluted EPS during the period.Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as the net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. Management considers this metric to be helpful in understanding how the business is generating cash from its operating and investing activities that can be used to meet the financing needs of the business. Free cash flow is an indicator frequently used by management in evaluating its overall liquidity needs and determining appropriate capital allocation strategies. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes.The Company provides the year-over-year change in total sales excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to provide transparency to performance and enhance investors' understanding of underlying business trends. The effect from foreign currency, calculated on a constant currency basis, is determined by applying current year average exchange rates to prior year sales in local currency.The adjusted debt and adjusted net debt leverage ratios are non-GAAP measures calculated by dividing Signet's adjusted debt or adjusted net debt by adjusted EBITDAR. Adjusted debt is a non-GAAP measure defined as debt recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheet, plus Preferred Shares, plus an adjustment for operating leases (5x annual rent expense). Adjusted net debt, a non-GAAP measure, is adjusted debt less the cash and cash equivalents on hand as of the balance sheet dates. Adjusted EBITDAR is a non-GAAP measure, defined as earnings before interest and income taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, other non-operating expense, net and certain non-GAAP accounting adjustments (""Adjusted EBITDA"") and further excludes minimum fixed rent expense for properties occupied under operating leases. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR are considered important indicators of operating performance as they exclude the effects of financing and investing activities by eliminating the effects of interest, depreciation and amortization costs and certain accounting adjustments. Management believes these financial measures are helpful to investors and analysts to analyze trends in Signet's business and evaluate Signet's performance. The adjusted debt leverage ratio is a key priority of the Company's capital allocation strategy used in measuring the Company's optimized capital structure. The adjusted net debt leverage is supplemental to this ratio as it is deemed useful to both investors and management to consider cash on hand available to pay down debt. The adjusted debt and adjusted net debt leverage ratios are presented on a trailing twelve-month (""TTM"") basis, which uses Adjusted EBITDAR calculated on the prior four fiscal quarters.The following information provides reconciliations of the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to presented non-GAAP financial measures.Free cash flow26 weeks ended(in millions)July 29, 2023July 30, 2022Net cash used in operating activities$             (253.3)$             (114.9)Purchase of property, plant and equipment(55.4)(58.2)Free cash flow $             (308.7)$             (173.1) Non-GAAP operating income13 weeks ended26 weeks ended(in millions)July 29, 2023July 30, 2022July 29, 2023July 30, 2022Total GAAP operating income$                90.2$              186.8$              191.9$              187.0Litigation charges (1)——(3.0)190.0Acquisition and integration-related costs (2)4.86.412.610.8Restructuring charges (3)4.2—4.2—Asset impairments (3)3.5—3.5—Total non-GAAP operating income$              102.7$              193.2$              209.2$              387.8 North America segment non-GAAP operating income13 weeks ended26 weeks ended(in millions)July 29, 2023July 30, 2022July 29, 2023July 30, 2022North America segment GAAP operating income $              117.1$              210.1$              241.8$              234.9Litigation charges (1)——(3.0)190.0Acquisition and integration-related costs (2)4.86.412.610.8Restructuring charges (3)4.2—4.2—Asset impairments (3)3.5—3.5—North America segment non-GAAP operating income$              129.6$              216.5$              259.1$              435.7 Non-GAAP income tax provision13 weeks ended26 weeks ended(in millions)July 29, 2023July 30, 2022July 29, 2023July 30, 2022GAAP income tax expense (benefit)$                17.2$                35.6$                26.7$              (19.6)Litigation charges (1)——(0.8)47.7Pension settlement loss (6)—0.24.125.2Acquisition and integration-related costs (2)1.21.53.12.6Restructuring charges (3)1.1—1.1—Asset impairments (3)0.9—0.9—Non-GAAP income tax expense$                20.4$                37.3$                35.1$                55.9 Non-GAAP effective tax rate13 weeks endedJuly 29, 2023July 30, 2022GAAP effective tax rate18.6 %19.7 %Acquisition and integration-related costs (2)0.4 %0.1 %Restructuring charges (3)0.3 %— %Asset impairments (3)0.2 %— %Non-GAAP effective tax rate19.5 %19.8 % Non-GAAP diluted EPS13 weeks ended26 weeks endedJuly 29, 2023July 30, 2022July 29, 2023July 30, 2022GAAP diluted EPS$                1.38$                2.58$                3.17$                0.90Litigation charges (1)——(0.06)3.82Pension settlement loss (6)—0.02—2.67Acquisition and integration-related costs (2)0.090.110.240.22Restructuring charges (3)0.08—0.08—Asset impairments (3)0.06—0.06—Dilution effect (4)———(0.53)Tax impact of items above (5)(0.06)(0.03)(0.16)(1.53)Non-GAAP diluted EPS$                1.55$                2.68$                3.33$                5.55 Adjusted debt and adjusted net debt leverage ratiosAs of(in millions)July 29, 2023July 30, 2022Adjusted debt and adjusted net debt:Current portion of long-term debt$              147.5$                    —Long-term debt—147.2Redeemable Series A Convertible Preference Shares654.7653.0Adjustments:5x Rent expense2,232.02,212.5Adjusted debt$           3,034.2$           3,012.7Less: Cash and cash equivalents690.2851.7Adjusted net debt$           2,344.0$           2,161.0TTM Adjusted EBITDAR$           1,332.1$           1,547.5Adjusted debt leverage ratio2.3x1.9xAdjusted net debt leverage ratio1.8x1.4x 26 weeks ended52 week period ended52 week period ended(in millions)July 29, 2023July 30, 2022July 31, 2021January 28, 2023January 29, 2022July 29, 2023July 30,2022Calculation:ABCDEA + D - BB + E - CAdjusted EBITDAR:Net income$       172.5$         61.9$     363.0$       376.7$       769.9$       487.3$       468.8Income taxes26.7(19.6)23.074.5114.5120.871.9Interest (income) expense, net(7.4)7.88.313.516.9(1.7)16.4Depreciation and amortization86.779.883.7164.5163.5171.4159.6Amortization of unfavorable contracts(0.9)(0.9)(2.4)(1.8)(3.3)(1.8)(1.8)Share-based compensation25.222.925.542.045.844.343.2Other non-operating (income)      expense, net (6)0.1136.9(0.2)140.22.13.4139.2Other accounting adjustments (7)17.3200.8(2.2)245.54.762.0207.7Adjusted EBITDA$       320.2$       489.6$     498.7$    1,055.1$    1,114.1$       885.7$    1,105.0Rent expense220.5220.6221.4446.5443.3446.4442.5Adjusted EBITDAR$       540.7$       710.2$     720.1$    1,501.6$    1,557.4$    1,332.1$    1,547.5Footnotes to Non-GAAP Reconciliation Tables(1)Fiscal 2024 includes a credit to income related to the adjustment of the prior litigation accrual.

It kept bothering her, and Russell's doctor said the only way to heal it would be to stay off her feet. At 88 years old, it probably didn't help that her favorite thing to do at Walgreens was to help unload the trucks.She proudly admits that she helped unload her last truck the month before she officially retired in May 2023, 67 years after she started working for the company. That makes her the longest-serving employee in Walgreens history.Russell spent the last 25 years of her career at Walgreens store #3013, located on Elvis Presley Boulevard in Memphis, Tennessee. Her title at retirement was inventory specialist, but Russell worked at many stores and held various positions throughout her career. She even served as a store assistant manager in Huntsville, Alabama. Russell says it was the people that kept her coming into work each day for 67 years-customers, team members, everyone.""I saw one of my customers at the grocery store the other day and she said, &amp;lsquo;Where have you been?'"" Russell says through laughter. ""And I said, &amp;lsquo;Well, I don't work there anymore. I retired!""Jan. 30, 1956, was Russell's first day of employment at Walgreens. At the time, many Walgreens stores had cafeterias inside them, and her first job was taking customer orders at the cafeteria counter in a Memphis-area Walgreens. She remembers that first role fondly and especially enjoyed the crowds that came in when conventions were in the area.""We sold slices of strawberry pie for 35 cents,"" she says. She even has a photo of herself next to the sign advertising that affordable treat.Russell also says she's liked watching-and being a part of-the company grow to its nearly 9,000 store footprint nationwide.""There weren't too many Walgreens when I started, but then they started this program of building 12 stores a year. And that's when we got stores on every corner,"" she says, recalling that she and her colleagues would help stock those stores' shelves to prepare them for opening.Working at Walgreens became a family affair when Russell's son and daughter both applied for jobs to make extra money while attending college. Russell also has two grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Married for 64 years, her husband Robert died about a decade ago.""That'll make you get out and work more,"" Russell says. ""That's the reason I hated to give up work but there comes a time when you have to make other plans.""And right now, Russell's immediate plans include well-deserved rest and relaxation.""I'm just gonna take it easy the rest of this year and see what comes next year. Hopefully a new body,"" she says with a laugh.Russell will celebrate her 89th birthday on Aug. 9, but she says the secret to longevity is no secret at all.""Take care of yourself. Money can't buy health,"" she says.And in taking care of herself, she took care of so many others during her 67 years at Walgreens.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Sysco (NYSE:SYY). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Sysco Sysco's Improving ProfitsSysco has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. As a result, we'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. Sysco's EPS shot up from US$2.65 to US$3.51; a result that's bound to keep shareholders happy. That's a fantastic gain of 32%.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. EBIT margins for Sysco remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 11% to US$76b. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Sysco.Story continuesAre Sysco Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Sysco, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Holding US$58m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders.

To skip our detailed analysis of the green energy market and Goldman Sachs' second quarter holdings, you can go directly to see the Goldman Sachs Solar and Green Energy Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.The Global Climate Change EnvironmentRenewable energy and the sources from which it is borne, such as wind and solar, have become hot topics not only among your everyday consumers but also among businesses, investors, and financial professionals. As global warming continues to ramp up with each passing moment, the global community is becoming increasingly fixated on ways to curb the impact of rapid climate change in an attempt to preserve the planet and its resources for future generations. As a result of this sense of urgency, renewable energy and the companies working to make such energy available have both steadily begun to gain popularity among consumers, governments, and businesses alike.According to the United States Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, renewable energy was generating about 20% of all US electricity in 2022. Of this 20%, 9.2% comes from wind, 6.3% from hydropower, 2.8% from solar, 1.3% from biomass, and 0.4% from geothermal resources. In 2022 alone, solar and wind energy resources were expected to add over 60% of the utility-scale generating capacity to the US power grid, representing a split of 46% from solar and 17% from wind. This widespread use of renewable energy in the country has many reasons. One notable reason is the continued effort on the part of the government to promote renewable energy-related programs and projects. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, there are several programs in place right now for the purpose of promoting the use of sustainable energy. These include the Combined Heat and Power Partnership, Energy Star, and WaterSense. The Combined Heat and Power Partnership program aims to reduce the environmental impact of power generation by promoting the use of combined heat and power. At the same time, Energy Star is working to provide an energy management strategy that can help measure current energy performance, set goals, track energy savings, and reward improvements. Finally, the WaterSense program is working to protect the American water supply by offering simpler ways to use less water with water-efficient products.Story continues""This Country Should Be Ahead Of Where It Is""These are merely a few examples of the immense effort that is going into promoting renewable energy in the US today. Such efforts are also aiding companies like Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG), and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in their renewable energy projects today. Despite this, major investors such as billionaire Warren Buffett still believe that the country is falling behind its environmental obligations. Here's what Buffett had to say on his company's contributions to the renewable energy space at the 2023 Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting:""We've probably spent more money than any other utility I'd guess in the United States. And we've just scratched the surface. But it is not easy when you cross state lines, I mean you have different jurisdictions. This country should be ahead of where it is in terms of transmission. We have been the biggest factor in helping that.""Buffett's comments make it clear that there is an expectation of major companies in the US to make large contributions to the continuing progress of the renewable energy transformation. Many companies have been following suit with environmental programs and projects to make these very contributions for the betterment of the environment and the planet as a whole. Considering the amount of money and effort that is thus being piled into this space at the moment, we have compiled a list of some of the top renewable energy and solar stocks to invest in according to Goldman Sachs, an institutional investor. These include some of the best solar and green energy stocks to buy today for those looking to invest in renewable energy in the face of climate change.Goldman Sachs Solar and Green Energy Stocks: Top 10 Stock PicksPhoto by Jason Blackeye on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe went through Goldman Sachs' 13F holdings for the second quarter to pick 10 solar and green energy stocks the institutional investor was seen to be holding in that quarter.

86,76169d96-a5fc-324d-b712-100aca8e9691,ADM,2023-08-31,30 Countries With Most Arable Land In The World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/30-countries-most-arable-land-211725458.html,1693430245,STORY,"['BG', 'DE', 'ADM']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at 30 countries with the most arable land in the world. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the global agriculture industry, you can go directly to see 5 Countries With Most Arable Land In The World.Arable land can be defined as land that is either currently used or potentially capable of being used to grow seasonal crops. Arable land can be beneficial for any country as it can mean more food and reduced starvation. Countries with more arable land can be more self-sufficient and politically independent as importation of food can be minimized.More land means more space for activities including gardening, farming and agriculture. In one of our previous articles about the biggest landowners in the US, we mentioned that land is an excellent hedge against inflation. Land can also be an important asset which becomes more valuable with time as the population grows and so does the demand for food and agriculture all around the world.Agriculture Industry Poised for Growth as Global Population SwellsPreviously, the COVID-19 crisis acted as a massive restraint on the global agriculture industry as supply chains were disrupted and consumption declined due to trade restrictions and lockdowns imposed by governments around the world. Moreover, farmers in various countries faced challenges in harvesting and marketing their products. However, as the lockdowns have eased down, the agriculture market has since started to recover.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has hurt businesses in the agriculture industry because of the economic sanctions on multiple countries and the supply chain disruptions. It is important to note that Russia ranks among the biggest food producing countries in the world. Despite the challenges that the agriculture industry has been faced with, it is expected to continue growing in the coming years. According to Research and Markets, the global agriculture industry was valued at around $12.25 trillion in 2022. Looking forward, the agriculture market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 9.1% during 2023-2027, propelling the market to reach above $19 trillion by the end of the forecasted period. Story continuesThe world's population is growing and the growth is not expected to slow down anytime soon. According to the latest estimates by the United Nations, the global population had reached 8 billion in November 2022. It is expected to grow to 9.7 billion by 2050. In one of our articles about the most grown crops in the world, we mentioned that according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), agricultural production must increase 60% by 2050 to feed the global population.Rising population has created more demand for food and agriculture. Global farming activities, crop production, and agricultural activities will have to increase to meet the demand as population swells. Agriculture companies are expected to invest increasingly in arable land for agribusiness and crop production to satisfy the demand while also increasing their presence, activities, and profitability. Agribusiness is currently in high demand, and some companies that are expected to benefit as population and demand for food and agriculture grows include Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG), and Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE).Severe warming, flooding, and droughts may reduce yields and dampen the growth of the global agriculture market in the coming years. On August 28, Reuters reported that according to estimates by authorities and the industry, heavy rains in Chile’s central south farming region could have caused at least $1 billion in losses. The government declared a state of catastrophe because of the extreme weather conditions. Chile is a strong agricultural and forestry exporter with shipments of fresh fruit and nuts, pulp, wine and wood. The government issued an agricultural emergency for 100 municipalities while also approving around $8.3 million to replace irrigation infrastructure, canal systems and other aid measures for farmers.What are Some of the Biggest Companies in the Agriculture Market Up To?On August 18, Reuters reported that Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE) posted strong profits but investors were concerned as sales are slowing down for the world's largest farm equipment maker. However, despite volatility in markets worldwide, the demand from farmers looking for new equipment and parts to repair aging fleets is bolstering Deere &amp; Company’s (NYSE:DE) sales. The post also mentions that according to the executives, order books for North American agriculture equipment remain strong and are largely pre-sold for the rest of the year. For fiscal 2023, Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE) raised its guidance and said it now expects to report net income in the range of $9.75 billion and $10.00 billion, up from its previous range of between $9.25 billion and $9.50 billion.On August 18, Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE) reported strong earnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $10.20, surpassing EPS estimates by $1.99. The company reported a revenue of $14.28 billion and outperformed revenue estimates by $219.62 million.Here are some comments from Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE) Q3 2023 earnings call:“Starting from the top, all of our North America large ag production is sold out for this year. We expect ending year-over-year changes in new field inventory to be modest. In-season inventory increases have largely corresponded to our quarterly production schedules, which will come down in the fourth quarter. Combine inventory, for example, saw its highest level in the second quarter and is currently down from its peak. We will see that figure step down further in connection with seasonal retail activity ahead of harvest. And while high horsepower tractor inventory remains sequentially flattish in the third quarter, we'll see that drop off at the end of the fourth quarter, which is typically the highest retail quarter for tractors. Keep in mind that combines and high horsepower tractors are 95%-plus retail sold to customers already.”It seems that the adoption of farming robots will grow in the near future as the potential benefits are significant and can revolutionize the agricultural industry. On August 29, Reuters reported that Solinftec, a Brazilian agriculture startup, is looking to speed up deliveries of its farming robots in Brazil and the US. The Solic AG Robotics unit, which costs around $50,000, can scout crops and monitor development of individual plants, and also target-spray herbicide to reduce costs. Britaldo Hernandez, CEO of Solinftec, said that the robot is powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and includes a ""hunter"" feature that uses light beams and electrical shocks to eliminate insects. According to Soliftec, farmers in the US corn belt tested the robot's sprayer feature and were able to reduce herbicide use by up to 95%. The company claims that the robot aims to help food producers use analytics to improve yields and engage in more sustainable production practices while also avoiding waste.On June 13, Reuters reported that Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) and Glencore PLC’s (LON:GLEN) Viterra are merging to create an agricultural trading giant worth about $34 billion including debt. Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) shareholders will own about 70% of the company as Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) will pay for a major chunk of the deal with cash. The report also mentions that the deal is unprecedented in size in the global agriculture market. It comes after Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) posted record adjusted profits in 2022, benefiting from shortage of global grain supplies due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The deal is expected to close in mid-2024.Now that we have discussed some recent developments in the agriculture sector and what some of the top key players in the market are up to, let's take a look at the 30 countries with most arable land in the world.30 Countries With Most Arable Land In The WorldNitrogen, Fertilizer, AgricultureMethodologyIn this article, we have listed the 30 countries with most arable land in the world.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Archer-Daniels-Midland's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Archer-Daniels-Midland is:16% = US$4.2b ÷ US$25b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.16 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Archer-Daniels-Midland's Earnings Growth And 16% ROETo start with, Archer-Daniels-Midland's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 13% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. Probably as a result of this, Archer-Daniels-Midland was able to see an impressive net income growth of 24% over the last five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Archer-Daniels-Midland's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 8.7% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Archer-Daniels-Midland's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Archer-Daniels-Midland Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Archer-Daniels-Midland's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 31%, meaning the company retains 69% of its income. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the high growth we discussed above, it looks like Archer-Daniels-Midland is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Moreover, Archer-Daniels-Midland is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 34%. However, Archer-Daniels-Midland's future ROE is expected to decline to 11% despite there being not much change anticipated in the company's payout ratio.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Archer-Daniels-Midland's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

The question of interest is, is the stock significantly undervalued? This article provides a detailed valuation analysis of the company. Keep reading to learn more.Company IntroductionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with HST. Click here to check it out. HST 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of HSTHost Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) owns 78 predominantly urban and resort upper-upscale and luxury hotel properties, which represents over 42,000 rooms, mainly in the United States. The company recently sold off its interests in a joint venture owning a portfolio of hotels throughout Europe and other joint ventures that owned properties in Asia and the United States. The majority of Host's portfolio operates under the Marriott and Starwood brands.The company's stock price is $15.92, with a market cap of $11.30 billion. However, the GF Value, an estimation of fair value, is $27.55. This discrepancy paves the way for a more profound exploration of the company's value.Unveiling Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (HST)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideSummarizing GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure of a stock's intrinsic value, derived from historical trading multiples, an adjustment factor based on the company's past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates.Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (NASDAQ:HST) appears to be significantly undervalued based on GuruFocus' valuation method. GF Value estimates the stock's fair value based on three key factors: historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the stock's share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. On the other hand, if the stock's share price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and have high future returns.Story continuesBecause Host Hotels &amp; Resorts is significantly undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much higher than its business growth.Unveiling Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (HST)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideFinancial StrengthCompanies with poor financial strength offer investors a high risk of permanent capital loss. To avoid permanent capital loss, an investor must do their research and review a company's financial strength before deciding to purchase shares. Both the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage of a company are a great way to understand its financial strength. Host Hotels &amp; Resorts has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.17, which ranks better than 74.44% of 720 companies in the REITs industry. The overall financial strength of Host Hotels &amp; Resorts is 5 out of 10, which indicates that the financial strength of Host Hotels &amp; Resorts is fair.Unveiling Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (HST)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthCompanies that have been consistently profitable over the long term offer less risk for investors who may want to purchase shares. Higher profit margins usually dictate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. Host Hotels &amp; Resorts has been profitable 8 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $5.20 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $1.05. Its operating margin is 15.56%, which ranks worse than 85.31% of 667 companies in the REITs industry. Overall, the profitability of Host Hotels &amp; Resorts is ranked 6 out of 10, which indicates fair profitability.Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus' research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing, the company usually creates value for its shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. Likewise, if a company's revenue and earnings are declining, the value of the company will decrease. Host Hotels &amp; Resorts's 3-year average revenue growth rate is worse than 67.56% of 635 companies in the REITs industry. Host Hotels &amp; Resorts's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -6.6%, which ranks worse than 68.02% of 541 companies in the REITs industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother way to evaluate a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts's ROIC was 6.8, while its WACC came in at 9.09.Unveiling Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (HST)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideConclusionOverall, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (NASDAQ:HST) stock gives every indication of being significantly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair and its profitability is fair. Its growth ranks worse than 68.02% of 541 companies in the REITs industry.

(NYSE:LUV) For Its Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-might-not-sense-buy-100145878.html,1693476105,STORY,['LUV'],"[Readers hoping to buy Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Thus, you can purchase Southwest Airlines' shares before the 5th of September in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 27th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.18 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$0.72 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Southwest Airlines has a trailing yield of 2.3% on the current share price of $31.63. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Southwest Airlines's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether Southwest Airlines can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. See our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Southwest Airlines is paying out an acceptable 55% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Southwest Airlines's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 29% a year over the previous five years. When earnings per share fall, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid also falls.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Southwest Airlines has delivered an average of 34% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. Growing the dividend payout ratio while earnings are declining can deliver nice returns for a while, but it's always worth checking for when the company can't increase the payout ratio any more - because then the music stops.To Sum It UpHas Southwest Airlines got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Southwest Airlines had an average payout ratio, but its free cash flow was lower and earnings per share have been declining. It's not that we think Southwest Airlines is a bad company, but these characteristics don't generally lead to outstanding dividend performance.With that being said, if you're still considering Southwest Airlines as an investment, you'll find it beneficial to know what risks this stock is facing. To help with this, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Southwest Airlines (1 is potentially serious!) that you ought to be aware of before buying the shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Boyd Group International President Mike Boyd joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the safeguards in place to monitor pilots, including their own labor unions.""Now, we have systems if a pilot is fired at one airline, there's basically a database that will tell another airline what happened there, supposedly,"" Boyd says. ""It's getting better, but we're dealing with humans.""Boyd details the pressure working pilots may be feeling under labor shortages and the counseling services that airlines and unions offer.Video Transcript- When you think about the idea that perhaps some pilots don't feel comfortable coming forward because it means they'll be barred from the cockpit, talk about some of the what goes into some of the decision-making behind this and perhaps some of the support that you think would benefit some of these pilots.MIKE BOYD: Well, yes, some of them really don't have a lot of faith or trust in the FAA, and that's understandable. But keep in mind too the majority of US airline pilots have labor unions, ALPA, APA, SWAPA, and these are more safety organizations every bit as much as they are labor organizations. So that's probably the refuge they should take because they have professionals who can work with that. Let's keep in mind, this is a very, very small percentage of people in that pilot population.- How does this change, if at all, the existing, the training, the work through that for a lot of commercial airlines, and you were mentioning kind of that part of this larger figure, how they evaluate and make sure that pilots are fit for even going through training in order to get onto some of the flight schedules?MIKE BOYD: Well now, we have systems. If a pilot is fired at one airline, there's basically a database that will tell another airline what happened there supposedly. So we have that safeguard in place, and that was from some accident that happened back in the '90s. So it's getting better.Story continuesBut we're dealing with humans, and humans do crazy things. The Chinese captain that-- actually co-pilot at that point who flew an airplane straight into the ground in China, there were no indications he had any problems other than being demoted. We don't know, we're all human, and these things can happen but it's not something the consumer should be really worried about.- And Mike, obviously this is something that people would have to self-report. But as you mentioned there, if you're saying that this isn't perhaps a broader problem. But in terms of the checks and balances that are out there for pilots, especially since there was a pilot shortage, you had COVID a lot of times when you weren't seeing a lot of pilots getting trained, how much pressure are pilots under on a day to day basis?MIKE BOYD: Well, they're under probably as much pressure as before, the problem is they may be doing some more flying. But keep in mind, there are limits to what they can fly. Now, there's always been arguments between airline crews schedulers and pilots that goes back to ancient times, I think. But the reality of this is that there are limits to what they can fly, and airlines and particularly pilots unions are working very hard to make sure pilots aren't flying out there tired and hungry, if you will.- How can airline operators do better at even baking in counseling services, baking in things that pilots are afraid to self-report in order to make sure that everyone's in the right headspace as they're going about the operation?MIKE BOYD: I think airlines have that. But again, they don't get credit for it, but airline pilots unions have systems like this also for their members because like I say, airline pilots unions are as much safety organizations as they are labor organizations. So pilots do have options there. And you're going to find some people who will lie in every population, every type of category of work.

First, though, they’ll have to book and complete a flight in a relatively short turnaround time.The Companion Pass will let customers bring along a friend or family member on an unlimited number of flights between Jan. 8 and March 8, 2024. All they’ll have to pay is taxes and fees, which start at $5.60 one-way). To earn that, they’ll have to register for the promotion, then book a round trip ticket (or two one-way flights) before 11:59 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 30 and travel before Sept. 30.(Customers must be members of Southwest’s Rapid Rewards program and include their Rapid Rewards number during booking.)It’s a narrow window, but a notable reward. Generally, companion passes are only offered to people who fly 100 qualifying one-way flights or earn 135,000 points during the calendar year.""We want our customers to feel appreciated for flying with Southwest, and what better way to do that than to offer the opportunity to travel and share experiences with a companion,"" said Jonathan Clarkson, Vice President Marketing at Southwest Airlines in a statement.Travelers aren’t locked in with the same companion every flight, either. Southwest will allows them to change the name up to three times during the promotional period.Southwest is the only airline offering an extended free companion pass right now, but other carriers have been incentivizing frequent flyers with unlimited flight passes recently. Frontier Airlines has been particularly aggressive with those, cutting the price to $399 at one point.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

For instance, we bought DexCom, Inc. at a $950 million market cap in 2012, and it is now valued at $50 billion (the stock has appreciated 41% annually since the Fund’s initial purchase). TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) has grown from $1.1 billion at purchase to $49 billion presently (and the stock has appreciated 29% annually since the Fund’s initial purchase 17 years ago).

Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.TransDigm Group's stock is estimated to be modestly overvalued based on the GuruFocus Value calculation. As a result, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be lower than its business growth.TransDigm Group (TDG): An In-Depth Analysis of its Modest OvervaluationLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthCompanies with poor financial strength pose a high risk of permanent capital loss.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the financial sector and its performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Financial Dividend Stocks To Invest In.Over the years, the finance industry in the US has gone through several changes. The onset of the pandemic and the recent banking crisis have made these changes even more intense. Following the failure of three major US banks in March this year, worried customers and investors rushed to withdraw their funds. CNN reported that these banks had about $559 billion in total assets, surpassing the $523 billion held by 25 banks that collapsed in 2008 when accounting for inflation.The effects of the pandemic have resulted in financial companies from Wall Street shifting away from New York City and moving to the Sun Belt region. According to Bloomberg, the firms are taking almost $1 trillion worth of managed assets with them. This move is being driven by factors like taxes and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also by practical and cultural reasons. Amid the pandemic, factors like no state income tax, pleasant weather, and business-friendly offers encouraged New York-based hedge fund billionaires to move their businesses to Florida. The report also mentioned that between the beginning of 2020 and the end of March 2023, over 370 investment companies, which is about 2.5% of all US investment firms, shifted their main offices to a different state. These companies collectively managed assets worth $2.7 trillion.In one of the recent developments, shares of several US banks dropped on August 22. This happened after S&amp;P Global, a rating agency, lowered credit ratings for certain regional banks that are heavily involved in commercial real estate. These banks include KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA), and Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE:ASB). This action came after a similar move by Moody's. Both of these rating agencies are making these changes because of an ongoing banking crisis that started in March.Story continuesS&amp;P Global mentioned challenging conditions affecting the banking sector. Here is what the credit agency said in its report:""The sharp rise in interest rates and quantitative tightening deployed since March 2022 to combat high inflation are weighing on many U.S. banks' funding, liquidity and spread income. These factors have also caused the value of banks' assets to fall and raised the odds of asset quality deterioration.""Investing in financial stocks means putting money into the top businesses that offer banking, insurance, credit cards, and various other financial services around the world. Since the financial sector is central to the worldwide economy, it's a smart idea for investors to seriously think about including financial stocks as a significant part of their investment collections. Due to the ongoing issues in the finance industry, the sector is struggling to match the pace of the market. The S&amp;P 500 Financials, which tracks the performance of some of the most prominent finance companies such as Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), is down by 1.11% year-to-date. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 gained 14.44% this year so far.Also read: 12 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy NowInvesting in dividend stocks within the finance sector can be a prudent strategy for income investors. However, it's essential to note that the finance sector can be sensitive to economic fluctuations and regulatory changes.

To skip our detailed analysis of the green energy market and Goldman Sachs' second quarter holdings, you can go directly to see the Goldman Sachs Solar and Green Energy Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.The Global Climate Change EnvironmentRenewable energy and the sources from which it is borne, such as wind and solar, have become hot topics not only among your everyday consumers but also among businesses, investors, and financial professionals. As global warming continues to ramp up with each passing moment, the global community is becoming increasingly fixated on ways to curb the impact of rapid climate change in an attempt to preserve the planet and its resources for future generations. As a result of this sense of urgency, renewable energy and the companies working to make such energy available have both steadily begun to gain popularity among consumers, governments, and businesses alike.According to the United States Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, renewable energy was generating about 20% of all US electricity in 2022. Of this 20%, 9.2% comes from wind, 6.3% from hydropower, 2.8% from solar, 1.3% from biomass, and 0.4% from geothermal resources. In 2022 alone, solar and wind energy resources were expected to add over 60% of the utility-scale generating capacity to the US power grid, representing a split of 46% from solar and 17% from wind. This widespread use of renewable energy in the country has many reasons. One notable reason is the continued effort on the part of the government to promote renewable energy-related programs and projects. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, there are several programs in place right now for the purpose of promoting the use of sustainable energy. These include the Combined Heat and Power Partnership, Energy Star, and WaterSense. The Combined Heat and Power Partnership program aims to reduce the environmental impact of power generation by promoting the use of combined heat and power. At the same time, Energy Star is working to provide an energy management strategy that can help measure current energy performance, set goals, track energy savings, and reward improvements. Finally, the WaterSense program is working to protect the American water supply by offering simpler ways to use less water with water-efficient products.Story continues""This Country Should Be Ahead Of Where It Is""These are merely a few examples of the immense effort that is going into promoting renewable energy in the US today. Such efforts are also aiding companies like Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG), and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in their renewable energy projects today. Despite this, major investors such as billionaire Warren Buffett still believe that the country is falling behind its environmental obligations. Here's what Buffett had to say on his company's contributions to the renewable energy space at the 2023 Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting:""We've probably spent more money than any other utility I'd guess in the United States. And we've just scratched the surface. But it is not easy when you cross state lines, I mean you have different jurisdictions. This country should be ahead of where it is in terms of transmission. We have been the biggest factor in helping that.""Buffett's comments make it clear that there is an expectation of major companies in the US to make large contributions to the continuing progress of the renewable energy transformation. Many companies have been following suit with environmental programs and projects to make these very contributions for the betterment of the environment and the planet as a whole. Considering the amount of money and effort that is thus being piled into this space at the moment, we have compiled a list of some of the top renewable energy and solar stocks to invest in according to Goldman Sachs, an institutional investor. These include some of the best solar and green energy stocks to buy today for those looking to invest in renewable energy in the face of climate change.Goldman Sachs Solar and Green Energy Stocks: Top 10 Stock PicksPhoto by Jason Blackeye on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe went through Goldman Sachs' 13F holdings for the second quarter to pick 10 solar and green energy stocks the institutional investor was seen to be holding in that quarter.

It has amassed assets over $1.39 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendCompanies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.11%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.23%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 27.10% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 6.76% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN).Performance and RiskGUSA seeks to match the performance of the SOLACTIVE GBS US 1000 INDEX before fees and expenses. The Solactive GBS United States 1000 Index measures the performance of equity securities of large and mid-capitalization equity issuers covering approximately the largest 1,000 of the free-float market capitalization in the United States.Story continuesThe ETF has gained about 18.78% so far this year and is up roughly 13.95% in the last one year (as of 08/31/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $31.16 and $39.71.The ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 21.06% for the trailing three-year period. With about 1012 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesGoldman Sachs MarketBeta U.S. 1000 Equity ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, GUSA is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF has $354.34 billion in assets, SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF has $415.96 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.Bottom-LinePassively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Now, in the wake of the record-breaking Barbie movie, Bratz are mounting a comeback, and they’re recruiting Kylie Jenner to do it.Jenner, who has been compared to the cat-eyed, pouty-lipped doll in the past, is being “Bratzified” in the brand’s first celebrity partnership. The pop culture icon is launching a line of dolls in her likeness, with one doll selling for as much as $100. And the Bratz-Barbie dynamic goes beyond contrasting aesthetics—Bratz’s maker, MGA Entertainment, once went into a nearly decade-long legal battle with Barbie parent Mattel over plagiarism and ownership claims.Bratz were introduced to the public in 2001. The dolls’ distinctive look was defined by their arched eyebrows, bold eyeshadows, and full, glossy lips. They wore fashionable outfits reminiscent of Britney Spears in the ‘90s and were celebrated for their ethnically diverse representation. But they were also criticized for being overtly sexual, and some parents deemed the dolls inappropriate for their young children.Still, Bratz steadily ate into Barbie’s market share, reportedly grossing over $2 billion in sales in its first five years on the market and selling over 150 million dolls within the decade after they were introduced. By 2004, Bratz outsold Barbie in the U.K., the BBC reported. That same year Mattel launched a messy legal battle against MGA Entertainment, plunging the two manufacturing giants into years of litigious twists and turns.You don’t own meIn its lawsuit, Mattel accused Bratz creator Carter Bryant of stealing Mattel’s trade secrets. The Barbie parent asserted that Bryant had been working at Mattel when he first designed what would eventually become the Barbie doll competitor. In 2008, a jury found the claim to be true and awarded Mattel $100 million, but the Ninth Circuit soon overturned the verdict and ordered a new trial.Story continuesIn a turn of events, one federal district court judge allowed MGA to submit a counterclaim before the second trial began. The Bratz manufacturer accused Mattel of engaging in corporate espionage at toy stores and conspiring to keep Bratz products off shelves. In April 2011, a jury sided with MGA, rejecting Mattel’s original claims and ordering Mattel to pay $309 million in damages and legal fees.That verdict didn’t last long, either. Nearly two years later, in January 2013, a three-judge panel unanimously ruled that the trial judge was wrong to have allowed the jury to consider MGA’s counterclaims since they were unrelated to Mattel’s initial lawsuit. But the panel allowed MGA to keep $137 million for legal fees, and the smaller competitor lived on to keep selling its dolls.The “Bratizification” of Kylie JennerNow, beauty and fashion mogul Jenner is jumping into the fray by launching a new line of Bratz dolls. The partnership with Jenner, first announced Aug. 1, is the brand’s first celebrity Bratz collection, and includes miniatures of a “Bratzified Kylie” in some of her most iconic looks, like the lavender Versace gown she wore to the Met Gala in 2019. The mini collectibles sell in packs of two, retailing for $9.99 on the Bratz website.The partnership was expanded on Aug. 21 with the release of the “Bratz x Kylie Fashion Dolls - Night and Day,” preorders retailing for $29.99 on the brand’s website, and the “Bratz x Kylie 24-inch Fashion Doll,” preorders retailing for $99.99 on Amazon.Jenner, 26, is the youngest member of the famed Kardashian-Jenner family, which includes sisters Kim Kardashian and Kendall Jenner, and mother Kris Jenner. Her makeup company, Kylie Cosmetics, has helped propel her net worth to $680 million, prompting Forbes to name Jenner the youngest self-made woman for six consecutive years. (The “self-made” moniker has sparked backlash given Jenner’s background as the youngest child of a wealthy celebrity family; she has defended herself by telling to Paper Magazine her parents, Kris and Caitlyn Jenner, cut her off at age 15, and that while she “did have a platform… none of my money is inherited."")Jenner said in a release that she’s “been a fan of Bratz since childhood and I’ve always wanted my own Bratz doll.” She’s even been compared to one, including by her own family.“Kylie truly embodies everything Bratz has stood for since its inception,” Bratz creative director Jasmin Larian said in the same release, describing her as “disruptive and rebellious” and “energetic and expressive.”But not all Bratz fans are pleased that Jenner will represent the brand. Some have criticized the company for choosing a white woman for the partnership when it was Bratz dolls’ varying skin tones and hair textures that gave them cultural significance and set them apart from Barbie, especially among girls of color. Jenner and other members of the Kardashian-Jenner clan have also been accused of “blackfishing”—a term for white influencers appropriating the beauty standards and aesthetics of Black people, such as darkening their skin or wearing Fulani braids.One person posted on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter: “Giving Kylie (a white woman who modeled her face/body around Black women) her own Bratz doll (which is an arguably more Urban/Black presenting doll) before an ACTUAL Black woman is… weird.”In many ways, Jenner is a smart choice for the partnership given her massive social influence and Bratz-y aura. However, that doesn’t mean she was necessarily the right choice in a society that often overlooks women of color in favor of their white counterparts.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, Schlumberger investors that purchase the stock on or after the 5th of September will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 12th of October.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.25 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.00 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Schlumberger has a trailing yield of 1.7% on the current share price of $59. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for Schlumberger Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Schlumberger paid out a comfortable 31% of its profit last year. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 42% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's positive to see that Schlumberger's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's encouraging to see Schlumberger has grown its earnings rapidly, up 31% a year for the past five years. Schlumberger is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Schlumberger has seen its dividend decline 0.9% per annum on average over the past 10 years, which is not great to see.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Schlumberger? It's great that Schlumberger is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. It's disappointing to see the dividend has been cut at least once in the past, but as things stand now, the low payout ratio suggests a conservative approach to dividends, which we like. Schlumberger looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.So while Schlumberger looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. Our analysis shows 3 warning signs for Schlumberger and you should be aware of them before buying any shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

NSP is benefiting from its consistent efforts to reward shareholders and solid liquidity. The company has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 15%.Factors Favoring NSPInsperity looks strong on the back of a growing professional employer organization (“PEO”) industry. PEO industry is currently being driven by growth of small and medium-sized businesses, increased need of providing employee benefits, raised costs related to workers’ compensation insurance coverage, workplace safety programs, employee-related complaints and litigation, complex regulation of payroll, and payroll tax and employment issues. Related costs of compliance, expenses, time and knowledge required to attain technology infrastructure to administer benefits, HR and payroll processing on an integrated basis are other tailwinds.Insperity reported current ratio of 1.2 at the end of second-quarter 2023, higher than 1.13 at the end of prior-year quarter. Increasing current ratio is desirable as it indicates that the risk of default is less.Insperity puts consistent efforts to reward its shareholders. During the second quarter, NSP repurchased almost 289,000 shares for $35 million and paid out $20 million as cash dividends. Capital expenditures totaled $7.2 million. Such moves indicate NSP’s commitment toward boosting shareholders’ value and underlining its confidence in business.Key RisksThe company is seeing a rise in expenses as it continues to invest in growth, technology, and product and service offerings. Operating expenses jumped 9% year over year to $208.8 million during second-quarter 2023. Operating expenses per worksite employee per month inched up 1.8% to $224.

If you want to skip our introduction to short interest, then check out 5 Stocks With Lowest Short Interest. Short selling is also quite entertaining if you're watching from the sidelines. And it was one aspect of the market that caught media waves by storm during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic. The conditions created by the virus, namely lockdowns that left people with nothing much to do but sit in front of their computer screens and receive money from the government in the form of stimulus checks, created a rather interesting set of conditions. The retail investing boom of the pandemic is a well known fact by now, and one way in which it materialized was in the form of serious share price action around GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME).GameStop is a well known retailer and is a one-stop shop for anyone's gaming needs. However, like other traditional brick and mortar retailers, the firm has struggled to adapt to a digital age, and its operations were particularly harmed when video game developers cut the middle man and allowed gamers to directly download games. Not only did this reduce the price that gamers paid for their favorite titles, but firms also managed to reduce the costs of selling games, in a win win situation for both that left GameStop scratching its head.Analysts and hedge funds were as hawk eyed as ever and had shorted GameStop's shares as they believed that the firm would continue to bleed cash and lose market share. However, retail investors teamed up on Reddit and started buying the company's shares in bulk. These purchases were large enough to boost GameStop's share price from roughly $2.5 in April 2020 to a stunning $483 in January 2021 roughly three weeks after the meme buying frenzy started on Reddit. In the immediate aftermath of the retail stock frenzy, short sellers in GameStop had lost $6 billion and some hedge funds even went out of business.Story continuesSince then, even though GameStop buffeted its cash reserves by issuing more shares, the firm has been unable to successfully undertake a turnaround. GameStop has gone through multiple chief executive officers and chief financial officers and experimented with non fungible tokens (NFTs). The firm continues to post annual losses and its quarterly revenues continue to remain flat. However, GameStop still has plenty of cash left from its earlier share sales, so the jury's still out about the firm. As to what analysts think, the average share price target is $13.10 for a $5 downside from the current share price of $18.37. Analysts have also rated the shares as Underperform which have lost 35% over the past 12 months but made modest 6% gains this year.So, looks like short sellers are often on the dot when they short stocks, and today we'll look at some stocks with the lowest short interest.

(NASDAQ:HOLX) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Hologic The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.09bUS$1.13bUS$1.20bUS$1.24bUS$1.29bUS$1.33bUS$1.36bUS$1.40bUS$1.43bUS$1.47bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x1Est @ 4.02%Est @ 3.46%Est @ 3.07%Est @ 2.79%Est @ 2.60%Est @ 2.46%Est @ 2.37% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$1.0kUS$986US$978US$951US$920US$887US$853US$818US$784US$751(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.9bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.5b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.2%) = US$31bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$31b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$16bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$25b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$76.0, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 25% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Hologic as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.957. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for HologicStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Discovery (WBD) has named former BBC and New York Times executive Mark Thompson as its CEO. It comes at a time of great change for the media industry. Traditional media companies like Disney (DIS), Paramount (PARA), and Warner Bros. Discovery are seeing their cable businesses decline while they are investing a lot of money in their streaming businesses. Activate CEO Michael Wolf says all of these companies are trying to position themselves for the ""direct-to-consumer"" future and, as a result, they will increase their spending on content. Several of the big streamers have started raising prices. Wolf says thinks that, in the future, viewers are going to ""churn in and out among these services, price might not be the reason that determines it. It's just more about the availability of programming on those networks and streaming services,"" Wolf tells Yahoo Finance Live. When it comes to the Hollywood strikes, Wolf calls the timing of the strikes ""inopportune,"" saying the ""profit pools for programming production are drying up"" and that the ""revenue streams for these shows aren't necessarily settled.""Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: CNN has a new CEO. Warner Brothers Discovery appointing Mark Thompson as chief executive of the cable news network. He previously served as director general of the BBC as well as CEO of the ""New York Times."" Thompson coming to CNN at a critical time for the media industry as cord cutting accelerates and traditional TV struggles to keep up.Here to discuss this and much more, we want to bring in Michael Wolf, CEO of Activate. Michael, it's great to see you here. So let's start with CNN's new appointment for their CEO Mark Thompson. Is he the best candidate for this job, and why?MICHAEL WOLF: He comes with an incredible pedigree and an incredible track record. So between understanding television from the BBC and managing a massive news organization to what he accomplished as the CEO of the ""New York Times"" company, especially in terms of building a subscription base and continuing to expand their users-- now, here's what's happening.Story continuesIronically, up until recently, CNN was the largest news website, roughly about 400 million unique visitors. And just recently, ""The New York Times"" overtook it just by a couple of million. And so I think we're going to see-- it's going to continue to, of course, be a race between those two as long-- as well as others-- MSNBC and Fox News and even the ""New York Post"" and, of course, Yahoo Finance.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, we appreciate you adding that Yahoo Finance in there, Michael. You know, this, of course, comes at a time-- when you think about, especially in the streaming space, there's this real divide that's happening between linear and digital. You're talking about CNN, which we tend to think more as linear. You know, Bob Iger over at Disney is looking at options for ESPN and what to do there. I mean, what kind of shakedown you think is coming when you think about brands like Warner Brothers Discovery as well as Disney in terms of linear and digital?MICHAEL WOLF: Yeah, so part of what we're seeing and what really is driving this urge to merge among these companies is the need to really position themselves in this world, where increasingly, we have fewer and fewer subscribers. We now have 70 million people in 70 million homes in the US that are subscribing to cable.And we expect it-- at Activate, we expect it to go down into roughly 60 in the next couple of years. And at the same time, these streaming services are their big cash drains. They're very deep expenses for the next couple of years. And it's no different how long it took for each of these companies to make their cable networks profitable.So cable networks have been the golden goose. Suddenly, we have something new coming on in streaming. They're all trying to position themselves for this future, this direct-to-consumer future. And I think that-- by the way, despite the fact that the CEOs of these companies say that they're going to cut back on their spending on programming, we think and we see and we forecast that there are expenses for and then their investments in programming are going to continue to be at these levels and, in fact, continue to increase.SEANA SMITH: Michael, that, of course, then brings up the question of pricing when it comes to the streaming side of the business, right? Because we know Bob Iger time and time again has reiterated the fact that he is focusing on profitability for their streaming division. And Disney recently raising prices following a number of their competitors who have done so very recently. How do these media companies-- how are they thinking about price hikes and balancing that with making sure that they don't see a massive increase in churn?MICHAEL WOLF: Well, I mean, it's-- you really hit the nail on the head, which is they're trying to strike that right balance. And so the fact that we've seen some decline in Netflix in the last quarter, really some of that reflects a couple of things. One is price increase but the also the eliminating password sharing. And so you would have thought that would have increase the number of subscribers.So I think that what's the bigger issue is not whether those price can be sustained. But also, they're having a lot of churn. It's very easy to watch a set of shows on Disney+ and then drop it and go to Max and watch it.So it's-- we as a firm, we forecast that by 2026, the average subscriber will have six streaming services. They're just not going to be the same six. They're going to churn in and out among these services. Price might not be the reason that determines it. It's just more about the availability of programming on those networks and streaming services.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I'm surprised at that number, Michael, at six because it feels like-- you know, I was thinking back to the conversation with streaming first launched. It was about the optionality. And you--MICHAEL WOLF: Yes.AKIKO FUJITA: --don't have to pay for these massive cable bundles. And it feels like cable is cheaper when you consider six different subscriptions you have to pay for. It feels like increasingly sports could be one that could make a lot of these places very sticky because it is one that comes up on a weekly basis, maybe not as much churn. I mean, how do you think these streaming services are positioning themselves on sports with that very idea in mind that there is a limit to how many streaming services viewers want to subscribe to?MICHAEL WOLF: Yeah, I mean, precisely, they're-- the-- what we're going to see is that-- and already seeing is that between Apple and Peacock and Amazon and others, they're already getting streaming rights for sports. They're not getting all of it. So you've got Amazon with ""Thursday Night Football"" as well as they're going to do one preseason game and a special game on Black Friday. And we're going to see that all the way through to Apple really locking up Major League Soccer for the next year.So we're going to see those games go back and forth. And yes, it's going to be another reason for people to watch. But you can't get all of the games in the same place. So you're going to have to subscribe to different services. And you're going to have to keep watching them on television in order-- if you're really an avid super sports fan.SEANA SMITH: Michael, we're talking about the media landscape right now. We also have to talk about the strike that's going on, right? Because when we talk about the pressure that so many of these media Giants are facing, it almost seems like from all angles, obviously, the strike is another pressure point here for these companies, for the studios, for the streamers. How much more challenging is the next several months going to be the longer that this strike goes on for? And I guess who is best positioned given the circumstances we're in today?MICHAEL WOLF: Yeah, I'm hopeful that the strike won't last forever. Part of it is that the time is really an opportune. The profit pools for programming production are drying up there. Even though there's a whole set of new shows, there-- they're really at much lower cost levels. And so I'm not sure there's going to be a lot of profit left to distribute.And this-- the other reason why it's in an opportune time is because the revenue streams for these shows aren't necessarily settled. And so the actors and the writers may find themselves in a position where they put their earnings more at risk than less as they want to have a piece of the profits. And the profits may not be there.Interestingly, the last time that one of these strikes took place a lot, last time was well over 10 years ago. And at that point, they were arguing about who got residuals from DVD rights. So the world has changed. And yes, the relationships with writers and actors and artists are going to change. But this is a tough time to be making those demands.SEANA SMITH: And it is a tough time, certainly a tough time for both sides right now. All right, Michael, always great to have you. Thanks so much for joining me.MICHAEL WOLF: Great to be here.]"

Industry watchers say that the ""double whammy"" work stoppage has already had serious economic implications, similar to the last writers' strike.According to estimates from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., the 2007-2008 strike cost the Los Angeles County economy a whopping $2.5 billion. That likely will double this time around.Kevin Klowden, chief global strategist at the Milken Institute, estimated the current strikes will soon cost the national economy $5 billion-plus, upwardly revising his previous estimate of $4 billion. He explained that the work stoppage will impact other businesses besides production, including restaurants, catering companies, trucking agencies, and dry cleaning businesses, among many others.""The main thing we're really factoring into it is the lost wages,"" Klowden told Yahoo Finance Live in an interview on Tuesday. He emphasized it's not just the industries in California that will be impacted, but also industries in New York, Atlanta, Albuquerque, Pittsburgh, and other production-friendly locations.On top of lost wages, Klowden said delayed films, including Warner Bros.' ""Dune"" sequel, and cancelled programming, such as Amazon's ""A League of Their Own,"" will also heavily contribute to losses.""Hollywood's been very heavily concentrated in terms of production activity, so anybody who does film and TV — Disney (DIS) is a classic example of that — along with Warner Bros. (WBD), Universal (CMCSA), and even at this point [Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL)] they're all getting affected,"" he said. ""But we don't see it as much on their bottom line as we do on the workers.""Story continuesStill, that doesn't mean these companies won't be hit in the future, Klowden warned.""They can put off costs right now. The catch is [as] they delay movies, that means their ability to get the revenue back, to be able to get their expenditures back, becomes harder and harder. They forego revenues and they forego any ability to easily snap back out of this strike the longer it goes on.""'Suits' resurgence highlights strategy shift amid strikesMembers of the The Writers Guild of America picket outside Paramount Pictures on May 3, 2023, in Los Angeles. Hollywood productions and promotional tours around the world have been put on indefinite hold as actors and writers are on strike against big studios and streaming services.(Ashley Landis/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)In the wake of the strikes, streaming platforms have scrambled to fill their content pipelines with strike-immune programming like reality TV, international series, and, in some cases, live sports and news.Recently, USA Networks drama ""Suits"" saw a resurgence on Netflix after the platform acquired the series in June. According to Nielsen, ""Suits"" — which debuted 12 years ago — attracted a record-breaking 18 billion minutes of viewing time in July.""We might break out of what we're seeing in terms of siloing,"" Klowden said, referencing the massive success of ""Suits,"" which was heavily driven by word of mouth in addition to Netflix strategically promoting the show on its homepage.Other streamers have also hopped on the trend with Warner Bros. Discovery's Max announcing a 60-day deal with AMC that will bring AMC+ programming like ""Fear The Walking Dead"" and ""Killing Eve"" to the platform. WBD already has a licensing deal with Netflix.USA Networks drama ""Suits"" saw a resurgence on Netflix after the platform acquired the series in June. (Courtesy: Shane Mahood/USA Network)Klowden explained the old days of streamers holding on to exclusive content could be over as syndication, or reselling shows to other channels in an effort to revive neglected content, becomes a more lucrative opportunity.""That was essentially the holy grail that people used to talk about,"" Klowden continued, adding syndication was a popular strategy that fueled the creation of channels like TNT and even streamers like Netflix, which held the rights to Paramount's ""Twilight Zone"" before the episodes left the platform in mid-2021.That strategy could speed up the timeline for media consolidation — but most likely only for mid-level companies.""There's only so much consolidation that can really happen and still be effective and efficient,"" he said, adding, ""I think you'll see more on the mid-size where companies look at it and say their financials are under pressure ... you might see more acquisitions that way, rather than at the large cap size.""Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

But analysts are eagerly awaiting final prices, which have yet to be negotiated.In a note Tuesday, Goldman Sachs analysts said the minimal impact to the companies' stocks was because much remains unknown.""We see relatively limited scope for stocks to react materially to the contents of [yesterday] morning’s announcement, given that in our view, potentially the more impactful update will come with the potential disclosure ... of [Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)]' initial maximum fair price offer,"" the analysts said.In lawsuits filed by companies to block or delay negotiations, plaintiffs allege there is uncertainty around what the CMS will determine to be a fair price.Medicare Director and CMS Deputy Administrator Dr. Meena Seshamani told Yahoo Finance that the agency intends to engage in a ""true back-and-forth process"" for negotiations.Farxiga, Xarelto, Entresto, and Eliquis at the New City Halsted Pharmacy on Aug. 29, 2023 in Chicago, Illinois. These are 4 of 10 prescription drugs that will be subject to Medicare price negotiations under the Inflation Reduction Act. The other drugs include Jardiance, Enbrel, Januvia, Imbruvica, Stelara, and Fiasp. (Scott Olson/Getty Images) (Scott Olson via Getty Images)The goal, she said, is to figure out what the real-world impact is for the drugs, so that can be taken into consideration for the price of medications.Analysts have repeatedly said that while the CMS data shows that these drugs account for $50.5 billion, or about 20%, of Part D spend inclusive of out-of-pocket spend, some of the drugs are not necessarily top sellers for the drug manufacturers.""Overall, [yesterday’s] update was largely expected, with key drugs included for price negotiations consisting of Eliquis (BMY) and Imbruvica (ABBV), although the inclusion of Stelara was somewhat unexpected. With biosimilars expected in 2025, however, we do not see this having a large impact on JNJ [Johnson &amp; Johnson],"" JPM analyst Chris Schott said in a note to clients.Story continues""The rest of the drugs, meanwhile, are relatively small revenue/EPS [earnings per share] contributors to their respective stories, and we do not see any meaningful impact to our estimates from today’s update,"" he added.The list included heart disease and diabetes drugs, including insulin from Novo Nordisk (NVO), some cancer drugs, and J&amp;J's autoimmune disease treatment Stelara. The latter was a surprise to experts, in part because it will face generic competition before 2026.Senior administration officials told reporters Tuesday there could be some adjustment to the price based on generic or biosimilar competition hitting the market before September 2024, when the prices are published, but the list would remain the same through 2026 at the least.Leerink Partners estimates the limited impact is also due to the prices only lasting a year, before CMS begins the process again for 2027.""JNJ’s Xarelto and NVS’s Entresto will only be affected for 1 year since they are both expected to lose exclusivity in 2027. If generics are approved for Xarelto or Entresto prior to Mar. 31, 2027 then either would be deselected on Jan. 1, 2028. MRK’s (Graybosch, OP) Januvia and AZN’s Farxiga both have [patents expiring] in 2026, thus minimizing the price control impact of these products given the likelihood of imminent generic entry,"" Leerink analysts said in a note.Meanwhile, until Medicare negotiations start in February, there are several lawsuits that have been filed by drug companies and trade groups calling the process unconstitutional, in hopes of delaying or derailing negotiations.Neera Tanden, domestic policy adviser to President Joe Biden, told reporters Tuesday that the government's health agencies negotiate prices for other parts of the healthcare system all the time.""The only reason why Medicare has not been negotiating drug prices is because pharma got a sweetheart deal decades ago to basically prohibit negotiations. Negotiations are part of market systems; it's very normal,"" Tanden said.The Congressional Budget Office estimates $90.5 billion in savings over 10 years to the Medicare program through these negotiations. Analysts expect roughly 40% reduction in prices for drugs from the negotiations.In response to the companies trading flat on the news Tuesday, Seshamani said, ""I think we know that the pharmaceutical industry is strong and thriving and innovates and will continue to innovate.""Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhem.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Yahoo Finance Health Care Reporter Anjalee Khemlani breaks down the list and how this may impact the pharmaceutical companies who profit from these drugs.The ten drugs and pharma companies impacted are:Eliquis - Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Pfizer (PFE)Jardiance - Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly (LLY)Xarelto- Bayer (BAYRY), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Januvia - Merck (MRK)Farxiga - AstraZeneca (AZN)Entresto - Novartis (NVS)Enbrel - Amgen (AMGN)Imbruvica - Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), AbbVie (ABBV)Stelara - Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Fiasp, NovoLog - Novo Nordisk (NVO)Video Transcript- Shifting gears now to Medicare. It achieved a milestone Tuesday by announcing the list of 10 drugs that would be the first ever to face price negotiations. Now some analysts were surprised by a few of the picks but remained confident that all drugs represent no real threat to company earnings. For more on this story, we're joined by Anjalee Khemlani. Anjalee, I know you've been following this for us.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right, Rachelle. It's definitely interesting to see some of the picks yesterday. Of course, many analysts had already picked and targeted some of those drugs. But I've got an interesting note from JPM looking at those picks saying that overall the update was largely expected with key drugs like Eliquis and Imbruvica on that list, but Stelara from Johnson &amp; Johnson was a surprise for many because of the fact that it faces a biosimilar competition in the upcoming years before the 2026 year that this goes into effect.However, the rest of the drugs are small revenue and earnings per share contributors to their company, so JPM doesn't really see that. And I saw that theme repeated in many of the notes that came out yesterday. But when I started thinking about also was how much of that is true when it comes to the earnings and the profit or rather the sales from these companies in the time period that CMS looked at which was June of last year through May of this year?Story continuesI did a little bit of back of the napkin math to take a look at Eliquis first. For example, CMS did say in that time period, the cost to it for part D beneficiaries was $16.5 billion. And that total it seems to match what Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer, who both share in the profits for this did mention in their quarterly earnings in that time period.And that's if you compare that to their total revenues for that time period, Bristol Myers Squibb saying that $57 billion is what their total revenues were for that year and nearly $78 billion for Pfizer. And then I looked at Stelara, the surprise pick, that was on the lower end for Medicare-- $2.6 billion as their cost. And then meanwhile, Johnson &amp; Johnson saying in that same time period again last June to this May, $12.7 billion from Stelara alone.And if you compare that to the total company's earnings of $121.7 billion, you can see how it does contribute a smaller amount. In the previous example we did often see Eliquis cited as a driver of earnings for those two companies, and Stelara has always been called out as a strong product.So it will be interesting whether or not those LOEs, that loss of exclusivity, is that driver behind those comments for the analysts on considering how much of an impact it really is going to take on these companies earnings moving forward. We did see some notes about analysts estimating that the price drop could be somewhere in the 40% range from the current pricing. So definitely something to keep an eye on as the negotiation process begins next year.BRAD SMITH: And Anj, what happens to all of the lawsuits against Medicare now?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Yeah, good question. So most of these companies that we saw listed, like I said, expected so the companies had already filed citing their anticipation as being targeted by this list. As the list, for example, did not make the cut, whether or not they will continue to push forward in their lawsuit remains to be seen.Pfizer has not yet independently filed a lawsuit. However, it is as, we mentioned earlier, one of the drugs-- one of the companies that has a drug listed. Novartis as well is one of those-- Novo Nordisk. So a couple of those companies haven't yet individually filed. They do belong to pharma, the lobbying firm, as well as the US Chamber of Commerce which we know has filed those lawsuits. But as of right now, unclear on which ones will go forward, which new ones will be expected, and so we're keeping an eye on that for you.BRAD SMITH: All right, Anjalee Khemlani, thanks for tracking all of this and keeping an eye on it. We appreciate it.]"

The work related to the deal will be carried out in Pascagoula, MS. What’s Favoring Huntington Ingalls?DDG 1000, also known as Zumwalt-class destroyers, marks the pioneering use of an advanced and extremely resilient Integrated Power System among U.S. Navy surface combatants. It boasts features that provide power to propulsion and combat system loads from the same gas turbine prime movers. This makes the ship a unique and top choice in the U.S. Navy.Huntington’s Ingalls unit, which designs and constructs non-nuclear ships for the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard, will further upgrade the lethal DDG 1000 combat ship with advanced technology so that it continues to serve the U.S. Navy with all evolving warship requirements. This should further boost the demand for this warship.Considering the importance and demand for the combatant ship, HII is well-poised to win several significant awards involving the modernization of DDG 1000 in the days ahead, like the latest one. This should benefit the company and boost its revenue generation prospects.Growth ProspectsWith increased spending by nations for strengthening their sea warfare capabilities, the military shipbuilding market may witness strong demand. Per Mordor Intelligence, the global shipbuilding market is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 4.8% over the 2023-2028 period.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Zoetis with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for Zoetis Zoetis' Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years Zoetis grew its EPS by 12% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Zoetis maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 2.8% to US$8.2b. That's encouraging news for the company!You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Holding US$70m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.Story continuesIs Zoetis Worth Keeping An Eye On?One important encouraging feature of Zoetis is that it is growing profits. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 1 warning sign for Zoetis that you should be aware of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

We have worked together, across functionalities, to develop a comprehensive sustainability framework, placing equal importance on decarbonizing our business and helping our customers - big and small - bridge the gap between traditional and renewable.As Vice President of Sustainable Products and Innovation, I lead a team whose work is helping customers meet their goals and reduce their environmental impact. Expert, adaptable, and innovative, together we are leading the transition to a more sustainable future. I am proud to introduce the members of my team who seem to make anything possible.Get to know mePersonally, I got my start right out of school as an analyst at an investment bank. My willingness and ability to learn new things helped me land my first role and has continued to be a core competency I have relied on throughout my career. Following this position, I had the opportunity to work at Enron for eight years and started a weather derivatives business, which works like an insurance policy against weather performance that could negatively impact business. I also started a sulfur dioxide + nitrogen oxides (SO2 + NOx) emissions trading desk, a market-based approach to controlling SO2 + NOx emissions. This kept me busy and stoked my passion for developing and implementing sustainable solutions.In 2000, I left to co-found and serve as COO of XL Weather and Energy (a division of XL Capital Ltd.), a trading and insurance company based in Connecticut, before finally joining the team at NRG. Since 2012, I have led NRG's sustainable products, renewables, innovation, and project management teams. I help run an incubator for growing businesses and early-stage opportunities within NRG Business, and my team is always working on new projects with the goal of enhancing our sustainability and renewables approach for customers.Beyond the work, one of the reasons I have remained here for some time is the amazing team I get to work with every day. Together, we embody a culture that is collaborative and focused on education and sharing information. We try extremely hard to make sure that even the newest member of our team can understand, rather than using our own jargon. We also take the time to hear everyone's perspective because oftentimes, it's the newest teammate who brings the best idea to the table.Work-life balance is something I have spent my life trying to perfect-especially as a mother of two daughters-and I encourage my team members to do the same. When I'm not in the office, I try to take time for myself by enjoying outdoor activities such as hiking, snowboarding, and gardening, and when it's inevitably 100+ degrees in Houston, I'm probably inside on my Peloton or reading a good book.My dream teamOur Sustainable Products and Innovation team is made up of four branches which come together to provide our customers with premier and innovative approaches to sustainability. Each group, within the larger team, is focused on their field of expertise, and when brought together they create a formative and multi-faceted foundation for sustainability at NRG Business.Let me introduce you to each of the branches of our tree and highlight what they do.Our commitment to changeOur industry is at an inflection point and we have an opportunity to rethink what power can be. For NRG, customers are the driving factor pushing us forward with their sustainability goals. The ambition of our customers motivates the team to develop new and innovative sustainable solutions.Paving a new path for the energy sector requires dedication to our customers, communities, and the environment we all share. I am proud of what my team's work achieves and our shared commitment to propelling all of us toward a more sustainable future. I'll let them share the reasons why they are passionate about the work we do.""I am passionate about my work because I believe I am in a role at a company and industry in which I can truly make a difference. It is only through a clean, resilient, affordable grid that we will have the energy foundations that can support a more equitable future."" -Schneider Otohwo""When I started my career, I found myself gravitating towards clean power - even before it was popular. To date, I have been part of nearly 6GW of projects, many of which would not have happened without my involvement. This gives me immense satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment in being able to make a positive impact in the world."" -Miro Sutton""As an originator, It's extremely rewarding to be able to help our suppliers advance projects that benefit the environment, while helping our customers achieve their own environmental objectives. It's not always easy, but important work and every success is a stepping stone along the path to a more sustainable future."" -Alan Cherkas""I want to help create a more sustainable and empowering energy ecosystem for our customers. With NRG's position in the industry, we have the opportunity to lead by example for a cleaner and affordable energy future."" -Greg Kandankulam""Small changes have big impacts.

Now I'd like to hand the call over to Don Zurbay.Story continuesDonald J. ZurbayThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Patterson had a strong start to fiscal '24, building upon our momentum across the business as we continue to deliver value for our customers and shareholders. A few highlights from our first quarter. On the top line, year-over-year internal sales increased approximately 3% with growth across both the Dental and Animal Health segments. Our initiatives to drive margin improvement were successful as we achieved year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion across the company and the Dental and Animal Health segments. We returned $55 million to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases, and we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 25% from the same period a year ago. Given these results, we remain on track to achieve our fiscal 2024 earnings guidance. As a reminder, our guidance accounts for our commitment to deliver year-over-year internal sales growth and adjusted operating margin expansion for the total company and across both our Dental and Animal Health segments. Our performance during our fiscal '24 first quarter illustrates the continued execution of our proven strategy, which, as I shared last quarter, is designed to achieve 4 core objectives: first, drive revenue growth above the current end market growth rates; second, build upon the progress we've made to enhance our margin performance; third, evolve our products, channels and services to best serve the customers in our end markets; and fourth, improve efficiency and optimization. Our team is aligned around various strategic initiatives to advance each of these core objectives. Today, I'd like to highlight just a couple of specific examples that we've been working on in early fiscal 2024 to demonstrate our progress. First, our focus on private label. During the first quarter, we benefited from continued growth in our private label portfolio, which includes the collection of owned brands with strong market equity. These include brands we've built like the Patterson brand in Dental in the Aspen and pivotal companion vet products as well as acquire brands like Dairy Tech in the production animal business. We have invested in this important category by adding new SKUs and our sales team is highly engaged and motivated to drive sales growth in this margin-accretive category. We continually evaluate opportunities across our businesses, but believe there is a distinct opportunity within Animal Health to further expand the private label portfolio to meet evolving consumer preferences. In fact, during fiscal '24, we expect to add more private label products to our Animal Health offering than ever before. Over the past several years, our private label sales growth has outpaced the sales growth of products manufactured by our strategic partners. The results are paying off. And in addition to generating above-market growth, our focus on private label supports our other core objectives. Another recent example relates to our efforts to improve efficiency and optimization. As we've said before, this objective includes not only a rigorous focus on cost discipline, but also targeted investments to leverage best practices and advanced operational excellence across the enterprise. We have recently been implementing strategic modernization of our fulfillment facilities and capabilities. This includes investments in new technologies such as robots and cobots to automate order picking, enhancements for our teams to ensure the right skills and expertise to operate the more modern facilities and substantial expansion of our fulfillment capacity. Just this week, we are opening a brand-new fulfillment center in the U.K., we call the [Big Shed] that will double our capacity in the region. This fully automated next-generation facility is not just larger, it's more sustainable, more efficient and further advances our channel capabilities. We also recently completed a technology overhaul to our fulfillment center in Southern California and are close to opening an expanded facility in Montreal, Canada. In addition, we have similar projects underway in several other locations. These strategic investments in our fulfillment centers can help alleviate capacity constraints and the modernization of our facilities is expected to enhance growth. These are only a couple of examples of some of the many initiatives we have underway. Taken together, our strategic areas of focus build upon our strong foundation and success over the past several years to further differentiate our position in the market and drive enhanced growth, profitability and value creation over the long term. Now I'll provide some updates on each of our segments during the fiscal first quarter. Let's start with Dental. Dental segment internal sales increased 2% compared to the first quarter of fiscal '23, due to strong growth in consumables and value-added services, which includes our software offerings. We also achieved year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion in the fiscal first quarter due to our Dental team's ongoing focus on our margin enhancement initiatives. Our value proposition continues to resonate with all types of Dental customers. From individual practices to group practices, we seek to create a seamless experience by offering a comprehensive suite of products and solutions to help Dental practices grow, become more efficient and provide improved patient care. In the consumables category, Dental internal sales increased approximately 5% in the fiscal first quarter compared to 1 year ago. Excluding the moderating deflationary impact of infection control products, internal sales for our non-infection control consumables increased nearly 7% year-over-year. Overall, we believe the demand we are seeing for consumables products speaks to the resiliency of the Dental market and our ability to drive growth above the current end market. Looking at Dental equipment. Internal sales in the first quarter of fiscal '24 decreased 6% compared to the year ago period. Our team delivered growth in our core equipment and CAD/CAM categories that was more than offset by a decline in digital technology, which experienced a sequential decline in sales following a strong fiscal 2023 fourth quarter. This dynamic is typical of the variability of the equipment category and further demonstrates how equipment sales can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter for a variety of factors. Over the last 8 quarters, our average quarterly equipment internal sales growth was 4%. Dentists continue to invest in their practices and look to Patterson when they do. We anticipate that demand for equipment and technology will drive our manufacturing partners to continue introducing new innovations and technologies. Patterson is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand, thanks to our expertise in selling, financing, installing, training and servicing the latest technologies and equipment. And finally, Dental internal sales in our software and value-added services category increased approximately 6% over the prior year period. Value-added services represent the entire suite of offerings we provide to our customers that help make Patterson an indispensable partner to their practice, including our leading technical service offering. This category continues to grow at a rate exceeding the overall rate of the Dental segment. The strong results we have been delivering in the value-added services category, our testament to our customers, recognizing the full life cycle support and services that Patterson provides. And as an added benefit, these valuable offerings are mix favorable to our P&amp;L. Maximizing our value-added service offerings particularly in the software category is a key part of our strategy with a meaningful opportunity for growth. Looking ahead, we believe the dental market remains stable with healthy underlying fundamentals, including an aging population, practice modernization and the direct link between the patient's oral health and overall health, which we believe will continue to serve as tailwinds and help drive performance across our Dental segment over the long term. Now let's move on to our Animal Health segment. During the first quarter of fiscal '24, Animal Health internal sales increased 4% year-over-year, with growth in both companion animal and production animal businesses. We also achieved year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion in the Animal Health segment, building upon our excellent track record of margin improvement over the past few years. We benefit from the depth of our offering and omnichannel presence that spans a wide range of animal species and offers comprehensive solutions for diverse customers. In companion animal, our internal sales in the first fiscal quarter increased by mid-single digits as we executed well within this healthy and growing market. As we've said before, we've been modeling mid-single-digit revenue growth for our companion business over the long term. On the production animal side, fiscal 2024 first quarter internal sales grew by low single digits. Despite ongoing headwinds within the cattle market, we have continued to deliver sales growth in this part of the Animal Health business. This is a testament to our team's performance and the diversification of our production business. Across the Animal Health segment, our value-added services category achieved strong growth that can be attributed to sales of our software solutions and equipment service as well as operational efficiencies. Expanding our investments in software and value-added services remains a priority for us and is core to our objective to position Patterson Animal Health as the leading provider of technology, software, data insights, services and products to the Animal Health industry. Our team stands ready to help our customers identify the right set of solutions to streamline their workflows and run their practices efficiently, all backed by our enviable service and support. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin Barry to provide more detail on our financial results.Kevin M. BarryThank you, Den, and good morning, everyone. In my prepared remarks this morning, I will cover the financial results for our first quarter of fiscal '24, which ended on July 29, 2023, and then conclude with our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. So let's begin by covering the results for our first quarter fiscal '24. Consolidated reported sales for Patterson Companies in our fiscal '24 first quarter were $1.6 billion, an increase of 3.5% over the first quarter of 1 year ago. Internal sales, which are adjusted for the effects of currency translation and contributions from recent acquisitions, increased 2.8% compared to the same period last year. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '24, was 20.2%, a decrease of 25 basis points compared to the prior year period. Our gross margin was negatively impacted by 40 basis points this quarter by the mark-to-market accounting adjustment from rising interest rates on our equipment financing portfolio. As we have mentioned in prior earnings calls, any positive or negative impact related to our equipment financing portfolio is nearly offset by our corresponding hedging instrument, which is reflected in the other income net line in our P&amp;L. So the net result has a minimal impact on our adjusted earnings per share. This dynamic also occurred in the first fiscal quarter of last year and the positive impact of the mark-to-market accounting calculation was 10 basis points. When normalizing for the mark-to-market accounting adjustment in both periods, our gross margin rate in the first quarter of fiscal '24 was 20 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal '23. Remember, the accounting impact of the mark-to-market adjustments impacts our total company gross margin, but not the gross margin within our business segments. Importantly, during the fiscal first quarter, both of our business units posted a year-over-year increase to their respective gross margins compared to the prior year period. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal '24 were 17.2% and favorable by 40 basis points compared to the fiscal first quarter of '23. In the first quarter of fiscal '24, our consolidated adjusted operating margin is 3.0%, an increase of 15 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year. Again, when normalizing for the impact of the mark-to-market accounting adjustment in both periods related to gross margin, our consolidated adjusted operating margin in the first quarter of fiscal '24 expanded by 60 basis points over the prior year period.I am pleased with the team's efforts to continuously improve and deliver on our commitment to drive operating margin expansion within our business segments and for the total company overall in the first quarter of fiscal '24. The initiatives we put in place to improve gross margin to work more closely with strategic vendors who reward us for our sales performance, drive improved mix, exercise expense discipline and leverage our cost structure has certainly translated into a higher level of profitability and financial performance of Patterson. Our adjusted tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal '24 was 23.5%, an increase of 110 basis points compared to the prior year period. Reported net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. for the first quarter of fiscal '24 was $31.2 million or $0.32 per diluted share. This compares to reported net income in the first quarter of last year of $24.6 million or $0.25 per diluted share. Adjusted net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. in the first quarter of fiscal '24 was $38.6 million or $0.40 per diluted share. This compares to $31.7 million or $0.32 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal '23. This 25% increase in adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fiscal first quarter was primarily due to the sales execution and operating margin expansion in both of our business segments. Now let's turn to our business segments starting with our Dental business. In the first quarter of fiscal '24, internal sales for our Dental business increased 2.1% compared to the first quarter of fiscal '23. Internal sales of dental consumables in the fiscal first quarter increased 4.6% compared to 1 year ago and were impacted by continued price deflation of certain infection control products. Internal sales of non-infection control products increased 6.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '24 compared to the year ago period. This negative impact from infection control product deflation has continued to moderate over the past year, and we expect the year-over-year deflationary effect to continue moderating and fully normalized by the end of fiscal year '24. In the first quarter of fiscal '24, internal sales of Dental equipment decreased 5.7% compared to 1 year ago. As Don mentioned, sales in the equipment category can vary from quarter to quarter, and these dynamics apply to each of the specific product categories as well. This quarter, core equipment and CAD/CAM sales posted positive year-over-year sales growth, but were more than offset by a decline in the digital X-ray category compared to the prior year period. Internal sales of value-added services in the first quarter of fiscal '24 increased 5.8% over the prior year period, led by the increased year-over-year contribution from our technical service team and continued growth of our software business. Value-added services, including our software offerings represent the entire suite of offerings we provide to our customers to help make us an indispensable partner to their practice, and these valuable offerings are also a mix favorable to our P&amp;L. The adjusted operating margin in Dental was 7.4% in the first quarter of fiscal '24, which represents a 35 basis point improvement over the prior year period. This operating margin performance reflects the efforts of our dental team to improve margins through effective pricing and mix management and continued expense discipline to deliver operating margin expansion for the first quarter of fiscal '24. Now let's move on to our Animal Health segment. In the first quarter of fiscal '24, internal sales for our Animal Health business increased 4.0% compared to the first quarter of fiscal '23. Internal sales for our companion animal business in the first quarter of fiscal '24, increased 5.1% over the prior year period, which included strong sales performance from our NVS business in the U.K. Internal sales for our production animal business quarter increased 2.5% in the quarter compared to the prior year period. Our production animal team continues to execute well in the market and internal sales in the first quarter of fiscal '24 delivered particularly strong growth in the swine category compared to the prior year period. The adjusted operating margin in our Animal Health segment was 4.0% in the fiscal '24 first quarter, an increase of nearly 80 basis points from the prior year period. Our Animal Health team continues to drive business with strategic manufacturer partners who value our ability to deliver increased sales, while also exercising expense discipline as they delivered operating margin expansion for the first quarter of fiscal '24. Now let me cover cash flow and balance sheet items. During the first 3 months of fiscal '24, our free cash flow improved by $35.7 million compared to the same period 1 year ago. This was primarily due to a decreased level of working capital in the first 3 months of fiscal '24 compared to the year ago period. Turning now to capital allocation. Our capital spending in the first quarter of was $17.1 million and $2.5 million higher than the first quarter of fiscal '23. This increased spending reflects the investments we are making in our distribution capabilities as well as our software and value-added services. We continue to execute on our strategy to return cash to our shareholders. In the first quarter of fiscal '24, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per diluted share, which was then paid at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal '24. We also repurchased 29.5 million of shares during the first quarter of fiscal '24, thereby returning a total of $54.9 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.Let me conclude with our outlook for the remainder of fiscal '24. Today, we are reaffirming our fiscal '24 GAAP earnings guidance range of $2.14 to $2.24 per diluted share and our adjusted earnings guidance range of $2.45 to $2.55 per diluted share. And now I'm going to turn the call back over to Don for some additional comments.Donald J. ZurbayThanks, Kevin. Before we open it up for Q&amp;A, I want to thank the entire Patterson team for a great start to fiscal 2024 as we made progress to build upon our momentum across the business. We're continuing to deliver on our proven strategy and combined with the resilient end markets in which we operate, I'm confident that we are well positioned to drive enhanced growth, profitability and value creation over the long term. That concludes our prepared remarks. Kevin and I will be glad to take questions. Operator, please open the line.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Jason Bednar from Piper Sandler.Jason M. BednarDon and Ken, I want to start, the Dental consumable performance was really strong. It really seems to defy expectations that I think many have out there on the Dental market at the moment. I heard the private label commentary, but could you unpack a bit more where the strength is coming from, that's supporting that 7% underlying growth in consumables? Any procedure categories to call out where you're seeing notable strength or anything of note on DSOs, pricing, share gains, anything like that?Donald J. ZurbayYes. Thanks, Jason. We're trying to be helpful here. We're not going to probably break down pieces. But quite honestly, we saw strength across the board. I think patient traffic is steady. We feel really good about that. All customer types performed and the sales force really, I think, is just hitting on all cylinders right now. We think the momentum -- we think the key to this quarter and last quarter and just kind of where we're at right now is just the continued momentum in the business. So not to able to break that down for you, but honestly, it was across the board.Jason M. BednarOkay. That's helpful. I'm sure there's some -- probably are questions there as well but maybe just for a follow-up. I did want to ask, I mean, Don, you highlighted those corporate investments. I don't think we've heard those kind of specifics in the past, that it sounds like you have a lot of wheels in motion across your facilities, your distribution network. Are you able to quantify, at all, the investments you've made with some of that automation work? And what the ROI or payback you're expecting from some of those investments?Donald J. ZurbayYes. Well, if you look at our CapEx spending this quarter is above last first quarter. And I think what you're going to see is as we go through the year, that will continue to be the case. All of these projects go through a rigorous process that we have internally to make sure that the ROI gets above our cost to capital. And that it all is a financial payoff as well as all the other benefits we're getting from it. So we're pretty excited about each of these investments. Obviously, we're not going to see the benefits of these quite yet, but I wanted to highlight some examples of the types of things that we have that are going to keep the margin improvement moving in the right direction. And when we make the commitment to continuously improving the margin. I think this is an example of how that works. So pretty excited about all of them. I think more to come, and what I really like is the team's continues to think about the next thing and the next opportunity.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs.Nathan Allen RichI wanted to start with question on margins. Don, you reiterated expectations for operating margin expansion for the total company as well as both segments. I guess, any change in your expectations for the overall level of margin expansion? I guess particularly with respect to the dynamics you're seeing in the corporate segment. And then any comments or thoughts on just cadence of margin improvement over the balance of the year.Donald J. ZurbayI'll maybe let Kevin get into a little of that. I think overall, we're still committed to the margin improvement story, both at the corporate level and in each of the business units. And if anything changed, it's minor. I think our expectations are the same as they were as we entered the year.Kevin M. BarryYes. We got off to a good start here in Q1 with both of our business units, expanding both their gross margins and their operating margin. And so we're seeing that momentum at the business unit level. You alluded to the corporate segment. Just as a reminder, this is a dynamic that we have related to our equipment financing portfolio where as the forward interest rate curve changes, we have to mark that portfolio to market, which does create some noise in our corporate segment and our overall margins, which is offset with the hedge we have in our other income line below operating profit. This quarter, it was a bit of a headwind as the forward rate curve increased in that portfolio. And so -- and that's why we try to give you guys kind of the adjusted numbers, so you can see kind of what that noise taken out of it, how we're performing underneath it. So we're not going to guess where interest rates are going to go from here, but we'll continue to kind of have that dynamic as interest change. But again, I think as you can strip that out and see the underlying momentum there. And then the other thing on phasing, I'd say is that I think we expect a similar cadence where we typically see some leverage as we go through the year. Q1 is typically our lowest op margin level for the year. But as we have higher sales quarters, we typically see leverage on the op margin line through the rest of the year.Donald J. ZurbayI think I just maybe want to reiterate. When you take out the dynamics of the accounting that Kevin mentioned, which you need to do and look at our margin, I mean, our gross margin was up 20 basis points in the quarter, like Kevin mentioned and operating margin up 60%, which I think was notable. And I want to make sure people understand that dynamic, it's kind of confusing.Nathan Allen RichGreat. That's helpful. And then I wanted to ask on the U.S. companion animal business. I know you said overall companion was up 5.1%. But I think, Kevin, you kind of called out is maybe the main driver of that. Could you comment on how the U.S. companion animal business did? And any change to your outlook for that business, just given kind of the overall kind of traffic and level of demand that you're seeing in the market?Kevin M. BarrySure. I can jump in, and Don can add. We saw growth in both segments. We saw particularly the strong growth in our NVS business, which is -- I want to call them out, they're performing really well in that market. And this is in advance of some of the investments Don mentioned, what you think are even going to accelerate that business further. But the U.S. companion business also did grow in the quarter. Now as you'd expect, we're not seeing the same level of growth as we have over the past couple of years as that market has kind of moderated a bit from the heights of the pandemic boom. But -- and in the overall market, we still see spending up even as visits have come down a bit. So that team is executing really well and they are growing in the market so.Donald J. ZurbayYes. I think the 5% is off a fairly tough comp, as Kevin mentioned, with some of the dynamics in the market that were in place last year.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird.Jeffrey D. JohnsonDon, I wanted to start on your equipment number, the down 5.7%. Obviously, we've seen many times in the past from you and other companies push hard as kind of the fiscal end of year to make some numbers and then the next quarter has a bit of an overhang here. How much of that was an impact this quarter? I mean obviously, you talked about digital x-ray being down. But I'm hoping you can help us maybe disaggregate kind of end market -- tenor of end markets versus just some timing of when you close your fiscal year and then made a big push last year, and had a bit of an overhang to deal with in this first quarter.Donald J. ZurbayYes, no, no doubt, Jeff. And I think you've seen that in the past. And there's a lot of reasons for it. Obviously, there can be a fourth quarter push. We do budget and forecast for that. And I think, as you mentioned, the digital category sometimes is the one that you may see more variability on that kind of dynamic. So this gets back to -- for me, just back to the whole notion of looking at it in the 3-month increments, particularly as you're bringing up in the fourth quarter, first quarter kind of realm. I think the -- I think if you just looked across the 6-month period, which might be a better way to think about all that. Our equipment sales were up 8%, Q4 and Q1 over last year. And then I think the -- I would just highlight that we keep watching this category as you all do, I think, in terms of the economy and things. But all we're seeing is just the our customers' desire to continue investing in their practice, and that's just not slowing down. It's good patient traffic and it's kind of translating to the practices wanting to continue to invest.Jeffrey D. JohnsonThat's helpful. And then just on the EPS guidance, you're obviously up 25% year-over-year this quarter. I think your guidance for the year is low single digit to mid-single digit growth year-over-year for the full year. So that would kind of imply kind of flattish EPS over the next 3 quarters on a year-over-year basis. Just remind us, one, why would that be the right level of EPS growth after a strong start here on the EPS line of the year? And two, how much conservatism versus other factors we might have to be taken into account there?Donald J. ZurbayYes. Yes. I think this really actually -- I think this mostly relates just to a bit of phasing on the year. I think that we had a tough comp or we had an easy comp in Q1 and obviously, a tough comp in Q4 and there's some other dynamics within the year. But I think it relates more to that than anything. And so when we kind of look back and say even with all that phasing, we're comfortable with the guidance we've given for the year and that growth even though it comes in a little bit different form each quarter.Kevin M. BarryYes, I think the other thing I'd add, Jeff, is there are some -- while we do expect the business to continue to grow over the course of the year, there are some internal investments we're making that will ramp up a bit here into the rest of the year that we think are great investments for the long term of the company. But we're going to have a little bit of spending that will come through in the back half of the year, too.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo from UBS.Kevin CaliendoI guess one question I had to ask is around what you saw in July. That's the month we don't get to see from anybody else. I'm just wondering if trend through the quarter was consistent or not. I understand on the equipment side, what happened with ordering and timing. I'm just wondering as you exited the quarter, did you think the demand for equipment to change, at all, from the beginning of the quarter or from second quarter. We're just trying to get a read on what's going to happen over the rest of the calendar year into next year.Donald J. ZurbayYes. No, Kevin, I appreciate the question and a good one. I -- for us, I think the quarter really played out kind of in normal fashion. I don't -- I wouldn't highlight and we probably wouldn't say too much about intra-quarter phasing. But I guess I would say that I don't think that there was nothing notable from my perspective on how the quarter played into the first 2 months versus the last one.Kevin CaliendoOkay. That's helpful. And also just thinking about with equipment, where are you in terms of relatively speaking, in terms of backlog, whether it's core or digital? Has that normalized? Or do you feel like the backlog in either of those are elevated or lower or normal? Any color around that would be super helpful.Kevin M. BarryI think -- this is Kevin. I think what we'd say the core equipment demand continues to be strong. Those supply chains have normalized, I think we'd say, compared to what we were talking about a couple of past year or 2. So the lead times aren't as long as they used to be. So that sales cycle has shortened for us, which is good. And then for the digital categories, those sales cycles are pretty quick. We can turn around those orders and installs fairly, fairly rapidly. The consults, obviously, not as complicated as a new office build out. So we don't really think about those in terms of backlog just because the cycle is pretty quick. But I'd say, like Don said, we're seeing healthy demand in the market. Our sales teams are executing really well to help their customers find the right investment for their practice and feel good about the rest of the year.Kevin CaliendoDo you think that interest rates or the economic situation has held up ordering in any way, shape or form, on some of the higher cost equipment in the category? I'm just -- we've heard anecdotally this from -- in the channel and from some of your peers and manufacturers. Just wondering how real you see that as being any kind of impact on the market.Donald J. ZurbayYes. I think marginally, not in a significant way, though. And again, we're pleased with the momentum in the business, but the momentum in the market, too, in terms of -- again, in terms of practices willing to invest in their business and it continues. So it's a little more challenging, I think, but still makes sense, I think, when they run the math.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of John Block from Stifel.Jonathan David BlockGreat. I guess I'll go back to the underlying Dental consumables, which were seemingly, I guess, the revenue highlight for the quarter. You've got inflation impact starting to diminish. I guess what I'm trying to go with this is, what was the approximate price contribution in fiscal '23 for Dental consumables? And how do you see that playing out in fiscal '24? I'm just trying to focus on that pricing contribution because I think we all want to arrive at how underlying volumes are trending. And if the price contribution for consumables is sort of closer to normalized levels as we currently sit here today.Kevin M. BarryYes, Jon, this is Kevin. Yes, I think we would say that the pricing certainly is kind of more at historical norms, the kind of low single-digit pricing. As we've looked at our internal data, here, we certainly -- part of our Q1 performance was price contribution, but it was also a positive volume contribution. So we saw units grow this quarter as well. So it wasn't just the one or the other. I think we expect that for some of those infection control products that we've been tracking, that year-over-year deflationary impact is going to continue to be a drag for the next couple of quarters. The prices have stabilized but we're still going to be comparing back to a higher kind of ASP basket for those products from last year. So I think as we -- so we'll be dealing with that dynamic for the next couple of quarters. But I think for -- if you kind of look at the category as a whole, we'd say, we're seeing volume contribution as well as kind of more normalized historical price contribution for dental consumables.Jonathan David BlockOkay. Got it. And then just maybe a small handful as part of the second question. For Dental equipment, should we still expect mid-single-digit growth for the year? Obviously, fiscal 1Q was down. You got a really tough comp in 4Q. So do we still think you can land at mid-single digits for the year? And Kevin, still tax rate of 25% for the year, is that correct? You were shy of that for the quarter. And did your messaging change a little bit on the deflationary for the infection control? I thought before that was supposed to ease in the back part of the year. And maybe in your prepared remarks, you sort of said that continues to the end of the fiscal year, maybe some clarification there.Kevin M. BarryYes, I'll take a couple of those. So yes, on the deflation, I think what I'd say is we really saw the prices kind of stabilize at a new level in our Q4 of fiscal '23. So it's probably -- Q2 will have a headwind. Q3 will have a smaller headwind, yes. Q4, it should be pretty marginal sort of how we see the pricing dynamics playing out for, Jon. And then on the tax rate, yes, we'd still say about 25%. We're seeing a step-up this year in our tax rate due to some changes in the U.K. tax law as well as some historical deductions that have expired for us. So I think that's still the right number for your estimate. And equipment -- yes. And I think -- yes, you're right. We do have some tough comps coming up in equipment. The team is still pushing hard on that. I think mid-single digit long term. And again, given some -- not looking at quarter-to-quarter, but over a reasonable time frame is what we'd expect. And I just keep reiterating what we're saying is I think the market is looking for these investments. And so we're still pushing to get to that mid-single digit long-term growth rate for equipment.Donald J. ZurbayI think the -- Jon, I think the metric we've kind of brought out every quarter is what does it look like if you look over the last 8 quarters. I think the equipment growth is 4% in that time, and it kind of has been. So you can kind of think about it like that. I think the ups and downs year-over-year, up here, we deal with. But over an 8-quarter period, that's still -- we still think that's a pretty good number.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI.Elizabeth Hammell AndersonJust a quick question. How are you guys thinking about -- obviously, you haven't (inaudible) interest expense in the quarter. How are you sort of expecting that to trend for the rest of the year?Kevin M. BarryYes. Yes, so interest expense, we'd expect it to be maybe a little above what we carried here in Q1 for the rest of the next 3 quarters as we've kind of re-forecast where we expect rates to go. And so really, if you look at it versus the last year, there will still be a bit of a headwind here in Q2 and Q3, a little bit less so in Q4.Elizabeth Hammell AndersonOkay. That's helpful. And maybe on the longer-term side, what are the things that maybe come out in the last of years? Is that -- you seem to have a sort of different M&amp;A strategy for the Animal Health business versus the Dental business? It seems like sort of more tuck-ins or a more regular cadence of tuck-ins on the Animal Health side. Can you talk to us a little bit more about sort of maybe why that is? Why you're seeing is this is availability of assets? Is it just something unique about that business versus some of the Dental, which is, obviously, just had more core benefit?Donald J. ZurbayYes. Okay. I think there -- first of all, I would start off by saying in terms of our M&amp;A strategy, we're agnostic to some extent between Animal Health and Dental. We're looking for the right opportunities that hit our metrics and that check the box on what we're thinking about in terms of M&amp;A. So I mean I would put this particular dynamic and kind of where we've been over the last few years, it's just the timing of opportunities that come up and when we're ready to do something, and how they check the box. I don't know that there's anything particularly unique about Animal Health that would put us into a position where there's some good tuck-in acquisitions versus Dental, but we're doing a lot of work. There's a lot of work going into all kinds of potential acquisitions. I know we've been saying this, but we're careful. We want to make sure we make the right investments. And so far, this is what we have. But again, I don't think there's anything unique about Animal Health and Dental. They are different businesses, but we're looking for the right opportunities.Elizabeth Hammell AndersonGot it. Just one for me. Just how do you think about the private label opportunity? I know you sort of talked about that particular -- is there something you can sort of like quantify there? And I know you said you're adding more products than before, but how do we think about that as like a driver of margins in that business?Donald J. ZurbayWell, I think what you're going to see is private label becoming a more prominent part of our program. I mean, it's slow, we're not accelerating at any -- at a significantly rapid pace. So I mean we move carefully, but definitely, there's a strategic objective to make that a bigger part of our business and our sales in both the Animal Health and Dental businesses.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse.Albert J. William RiceObviously, you had really solid strong growth in consumables on the dental side and then your equipment sales down for all the reasons we talked about and need to normalize that. I wonder though, in the quarter, does that dynamic -- is it enough on the product mix shift you saw that have an impact on the margin? Is that part of why the margins showed the improvement that they did in Dental?Kevin M. BarryA.J., yes, it is. I mean we see typically within our Dental business, our consumables margins and our value-added services margins, gross margins, are higher than our equipment gross margins. Now they're somewhat interrelated, I'd say, because when we look at equipment, we also think about all the services that we provide with regard to the equipment that actually shows up on our value-added services. So in a quarter where we have slightly lower equipment sales that quarter, we might see a little bit of a mix benefit. But we know in our model, it accrues to mix benefits going forward when we sell a lot of equipment because we get the value-add services, we get the technical service revenue from that relationship.Albert J. William RiceOkay. The company continues to put in its press release, the non to uncertain macro backdrop and some inflationary pressures we've talked on the call already about inflation impact or deflation impact in our infection control. And you've said you don't think you're seeing any impact on the equipment sales. Are you just making those statements to sort of keep a cautionary tone on things? Or is there any place that hasn't come up where those 2 dynamics, uncertain macroeconomic and inflationaries or pressures, are having an impact now that you would want to call out?Donald J. ZurbayNo. I think we are we're putting that out there as just sort of a caution that kind of these forces are out there, and we have a lot of ways that we're looking at. Whether those are impacting our business and looking forward, do we think they're going to, and we're not seeing that. I think, again, I go back to -- I've been out in the field, I've been with our top salespeople recently. And I'd just tell you that the momentum in the business right now, the optimism momentum are extremely high and and they're just not seeing it. So we'll continue to monitor it. And I think we want to put that out there just so -- I mean, not that people don't, but so people keep that in mind, but it's not showing up.Albert J. William RiceIt sounds like -- to an earlier question, when you think about the outlaying out the rest of the year, it doesn't sound like you're taking -- you're making any adjustments, that things get tougher in any particular area because of these factors later in the year. I just want to confirm that the variation that would be there is more because of the year-to-year comps, et cetera, not so much because you're making an assumption about the macro environment changing. Is that right?Kevin M. BarryThat's right. Absolutely.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Allen Lutz from Bank of America.Allen Charles LutzI wanted to follow up on Jeff's question from earlier. So over the past 6 months, equipment sales have been about 8%, and that's higher than what it's been over the past 8 quarters. And so as we think about what we've seen so far on interest rates, you've said there's been a marginal impact. As you think about the guide for the remaining 3 quarters of the year, is there any expected incremental impact from higher interest rates? And then kind of more thematically in longer term, is there any way to think about how dentists react if interest rates stay higher for maybe a few quarters?Donald J. ZurbayWell, I would say, first, the concept of any kind of marginal impact on the equivalent business, given interest rates is something that we spent a lot of time modeling is all really built into our guidance. So I think it would -- unless there's a fairly dramatic change there that we built some of that into our guidance and that's there. What was the second part of the question?Allen Charles LutzJust how dentists would -- historically, how they react if interest rates stay higher for longer. We haven't really seen an environment where rates have been elevated for more than a few quarters. So just curious about your perspective there.Donald J. ZurbayWell, again, what we keep seeing, and it's not just in the numbers, it's really just as we interact with our customers that there's a lot of interest and continued investment in the practice. We'll monitor that. I mean, I think if we start to see something happen there that changes that dynamic, then we'll build that into the expectations. But again, for right now, that's just -- again, there's a lot of interest in investment.OperatorAnd your final question today comes from the line of John Stansel from JP Morgan.John Paul StanselI wanted to look into production a little bit more. I think you -- appreciate you called out the headwind around cattle. So how does that sequential decline in herd count kind of translate to traffic? And then when you're having conversations with customers, how are you thinking about this? Is this something you see as kind of persistent through the year or more of a kind of a near term?Kevin M. BarryYes, so certainly, our customers are seeing those lower herd counts on the cattle business, and I'd say our production team is doing a fantastic job managing through that. I think the thing for our business is that we do have a diverse kind of portfolio of customers and species that we serve. We've got a large cattle business, but we also serve the swine markets, the dairy markets. And so as we look at our business, even if one of those markets is relatively down, we see strength like we did in this quarter in the swine market. The dairy markets have come back. So we'll be able to kind of manage through with our portfolio. And so if there's a bit of a headwind here in [one] for a couple of quarters as those herd counts normalize, we're confident we've got the plan to manage through it.John Paul StanselGreat. And then just quickly on working capital. I think you called out that it improved in the quarter. Is there anything specifically that you're doing to drive this working capital improvement?Kevin M. BarryYes -- no, the team did a good job this quarter. I think we're at a place with our working capital, I'd say that we're always looking for the right opportunities to make sure we've got the right inventory levels. We're balancing our service levels with good -- not getting too long on certain inventory categories. So I'd say there's opportunities that we look at more kind of opportunistically on the margins. But I'd just say, this quarter, our receivables team is doing a really good job. And I think as we go through the year, we'll continue to find some price some opportunities to take inventory down a bit, balancing that need to service the demand we've seen.OperatorAnd we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to CEO, Don Zurbay, for some final closing remarks.Donald J. ZurbayJust want to thank everybody for their time today and their interest in Patterson Companies, and we'll talk to you in a quarter. Thank you.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePatterson Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePatterson Companies, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Patterson Companies, Inc. QuoteOur TakePatterson Companies ended first-quarter fiscal 2024 on a mixed note, wherein earnings were in line with the consensus mark but revenues beat the same.Both the Dental and the Animal Health segment showed signs of improvement. Sales at both the segments were hurt by unfavorable currency movement. A prudent cost-savings approach and solid sales execution worked in favor of the stock, expanding adjusted operating margin. Sustained momentum in the Animal Health business bodes well.A broad spectrum of products cushions the company against economic downturns in the MedTech space. We believe that a diverse product portfolio, strong veterinary business prospects, accretive acquisitions and strategic partnerships are the key catalysts.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderPatterson Companies currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Align Technology ALGN, HealthEquity, Inc.

MMSI is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its strong product portfolio. The optimism led by solid second-quarter 2023 performance and international exposure are expected to contribute further. However, headwinds due to forex volatility and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 12.4% compared with a 16.9% rise of the industry and 13.8% growth of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical devices provider has a market capitalization of $3.84 billion. The company projects 11.5% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 15.8% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Product Portfolio: Merit Medical has continued to gain significant momentum on the back of new products. The company is upbeat about the product pipeline, including radio and electrophysiology products, raising investors’ optimism. It has several electrophysiology products that are either on track for release or in several other stages of development.In June, Merit Medical completed the acquisition of a portfolio of dialysis catheter products and the BioSentry Biopsy Tract Sealant System from AngioDynamics. This follows Merit Medical’s acquisition of the Surfacer Inside-Out Access Catheter System from Bluegrass Vascular Technologies, Inc.International Exposure: We are optimistic about Merit Medical’s worldwide product distribution network, which includes territories in Europe, the Middle East, Africa (EMEA) and Asia, among others. On the second quarter of 2023 earnings call, Merit Medical confirmed that growth in U.S. and international sales drove its overall top line.Per management, Asia Pacific (APAC) was the primary driver of better-than-expected results, although both the EMEA and Rest of World regions were at the upper end of Merit Medical’s growth expectations in the second quarter. APAC growth was driven by sales in China, which increased year over year as the improving trends in March continued into the second quarter.Story continuesStrong Q2 Results: Merit Medical’s robust second-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company witnessed a year-over-year uptick in the top and bottom lines. The company also saw revenue growth in both its segments and across all the product categories within its Cardiovascular unit. Robust performances in the United States and outside were also seen. The expansion of gross margin bodes well for the stock.DownsidesForex Volatility: Merit Medical has been expanding its operations outside the United States. This has led to the company becoming increasingly subject to market risk relating to foreign currency, which could have a negative impact on its margins and financial results. If the rate of exchange between foreign currencies declines against the U.S. dollar, Merit Medical may not be able to increase the prices charged from its customers for products whose prices are denominated in those respective foreign currencies.Stiff Competition: Merit Medical operates in highly competitive markets, where it faces competition from many companies with greater resources. The company competes globally in several market areas, including radiology and interventional cardiology. Such resources and market presence may enable the competitors to market competing products more efficiently or at reduced prices to gain market share.Estimate TrendMerit Medical is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved a penny south to $2.88.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $306.3 million, suggesting a 6.6% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Patterson Companies, Inc.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.Patterson Companies (PDCO) is a stock many investors are watching right now. PDCO is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 13.30, which compares to its industry's average of 18.94. Over the last 12 months, PDCO's Forward P/E has been as high as 13.74 and as low as 10.21, with a median of 11.74.PDCO is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1.45. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. PDCO's industry currently sports an average PEG of 1.51. Within the past year, PDCO's PEG has been as high as 1.90 and as low as 1.26, with a median of 1.53.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is PDCO's P/B ratio of 2.90. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 7.13. PDCO's P/B has been as high as 2.93 and as low as 2.25, with a median of 2.55, over the past year.Story continuesValue investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. PDCO has a P/S ratio of 0.49. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.88.Finally, our model also underscores that PDCO has a P/CF ratio of 11.38. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 23.54. Within the past 12 months, PDCO's P/CF has been as high as 11.52 and as low as 8.53, with a median of 9.61.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Patterson Companies is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, PDCO sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of the financial sector and its performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Financial Dividend Stocks To Invest In.Over the years, the finance industry in the US has gone through several changes. The onset of the pandemic and the recent banking crisis have made these changes even more intense. Following the failure of three major US banks in March this year, worried customers and investors rushed to withdraw their funds. CNN reported that these banks had about $559 billion in total assets, surpassing the $523 billion held by 25 banks that collapsed in 2008 when accounting for inflation.The effects of the pandemic have resulted in financial companies from Wall Street shifting away from New York City and moving to the Sun Belt region. According to Bloomberg, the firms are taking almost $1 trillion worth of managed assets with them. This move is being driven by factors like taxes and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also by practical and cultural reasons. Amid the pandemic, factors like no state income tax, pleasant weather, and business-friendly offers encouraged New York-based hedge fund billionaires to move their businesses to Florida. The report also mentioned that between the beginning of 2020 and the end of March 2023, over 370 investment companies, which is about 2.5% of all US investment firms, shifted their main offices to a different state. These companies collectively managed assets worth $2.7 trillion.In one of the recent developments, shares of several US banks dropped on August 22. This happened after S&amp;P Global, a rating agency, lowered credit ratings for certain regional banks that are heavily involved in commercial real estate. These banks include KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA), and Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE:ASB). This action came after a similar move by Moody's. Both of these rating agencies are making these changes because of an ongoing banking crisis that started in March.Story continuesS&amp;P Global mentioned challenging conditions affecting the banking sector. Here is what the credit agency said in its report:""The sharp rise in interest rates and quantitative tightening deployed since March 2022 to combat high inflation are weighing on many U.S. banks' funding, liquidity and spread income. These factors have also caused the value of banks' assets to fall and raised the odds of asset quality deterioration.""Investing in financial stocks means putting money into the top businesses that offer banking, insurance, credit cards, and various other financial services around the world. Since the financial sector is central to the worldwide economy, it's a smart idea for investors to seriously think about including financial stocks as a significant part of their investment collections. Due to the ongoing issues in the finance industry, the sector is struggling to match the pace of the market. The S&amp;P 500 Financials, which tracks the performance of some of the most prominent finance companies such as Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), is down by 1.11% year-to-date. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 gained 14.44% this year so far.Also read: 12 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy NowInvesting in dividend stocks within the finance sector can be a prudent strategy for income investors. However, it's essential to note that the finance sector can be sensitive to economic fluctuations and regulatory changes.

Invesco KBW Regional Banking ETF KBWR lost even higher 9.1% past month. Due to the banking stocks’ slump, inverse-leveraged bank ETN MicroSectors U.S. Big Banks Index -3X Inverse Leveraged ETN BNKD jumped as much as 31.3% past month. Several bank downgrades led to this slump.Inside the DowngradesShares of several U.S. banks declined on Aug 22, as the ratings agency S&amp;P Global followed Moody's in slashing the former’s credit ratings on some regional lenders with high commercial real estate (CRE) exposure. S&amp;P's action will make borrowing more costly for a banking sector aiming to recover from a crisis emanating in Mar 2023, which resulted in failure of three banks.The banks that suffered S&amp;P Global's cuts were Comerica (CMA), Associated Banc-Corp (ASB), KeyCorp (KEY), Valley National Bancorp (VLY), and UMB Financial (UMBF). S&amp;P Global indicated that these banks will remain under pressure as long as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates.S&amp;P's action came weeks after similar downgrades by its peer Moody's, which cut ratings on 10 U.S. banks and warned of potential downgrades for several large lenders.This signifies potential turbulence ahead in the banking sector, causing many to sell off banks and the inverse/leveraged bank ETF to jump.Fitch Ratings too cut its assessment of the banking industry’s health in June, a move that analyst Chris Wolfe said went largely ignored because it didn’t activate downgrades on banks. But another one-notch downgrade of the industry’s score from AA- to A+ would lead Fitch to reevaluate ratings on each of the more than 70 U.S. banks it covers, Wolfe told CNBC in mid-August.""These downgrades are mainly focused on the liquidity concerns now raised by multiple agencies where banks have a lot of loan portfolios that are only drawing 2.5-4.5% in interest income while now needing to pay depositors 4.5-5.5% in savings and money market accounts,"" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management (read: Top Inverse/Leveraged ETF Areas of Last Week).Story continuesWhat Lies Ahead?Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the need for continued vigilance in the battle against inflation in a meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyo on Aug 25. Powell emphasized that even though inflation has moderated slightly from its peak, it is still at an undesirable level. This may induce further rate hikes or a higher-than-longer interest rates (read: Fed Warns of More Rate Hikes to Tame Inflation: ETFs to Buy).Currently, there is a 51% likelihood of a 25-bps rate hike in November, up from 29.7% recorded a month ago, per CME Fed Watch Tool. There is 41.1% chance that the Fed will maintain its benchmark interest rate within the 5.25% to 5.50% range during the January 2024 meeting, while 41.7% chances are there for rates being within the 5.50% to 5.75% range during January meeting.Hence, rate hike or not, one thing is evident from the latest Fed members’ speeches that interest rates are likely stay elevated for a longer period time. No rate cuts are expected in the near term. As of Aug 28, 2023, yield on three-month U.S. treasury note was 5.58%, higher than the 10-year note (i.e., 4.20%). One -year note yielded 5.44% while two-year note yielded 4.98%. This also indicates that the yield curve remains flattened, which is a negative for the banking stocks.If these were not enough, U.S. regulators revealed plans on Aug 29 to force regional banks to issue debt in order to protect the public in the event of more failures. Impacted lenders will have to maintain long-term debt levels equal to 3.5% of average total assets or 6% of risk-weighted assets, whichever is higher, according to a fact sheet released on Aug 29, as quoted on CNBC.Any Ray of Hope?We expect the pressure to continue for bank stocks as the sentiments are bearish around the banking sector investing. Only some buy-on-dips activities can be seen occasionally. But investors should note that bank ETFs offer value. Invesco KBW Bank ETF KBWB, KBE and First Trust Nasdaq Bank ETF FTXO have a P/E of 9.38X, 6.85X and 9.49X, respectively against 17.86X P/E ratio offered by the S&amp;P 500.Earnings season have come in upbeat in the latest reporting season. The S&amp;P 500 financial sector has recorded 4.3% gains in earnings with a beat ratio of 72.5% while the sector has reported 11.4% uptick in revenues with a beat ratio of 72.5%, per Zacks Earnings Trends issued on Aug 23, 2023 (read: Bank ETFs in Focus on Consumer vs Corporate Tug-of-War in Q2).Profits in consumer banking have surged due to increased credit card borrowing, higher loan charges, and robust consumer spending. JPMorgan JPM and Wells Fargo WFC, which have extensive consumer franchises, gained on the trend. Corporate activities have been downbeat. So, as long as consumers’ health is good, bank stocks will have a cushion.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the financial sector and its performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Financial Dividend Stocks To Invest In.Over the years, the finance industry in the US has gone through several changes. The onset of the pandemic and the recent banking crisis have made these changes even more intense. Following the failure of three major US banks in March this year, worried customers and investors rushed to withdraw their funds. CNN reported that these banks had about $559 billion in total assets, surpassing the $523 billion held by 25 banks that collapsed in 2008 when accounting for inflation.The effects of the pandemic have resulted in financial companies from Wall Street shifting away from New York City and moving to the Sun Belt region. According to Bloomberg, the firms are taking almost $1 trillion worth of managed assets with them. This move is being driven by factors like taxes and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also by practical and cultural reasons. Amid the pandemic, factors like no state income tax, pleasant weather, and business-friendly offers encouraged New York-based hedge fund billionaires to move their businesses to Florida. The report also mentioned that between the beginning of 2020 and the end of March 2023, over 370 investment companies, which is about 2.5% of all US investment firms, shifted their main offices to a different state. These companies collectively managed assets worth $2.7 trillion.In one of the recent developments, shares of several US banks dropped on August 22. This happened after S&amp;P Global, a rating agency, lowered credit ratings for certain regional banks that are heavily involved in commercial real estate. These banks include KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA), and Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE:ASB). This action came after a similar move by Moody's. Both of these rating agencies are making these changes because of an ongoing banking crisis that started in March.Story continuesS&amp;P Global mentioned challenging conditions affecting the banking sector. Here is what the credit agency said in its report:""The sharp rise in interest rates and quantitative tightening deployed since March 2022 to combat high inflation are weighing on many U.S. banks' funding, liquidity and spread income. These factors have also caused the value of banks' assets to fall and raised the odds of asset quality deterioration.""Investing in financial stocks means putting money into the top businesses that offer banking, insurance, credit cards, and various other financial services around the world. Since the financial sector is central to the worldwide economy, it's a smart idea for investors to seriously think about including financial stocks as a significant part of their investment collections. Due to the ongoing issues in the finance industry, the sector is struggling to match the pace of the market. The S&amp;P 500 Financials, which tracks the performance of some of the most prominent finance companies such as Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), is down by 1.11% year-to-date. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 gained 14.44% this year so far.Also read: 12 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy NowInvesting in dividend stocks within the finance sector can be a prudent strategy for income investors.

HP Inc. (HPQ) shares fell after the tech manufacturer illustrated slowing PC demand in its mixed earnings report. Lastly, Nvidia (NVDA) stock closes higher at an all-time high, continuing a record run starting on Tuesday, August 29.Yahoo Finance Live checks out several of the day's trending stocks after Wednesday's closing bell.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: And that's the closing bell on Wall Street, checking in on where we are closing the day. All three of the major averages ending in the green. You're looking at the S&amp;P above 4,500, up now for four days in a row. The Dow up just about 38 points. The NASDAQ up about a half of a percent.Investors sifting through a number of econ data points that were out this morning before the bell, showing slowing growth. And it looks like investors actually taking that as good news and maybe that means that the Fed is going to back off on future rate hikes. But, again, all three of the major averages closing today to the upside.Let's check in on some of the top trending tickers of the day. Shares of Visa and Mastercard both closing to the upside on reports that the two companies are planning to increase fees that businesses pay when they accept customers' credit cards. Now the increases are scheduled to start in October for Visa's online transactions. And Mastercard's new pre-authorization fee for credit card purchases.Akiko, obviously this is bad news for merchants. We know merchants are likely going to fight this. They have already facing a pretty steady climb in the amount that they are paying in terms of fees for these credit card companies. But it alss it does mean something for the consumers at the end of the day because the merchants are likely to pass along those prices in some capacity to consumers through higher prices for their products.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I mean, that is the big concern. I mean, it's worth running through some of the numbers in terms of where the fees stand right now. US merchants paid an estimated $93 billion in Visa and Mastercard fees last year.Story continuesYou talk about this additional hike that we're talking about today, an additional $502 million annually in fees and really does come down to businesses saying, look, this is just not the time to be doing it. That's the concern, especially with the higher costs they've had to deal with.And then of course, the concern on the other end is if they're not able to shoulder some of those additional costs and how much of that is going to get passed down to consumers. So we'll have to be watching when those hikes take effect in October, as well as April.Well, shares of PC making giant HP Inc in the red today, as slowing demand for computers led to a full-year profit warning. HP now sees full-year adjusted earnings of $3.23 to $3.25 a share. That's down from $3.30 to $3.50. Previously, the stock getting hit today, down more than 6%.It feels like, Seana, there's two schools of thought here when you think about analysts that are weighing in. You've got Evercore ISI saying this is sort of the short-term pain that we're seeing. But long term, HP's margins are holding up at the top end of its product range. They've maintained a price target of $33 a share.But then you've got Citi that says, look, even if the PC demand, which of course, has been quite weak. Even if those turnaround, the print headwinds are still likely to really pressure HP moving forward.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. Also, Morgan Stanley pointing to those print headwinds. The decline that we saw here in the most recent quarter. And taking a look at what those sales looked like for HP. Print declines for sales, off about 7% to 4.3 billion. And the argument here is that the declining sales, that could actually limit future growth.When we talk about this turnaround story, clearly not taking place in the timeline that HP had initially anticipated. So the company really seeing the fact that others are putting off spending amid job cuts, amid the broader pullback in the economy. They also cited a weakness out of China as another headwind facing HP.So I think there's lots of questions just about what this recovery is going to look like and potentially how much longer it could take relative to what executives had been hoping for and they were hoping for obviously that it would be taking place right now. And we'd see it pick up in the second half of the year.All right, let's also take a look at shares of NVIDIA, closing the day in the green, hitting an all time high. Now up over 230% on the year, closing the day up just about 1% Now this coming after the company's second quarter earnings recently blowing past already sky high expectations. AI hype train continuing to push the stock higher.And, Akiko, when you take a look at the Street's reaction to the results and what we've seen play out over the last week or so, Wall Street continuing to get more bullish on NVIDIA. The average analyst price target now at 644 bucks a share.AKIKO FUJITA: That is incredible when you consider that run. I mean, a number we like to say a lot, Seana, is NVIDIA has a market share of 85% to 90% when it comes to AI chips.But our tech editor, Dan Howley, has an interesting piece out today, that essentially says, look, there's a first mover advantage, but this isn't going to last at these levels for long for NVIDIA largely because their competitors, especially AMD as well as Intel are working on their own offerings.His piece seems to suggest that they could really make big inroads, particularly based on what NVIDIA has right now but the stock still trading at what was that? Can we bring that up again? I mean, 690, was that the call? I mean, that's the Street high, right? Still got a long way to go at $492 a share.]"

Tematica Research Chief Investment Officer Chris Versace explains why, as we head into the month, you should “have your shopping list” ready. Some of the stocks on Versace's shopping list include, Qualcomm (QCOM), Universal Display (OLED), and CIBR ETF (CIBR).One area Versace is watching is cybersecurity, saying “we have broad-based exposure to that in the CIBR ETF… so we’re not relying on any one particular cybersecurity company.”Versace also notes that there are some signs the smartphone market is showing recovery. “We do like Apple (AAPL), but we’re becoming increasingly positive on Qualcomm. We also like a company called Universal Display that is seeing and benefiting from the adoption of organic light-emitting diode displays,” Versace explains.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: So in this environment, let's start off with some of your top stock picks that you're looking at at the moment.CHRIS VERSACE: So, you know, when we try to capitalize on the evolving landscape, take really laying-- layering into thematics as we do that. But one of the pervasive areas that we tend to see just gaining traction is going to be the area of cybersecurity . Over at the Action Alerts Plus portfolio that I manage for the Street, we have broad-based exposure to that in the CIBR, C-I-B-R, ETF. And you know, we like that because it not only gives us broad-based exposure like I said. So we're not relying on any one particular cybersecurity company. We like that because, again, of the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, whether it's increasingly in IoT or some other attack vector.The way we think about it is, as we continue to move deeper into the digital world, hackers become increasingly creative forcing companies to once again re-up, re-protect if you will, their crown jewels. So we like that, but we're also seeing other signs that are emerging that, kind of, point to an improving smartphone market, particularly outside the Android ecosystem in that environment. Yes, we do like Apple, but we're becoming increasingly positive on Qualcomm. We also like a company called Universal Display that is seeing and benefiting from the adoption of organic light-emitting diode displays not just in smartphones, but increasingly in tablets-- tablets, excuse me, and in other markets.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: Chris, and the type of environment that we are in and, kind of, naming some of the economic data that's come out that the Fed sure at their next meeting might consider. But at the same time, a lot of people not really expecting them to really make a decision one way or the other firmly until November meeting and so, kind of, waiting and seeing. In this wait-and-see period, where should investors be most apt to, kind of, pick out a few names where you've, kind of, got the Fed on the sidelines at least at this upcoming meeting?CHRIS VERSACE: Well, Brad, I think you used the right word, which is pick. And I say that because it's very difficult to go kind of like, you know, all in or all out because we're just not really sure what the data is going to bring. And as Rachelle had mentioned, we saw some nice, favorable data that says, yes, the Fed's efforts are bearing fruit. The ADP report showed slower job growth month over month and also, if you dig into it showed better wage gains, and by that I mean slower wage gains year over year in August compared to not only July, but earlier this year as well, the JOLTS report you referenced.But let's just understand, we have a lot more data that we're going to get not only before the September meeting, but before the November meeting. My thinking here is at least in the very near term, we've got the July PCE that will drop or be reported, I should say. Tomorrow on Thursday, we've got the employment report. We've got data from S&amp;P Global both for manufacturing and services. And we still have the July data for-- sorry, August data coming for CPI/PPI, again, all before the Fed's September meeting.And my thinking on this is the market is going to be very volatile, kind of, trading, right, on the most recent data point that it gets because we're trying to assemble all these puzzle pieces together to figure out what is the Fed likely to do. So my advice against that backdrop as you, kind of, alluded to, Brad, is have your shopping list. I rattled off some of the things that we own over at Action Alerts Plus, some of the ones that we're looking at as well. And we're just going to slowly build our positions using pullbacks hopefully to improve our cost basis.]"

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.46bUS$6.46bUS$6.81bUS$7.19bUS$7.43bUS$7.64bUS$7.85bUS$8.05bUS$8.25bUS$8.44bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x10Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 3.29%Est @ 2.95%Est @ 2.71%Est @ 2.54%Est @ 2.42%Est @ 2.34% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.4% US$6.1kUS$5.7kUS$5.6kUS$5.6kUS$5.4kUS$5.3kUS$5.1kUS$4.9kUS$4.7kUS$4.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$53bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.4b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.4%– 2.2%) = US$201bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$201b÷ ( 1 + 6.4%)10= US$108bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$161b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$448, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 30% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Lockheed Martin as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.858. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Lockheed MartinStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace &amp; Defense market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with HST. Click here to check it out. PHM 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PHMPulteGroup Inc is one of the largest homebuilders in the United States, with operations spanning across 42 markets in 24 states. The company primarily builds single-family detached homes, catering to entry-level, move-up, and active-adult buyers. PulteGroup also offers mortgage financing and title agency services through its financial services segment. The company is headquartered in Atlanta and has a market cap of $17.90 billion. Comparing the stock price of $81.4 with the GF Value of $77.27, it appears that PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) is fairly valued.Unveiling PulteGroup (PHM)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideDeciphering the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. This value is derived from historical trading multiples, GuruFocus adjustment factors based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line on the summary page provides an overview of the stock's fair value. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Given PulteGroup's current price of $81.4 per share and a market cap of $17.90 billion, the stock appears to be fairly valued. This means that the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Story continuesUnveiling PulteGroup (PHM)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideAssessing PulteGroup's Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength can result in permanent capital loss. Therefore, investors must carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding whether to buy shares.

Its operating margin is 21.38%, ranking better than 88.18% of 110 companies in the Homebuilding &amp; Construction industry. Overall, PulteGroup's profitability is ranked 10 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth.

PulteGroup's average annual revenue growth is 22.8%, which ranks better than 84.47% of 103 companies in the Homebuilding &amp; Construction industry. Its 3-year average EBITDA growth is 43.2%, ranking better than 79.17% of 96 companies in the industry.Return on Invested Capital vs Weighted Average Cost of CapitalComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is another method of determining its profitability. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, PulteGroup's return on invested capital is 23.94, and its cost of capital is 9.39.Unveiling PulteGroup (PHM)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right?

In the current scenario, we recommend stocks like Sprouts Farmers Market SFM, PulteGroup PHM, Kirby Corp. KEX, Atmos Energy ATO and Teekay Tankers TNK, which bear low leverage. These picks can shield investors from incurring losses in times of crisis.Now, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let’s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock helps investors.In finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.However, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to exorbitant debt financing.The crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.The equity market can be volatile at times and as an investor, if you don’t want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks, which bear low leverage and are hence less risky.To identify such stocks, historically, several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityStory continuesThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.With the second-quarter earnings cycle behind us, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.Yet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 or 2: Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks out of the 22 stocks that made it through the screen.Sprouts Farmers Market: The company has a unique model that features fresh produce, a foods section and a vitamin department focused on overall wellness.

Holdings",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-pultegroup-112300516.html,1693394580,STORY,"['MTH', 'TOL', 'MDC', 'PHM', 'TMHC', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – August 30, 2023 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses PulteGroup Inc. PHM, Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL, Taylor Morrison Home Corp. TMHC, Meritage Homes Corp. MTH and M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. MDC.Industry: HomebuildingLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2141804/5-top-ranked-stocks-to-buy-from-the-buoyant-homebuilding-industryThe U.S. housing space continues to grapple with accelerating mortgage rates, rising raw material and labor costs. That said, the rising need for more work-at-home space, lack of existing homes for sale, focus on cost control, increased operating leverage and important buyouts have been boosting the confidence of the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry players. Companies like PulteGroup Inc., Toll Brothers, Inc., Taylor Morrison Home Corp., Meritage Homes Corp. and M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. have been gaining from their fundamental strength and the above-mentioned tailwinds.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry comprises manufacturers of residential and commercial buildings. Some industry players are involved in providing financial services that include selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance agencies as well as closing services. The industry players are involved in building single-family detached and attached home communities; townhouses, condominiums, duplexes and triplexes; master-planned luxury residential resort-style golf communities; and urban low, mid, and high-rise communities.The companies are also involved in the purchase, development and sale of residential land. Additionally, the companies build and own multi-family rental properties, residential real estate, and oil and gas assets.4 Trends Shaping the Homebuilding Industry's FutureLack of Supply, Suburban Shift: There is a sizable shortage of new homes after more than a decade of under-building compared with population growth. Although demand has slowed recently, supply remains very low. Continued demand for homes despite rising mortgage interest rates amid low supply has been generating profit for homebuilders.Story continuesMeanwhile, the changing geography of housing demand has been supporting builder confidence. Demand for new homes is improving in lower-density markets, including small metro areas, rural markets and large metro exurbs, as people seek larger homes to work from home amid the pandemic. The desire for more space and amenities to accommodate working and learning from home should continue to boost the U.S. housing market in the near term.Cost-Control Efforts, Focus on Entry-Level Buyers &amp; Acquisitions: Given the accelerated raw material prices, companies have been relying on effective cost control and focusing on making the homebuilding platform more efficient, which, in turn, is resulting in higher operating leverage. Homebuilders have been controlling construction costs by designing homes efficiently and obtaining construction materials and labor at competitive prices. Some homebuilders also follow a dynamic pricing model, which enables them to set the price according to the latest market conditions.Again, the majority of companies are focused on the growing demand for entry-level homes and addressing the need for lower-priced homes, given affordability concerns in the U.S. housing market. Meanwhile, industry players have been acquiring other homebuilding companies in desirable markets, resulting in improved volumes, market share, revenues and profitability.Higher Rates: The home affordability issue remains a headwind owing to accelerating mortgage rates. While remaining committed to combating inflation, the Fed raised interest rates last year at the fastest pace since the 1980s, pushing borrowing costs above 5% from near zero. On Jul 26, 2023, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for its benchmark interest rate by 0.25% while leaving its options open on future rate hikes.The central bank's move pushed its benchmark policy rate, the Fed funds rate, to a new range of 5.25%-5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. Notably, as part of the Fed's rate hiking drive since the 1980s, the U.S. central bank has lifted the range for its benchmark interest rate by 5.25 percentage points since March 2022. This is less encouraging for this rate-sensitive market, which accounts for almost 3% of the economy.Tight Labor &amp; Credit Markets: Although there has been a modest improvement in the supply chain and some easing in labor constraints, supply-chain challenges are still expected to continue to impact the level of housing starts and construction cycle times to some extent in the near term. Continuous supply-chain issues in various countries have been impacting builders' ability to deliver on time.Again, the shortage of skilled construction labor continues to be a pressing concern. With the rising demand for construction, the industry requires more skilled professionals, which is vital to America's economy. Meanwhile, there still exists supply shortages of building materials as well as tightening credit conditions for residential real estate development and construction due to the recent banking crisis and higher interest rates.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry is an 18-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #4, which places it in the top 2% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a higher earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. Since May 2023, the industry's earnings estimates for 2023 and 2024 have increased 20% and 20.1%, respectively.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index and the broader Zacks Construction sector in the past year.Over this period, the industry has gained 60% compared with the S&amp;P 500's rise of 10.5%. The broader sector has gained 30.7% over the time frame.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio, which is commonly used for valuing homebuilding stocks, the industry is currently trading at 8.3 compared with the S&amp;P 500's 19.1 and the sector's 14.5.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 11.6X and as low as 4.2X, with a median of 8.8X.5 Homebuilding Stocks to Buy NowWe have selected five stocks from the Zacks homebuilding space that currently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and are expected to register growth. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Toll Brothers: Based in Horsham, PA, Toll Brothers is a leading builder of luxury homes. The company has been benefiting from its strategy of broadening its product lines, price points and geographies. Also, it has been gaining from the lack of competition in the luxury new home market, its build-to-order approach and solid backlog level. This, combined with its focus on operational efficiency, has been helping TOL to drive growth. Meanwhile, the company has been strategically adding more affordable luxury communities because of the current demographic trends and expanding footprint and customer base. These communities are expected to be more capital efficient.Toll Brothers stock gained 54.4% so far this year, outperforming the industry's 38.6% rise. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2023 have increased to $11.59 per share from $10.61 over the past seven days. The company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average being 31.4%. Again, it carries an impressive VGM Score of A. This helps to identify stocks with the most attractive value, growth and momentum.PulteGroup: Based in Atlanta, GA, this homebuilder has been benefiting from a prudent land investment strategy, focus on entry-level buyers and return of more free cash flow to shareholders. PulteGroup's annual land acquisition strategies have been resulting in improved volumes, revenues and profitability for quite some time now. The company has been reaping benefits from the successful execution of strategic initiatives to boost profitability, with a focus on entry-level homes. Its solid operating model, which strategically aligns the production of build-to-order and quick-move-in homes with applicable demand across consumer groups, has been a major tailwind.PulteGroup stock has jumped 90.4% year to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 and 2024 earnings has been upwardly revised by 12.3% and 9%, respectively, over the past 30 days. Its earnings topped consensus estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed on one occasion, with the average surprise being 19.5%. Again, it carries an impressive VGM Score of A.Meritage Homes: Based in Scottsdale, AZ, Meritage Homes is one of the leading designers and builders of single-family homes. Its focus on entry-level LiVE.NOW homes has been a major driving factor. Although the combined effect of greater sales incentives and continued elevated direct costs has been impacting the company's gross margins, MTH is particularly focused on increasing gross margins and maximizing profits on every sale.To this end, it is making homes out of speculations that promise faster delivery at a lower cost. Meritage Homes' strategic shift to a pure-play entry-level and first-move-up builder is expected to yield higher absorptions, aided by an improving community count growth trajectory.Meritage Homes' shares gained 65.5% so far this year. MTH has seen an upward estimate revision for 2023 and 2024 earnings by 25.2% and 22.6% over the past 30 days, respectively.

Holdings: Headquartered in Denver, CO, this company's homebuilding operations include purchasing finished lots or developing lots for the construction and sale of primarily single-family detached homes to first-time and first-time move-up homebuyers under the Richmond American Homes name. In a bid to stay competitive in the current market condition, MDC is offering great opportunities for build-to-order buyers, such as long-term interest rate lock programs and other special incentives. The company's land acquisition strategies and high liquidity add to its growth.MDC — a Zacks Rank #1 stock — has jumped 40.4% year to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 and 2024 earnings has been upwardly revised by 33.4% and 30.4%, respectively, over the past 30 days. The company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and missed on other two occasions, the average surprise being 46%. Again, it carries an impressive VGM Score of A.Taylor Morrison Home: This Scottsdale, AZ-based homebuilder and land developer is engaged in building single-family detached and attached homes for first-time buyers, move-up families to luxury and active adult customers. The company has been benefiting from critical advantages by achieving greater scale, simplifying its operations and embracing innovation to drive both growth opportunities and enhance bottom-line growth. Focus on the operational efficiencies and solid liquidity level are tailwinds.TMHC shares gained 72.4% so far this year. TMHC has seen an upward estimate revision for 2023 and 2024 earnings over the past 30 days by 3.4% and 5.7%, respectively.

But analysts are eagerly awaiting final prices, which have yet to be negotiated.In a note Tuesday, Goldman Sachs analysts said the minimal impact to the companies' stocks was because much remains unknown.""We see relatively limited scope for stocks to react materially to the contents of [yesterday] morning’s announcement, given that in our view, potentially the more impactful update will come with the potential disclosure ... of [Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)]' initial maximum fair price offer,"" the analysts said.In lawsuits filed by companies to block or delay negotiations, plaintiffs allege there is uncertainty around what the CMS will determine to be a fair price.Medicare Director and CMS Deputy Administrator Dr. Meena Seshamani told Yahoo Finance that the agency intends to engage in a ""true back-and-forth process"" for negotiations.Farxiga, Xarelto, Entresto, and Eliquis at the New City Halsted Pharmacy on Aug. 29, 2023 in Chicago, Illinois. These are 4 of 10 prescription drugs that will be subject to Medicare price negotiations under the Inflation Reduction Act. The other drugs include Jardiance, Enbrel, Januvia, Imbruvica, Stelara, and Fiasp.

The overall survival (OS) analysis for this study is ongoing.Merck received accelerated approval from the FDA in 2021 for the Keytruda-trastuzumab-chemotherapy combination in a similar indication.Merck’s shares have lost 0.9% year to date against the industry’s 8.1% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMerck has an extensive clinical development program evaluating Keytruda in gastrointestinal cancers, including in the early stage of the disease. In April, the FDA accepted the company’s label expansion filing seeking approval for using Keytruda plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma. A final decision is expected in December.Gastric cancer tends to develop slowly over many years and rarely causes early symptoms, resulting in most cases going undetected until it reaches an advanced stage. Per Merck, the five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with gastric cancer at an advanced stage is only 6%. Management also estimates that this year, in the United States alone, there will be approximately 26,500 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer and 11,000 deaths from the disease.Story continuesKeytruda, the key revenue generator for Merck, is already approved for treating many cancers globally. In first-half 2023, Merck recorded $12.1 billion in sales from Keytruda, up 20% year over year. Drug sales are gaining from continued strong momentum in metastatic indications and rapid uptake across recent earlier-stage launches. Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally.Merck is also evaluating Keytruda across many indications that are progressing well. Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer indications in more than 1700 studies, including combination studies. If approved, label expansions for new cancer indications can further boost sales.Merck &amp; Co., Inc. Price Merck &amp; Co., Inc. PriceMerck &amp; Co., Inc. price | Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

Yahoo Finance Health Care Reporter Anjalee Khemlani breaks down the list and how this may impact the pharmaceutical companies who profit from these drugs.The ten drugs and pharma companies impacted are:Eliquis - Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Pfizer (PFE)Jardiance - Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly (LLY)Xarelto- Bayer (BAYRY), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Januvia - Merck (MRK)Farxiga - AstraZeneca (AZN)Entresto - Novartis (NVS)Enbrel - Amgen (AMGN)Imbruvica - Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), AbbVie (ABBV)Stelara - Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Fiasp, NovoLog - Novo Nordisk (NVO)Video Transcript- Shifting gears now to Medicare. It achieved a milestone Tuesday by announcing the list of 10 drugs that would be the first ever to face price negotiations. Now some analysts were surprised by a few of the picks but remained confident that all drugs represent no real threat to company earnings. For more on this story, we're joined by Anjalee Khemlani. Anjalee, I know you've been following this for us.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right, Rachelle. It's definitely interesting to see some of the picks yesterday. Of course, many analysts had already picked and targeted some of those drugs. But I've got an interesting note from JPM looking at those picks saying that overall the update was largely expected with key drugs like Eliquis and Imbruvica on that list, but Stelara from Johnson &amp; Johnson was a surprise for many because of the fact that it faces a biosimilar competition in the upcoming years before the 2026 year that this goes into effect.However, the rest of the drugs are small revenue and earnings per share contributors to their company, so JPM doesn't really see that. And I saw that theme repeated in many of the notes that came out yesterday. But when I started thinking about also was how much of that is true when it comes to the earnings and the profit or rather the sales from these companies in the time period that CMS looked at which was June of last year through May of this year?Story continuesI did a little bit of back of the napkin math to take a look at Eliquis first. For example, CMS did say in that time period, the cost to it for part D beneficiaries was $16.5 billion. And that total it seems to match what Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer, who both share in the profits for this did mention in their quarterly earnings in that time period.And that's if you compare that to their total revenues for that time period, Bristol Myers Squibb saying that $57 billion is what their total revenues were for that year and nearly $78 billion for Pfizer. And then I looked at Stelara, the surprise pick, that was on the lower end for Medicare-- $2.6 billion as their cost. And then meanwhile, Johnson &amp; Johnson saying in that same time period again last June to this May, $12.7 billion from Stelara alone.And if you compare that to the total company's earnings of $121.7 billion, you can see how it does contribute a smaller amount. In the previous example we did often see Eliquis cited as a driver of earnings for those two companies, and Stelara has always been called out as a strong product.So it will be interesting whether or not those LOEs, that loss of exclusivity, is that driver behind those comments for the analysts on considering how much of an impact it really is going to take on these companies earnings moving forward. We did see some notes about analysts estimating that the price drop could be somewhere in the 40% range from the current pricing. So definitely something to keep an eye on as the negotiation process begins next year.BRAD SMITH: And Anj, what happens to all of the lawsuits against Medicare now?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Yeah, good question. So most of these companies that we saw listed, like I said, expected so the companies had already filed citing their anticipation as being targeted by this list. As the list, for example, did not make the cut, whether or not they will continue to push forward in their lawsuit remains to be seen.Pfizer has not yet independently filed a lawsuit. However, it is as, we mentioned earlier, one of the drugs-- one of the companies that has a drug listed. Novartis as well is one of those-- Novo Nordisk. So a couple of those companies haven't yet individually filed. They do belong to pharma, the lobbying firm, as well as the US Chamber of Commerce which we know has filed those lawsuits. But as of right now, unclear on which ones will go forward, which new ones will be expected, and so we're keeping an eye on that for you.BRAD SMITH: All right, Anjalee Khemlani, thanks for tracking all of this and keeping an eye on it. We appreciate it.]"

But I've got an interesting note from JPM looking at those picks saying that overall the update was largely expected with key drugs like Eliquis and Imbruvica on that list, but Stelara from Johnson &amp; Johnson was a surprise for many because of the fact that it faces a biosimilar competition in the upcoming years before the 2026 year that this goes into effect.However, the rest of the drugs are small revenue and earnings per share contributors to their company, so JPM doesn't really see that. And I saw that theme repeated in many of the notes that came out yesterday. But when I started thinking about also was how much of that is true when it comes to the earnings and the profit or rather the sales from these companies in the time period that CMS looked at which was June of last year through May of this year?Story continuesI did a little bit of back of the napkin math to take a look at Eliquis first. For example, CMS did say in that time period, the cost to it for part D beneficiaries was $16.5 billion. And that total it seems to match what Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer, who both share in the profits for this did mention in their quarterly earnings in that time period.And that's if you compare that to their total revenues for that time period, Bristol Myers Squibb saying that $57 billion is what their total revenues were for that year and nearly $78 billion for Pfizer. And then I looked at Stelara, the surprise pick, that was on the lower end for Medicare-- $2.6 billion as their cost. And then meanwhile, Johnson &amp; Johnson saying in that same time period again last June to this May, $12.7 billion from Stelara alone.And if you compare that to the total company's earnings of $121.7 billion, you can see how it does contribute a smaller amount. In the previous example we did often see Eliquis cited as a driver of earnings for those two companies, and Stelara has always been called out as a strong product.So it will be interesting whether or not those LOEs, that loss of exclusivity, is that driver behind those comments for the analysts on considering how much of an impact it really is going to take on these companies earnings moving forward. We did see some notes about analysts estimating that the price drop could be somewhere in the 40% range from the current pricing. So definitely something to keep an eye on as the negotiation process begins next year.BRAD SMITH: And Anj, what happens to all of the lawsuits against Medicare now?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Yeah, good question. So most of these companies that we saw listed, like I said, expected so the companies had already filed citing their anticipation as being targeted by this list. As the list, for example, did not make the cut, whether or not they will continue to push forward in their lawsuit remains to be seen.Pfizer has not yet independently filed a lawsuit. However, it is as, we mentioned earlier, one of the drugs-- one of the companies that has a drug listed. Novartis as well is one of those-- Novo Nordisk. So a couple of those companies haven't yet individually filed. They do belong to pharma, the lobbying firm, as well as the US Chamber of Commerce which we know has filed those lawsuits. But as of right now, unclear on which ones will go forward, which new ones will be expected, and so we're keeping an eye on that for you.BRAD SMITH: All right, Anjalee Khemlani, thanks for tracking all of this and keeping an eye on it. We appreciate it.]"

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly. Top 5 Upgrades: Goldman Sachs upgraded PDD Holdings (PDD) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $129, up from $99, following what the firm calls a ""significant"" Q2 earnings beat, driven mostly from domestic online ad revenue being up 50% year-over-year.Citi upgraded Sunrun (RUN) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $21, down from $25. While headwinds from higher interest rates and net energy metering impacts appear to be largely priced into the shares, Sunrun is not getting due credit for its market share gains from third party owner shift, path to free cash flow generation, no corporate level equity raises, projected component cost deflation, and success in selling battery storage, the firm says.Scotiabank upgraded UDR (UDR) to Outperform from Sector Perform with a price target of $45, up from $44. The firm sees a relative valuation discount in UDR shares that ""offers an attractive entry point.""Compass Point upgraded Hercules Capital (HTGC) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $17.50, up from $17. Hercules raised $108M in fresh capital through a syndicated equity offering of 6.5M shares in early August and the ""only reason to do a syndicated equity offering is that originations are accelerating faster than expected,"" the firm notes.JPMorgan upgraded Cemig (CIG) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of R$16, up from R$14.50. The firm believes state-owned utilities controlled by the state of Minas Gerais are being mispriced by the market. Top 5 Downgrades:Bernstein downgraded Texas Instruments (TXT) to Underperform from Market Perform with an unchanged price target of $145. The firm says Street models do not appear to contemplate the consequences of Texas Instruments' capex and inventory plans. TD Cowen downgraded Ambarella (AMBA) to Market Perform from Outperform with a price target of $65, down from $90, following the Q2 report. The company announced ""another hard expectation cut"" as customer inventory burn accelerates, leaving Ambarella with little visibility in the near and intermediate term, the firm notes.Craig-Hallum downgraded Box (BOX) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $30, down from $35. Growth at Box is slowing to a halt as customers continue to lower their rate of seat expansion, the firm says.Morgan Stanley downgraded Centene (CNC) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $73, down from $94. The firm has lowered confidence in the visibility and stability of the company's long term earnings growth profile. Barclays downgraded Rockwell Automation (ROK) to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $287, down from $300. The company has attractive end market exposures and an un-levered balance sheet, but the stock's valuation is ""quite rich"" after rallying 20% year-to-date, the firm argues.Top 5 Initiations: WestPark Capital initiated coverage of Palo Alto Networks (PANW) with a Buy rating and $340 price target. The firm believes Palo Alto is ""leaving competitors far behind"" and that the company's growing scale will provide additional competitive benefits versus smaller point solutions.HSBC initiated coverage of Align Technology (ALGN) with a Buy rating and $450 price target. The firm believes the dental market is under-penetrated, with an addressable size of $20B and a solid growth profile, and says ageing demographics and consumer spending patterns are long- and mid-term drivers of growth.Citi initiated coverage of Cognex (CGNX) with a Neutral rating and $52 price target. The firm says softer near-term demand trends across most of the company's end markets and its ""still relatively elevated"" valuation could keep shares relatively range-bound in the near-term.B. Riley initiated coverage of AZZ Inc. (AZZ) with a Buy rating and $64 price target.  The firm believes the company has ""several compelling investment attributes,"" including the durability of cash flows, a leading position in its respective markets, and disciplined capital allocation.Janney Montgomery Scott initiated coverage of BCB Bancorp (BCBP) with a Buy rating and $18.50 fair value estimate. The traditional lender focused on commercial lending, not thrift-related assets, in Northern New Jersey is an ""inexpensive community bank"" that currently trades at a 30% discount to tangible book value, or TBV, per share, the firm tells investors.]"

The owners include Georgia Power (45.7%), Oglethorpe Power (30%), Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (22.7%) and Dalton Utilities (1.6%).The start up of the reactors has been hailed as a major milestone in U.S. nuclear power construction, but the units arrived more than seven years later than originally planned and at a budget of more than double the preliminary projected cost at over $30 billion.

With the commission's Public Interest Advocacy staff and three ratepayer groups signing on, the agreement is likely to avert contentious hearings over how much blame the company should bear for billions in cost overruns at two new nuclear reactors southeast of Augusta.Vogtle's Unit 3 and Unit 4 are the first new American reactors built from scratch in decades. Each reactor can power 500,000 homes and businesses without releasing any carbon. But even as government officials and some utilities are again looking to nuclear power to alleviate climate change, the cost of Vogtle could discourage utilities from pursuing nuclear power.Jacob Hawkins, a Georgia Power spokesperson, said the agreement represents “a balanced approach that recognizes the value of this long-term investment for the state and recognizes affordability needs for customers.”Liz Coyle, the executive director of Georgia Watch, a consumer advocacy group that signed the agreement, said the reactors will never be cheaper than alternative sources of power. But since regulators, traditionally friendly to Georgia Power, allowed them to be built, Coyle said it was important to limit consumers’ exposure.“I believe that this is the best outcome we could get with where we are in this process,” Coyle said.Public service commissioners declined comment on the deal, saying all the evidence hadn’t been heard.The project's overall cost, including financing, is currently $31 billion for Georgia Power and three other owners, Associated Press calculations show. Add in $3.7 billion that original contractor Westinghouse paid the Vogtle owners to walk away from construction, and the total nears $35 billion. The reactors are seven years late and $17 billion over budget.Story continuesGeorgia Power says it has spent $10.2 billion on its share of construction for Vogtle Units 3 and 4, built alongside two earlier reactors. Public service commissioners originally approved the largest unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co. to spend $4.4 billion. After years of delays and cost overruns, the commission said in 2017 that it would consider $7.3 billion as a reasonable cost for Georgia Power.In a regulatory filing Wednesday, Georgia Power argued that $8.8 billion of the $10.2 billion had been prudently spent on construction, while $1.4 billion should be disallowed. But the company agreed to give up an additional $1.3 billion that it could have sought from customers, amid indications that Public Service Commission staffers would argue that even some spending below the reasonable cap was wasted by mismanagement.The company says that would work out to an additional $8.95 per month for a typical residential customer, added to the current $153 monthly bill. The increase would begin when Unit 4 enters commercial operation. Georgia Power has loaded fuel into Unit 4 and says it will reach commercial operation before March 30.Bills went up $5 this month after Unit 3 entered commercial operation. That's atop a $16-a-month increase to pay for higher fuel costs two months ago. There was also an increase in base rates early this year, with another scheduled next year.Hawkins said Southern Co. shareholders wouldn't absorb additional losses under the agreement, because the company has already written off $3.26 billion in anticipated Vogtle losses since 2018. Georgia Power could seek to recoup some of those losses from contractors, and the agreement allows shareholders to keep all of any such gains.Georgia Power owns 45.7% of the reactors. Smaller shares are owned by Oglethorpe Power Corp., which provides electricity to member-owned cooperatives, the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia and the city of Dalton. Some Florida and Alabama utilities have also contracted to buy Vogtle’s power.Ratepayer groups won other concessions. Georgia Power agreed to double the size of a bill-relief program that applies to some low-income seniors.The plan is projected to add 96,000 beneficiaries over the next three years. That includes seniors in households with low incomes, and people of all ages who get federal housing vouchers or federal disability payments.

The owners include Georgia Power (45.7%), Oglethorpe Power (30%), Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (22.7%) and Dalton Utilities (1.6%).The start up of the reactors has been hailed as a major milestone in U.S. nuclear power construction, but the units arrived more than seven years later than originally planned and at a budget of more than double the preliminary projected cost at over $30 billion.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Cigna Group's shares on or after the 5th of September, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 21st of September.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.23 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$4.92 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Cigna Group has a trailing yield of 1.7% on the current stock price of $282.67. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Cigna Group's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for Cigna Group Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Cigna Group has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 21% of its income after tax. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. What's good is that dividends were well covered by free cash flow, with the company paying out 12% of its cash flow last year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's encouraging to see Cigna Group has grown its earnings rapidly, up 20% a year for the past five years. Cigna Group earnings per share have been sprinting ahead like the Road Runner at a track and field day; scarcely stopping even for a cheeky ""beep-beep"". We also like that it is reinvesting most of its profits in its business.'Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Cigna Group has lifted its dividend by approximately 62% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.To Sum It UpShould investors buy Cigna Group for the upcoming dividend? Cigna Group has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. There's a lot to like about Cigna Group, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Cigna Group is facing.

(FL) stock tumbled again after its earnings and guidance disappointed Wall Street on August 23.The footwear retailer is facing near-term headwinds as consumers pull back on spending on goods such as expensive sneakers, alongside other issues. Foot Locker’s current troubles even caused the company to pause its dividend beyond its recently approved October payout.What’s Going On?Foot Locker is a shoe retailer that aims to ‘unlock the “inner sneakerhead” in all of us.’ The company currently has roughly 2,600 stores across 26 countries under the Foot Locker brand as well as Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, atmos, and WSS. Foot Locker has grown within the broader sneaker revolution that’s developed alongside the rise of Nike, its Jordan Brand, and other popular and trendy shoemakers.  Foot Locker is actively reshaping its business to move away from its huge dependence on Nike (NKE) as the footwear and apparel titan moves toward its own direct-to-consumer businesses. Nike is still very important to Foot Locker and it is doing all it can to have the best relationship possible with NKE.Foot Locker is also attempting to navigate the changing retail landscape that’s seen malls fade and e-commerce rise. FL currently faces many direct competitors in the sneaker space that were born and raised in the digital commerce age.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFoot Locker’s 2022 revenue dipped 2% against a tough-to-compete against year. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings fell by around 30%. The company fell short of our Q1 EPS estimates and it missed by 20% on the bottom line when it reported its second quarter results on August 23. FL’s Q2 comparable-store sales fell by 9.4%, “driven by ongoing consumer softness, changing vendor mix, and the repositioning of Champs Sports.”Foot Lock’s downbeat guidance has pushed its FY23 earnings consensus down by 28% and its FY24 outlook 20% lower. FL’s most accurate/most recent EPS estimates also came in below the newly downbeat consensus. Zacks estimates call for the company’s adjusted earnings to fall another 70% this year on 9% lower sales.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineFoot Locker’s overall downbeat earnings outlook helps it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now. The company also said when it reported its results that it is pausing its quarterly cash dividend beyond its recently approved October payout to “ensure that we have the flexibility to continue to fund our strategic investments appropriately.”Foot Locker stock is down 50% YTD and 40% over the past decade. The sharp downturn has it trading way below its 50-week and 200-week moving averages. All that said, investors might want to stay away from FL and avoid possibly attempting to catch a falling knife.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Avenatti, 52, is incarcerated at a federal prison near Los Angeles, where he lived and practiced law. His law license is suspended and he is scheduled to be released from prison in 2036.According to prosecutors, Avenatti and another lawyer — identified in the appellate court's ruling as one-time Michael Jackson lawyer Mark Geragos — went to Nike in March 2019 claiming to have evidence from a whistleblower client that the company was paying amateur basketball players.Avenatti demanded that Nike pay a settlement to the whistleblower and hire him and Geragos “to conduct an internal investigation into corruption in basketball,"" or they would hold a news conference on the eve of the company’s quarterly earnings call to ""blow the lid on this scandal,” prosecutors said.Story continuesAvenatti told Nike officials that they could either pay him and Geragos $15 million to $25 million to investigate the allegations, or pay him more than $22 million for his silence, prosecutors said.Geragos, who was not charged, later told prosecutors that he felt Avenatti had “crossed a line” with Nike and expressed to Avenatti that he was “concerned about and uncomfortable with the situation.”Avenatti was arrested in New York as he was about to meet with Nike lawyers to press his demands. The same day, federal prosecutors in California charged him with stealing from clients. Prosecutors said Avenatti's behavior may have been motivated by crippling debt stemming, in part, from a high-flying lifestyle that included a private jet, fast cars and pricy artwork.Evidence presented at Avenatti's extortion trial showed he owed at least $11 million at the time and had been evicted from his law offices for failure to pay rent that totaled roughly $50,000 a month.]"

He was convicted of extortion and honest services fraud and sentenced to 2-1/2 years in prison.Story continuesAnother 2-1/2 years behind bars were added in June 2022 after Avenatti was convicted of defrauding Daniels out of a book contract.Fourteen more years were tacked on last December after Avenatti pleaded guilty to cheating four other clients, including a paraplegic, out of millions of dollars.Avenatti may be eligible for release in January 2036.The case is U.S. v.

Yahoo Finance Health Care Reporter Anjalee Khemlani breaks down the list and how this may impact the pharmaceutical companies who profit from these drugs.The ten drugs and pharma companies impacted are:Eliquis - Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Pfizer (PFE)Jardiance - Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly (LLY)Xarelto- Bayer (BAYRY), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Januvia - Merck (MRK)Farxiga - AstraZeneca (AZN)Entresto - Novartis (NVS)Enbrel - Amgen (AMGN)Imbruvica - Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), AbbVie (ABBV)Stelara - Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Fiasp, NovoLog - Novo Nordisk (NVO)Video Transcript- Shifting gears now to Medicare. It achieved a milestone Tuesday by announcing the list of 10 drugs that would be the first ever to face price negotiations. Now some analysts were surprised by a few of the picks but remained confident that all drugs represent no real threat to company earnings. For more on this story, we're joined by Anjalee Khemlani. Anjalee, I know you've been following this for us.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right, Rachelle. It's definitely interesting to see some of the picks yesterday. Of course, many analysts had already picked and targeted some of those drugs. But I've got an interesting note from JPM looking at those picks saying that overall the update was largely expected with key drugs like Eliquis and Imbruvica on that list, but Stelara from Johnson &amp; Johnson was a surprise for many because of the fact that it faces a biosimilar competition in the upcoming years before the 2026 year that this goes into effect.However, the rest of the drugs are small revenue and earnings per share contributors to their company, so JPM doesn't really see that. And I saw that theme repeated in many of the notes that came out yesterday. But when I started thinking about also was how much of that is true when it comes to the earnings and the profit or rather the sales from these companies in the time period that CMS looked at which was June of last year through May of this year?Story continuesI did a little bit of back of the napkin math to take a look at Eliquis first. For example, CMS did say in that time period, the cost to it for part D beneficiaries was $16.5 billion. And that total it seems to match what Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer, who both share in the profits for this did mention in their quarterly earnings in that time period.And that's if you compare that to their total revenues for that time period, Bristol Myers Squibb saying that $57 billion is what their total revenues were for that year and nearly $78 billion for Pfizer. And then I looked at Stelara, the surprise pick, that was on the lower end for Medicare-- $2.6 billion as their cost. And then meanwhile, Johnson &amp; Johnson saying in that same time period again last June to this May, $12.7 billion from Stelara alone.And if you compare that to the total company's earnings of $121.7 billion, you can see how it does contribute a smaller amount. In the previous example we did often see Eliquis cited as a driver of earnings for those two companies, and Stelara has always been called out as a strong product.So it will be interesting whether or not those LOEs, that loss of exclusivity, is that driver behind those comments for the analysts on considering how much of an impact it really is going to take on these companies earnings moving forward. We did see some notes about analysts estimating that the price drop could be somewhere in the 40% range from the current pricing. So definitely something to keep an eye on as the negotiation process begins next year.BRAD SMITH: And Anj, what happens to all of the lawsuits against Medicare now?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Yeah, good question. So most of these companies that we saw listed, like I said, expected so the companies had already filed citing their anticipation as being targeted by this list. As the list, for example, did not make the cut, whether or not they will continue to push forward in their lawsuit remains to be seen.Pfizer has not yet independently filed a lawsuit. However, it is as, we mentioned earlier, one of the drugs-- one of the companies that has a drug listed. Novartis as well is one of those-- Novo Nordisk. So a couple of those companies haven't yet individually filed. They do belong to pharma, the lobbying firm, as well as the US Chamber of Commerce which we know has filed those lawsuits. But as of right now, unclear on which ones will go forward, which new ones will be expected, and so we're keeping an eye on that for you.BRAD SMITH: All right, Anjalee Khemlani, thanks for tracking all of this and keeping an eye on it. We appreciate it.]"

The Committee has also recommended the updated vaccine for children 6 months through 4 years of age as part or all of the primary three-dose vaccination series, depending on how many prior doses they received, or as single dose for those with a history of completion of a COVID-19 primary vaccination course or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.This press release features multimedia.

""Omicron XBB-related sublineages are antigenically distant from prior Omicron strains and continue to account for the vast majority of COVID-19 cases globally.

Discovery (WBD) has named former BBC and New York Times executive Mark Thompson as its CEO. It comes at a time of great change for the media industry. Traditional media companies like Disney (DIS), Paramount (PARA), and Warner Bros. Discovery are seeing their cable businesses decline while they are investing a lot of money in their streaming businesses. Activate CEO Michael Wolf says all of these companies are trying to position themselves for the ""direct-to-consumer"" future and, as a result, they will increase their spending on content. Several of the big streamers have started raising prices. Wolf says thinks that, in the future, viewers are going to ""churn in and out among these services, price might not be the reason that determines it. It's just more about the availability of programming on those networks and streaming services,"" Wolf tells Yahoo Finance Live. When it comes to the Hollywood strikes, Wolf calls the timing of the strikes ""inopportune,"" saying the ""profit pools for programming production are drying up"" and that the ""revenue streams for these shows aren't necessarily settled.""Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: CNN has a new CEO. Warner Brothers Discovery appointing Mark Thompson as chief executive of the cable news network. He previously served as director general of the BBC as well as CEO of the ""New York Times."" Thompson coming to CNN at a critical time for the media industry as cord cutting accelerates and traditional TV struggles to keep up.Here to discuss this and much more, we want to bring in Michael Wolf, CEO of Activate. Michael, it's great to see you here. So let's start with CNN's new appointment for their CEO Mark Thompson. Is he the best candidate for this job, and why?MICHAEL WOLF: He comes with an incredible pedigree and an incredible track record. So between understanding television from the BBC and managing a massive news organization to what he accomplished as the CEO of the ""New York Times"" company, especially in terms of building a subscription base and continuing to expand their users-- now, here's what's happening.Story continuesIronically, up until recently, CNN was the largest news website, roughly about 400 million unique visitors. And just recently, ""The New York Times"" overtook it just by a couple of million. And so I think we're going to see-- it's going to continue to, of course, be a race between those two as long-- as well as others-- MSNBC and Fox News and even the ""New York Post"" and, of course, Yahoo Finance.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, we appreciate you adding that Yahoo Finance in there, Michael. You know, this, of course, comes at a time-- when you think about, especially in the streaming space, there's this real divide that's happening between linear and digital. You're talking about CNN, which we tend to think more as linear. You know, Bob Iger over at Disney is looking at options for ESPN and what to do there. I mean, what kind of shakedown you think is coming when you think about brands like Warner Brothers Discovery as well as Disney in terms of linear and digital?MICHAEL WOLF: Yeah, so part of what we're seeing and what really is driving this urge to merge among these companies is the need to really position themselves in this world, where increasingly, we have fewer and fewer subscribers. We now have 70 million people in 70 million homes in the US that are subscribing to cable.And we expect it-- at Activate, we expect it to go down into roughly 60 in the next couple of years. And at the same time, these streaming services are their big cash drains. They're very deep expenses for the next couple of years. And it's no different how long it took for each of these companies to make their cable networks profitable.So cable networks have been the golden goose. Suddenly, we have something new coming on in streaming. They're all trying to position themselves for this future, this direct-to-consumer future. And I think that-- by the way, despite the fact that the CEOs of these companies say that they're going to cut back on their spending on programming, we think and we see and we forecast that there are expenses for and then their investments in programming are going to continue to be at these levels and, in fact, continue to increase.SEANA SMITH: Michael, that, of course, then brings up the question of pricing when it comes to the streaming side of the business, right? Because we know Bob Iger time and time again has reiterated the fact that he is focusing on profitability for their streaming division. And Disney recently raising prices following a number of their competitors who have done so very recently. How do these media companies-- how are they thinking about price hikes and balancing that with making sure that they don't see a massive increase in churn?MICHAEL WOLF: Well, I mean, it's-- you really hit the nail on the head, which is they're trying to strike that right balance. And so the fact that we've seen some decline in Netflix in the last quarter, really some of that reflects a couple of things. One is price increase but the also the eliminating password sharing. And so you would have thought that would have increase the number of subscribers.So I think that what's the bigger issue is not whether those price can be sustained. But also, they're having a lot of churn. It's very easy to watch a set of shows on Disney+ and then drop it and go to Max and watch it.So it's-- we as a firm, we forecast that by 2026, the average subscriber will have six streaming services. They're just not going to be the same six. They're going to churn in and out among these services. Price might not be the reason that determines it. It's just more about the availability of programming on those networks and streaming services.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I'm surprised at that number, Michael, at six because it feels like-- you know, I was thinking back to the conversation with streaming first launched. It was about the optionality. And you--MICHAEL WOLF: Yes.AKIKO FUJITA: --don't have to pay for these massive cable bundles. And it feels like cable is cheaper when you consider six different subscriptions you have to pay for. It feels like increasingly sports could be one that could make a lot of these places very sticky because it is one that comes up on a weekly basis, maybe not as much churn. I mean, how do you think these streaming services are positioning themselves on sports with that very idea in mind that there is a limit to how many streaming services viewers want to subscribe to?MICHAEL WOLF: Yeah, I mean, precisely, they're-- the-- what we're going to see is that-- and already seeing is that between Apple and Peacock and Amazon and others, they're already getting streaming rights for sports. They're not getting all of it. So you've got Amazon with ""Thursday Night Football"" as well as they're going to do one preseason game and a special game on Black Friday. And we're going to see that all the way through to Apple really locking up Major League Soccer for the next year.So we're going to see those games go back and forth. And yes, it's going to be another reason for people to watch. But you can't get all of the games in the same place. So you're going to have to subscribe to different services. And you're going to have to keep watching them on television in order-- if you're really an avid super sports fan.SEANA SMITH: Michael, we're talking about the media landscape right now. We also have to talk about the strike that's going on, right? Because when we talk about the pressure that so many of these media Giants are facing, it almost seems like from all angles, obviously, the strike is another pressure point here for these companies, for the studios, for the streamers. How much more challenging is the next several months going to be the longer that this strike goes on for? And I guess who is best positioned given the circumstances we're in today?MICHAEL WOLF: Yeah, I'm hopeful that the strike won't last forever. Part of it is that the time is really an opportune. The profit pools for programming production are drying up there. Even though there's a whole set of new shows, there-- they're really at much lower cost levels. And so I'm not sure there's going to be a lot of profit left to distribute.And this-- the other reason why it's in an opportune time is because the revenue streams for these shows aren't necessarily settled. And so the actors and the writers may find themselves in a position where they put their earnings more at risk than less as they want to have a piece of the profits. And the profits may not be there.Interestingly, the last time that one of these strikes took place a lot, last time was well over 10 years ago. And at that point, they were arguing about who got residuals from DVD rights. So the world has changed. And yes, the relationships with writers and actors and artists are going to change. But this is a tough time to be making those demands.SEANA SMITH: And it is a tough time, certainly a tough time for both sides right now. All right, Michael, always great to have you. Thanks so much for joining me.MICHAEL WOLF: Great to be here.]"

The Rhode Island license, while essential for permitting payments, is also a requirement for offering crypto services.""I think a new social media company is needed that is based on a blockchain and includes payments,"" Musk said in a text message just days before the bombshell offer to buy Twitter for $43 billion back in April 2022.In an FAQ answering common queries Rhode Island's Department of Business Regulation (DBR) specifies that firms requiring the approval ""include those transmitting money for its customers, including traditional wire transfers (like Western Union) and electronic transfers (like PayPal).""The state's currency transmission license is also required for conducting crypto exchange and custody business, with an exception for fintechs in ""very rare cases"" where the firm ""is registered as a true 'agent' of the Rhode Island licensed currency transmitter ... and money transmission is not the core profit-making business of the fintech.""Story continuesThough they certainly open the way for offering crypto payments, the state licenses are not limited or unique to that service. In New Hampshire, ""'money transmission' means engaging in the business of selling or issuing payment instruments or stored value, or receiving currency or monetary value for transmission to another location."" The state also says ""an administrator or exchanger that accepts and transmits a convertible virtual currency or buys or sells convertible virtual currency for any reason is a money transmitter under federal regulations ...""Western Union and PayPal have the same state licenses as X, and additional ones in line with the services they offer and the states they serve.Read more: Elon Musk’s X Seeks Data Partner to Build Trading Service on App: Semafor]"

(Lisa Baertlein/REUTERS) (Lisa Baertlein / reuters)The VinFast story began when entrepreneur Pham Nhat Vuong founded Vingroup in 1993, a conglomerate that eventually operated in the food, entertainment, and healthcare spaces in its home country of Vietnam. Soon after, Vingroup entered the auto business, a first for a Vietnamese company.“Vuong decided to enter the automotive industry through a VinFast subsidiary,” Sam Fiorani, VP at manufacturing data provider AutoForecast Solutions, told Yahoo Finance. “The new venture purchased an old General Motors plant and worked with BMW to introduce its first [internal combustion] vehicles.”Vinfast’s GM-based Fadil sub-compact quickly topped the Vietnamese sales charts in 2021, but the company shifted its focus to electric vehicles soon after. Next the company did something extraordinary, launching its EVs in the highly competitive US market soon after launch, beginning sales in Q1 this year.“Vietnam and VinFast has accomplished in the space of a few years what its neighbors in SE Asia like Thailand and Indonesia could not achieve over decades of trying: Manufacturing a car to call their own,” let alone one that’s on sale in the US, Asian autos and supply chain expert Michael Dunne said to Yahoo Finance.Concurrent with the sale of its cars in the US was the SPAC merger of VinFast with Black Spade Acquisition. To say trading in the stock has been volatile over the past two weeks would be an understatement.Story continuesDuring this period, the market cap for VinFast swelled to nearly $200 billion at one point, more than the valuations of GM, Ford, and even Volkswagen. But there is more than meets the eye here when talking about that valuation. Less than 1% of VinFast’s shares are available for trading, with the balance owned by Pham Nhat Vuong and his family and not available for trade. The small “float” of VinFast shares means relatively small stock trades can amplify into big swings in price for VinFast, meaning it has become a favorite of small retail traders, and now a “meme” stock, as noted short seller Jim Chanos dubbed it this week.Can VinFast succeed — and justify its valuation?Buyers Andrew and Nikki Le take delivery of their VinFast electric car in Los Angeles, Calif., March 1, 2023. (Lisa Baertlein/REUTERS) (Lisa Baertlein / reuters)VinFast’s valuation, now around $100 billion, is frothy compared to the big automakers listed above, and of course Japanese behemoths like Toyota, Nissan, and Honda.VinFast sold only 24,000 cars globally in 2022, a fraction of the deliveries made by major global automakers, and VinFast’s net loss swelled to nearly $600 million in the first quarter, and is expected to widen according to Bloomberg.“Valuing the company above established automakers, however temporarily, is not a sign of confidence in VinFast, but rather short-term investors taking advantage of a high-profile stock in a market,” AutoForecast Solutions’ Fiorani says. “In the long term, VinFast will need to showcase a competitive product and a unique market position, which has not been displayed.”Auto purchasing expert Tom McParland of AutomatchConsulting.com added that VinFast EVs suffer from numerous quality issues and that VinFast doesn’t have the brand prestige or recognition of more well-known automakers. McParland also said he has come across many customers who distrust auto products not made in Japan, Europe, or the US.This is potentially where VinFast’s manufacturing strategy could come into play. The company announced last year it planned to build a $4 billion plant in North Carolina, with a capacity of 150,000 vehicles annually, and employ 7,500 local workers.Electric carmaker VinFast breaks ground in its $4B NC manufacturing plant located within the Triangle Innovation Point on July 28, 2023 in Chatham County, N.C. The Vietnamese carmaker is set to bring 7,500 jobs to the area. (Nick Ut/Getty Images) (Nick Ut via Getty Images)Geopolitics might also favor VinFast here. “Like with Japan and Korea before it, US government officials might like to see Vietnam, a strategic partner country in Asia, succeed in America,” Dunne said. “VinFast is also the first Asian country after Japan and Korea to start building a factory (North Carolina) in the United States.”Regardless, the company still has to persuade Americans to buy a new brand, with vehicles costing in the $40,000-$80,000 range to boot. If the company can build on sales and get some momentum going, the inclusion of the federal EV tax credits for North American-made cars could help VinFast tremendously.Those are some big “ifs,” however, and though VinFast says it is working on fixing earlier car issues with software updates and other fixes, it has a long way to go to profitability.“With the emergence of the tax incentives for electric vehicle sales, the North Carolina plant becomes a necessity, [but] it will take years for the volume to grow enough to make the local plant profitable,” Fiorani said. “While the jury’s out on the company’s potential success, VinFast’s chances, under current market and economic conditions, are less than 50/50.”Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

232,e6c50205-ad5b-33a9-a2a5-d3857586de35,GM,2023-08-31,Bloomberg Predicts Peak Oil Demand In 2027,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bloomberg-predicts-peak-oil-demand-140000759.html,1693404000,STORY,"['F', 'TSLA', 'GM']","[A couple of weeks ago, the International Energy Agency reported that global oil demand reached an all-time high of 103mn barrels a day in June. According to the global energy watchdog, robust demand was driven by better than expected economic growth in OECD countries, surging oil consumption in China, particularly for petrochemical production and strong summer air travel. The IEA has predicted that demand could hit another peak in August and remains on track to average 102.2mn b/d for the whole year, the highest ever annual level.Well, it appears the oil bonanza’s days are numbered. Bloomberg has predicted that global demand for road fuel will continue to grow for only four more years, with demand peaking in 2027 at 49 million barrels per day before entering terminal decline. According to Bloomberg, electric vehicles, ever-improving fuel efficiency and shared mobility are the oil sector’s biggest nemesis, with EVs expected to displace a staggering 20 million barrels per day in oil demand by 2040, up from 2 million barrels per day currently.Bloomberg reckons that demand for gasoline and diesel for road transport has already peaked in the U.S. and Europe, while demand in China is set to peak in 2024. Demand in other major consuming countries like India will go into a tailspin in the 2030s.Implications For The Oil &amp; Gas IndustryLast year, the electric vehicle sector crossed a global milestone, with one out of ten vehicles sold being electric for the first time ever. While that slice of the market might not seem like much in the grand scheme of things, another alarming trend for legacy ICE vehicle makers like Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F), Mercedes-Benz Group AG and BMW is that their total vehicle sales declined despite EV sales more than doubling.Obviously, oil and gas investors are receiving these developments with a bit of trepidation. And, this is no longer all about Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) alone, with pundits saying stiff competition from the likes of General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford is coming its way.Story continuesGM is one of the legacy automakers with the biggest clean energy investments, particularly  in the EV sector. GM Ceo Mary Barra has revealed that the company plans to produce ~400,000 electric vehicles from 2022 through the first half of 2024, and that the company will  be capable of annual EV production of more than one million in North America in 2025. Indeed, GM could overtake Tesla in just two to three years: a ""Car Wars"" report has forecasts that GM and Ford Motors (NYSE:F) each will have roughly 15% EV market share in 2025 while Tesla’s will plummet from 70% to 11% with new products like the F-150 Lightning and Silverado EV electric pickups driving the robust growth. Tesla appears set to lose its dominant EV market share because both legacy automakers are expanding their portfolios and lineups at a much faster clip.“GM has found a new life as an ESG play. We do have a sustainability fund that owns it in part because of their commitment to electrification. Mary Barra has been pretty vocal about that obviously, and it looks like it’s for real,” Christopher Marangi, Gamco’s value co-chief investment officer, told Bloomberg TV’s Surveillance.Implications On Oil DemandOver the years, there’s been no shortage of blue-sky forecasts from EV enthusiasts who have predicted an apocalypse for the oil industry that will be dished out by the EV revolution.That includes Stanford University economist Tony Seba who has declared that EVs will obliterate the global oil industry by 2030 while Bloomberg News’ Akshat Rathi is on record claiming that ‘every F-150 Lightning destroys 50+ barrels of oil demand forever.’ The F-150 Lightning is Ford’s electric equivalent of the marquee Ford-150 truck. Meanwhile, back in 2016, Bloomberg itself predicted EVs will trigger a global oil crisis.It’s not hard to see why these EV punters have been going ballistic with their predictions. The transportation sector is responsible for nearly 60% of global oil demand, with passenger vehicles and trucks guzzling the lion’s share. EV sales are surging thanks to a combination of new compelling models from automakers, improvements in battery technology, policy support and more charging infrastructure. Electrification is also beginning to spread to new segments of road transport.While there’s no denying that rapid adoption of EVs is bad news for global oil demand, the reality is probably nowhere near as dire as analysts like Seba have claimed. BNEF estimates EVs are currently displacing 1.5 million barrels of oil demand per day, good for 3% of total road fuel demand. But projections of the EV growth trajectory are all over the place, making it difficult to estimate how much impact the sector will have on future oil demand.According to BNEF, just over half of passenger cars sold in the U.S. will be electric vehicles by 2030. Forecasts for the penetration of EV to total passenger car sales by 2030 range from 11% at the low end to 63% at the high end while projections for 2050 range from 31% to nearly 100%. The lower end of these forecasts suggests minimal to gradual displacement of oil demand while the higher end suggests quite severe oil demand destruction.In carbon constrained forecasts, passenger vehicle oil demand is expected to fall from about 25 million barrels per day today to 3–6 million barrels per day by 2050. However, most other forecasts see passenger vehicle oil demand ranging from 10 million to 20 million barrels per day by 2050.By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Soaring Oil &amp; Gas Prices Made Renewables Cheaper Than Fossil Fuels In 2022Woodside Sees 100,000 Bpd Peak Production At Mexico's Giant Trion FieldOil Prices Climb As Hurricane Idalia Hurtles Towards The Gulf CoastRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

Boyd Group International President Mike Boyd joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the safeguards in place to monitor pilots, including their own labor unions.""Now, we have systems if a pilot is fired at one airline, there's basically a database that will tell another airline what happened there, supposedly,"" Boyd says. ""It's getting better, but we're dealing with humans.""Boyd details the pressure working pilots may be feeling under labor shortages and the counseling services that airlines and unions offer.Video Transcript- When you think about the idea that perhaps some pilots don't feel comfortable coming forward because it means they'll be barred from the cockpit, talk about some of the what goes into some of the decision-making behind this and perhaps some of the support that you think would benefit some of these pilots.MIKE BOYD: Well, yes, some of them really don't have a lot of faith or trust in the FAA, and that's understandable. But keep in mind too the majority of US airline pilots have labor unions, ALPA, APA, SWAPA, and these are more safety organizations every bit as much as they are labor organizations. So that's probably the refuge they should take because they have professionals who can work with that. Let's keep in mind, this is a very, very small percentage of people in that pilot population.- How does this change, if at all, the existing, the training, the work through that for a lot of commercial airlines, and you were mentioning kind of that part of this larger figure, how they evaluate and make sure that pilots are fit for even going through training in order to get onto some of the flight schedules?MIKE BOYD: Well now, we have systems. If a pilot is fired at one airline, there's basically a database that will tell another airline what happened there supposedly. So we have that safeguard in place, and that was from some accident that happened back in the '90s. So it's getting better.Story continuesBut we're dealing with humans, and humans do crazy things. The Chinese captain that-- actually co-pilot at that point who flew an airplane straight into the ground in China, there were no indications he had any problems other than being demoted. We don't know, we're all human, and these things can happen but it's not something the consumer should be really worried about.- And Mike, obviously this is something that people would have to self-report. But as you mentioned there, if you're saying that this isn't perhaps a broader problem. But in terms of the checks and balances that are out there for pilots, especially since there was a pilot shortage, you had COVID a lot of times when you weren't seeing a lot of pilots getting trained, how much pressure are pilots under on a day to day basis?MIKE BOYD: Well, they're under probably as much pressure as before, the problem is they may be doing some more flying. But keep in mind, there are limits to what they can fly. Now, there's always been arguments between airline crews schedulers and pilots that goes back to ancient times, I think. But the reality of this is that there are limits to what they can fly, and airlines and particularly pilots unions are working very hard to make sure pilots aren't flying out there tired and hungry, if you will.- How can airline operators do better at even baking in counseling services, baking in things that pilots are afraid to self-report in order to make sure that everyone's in the right headspace as they're going about the operation?MIKE BOYD: I think airlines have that. But again, they don't get credit for it, but airline pilots unions have systems like this also for their members because like I say, airline pilots unions are as much safety organizations as they are labor organizations. So pilots do have options there. And you're going to find some people who will lie in every population, every type of category of work. There will be a few pilots that will be lying to get around the system, no question about it. But it's no different than bankers or people who work out in the field.]"

In fact, her vision and model for luxury streetwear brand HBCU Famous clinched a $5,000 prize in a pitch competition during Howard University and PNC National Center for Entrepreneurship launch events in the spring of 2023.""I started my business the semester before I came to Howard, and I had no idea that I had no idea,"" says Powell. ""The resources I have access to here have given me a huge boost - I've participated in pop-ups, I've been on panels, and I won $5,000 that I put directly back into my business. Now I have the capital to scale up as I've been longing to do, increase production and put money into social media and marketing resources. The message is clear that I need to move forward with this.""Equipping Black entrepreneurs with the tools they need to move forward and succeed is the fundamental idea behind the Howard University and PNC National Center for Entrepreneurship, which recently marked its official launch with four regional events.The four pop-up events - featuring booths across campuses at Howard, Clark Atlanta, Texas Southern, and Morgan State universities - gave young entrepreneurs an opportunity to share information and sell products and services ranging from skin care to food, clothing, health care and publications.Helping Black Entrepreneurs Level UpThe four campus events represented a milestone for the center, a vision that began between Howard University and PNC in August 2021, when the PNC Foundation committed to a $16.8 million, five-year grant to create the center.With Howard serving as the umbrella, the regional centers will pilot best practices to support entrepreneurs with education and resources, then share them across their network of strategic partners throughout the country. The goal is to take what historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) already do so well to the next level - engage students, business owners and communities of color to help entrepreneurs grow their enterprises.""When we thought about making an investment like this, it was a pretty simple matter to think about Howard as the hub,"" says Richard Bynum, chief corporate responsibility officer for PNC. ""HBCUs are the absolute preeminent network to make sure that our vision of creating a real impact for Black entrepreneurs comes to life.""This grant is part of PNC's $88 billion Community Benefits Plan focused on bolstering economic opportunity for low- and moderate-income (LMI) individuals, along with communities and people of color.The U.S. Census Bureau's 2021 Annual Business Survey shows there are approximately 3.12 million Black-owned businesses, generating $206 billion in annual revenues and employing 3.56 million workers.1But a 2023 Intuit QuickBooks survey showed that these businesses are battling persisting economic and social inequities.2""There are huge obstacles to entrepreneurs in the Black community,"" says Erin Horne McKinney, executive director, Howard University and PNC National Center for Entrepreneurship. ""Whether you're talking about financial capital, access to resources, or the ability for businesses to grow and scale from their initial launch. That's what we're trying to do - to provide those frameworks to help them get to that next level and create generational wealth.""Backing Ideas with Business SavvyIn addition to the vibrant entrepreneur pop-ups, the launch events featured some star power with notable Black entrepreneur speakers such as John Hope Bryant of Operation HOPE and T.D. Jakes of T.D. Jakes Enterprises.Another notable HBCU graduate who shared her story was Askale Davis, an entertainment mogul and entrepreneur who appeared on Real Housewives of Potomac. She's not only a proud Howard alumna who studied biology and chemistry, but now serves as community engagement manager for K-12 advocacy at the United Negro College Fund - where she helps guide students on a path to college primarily through HBCUs.As Davis provides an example of what success looks like for today's young entrepreneurs via her visible social media and TV presence, she's conscious of what something like the center could have meant for business owners like her parents - Ethiopian refugees, who started the first Ethiopian restaurant in Seattle.""Their business was successful at the start, but by the time I graduated high school, they'd lost everything,"" Davis recalls. ""I attribute that to not being business savvy. That's why it's so important to have these centers to teach and guide our communities, providing resources, even teaching things like branding and marketing. We have the ideas and the skill sets to get these businesses off the ground, but the goal is to grow and to scale, and to leave something for the next generation.""Marcus Davis, a Houston-based restaurateur, has tourists lining up for signature Southern dishes outside The Breakfast Klub. His own HBCU education at Texas Southern University helped him become established in a corporate job before he found the confidence to follow his entrepreneurship vision.""It helped me with being able to figure out life, being able to set a goal,"" says Davis, who spoke on a panel at the TSU launch event. ""It's about more than just curriculum and classes. It's learning how to set a long-term goal, how to maneuver through the system, the importance of being able to persevere.""The Intuit QuickBooks survey shows 95% of Black business owners view their business' success as important to the success of future generations of Black entrepreneurs, so having successful speakers who model success for launch event attendees was important.""It's one thing for me to look at a Bill Gates or Elon Musk, but when Black Enterprise magazine put out a top 100 list of Black businessmen every year, that was inspiring to me,"" Davis says. ""It gives you a sense of your peers.""That's why it's extremely important for me to go back and talk to students and show them that I went to the same school, have a similar background, and they, too, can do spectacularly well in business.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from The PNC Financial Services Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: The PNC Financial Services GroupWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/pnc-financial-services-groupEmail: info@3blmedia.com SOURCE: The PNC Financial Services GroupStory continuesThe PNC Financial Services Group, Wednesday, August 30, 2023, Press release picturehttps://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022/annual-business-survey-characteristics.htmlhttps://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/small-business-data/black-history-month-survey-2023/View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/778789/entrepreneurs-talk-obstacles-what-black-businesses-need-to-level-up]"

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points: The overall earnings picture remains stable and resilient, with the outlook beginning to improve in recent months. The revisions trend has notably stabilized lately, with estimates for several key sectors increasing. This evolving earnings outlook remains inconsistent with the long-feared ‘earnings cliff’ narrative. Q2 was the 3rd consecutive quarter of earnings declines. The expectation is for 2023 Q3 earnings to be the last period of decline, with growth resuming from Q4 onwards. For 2023 Q3, S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to be down -1.5% on +0.7% higher revenues. Excluding the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +3.4% on +3.2% higher revenues.The somewhat mixed showing from the traditional retailers in their Q2 earnings reports was primarily due to management execution and less a function of any significant moderation in consumer spending.We discussed Target TGT in recent days, which missed top-line and comp estimates but did better on margins and inventories. We noted that while management appeared satisfied with current inventory levels, investors will be justified in wondering whether Target has really addressed the issue if Q2’s weak sales and traffic trends will result in unsold inventory in the coming periods.Unlike Walmart, whose quarterly report showed all-around strength, Target has struggled in the post-Covid period, failing to foresee shifts in consumer spending away from discretionary categories like apparel, home furnishings, and electronics, resulting in unsold inventory that then needed to be cleared through markdowns.Walmart stumbled last year following its Q1 report, as did Target, but it recovered quickly. In its Q2 report, Walmart benefited from broad market share gains and momentum in key growth initiatives.Story continuesWhile Walmart has a much bigger grocery business, Target has all along been seen as more of a play on discretionary merchandise, demand for which has moderated in the post-Covid period. That said, Target appears to have lost out more than other retailers that sell comparable merchandise, with TJX Companies TJX as a good example of one such retailer.The challenge for retailers like Target, Walmart, TJX, and others is not only to have the correct merchandise but also to deal with higher expenses related to freight, payroll, and other items.We have provided the updated Q2 earnings season scorecard for the Zacks Retail sector in the detailed report.Beyond the Retail sector, the 2023 Q2 reporting cycle has come to an end for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with results from 98.4% of the S&amp;P 500 index companies already out.2023 Q2 is on track to be the third consecutive quarter of declining S&amp;P 500 earnings. The expectation currently is for another earnings decline in Q3 of -1.5%, after which growth turns positive in Q4 and continues in 2024. In fact, Q3 earnings would be positive had it not been for the Energy sector drag.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see from these quarterly earnings-growth expectations, the long-feared recession doesn’t show up in this near-term earnings outlook. A big-picture view of corporate profitability on a long-term basis doesn’t leave much room for a recession either, as you can see in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThese growth expectations reflect current bottom-up consensus earnings estimates for the individual S&amp;P 500 companies that, in turn, are based on the estimates from individual sell-side analysts that cover those companies.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have flagged a notable stabilization in the estimate revisions trend since the start of 2023 Q2, reversing the persistently negative trend that had been in place for almost a year prior.Earnings estimates in the aggregate for the S&amp;P 500 index have come down only a touch since the start of April, with a number of key sectors starting to see modest positive estimate revisions. These sectors include Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Tech, Medical, and Retail. These trends have been confirmed and strengthened by the Q2 earnings results and management’s guidance and commentary for the current and coming quarters.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

241,d2d338ea-608c-3f5e-8864-fe25defe295e,ISRG,2023-08-31,3 Millionaire-Maker Robotics Stocks to Hold Through Thick and Thin,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-millionaire-maker-robotics-stocks-015425073.html,1692928465.0,STORY,"['ISRG', 'TMO', 'EMR']","[The world is becoming increasingly automated paving the way for robotics stocks moving forward. Sector growth is expected to reach double digits on an annualized basis and ranges from the low to mid-teens depending on the sourceIn either case, capital invested in the sector has a reasonable chance of increasing in value. The firms highlighted here are well-established companies with long track records. Thus, investors sacrifice some level of sheer return potential for stability. Investing through thick and thin – aka the long term – requires such a sacrifice. With enough time and sufficient capital, it’s entirely reasonable to assume that an investment in the companies below could grow to exceed $1 million in value.  So here are the best robotics stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) robotic arms over medical bed symbolizing medical roboticsSource: shutterstock.com/MAD.vertiseInvesting in Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is a very good example of what it means to stay with something through thick and thin. The company has seen dramatic shifts in demand for its devices and services over the past few years. The company is famous for its Da Vinci Surgical device but also for Ion Endoluminal systems. The emergence of the pandemic dealt a serious blow to the company. Suddenly, everyone was afraid to go to the hospital and that sent elective surgery demand plummeting. ISRG stock has gone up and down since. Here’s a simple argument in favor of investing for the long term. On Jan. 1, 2020, ISRG shares traded at $197.78. They now trade at $290 following several ups and downs. 2020 revenues declined at Intuitive Surgical. They’ve increased by double digits in almost every measurable period since. Da Vinci is the most prominent robot in the healthcare space. Its place is stable as is its underlying sector. That makes ISRG one of those strong robotics stocks.Emerson Electric (EMR) a computer rendering of Miso Robotics's ""Flippy"" robotSource: Miso RoboticsEmerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) is another well-known robotics firm. The stock derives some of its potential upside due to the emergence of automation and the economic promise therein. Automation promises to increase business efficiency in ways we can’t yet fully understand. The notion is simple, though: machines are faster than humans when programmed for a given task. Story continuesEmerson has an entire business dedicated to factory automation. It focuses not only on disruptive technologies in the space but also on established automation technology. As with anything, automation won’t go from 0-60 without passing through multiple speeds. Emerson is working on those intermediate levels as we speak. Thus, it’s likely to iterate toward new paradigms and create breakthrough automation tech. That’s the general bullish outlook on Emerson for the long term as it relates to robotics. EMR shares are highly undervalued at present compared to their levels over the past decade based on the price-to-earnings ratio. That truth provides a reasonable argument in favor of investing now. Doing so includes a bit of dividend income to boot. Thermo Fisher (TMO)a robotic hand reaching out to a human hand against a black background, with the pointer fingers touching. robotics stocksSource: shutterstock.com/sdecoretThermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) stock is closely associated with lab sciences. Most people recognize the firm for lab equipment, research, diagnostics, and the like. That said, Thermo Fisher also includes robotics research. The firm has all kinds of lab robotics solutions which can be viewed here. The portfolio spans a lot of various end applications as well as software. It’s a safe firm to invest in for generalized exposure to robotics growth. It’s also difficult to bet against Thermo Fisher as an investment given how well the stock has done over the past decade. It has returned nearly 20% on an annualized basis during that period. That’s roughly double the return an investor could expect over a similar timeframe through indexed ETFs. Of course, it’s not smart to invest in a single stock so the comparison isn’t perfectly apt. However, the returns speak for themselves. Thermo Fisher is cooling some as its pandemic revenues wane but remains a strong investment nonetheless with revenues that are expected to continue growing overall. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Depressed valuations have been driven by tech sell-offs due to rising rates and macro uncertainties. This presents a chance to invest in innovative robotics companies at appealing prices.In the vast tech sector, robotics firms play a pivotal role as automation grows. AI’s progress highlights our evolving tasks. Humans and robots work in symbiosis, making certain duties indispensable. For future-oriented investors, now may be a good time to consider these three robotics stocks.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) leads the robotics-assisted surgery market with its Da Vinci system in 8,000+ global hospitals. The company has conducted 13 million surgeries using Da Vinci by June 2023. Q2 2023 showed a 15% revenue rise year over year (YoY) and a 38% EPS increase. Growing demand for robotics-assisted surgery drives core segment growth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsISRG exceeded Q2 2023 earnings estimates, but concerns about weight loss drugs impacting bariatric procedures caused a stock drop. Despite this, strong core product growth makes it a potential buying opportunity before a likely rebound.Analysts widely consider ISRG a strong buy, with only 2 out of 14 choosing hold. The target price averages $377.14, suggesting 16% upside, while high-side sees 23% growth. ISRG trades at 59-times forward earnings and 17.4-times trailing revenue. That’s certainly not cheap, but I think it’s offset by a rather attractive debt-free balance sheet.iRobot (IRBT)In this photo illustration the iRobot Corporation (IRBT) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screenSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comiRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT), a pioneer in consumer robotics with Roomba vacuums, saw shares drop 37% due to growth concerns and competition. However, now trading at 1-times sales (compared to 4-times), negativity around this name seems excessive. Notably, iRobot continues to expand into other growth areas, such as lawn care, and invests in its AI capabilities to drive further autonomy in its product lines. The company’s IP portfolio is strong, and iRobot remains a leader in this regard. Story continuesWall Street predicts a 19.7% revenue decline this year but a return to strong growth afterwards. This seems factored in, and I anticipate sales to bounce back with new products. With its current low multiples, iRobot offers an appealing opportunity. The stock could potentially double, providing significant returns for long-term investors.IRBT stock surged despite earlier hurdles, indicating renewed prospects for the company. The deal premium had been lost due to regulatory scrutiny, but with the U.K.’s approval, broader acceptance is more likely. However, FTC concerns persist as Chair Lina Khan aims to regulate Amazon, and past reports hinted at FTC opposition to the iRobot deal.Regardless of the events that transpire, I think IRBT stock has one of the most favorable valuations in this space right now. For those looking to play robotics, this is perhaps the simplest way to do so.Nvidia (NVDA)The Nvidia (NVDA Stock) logo on a graphics card.Source: Konstantin Savusia / Shutterstock.comInvestors are flocking to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock during the ongoing AI boom in 2023. The chipmaker’s remarkable performance, with over 93% gains in six months, highlights its potential among top tech stocks.NVIDIA holds an 83.7% market share and has growth drivers, including the GH200 AI chip for large models like ChatGPT. This positions NVDA for profit as the AI market is projected to grow from $454.12B in 2022 to $2,575.6B in 2032 at a 19% CAGR.Of course, robotics and other high-growth areas of the market that rely on these top-performance chips will only accelerate Nvidia’s growth. While most in the market are focused on AI-related demand drivers, I think robotics is one area that’s often overlooked.Thus, for those looking for another reason to get bulled up on Nvidia, here it is.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

(Photo: NTSB/CSX)The National Transportation Safety Board will be focusing its investigation of an Aug. 6 fatality at a CSX rail yard in Cumberland, Maryland, on the railroad’s employee training regime, as well as the industry’s procedures for identifying areas where the clearance between rail equipment might be limited.In a NTSB report issued Tuesday, it confirmed initial reported details about the incident, including that the conductor trainee, identified by CSX as Travis Bradley, sustained injuries while performing a shoving movement. At about 11:42 p.m. Aug. 6, Bradley was riding the side of an intermodal rail car as the train was moving at approximately 9 miles per hour when he was struck by the handrail of a standing locomotive on an adjacent track. Bradley was taken to a nearby hospital, where he later died.Other crew members besides the conductor trainee were an engineer, who was in the locomotive cab when the incident occurred, and a conductor, while the train was composed of two locomotives and three loaded intermodal rail cars.NTSB noted that following the incident, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) issued a safety bulletin on Aug. 16 urging railroads to review employee training programs that address riding equipment in close-clearance situations and to consider marking close or no clearance areas with highly visible signs. An industry working group affiliated with FRA that’s responsible for switching operations fatalities analyses also issued an alert on Aug. 11 advising railroad employees to remain vigilant when mentoring inexperienced employees and to conduct job briefings whenever a job changes.Separately, the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers – Transportation Division (SMART-TD) put out its own advisory to its members, urging them to put their safety first and ensure that their co-workers are out of harm’s way.As NTSB continues its investigation, other parties involved include FRA, the Maryland Department of Labor, CSX (NASDAQ: CSX), SMART-TD and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen.Story continuesSubscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:Rail union calls for more extensive conductor training following 2 deathsCSX plans extra training after deaths of 2 conductor traineesCSX and SMART-TD work on conductor trainee programThe post NTSB probe of CSX fatality to focus on employee training, close clearances appeared first on FreightWaves.]"
245,b468485b-6807-3e45-ab06-88cbb20cb8d9,CSX,2023-08-31,The 3 Most Undervalued Transportation Stocks to Buy Now: August 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-most-undervalued-transportation-stocks-135447226.html,1692885287,STORY,"['DAL', 'CSX', 'STNG']","[If manufacturing is the backbone of the economy, then transportation companies are the arteries and veins that allow goods services, and people to flow through the economy. Concerns about rising oil prices and lower consumer demand are casting a pall on this sector. But knowing the market is forward-looking, now is a good time to look for undervalued transportation stocks. Rising oil demand, infrastructure spending, and continued strength in the travel industry are three themes that are likely to drive growth in this sector. Investors have several options that allow them to find companies that are well-positioned to profit from these themes.  Using a simple stock screener, I looked for transportation stocks with a forward P/E ratio of 18x or less. I used 18x because that’s where the S&amp;P 500 is currently priced. But that’s likely to go down as the 10-year U.S. treasury yield continues to rise. To add some variety, you get one stock by land, sea, and air.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDelta Air Lines (DAL) Inside the airplane cabin of a Delta flight.Source: EQRoy / Shutterstock.comDelta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) is one of several undervalued transportation stocks in the airline industry. Many investors were expecting a pullback in airline stocks in 2023 as the industry faced tough comparisons from a blowout in 2022.  That hasn’t been the case. One of the ongoing mysteries in the economy is the stickiness of revenge travel. Every quarter, investors expect to see weaker demand. But as of the second quarter earnings season, there’s no big slowdown in sight. That fact was reflected in Delta’s earnings report.  The company just posted $2.68 earnings per share on revenue of $15.58 billion. Not only did both numbers beat expectations, but they were also higher on a year-over-year (YOY) basis. Plus, the company is guiding for higher revenue and earnings in the second half, backed by its decision to reinstate its dividend. The continuation of remote and hybrid work arrangements will continue to be bullish for Delta. But it’s also likely that with many homeowners locked into a low-interest rate mortgage, and with home improvement projects having been done in 2020 and 2021, they’ll continue to put that discretionary income into travel.  Story continuesCSX Corporation (CSX) Railroad tracks with a junctionSource: ShutterstockInfrastructure spending continues to flow into the economy as many manufacturers race to get factories built to take advantage of onshoring incentives. One way for investors to take advantage of this trend is with railroad stocks, and CSX Corporation (NYSE:CSX) is one of the best names in the sector. If you’re looking for eye-popping growth, CSX stock isn’t for you. If, however, you’re looking for stable revenue and earnings in addition to a stable dividend, then this railroad stock is worth a closer look.  For example, in its second-quarter earnings report in July, the company’s top-line and bottom-line results were basically flat based on analysts’ expectations. They were also essentially flat on a YOY basis. That’s not exciting for growth investors, but at a time when home runs are hard to come by, CSX offers investors a solid single with a reliable dividend that has a 1.44% yield.  Analysts are generally bullish on CSX. The stock is covered by 29 analysts and 18 of them have a strong buy or buy rating on the stock. Plus, the average price target of $36.27 is 18% higher than the current price.  Scorpio Tankers (STNG) Aerial front side view of oil tanker ship sailing on open sea, Imperial Petroleum (IMPP) operates oil tankersSource: Igor Karasi / Shutterstock.comScorpio Tankers (NASDAQ:STNG) is one of the leading global shipping companies engaged in the seaborne transportation of refined petroleum products. Its modern fleet makes it one of the most environmentally friendly carriers. It’s also one of the more undervalued transportation stocks to consider. STNG stock is flat for the year, down over 10% since April, and up 28% in the last 12 months. That’s the kind of volatility investors expect in the global oil shipping industry. And much of the stock’s recent performance is due to the company’s recent earnings report.  The company’s revenue came in at $329 million. This not only missed the consensus estimate by $!4.8 million, but it also came in 187% lower year-over-year. The bottom line also came in eight cents lighter than expected at $2.41.  One risk to owning STNG stock may come from China. The country’s reopening was one reason the International Energy Administration forecasted that global oil demand would reach a record 102 million barrels per day this year. However, recent economic news from China shows an economy that remains under pressure even with pandemic restrictions being lifted. That said, Scorpio has a solid balance sheet that includes no new builds on order and $1.2 billion of debt reduced in 2022. Plus, investors get a dividend that currently yields 1.92% and has an annual payout of $1 per share.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

LOPE or GCU has been experiencing enrollment growth, backed by the rise in new starts and an increase in retention numbers. These factors are driven by the company’s labor retention strategies, as well as the availability of ground and online campus services. Recently, the company unveiled that it expected more than 14% year-over-year increase in student enrollment for the 2023-24 session.GCU anticipates a class of more than 11,000 incoming traditional-age (21 and under) students attending both the Phoenix ground campus and online. This will increase the total estimated enrollment to more than 118,000 comprising approximately 25,800 enrollments in the ground campus and more than 92,000 enrolling for the online campus.Along with traditional ground and online campus learning environments, GCU also provides hybrid learning methods. The company has worked with industry partners to introduce its Center for Workforce Development to deliver skilled trades training services for careers which involve labor shortages.The company is optimistic about the anticipated milestone for the 2023-24 session on the back of encouraging additional hiring of faculty and staff during the pandemic rather than the idea of workforce layoff. Also, providing hybrid as well as sole online campus platforms to students for completing an entire program, given the high inflationary environment, is added positive. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Shares of LOPE have gained 40.8% in the past year, outperforming the Zacks Schools industry’s 25.9% growth.Grand Canyon’s Growth InitiativesGrand Canyon have been focusing on accretive initiatives to provide services to the students, which align with the current labor-market opportunities. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the company has introduced 66 new programs across nine colleges at GCU, which focuses directly on the labor market opportunities for students. The enrollment in these programs accounted for 10.8% of the new students enrolled in the second quarter of 2023.Grand Canyon tends to address workforce shortage issues and focuses on the education, health care, technology, public safety and the military industries, primarily by working with and understanding the employers directly. Also, the company’s approach of moderate raise of the tuition fee, especially during the pandemic, bodes well. Since 2018, online net tuition has increased by merely 1% annually.Furthermore, in August 2023, GCU opened two new residence halls, Santa Cruz and Copper, for the 2023-24 school session. This brought the total number of multi-stories on-campus residence halls to 32 as of August 2023.Story continuesZacks RankGrand Canyon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the Consumer Discretionary sector are Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

252,d65e43da-7ece-30ff-ab5e-82e83eaf6615,ADI,2023-08-31,Don’t Sleep on These 3 Quantum Computing Stocks That Will Mint Millionaires,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/don-t-sleep-3-quantum-131445933.html,1692882885,STORY,"['ADI', 'RGTI', 'FORM', 'AMD', 'NVDA']","[Market volatility has struck again. Last week, U.S. equities continued their slide in August, leaving many market-watchers wondering whether or not equities in general had reached their peak. The attributed to this precipitous decline in share prices is most likely multi-faceted. There is the Federal Reserve, which still is not sure it will pause on interest rates – more hikes could push the U.S. economy into recession territory, and investors, for good reason, become skittish when the possibility of a recession becomes greater.Then, there are also the astronomic valuations public equities have already reached this year, and no, it is not just Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Equity valuations have largely risen in a year where revenue growth and gross margins have contracted, resulting in some inflated multiples, especially amongst technology stocks.The slide in valuations last week presents an opportunity for investors to buy into new and exciting sectors. I have written about quantum computing before, and several pure-play quantum computing stocks have returned hefty sums to their investors this year. The novel technology, though still very much in its infancy, has the potential to solve complex problems that normally slow down classical computers, such as optimization, cryptography, machine learning, and simulation. Below is a list of quantum computing investors should not sleep on, especially as volatility makes certain valuations cheaper.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAnalog Devices (ADI)a close up image of a semiconductorSource: ShutterstockSimilar to the field of artificial intelligence, it is hard to discuss quantum computing stocks without mentioning the semiconductor companies that create some of the small devices powering quantum computers. Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) is a leading semiconductor company that simply designs and provides integrated chips and data converter products to a variety of industries, including communications, industrial, and automotive. Analog Devices happens to also be a key player in quantum computing, as it supplies high-performance analog and mixed-signal components that are essential for quantum processors. These components include amplifiers, converters, switches, filters, and clocks.Story continuesAnalog Devices has shown strong financial performance in 2022 and 2023. Revenue increased by more than 64% year-over-year in fiscal year 2022 (ended October 29), driven by strong demand in the company’s industrial and automotive end-markets. Similarly, the company’s first and second quarterly results for 2023 beat expectations on both revenue and EPS. In the first quarter, ADI reported $3.25 billion in revenues, up 21% year-over-year, while in the second quarter, the company reported $3.26 billion in revenue, which grew 10% year-over-year. As in fiscal year 2022, growth in both quarters was attributed to demand for industrial and automotive chips.The semiconductor company has proven itself capable of successfully meeting the needs and new challenges of clients in its respective end markets, and as quantum computing grows, Analog Devices could benefit similarly from good product execution.Rigetti Computing (RGTI)semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy nowSource: ShutterstockRigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI) had made it on my prior quantum computing list, and with shares down more than 17% over the past month, this may be just the moment for some of those patient investors to buy in. To recap, Rigetti Computing is a vertically integrated pure-play quantum computing firm, which means the company is involved in designing and manufacturing its multi-chip quantum processors. Rigetti leverages superconducting circuits as qubits fabricated on silicon chips and operating at near-zero temperatures.Rigetti has formed partnerships with several leading companies and institutions, such as ADIA Lab, Ampere Computing, Deloitte, NASA, and the U.S. Department of Energy, to bring awareness to its quantum computing technology. Rigetti Computing also earlier this year announced a collaboration with Amazon Bracket, a fully managed quantum computing service from AWS, to add support for Rigetti’s new 80-qubit processor. Rigetti Computing’s financials show robust growth potential, as the company generated $13 million in revenue in 2022, up 46% year-over-year. The quantum computing firm expects increased growth as its quantum projects scale. RGTI’s shares have surged 185% year-to-date.Nonetheless, shares have become volatile lately – a positive earnings report sent shares soaring earlier this month, but recent macroeconomic volatility has sent shares back plummeting. Investors betting on quantum computing should pay close attention to these moves and perhaps buy in at optimal entry points.FormFactor (FORM)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocks. semiconductor stocks to buy and holdSource: ShutterstockFormFactor (NASDAQ:FORM) is a semiconductor test and measurement company that provides advanced wafer probe cards, engineering systems, and analytical probes for various applications such as logic, memory, radio frequency, power management, photonics, and quantum computing. The semiconductor equipment company is also one of the leading suppliers of cryogenic probes that enable the testing of quantum devices at extremely low temperatures.FormFactor’s financial results as of the past year have been mixed. In February, their fiscal year 2022 earnings print showed a year-over-year decline in annual revenues, mostly stemming from weak demand from customers in Taiwan and China, representing more than 40% of 2022 revenues. In FormFactor’s recent Q2 earnings print, the company recorded a year-over-year revenue decline due to softening demand for its testing probe product. As these countries experience sluggish growth this year, some investors remain pessimistic about FormFactor’s near-term prospects, reflected in how FORM’s shares have appreciated versus semiconductor peers like Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).Despite macroeconomic setbacks, FormFactor is still well-positioned to whether the current storm will eventually capitalize on the growing demand for quantum computing and other emerging trends such as 5G, artificial intelligence, and autonomous vehicles.

And a husband with a passion for helping people.Payne serves on the board of Hearts in Hands, a faith-based organization in Birmingham, Alabama, that provides home repairs for low-income community members. But her connection to the nonprofit started with a simple desire to help people in need.Payne, a product team manager for Regions Treasury Management, has always been involved in the community through programs associated with her church. After she married 11 years ago, she and her husband, Carl, wanted to find a cause they could work on together.Through friends they found Hearts in Hands. Payne started out as a volunteer, helping to build wheelchair ramps, install handrails and doing minor plumbing and other repairs, but gradually began taking on more leadership and administrative roles with the organization.""I just wanted to use my gifts to do more,"" Payne said. With an accounting degree and an MBA, along with more than 39 years of banking experience, she has many financial and organizational skills to share. In addition to serving as secretary/treasurer of the board, she still finds time to work directly with clients, by taking the initial repair requests from homeowners.""I love talking to people and hearing their stories,"" she said. ""It can be difficult because so many people are in need, and you just wish you could help everyone, but it's a good feeling to know you're making a difference.""Many of their clients are elderly or people with disabilities and most do not have homeowners' insurance. Hearts in Hands performed 300 home repair projects last year and installed 50 wheelchair ramps.""Being a part of a nonprofit board is a different kind of community service,"" said Wendi Boyen, head of Community Advocacy and Financial Wellness at Regions. ""It's not like making a financial gift or participating in a volunteer project. It's a long-term commitment to make a difference in the community and support a cause you're passionate about.""Board members provide oversight, financial guidance and strategic planning to ensure the success of nonprofits, which strengthens our communities.Board service is also a good way to enhance personal and professional development. Individuals who serve on a board have the opportunity to cultivate new skill sets and expand their network of peers, professionals, community leaders, and thought leaders, which provides new avenues for development, outreach, influence, and mentorship.At Regions, board service is an important component of the Making Life Better Institute, the bank's community engagement strategy that also includes volunteerism, financial education and CDFI and MDI support.Currently around 534 Regions associates serve on boards in communities throughout the bank's footprint. Some associates' board service is related to their work at the bank and many other associates provide leadership to organizations they care about personally.Dennise Berger, branch manager of the Manatee Avenue Branch in Bradenton, Florida, also has a heart for service and a passion to lead.""I grew up in the community I live in, and as a youth was instilled with the value of community service and giving back,"" Berger said. And that drive to serve stayed with her as she began her banking career.""I believe that we as bankers have a responsibility to give back to the communities that we serve to help them grow and thrive. If they are growing and thriving, so will we. And organizations and boards love to have bankers supporting their organizations,"" she adds.Berger has served on boards of several civic and nonprofit organizations, including Bradenton Rotary Foundation, Manatee Chamber of Commerce, Manatee Technical College and DeMolay Florida, an organization committed to developing and inspiring leadership, team building, and networking for young men.Like Payne, Berger enjoys applying her specific skills and talents to provide leadership to these organizations and is gratified by their impact to the community.""I am a member and past president of the Rotary Club. Every year we raise money to award grants to local organizations. We fund youth programs that help youth, the homeless population and also seniors. I'm really proud to lend my talents to help create positive outcomes for my community.""Boyen has some advice for anyone interested in serving on a board. ""First, think about the types of organizations that appeal to you and do some research on the nonprofits and their board structure,"" she said.Boyen also suggests volunteering with the organization to get some hands-on experience with the work they do, and then connecting with a board member to let them know you're interested in a leadership position.To help associates learn more about serving on a nonprofit board, Regions recently launched a training course to provide information and insight on board service, as part of its Degreed learning platform.""If it's in your heart to help people, I'd advise anyone to take a leadership role in an organization,"" Payne said.

August and September have typically been volatile and often exhibit weak returns. So far, 2023 has not been an exception.Instead of buying and selling, it makes sense to hold on to quality stocks with solid long-term prospects. To quote Charlie Munger, “It’s waiting that helps you as an investor, and a lot of people just can’t stand to wait. If you didn’t get the deferred-gratification gene, you’ve got to work very hard to overcome that.”If we follow Mr. Munger’s advice, it makes sense to seek out mispriced equities or add to existing positions for the long term. Below are four of our favorite Dividend Contenders in August 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsUFP Industries (UFPI)photo of walking space between two very tall stacks of processed timberSource: shutterstock.com/Free BelarusUFP Industries (NASDAQ:UFPI) is probably a company most people have not heard about. But it has a $6.3 billion market capitalization and boasted $9.6 billion in sales in 2022. The company has a nearly 70-year history selling wood and other products to the housing industry. Today, the business operates in eight countries and reports four segments: UFP Retail Solutions, UFP Construction, UFP Packaging and UFP International.Historically, UFP Industries has grown organically and through many tuck-in acquisitions. It has recently purchased PalletOne, CedarPoly and DWP. These three M&amp;A actions are on top of 10 other prior additions. The company’s priority for capital allocation is strategic acquisitions to contribute half its total annual sales growth.The strategy is seemingly successful because sales have grown from $4.4 billion in 2019 to $9.6 billion in 2022. Likewise, net earnings and adjusted EBITDA have climbed. However, the company has not sacrificed fiscal discipline. The balance sheet is conservative. Furthermore, the dividend has grown at a double-digit rate for the past decade and is supported by an ultra-low payout ratio of about 8.7%.Story continuesThe share price has risen, but UFP Industries trades at a reasonable earnings multiple of about 12x. Investors may want to take a look at this equity.Williams-Sonoma (WSM)Williams-Sonoma (WSM) store in a shopping mallSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.comNext on our list is Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM), the well-known specialty retailer of upscale indoor and outdoor home furnishings, cookware and other products. The firm sells its products under the Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Teen, Pottery Barn Kids, West Elm, Rejuvenation, and Mark and Graham brands. Total revenue was $8.67 billion in 2022 and $8.54 billion in the last 12 months.Williams-Sonoma grows organically by adding to its store count and offering desirable, trendy items for sale. The formula has proven successful over time. Revenue has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 7.9%, while earnings per share (EPS) have climbed even faster at a CAGR of more than 20% in the past decade.The firm has paid shareholders a growing dividend for the past 17 years. The forward dividend yield is about 2.74%, supported by a conservative payout ratio of only 18.4%. This low value should permit the continuation of the double-digit dividend growth rate. Moreover, dividend safety is high, with earnings and free cash flow (FCF) covering the payout.The share price is down because of reduced spending after the pandemic. The forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is only 9.7x, below the 10-year range. Investors may want to dip into this stock now.Regions Financial (RF)A customer makes a transaction at a bankSource: Africa Studio / Shutterstock.comRegions Financial (NYSE:RF) is a large regional bank headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. The firm provides personal and corporate banking through three segments: Corporate Bank, Consumer Bank and Wealth Management. Regions Financial operates over 1,250 branches and 2,000 ATMs in the South, Midwest and Texas. Today, it is one of the biggest regional banks in the United States, with $99 billion in loans, $127 billion in deposits and $156 billion in assets.The bank continues to grow by adding deposits and making loans. Profitability is based on the net interest margin (NIM), the difference between the loan and deposit interest rates. Besides net interest income (NII), the firm charges fees, deriving non-interest income. The values typically fluctuate quarterly, but the bank has earned more over time.In addition, a bank’s profitability depends on asset quality and capitalization. Regions Financial seemingly has typical asset quality from the perspective of net charge-offs, allowance for credit losses and non-performing loans. In addition, the bank’s capitalization ratios are greater than the regulatory minimums.Regions Financial has paid a growing dividend for 11 years. The forward dividend yield is 4.9%, supported by a 32.7% payout ratio. The firm has increased the dividend at a double-digit rate in the past five years. In addition, the dividend quality grade is solid at a B+.The share price has been under pressure since this year because of the regional bank crisis. However, unlike some failed banks, Regions Financial has little exposure to start-ups and cryptocurrencies. We view the stock as a long-term buy.The Hartford Financial Services Group (HIG)A close-up shot of a hand choosing wooden blocks with emoticons related to health insurance. russell 2000 stocksSource: ShutterstockThe Hartford Financial Services Group (NYSE:HIG) is our fourth favorite Dividend Contender in August 2023. The firm is a leader in property and casualty insurance, group benefits and mutual funds operating in the United States and the United Kingdom. It has five business segments: Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, Property &amp; Casualty, Group Benefits and Hartford Funds. Total premium, annuity, interest and dividend revenue was $22.3 billion in 2022 and $23.6 billion in the trailing 12 months.Like most insurance companies, Hartford grows by writing more policies and collecting more premiums. Additionally, it invests the premiums in bonds and equities and collects interest and dividends. Also, the firm has a mutual and exchange-traded fund (ETF) business where it collects fees. This business grows by adding assets under management (AUM).Insurance companies must match liabilities to assets through solid underwriting to manage risk. Moreover, Hartford’s fund management business must perform well relative to the overall market. Generally, the company has performed well, growing the top and bottom lines since a low in 2017.This success has translated to a 13-year streak of rising dividends. The forward dividend yield is about 2.4%, near the five-year average. But the dividend is growing slightly more than 10% annually on average. The low payout ratio of approximately 21% and the A+ dividend quality grade provide confidence about the safety.The share price has been flat for the year, and the P/E ratio is only 9.2x. We see the stock as slightly undervalued and a long-term buy.On the date of publication, Prakash Kolli did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the financial sector and its performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Financial Dividend Stocks To Invest In.Over the years, the finance industry in the US has gone through several changes. The onset of the pandemic and the recent banking crisis have made these changes even more intense. Following the failure of three major US banks in March this year, worried customers and investors rushed to withdraw their funds. CNN reported that these banks had about $559 billion in total assets, surpassing the $523 billion held by 25 banks that collapsed in 2008 when accounting for inflation.The effects of the pandemic have resulted in financial companies from Wall Street shifting away from New York City and moving to the Sun Belt region. According to Bloomberg, the firms are taking almost $1 trillion worth of managed assets with them. This move is being driven by factors like taxes and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also by practical and cultural reasons. Amid the pandemic, factors like no state income tax, pleasant weather, and business-friendly offers encouraged New York-based hedge fund billionaires to move their businesses to Florida. The report also mentioned that between the beginning of 2020 and the end of March 2023, over 370 investment companies, which is about 2.5% of all US investment firms, shifted their main offices to a different state. These companies collectively managed assets worth $2.7 trillion.In one of the recent developments, shares of several US banks dropped on August 22. This happened after S&amp;P Global, a rating agency, lowered credit ratings for certain regional banks that are heavily involved in commercial real estate. These banks include KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA), and Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE:ASB). This action came after a similar move by Moody's. Both of these rating agencies are making these changes because of an ongoing banking crisis that started in March.Story continuesS&amp;P Global mentioned challenging conditions affecting the banking sector. Here is what the credit agency said in its report:""The sharp rise in interest rates and quantitative tightening deployed since March 2022 to combat high inflation are weighing on many U.S. banks' funding, liquidity and spread income. These factors have also caused the value of banks' assets to fall and raised the odds of asset quality deterioration.""Investing in financial stocks means putting money into the top businesses that offer banking, insurance, credit cards, and various other financial services around the world. Since the financial sector is central to the worldwide economy, it's a smart idea for investors to seriously think about including financial stocks as a significant part of their investment collections. Due to the ongoing issues in the finance industry, the sector is struggling to match the pace of the market. The S&amp;P 500 Financials, which tracks the performance of some of the most prominent finance companies such as Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), is down by 1.11% year-to-date. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 gained 14.44% this year so far.Also read: 12 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy NowInvesting in dividend stocks within the finance sector can be a prudent strategy for income investors. However, it's essential to note that the finance sector can be sensitive to economic fluctuations and regulatory changes. For example, during economic downturns, financial institutions might face challenges that affect their ability to maintain dividend payouts. Additionally, changes in interest rates, lending practices, or government policies can impact the sector's performance.

HP Inc. (HPQ) shares fell after the tech manufacturer illustrated slowing PC demand in its mixed earnings report. Lastly, Nvidia (NVDA) stock closes higher at an all-time high, continuing a record run starting on Tuesday, August 29.Yahoo Finance Live checks out several of the day's trending stocks after Wednesday's closing bell.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: And that's the closing bell on Wall Street, checking in on where we are closing the day. All three of the major averages ending in the green. You're looking at the S&amp;P above 4,500, up now for four days in a row. The Dow up just about 38 points. The NASDAQ up about a half of a percent.Investors sifting through a number of econ data points that were out this morning before the bell, showing slowing growth. And it looks like investors actually taking that as good news and maybe that means that the Fed is going to back off on future rate hikes. But, again, all three of the major averages closing today to the upside.Let's check in on some of the top trending tickers of the day. Shares of Visa and Mastercard both closing to the upside on reports that the two companies are planning to increase fees that businesses pay when they accept customers' credit cards. Now the increases are scheduled to start in October for Visa's online transactions. And Mastercard's new pre-authorization fee for credit card purchases.Akiko, obviously this is bad news for merchants. We know merchants are likely going to fight this. They have already facing a pretty steady climb in the amount that they are paying in terms of fees for these credit card companies. But it alss it does mean something for the consumers at the end of the day because the merchants are likely to pass along those prices in some capacity to consumers through higher prices for their products.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I mean, that is the big concern. I mean, it's worth running through some of the numbers in terms of where the fees stand right now. US merchants paid an estimated $93 billion in Visa and Mastercard fees last year.Story continuesYou talk about this additional hike that we're talking about today, an additional $502 million annually in fees and really does come down to businesses saying, look, this is just not the time to be doing it. That's the concern, especially with the higher costs they've had to deal with.And then of course, the concern on the other end is if they're not able to shoulder some of those additional costs and how much of that is going to get passed down to consumers. So we'll have to be watching when those hikes take effect in October, as well as April.Well, shares of PC making giant HP Inc in the red today, as slowing demand for computers led to a full-year profit warning. HP now sees full-year adjusted earnings of $3.23 to $3.25 a share. That's down from $3.30 to $3.50. Previously, the stock getting hit today, down more than 6%.It feels like, Seana, there's two schools of thought here when you think about analysts that are weighing in. You've got Evercore ISI saying this is sort of the short-term pain that we're seeing. But long term, HP's margins are holding up at the top end of its product range. They've maintained a price target of $33 a share.But then you've got Citi that says, look, even if the PC demand, which of course, has been quite weak. Even if those turnaround, the print headwinds are still likely to really pressure HP moving forward.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. Also, Morgan Stanley pointing to those print headwinds. The decline that we saw here in the most recent quarter. And taking a look at what those sales looked like for HP. Print declines for sales, off about 7% to 4.3 billion. And the argument here is that the declining sales, that could actually limit future growth.When we talk about this turnaround story, clearly not taking place in the timeline that HP had initially anticipated. So the company really seeing the fact that others are putting off spending amid job cuts, amid the broader pullback in the economy. They also cited a weakness out of China as another headwind facing HP.So I think there's lots of questions just about what this recovery is going to look like and potentially how much longer it could take relative to what executives had been hoping for and they were hoping for obviously that it would be taking place right now. And we'd see it pick up in the second half of the year.All right, let's also take a look at shares of NVIDIA, closing the day in the green, hitting an all time high. Now up over 230% on the year, closing the day up just about 1% Now this coming after the company's second quarter earnings recently blowing past already sky high expectations. AI hype train continuing to push the stock higher.And, Akiko, when you take a look at the Street's reaction to the results and what we've seen play out over the last week or so, Wall Street continuing to get more bullish on NVIDIA. The average analyst price target now at 644 bucks a share.AKIKO FUJITA: That is incredible when you consider that run. I mean, a number we like to say a lot, Seana, is NVIDIA has a market share of 85% to 90% when it comes to AI chips.But our tech editor, Dan Howley, has an interesting piece out today, that essentially says, look, there's a first mover advantage, but this isn't going to last at these levels for long for NVIDIA largely because their competitors, especially AMD as well as Intel are working on their own offerings.His piece seems to suggest that they could really make big inroads, particularly based on what NVIDIA has right now but the stock still trading at what was that? Can we bring that up again? I mean, 690, was that the call? I mean, that's the Street high, right? Still got a long way to go at $492 a share.]"

Marriott InternationalMarriott, the leading hotel company in India, is set to introduce its 17th brand in the country — Moxy.This move was recently announced by Ranju Alex, Marriott’s area vice president for South Asia, during the launch of India’s first-ever co-branded hotel credit card by Marriott in partnership with HDFC Bank.“Our brand entries reinforce our commitment to South Asia. It is a high potential region for us and Moxy as a brand will bring a bold, new and unconventional hotel experience to this dynamic market. It will be our 17th brand to launch in the region across markets such as Bengaluru, Mumbai and Chennai with an anticipated opening planned for the first quarter of 2024,” Alex said.Marriott International now has 31 brands globally with a 32nd on its way. (Read Skift’s explainer on Marriott’s brands.)The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has caused a major shift in Marriott’s approach to business, showing the importance of diversification. That’s behind the introduction of the Ritz Carlton yacht and the imminent launch of the Moxy brand in India.In Alex’s words, it isn’t enough to just be the largest hospitality company, “We aspire to be the most favorite travel company of the world.”Alex emphasized that loyalty is a key part of Marriott’s business model. In the highly competitive landscape of the hospitality industry, a loyal guest base can be an important asset.The hotel has 186 million members enrolled in the Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, and Alex underscored that Marriott will continue to foster its relationship with members in India, where around 4.5 million guests are part of the program.Targeting Smaller CitiesMarriott’s strategic expansion into India’s tier two and tier three cities is in response to changing consumer behavior, partially created during the pandemic.These cities have been experiencing a surge in growth, driven by rising middle-class aspirations and changes in consumer preferences.Alex noted that while tier one cities house the majority of Bonvoy members, the real growth potential lies in tier two and tier three cities.Story continuesAlex said that unlike bigger cities in the country, hotels in smaller cities did not have to reduce rates during Covid.Alex said these towns have surprised Marriott with their appetite for food and beverage. The company aims to capitalize on this potential by tailoring its offerings to meet the distinct preferences of consumers in these areas.Not Just RoomsMarriott has undertaken a substantial shift to place greater emphasis on elevating its food and beverage offerings to cultivate loyalty.Alex cited an example of Marriott’s Shillong property, which achieved profitability within its first month of operation due to the strong demand for food and beverage services.The company has also introduced schemes to earn and redeem loyalty points through dining experiences.“So far, we have piloted it in 40 hotels in India, but very soon we will have it in all the Marriott properties in India clearly giving us a first mover advantage.”This shift underscores the importance of localizing offerings to cater to specific market segments and occasions such as weddings, events, and conferences.Alex said that the absence of readily available upscale event venues creates a unique advantage for Marriott, as its accommodations become a sought-after choice for hosting events in smaller cities.This has translated into higher room occupancy rates, positioning the company’s properties as go-to options for hosting gatherings and enhancing its overall revenue in these markets.More Marriott NewsUpdated Jun. 27, 2023Marriott Vs.

However, as she pointed out, “We are an operator, we don’t buy hotels. So, if one of our owners buys it, and invites us to run it for them, we’ll be more than happy.”“The owners see a lot of value in Marriott’s conversions and we are getting a lot of queries on conversions. We are looking at some right now,” Alex said.The Blended Travel PushThe pandemic prompted a significant shift in consumer behavior, with a greater emphasis on experiences over material possessions.This change has worked to the advantage of hotel companies like Marriott, as blended trips combining business and leisure have become more prevalent.The number of guests working to combine their business trip with a staycation has increased exponentially. “Earlier, in tier one cities, especially in business hotels, we used to struggle with occupancies during weekends. That’s no longer a worry for us.”Marriott’s understanding of its customers’ desires and willingness to adapt to their changing needs have positioned the company to cater to this evolving trend successfully.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

Active inventory remained -47.8% below typical 2017 to 2019 levels, although an unseasonable increase in newly listed homes from July to August (+3.5%) this year provides more options for home shoppers as the fall buying season approaches.""While the uptick in new listings is good news for home shoppers, inventory remains persistently low, even with record-high mortgage rates putting a damper on demand,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""The inventory crunch continues to put upward pressure on home prices, amplifying affordability concerns and shutting some potential buyers out of the market. However, we anticipate mortgage rates will gradually ease through the end of the year and, despite this month's bump in home prices, we'll be unlikely to see a new price peak this year.""What it means for homebuyers, sellers, and the housing marketAlthough home sellers were less active in August compared to last year, the increase in newly listed homes for sale from July to August creates a nice boost for shoppers heading into fall, which is typically the best time to buy a home. Homeowners who have been on the fence about selling will likely find eager buyers looking for fresh listings.""As fall buying activity heats up, the newly available homes for sale aren't likely to remain on the market long, so sellers and hopeful homebuyers will need to be prepared to move quickly,"" said Realtor.com® Executive News Editor Clare Trapasso. ""Home shoppers can save searches on Realtor.com® to receive real-time alerts, receive mortgage pre-approvals, and pore over their budgets to determine what they can realistically afford with today's higher mortgage rates.""Story continuesAffordability remains a significant concern. Although sales of new homes are on the rise, construction activity isn't sufficiently robust to offset the inventory shortage and ease prices, which are up nearly 38% from August 2019 levels. Additionally, elevated mortgage rates have raised the monthly financing cost of the average home by about $417, up 21.7% from August 2022. This greatly exceeds both wage growth (4.4%) and inflation (3.2%).August 2023 Housing Metrics – NationalMetricChange over Aug 2022Change over Aug 2019Median listing price+0.7% (to $435,000)+37.9 %Active listings-7.9 %-45.8 %New listings-7.5 %-19.3 %Median days on market+5 days (to 46 days)-13 daysShare of active listings with price reductions-3.1 percentage points (to 16.2%)-1.4 percentage points Year over year home prices rise in August after two months of annual declinesIn August, national home listing prices rose slightly compared to last year, ending a two-month streak of year-over-year price declines in June and July, buoyed by a scarce inventory of homes for sale across the country. Despite listing prices being slightly higher than in August of last year, the median list price is unlikely to surpass last year's record peak of $449,000 in June 2022 as we head into the fall months and when home prices typically see a slight seasonal decline.The U.S. median list price fell to $435,000 in August, down from $440,000 in July, but is up slightly (+0.7%) from August of last year.While all regions saw listing prices in larger metros increase on average, Northeastern metros had the highest growth rate in active listing prices, with an average increase of 9.7% over the past year.Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, only 7 saw their median list price decline compared with this time last year, down from 12 last month. The greatest year-over-year price declines were seen in Raleigh (-4.6%) and Las Vegas (-2.8%). Larger southern metros saw the lowest listing price growth rate among the regions (3.2%).Nationally, the share of homes with price reductions decreased from 19.3% in August of last year to 16.2% this year, and remains below typical levels seen in 2017 to 2019.Among the 50 largest metros, the largest increases in the percentage of homes with price reductions compared to last year were in San Antonio (+3.9 percentage points), Memphis (+3.7), and Oklahoma City (+1.9).Newly listed homes improve from July, but inventory crunch continuesWhile the market saw an unusual bump in newly listed homes for sale between July and August this year, the overall number of homes actively for sale shrank for the second consecutive month, reversing the consistent growth trajectory seen since April 2022. Some of this drop can be attributed to an off-season surge in inventory during a market slowdown last summer. Although active inventory still remains below typical pre-pandemic levels seen between 2017 and 2019, the modest rise in new homes listed for sale this summer could give buyers grappling with affordability issues more options.Nationally, active inventory shrank -7.9% year over year in August compared to last year. On average, active inventory in August was -47.8% below typical 2017–2019 levels.Pending listings, or homes under contract, declined by 11.5% compared to the same time last year, which is slightly smaller than July's 12.6% decline and much improved from December's peak decline (-36.9% year over year).Newly listed homes were 7.5% below last year's levels, but this rate of decline is much improved from a decline of 20.8% in July. Newly listed homes increased by 3.5% from July to August.In all regions, the inventory of homes actively for sale was down 30%–60% from pre-pandemic levels. Inventory declined least in the South, by 1.5% compared to the same time last year, followed by a decline of 13.5% in the Midwest, 19.3% in the Northeast, and 31.5% in the West.In August, only Milwaukee (+6.8%) and Jacksonville (+4.0%) saw new listings increase over the same time last year. Declines in new listings were greatest in Nashville (-27.2%) Cincinnati (-25.0%) and Seattle (-24.7%).As inventory shrinks, homes in several large markets sell faster compared to last yearThe time homes spend on the market is approaching last year's quicker figures, with buyers again vying for fewer available options than the prior year in most parts of the country. Should this pattern continue, by the coming month homes in every region except the South are likely to sell faster than they did during the same period last year.In August, the typical home spent 46 days on the market, 5 days longer than this time last year, but 13 fewer days than they did on average from August 2017–2019.Time on market increased in August compared to last year in 35 of the 50 largest metro areas. Larger metros in the South saw the greatest increase (+6 days), followed by the Northeast (+2 days), Midwest (+1 day) and West (+0 days).At the market level, time on market increased the most in Austin and New Orleans (+15 days), as well as in Miami (+13 days). August 2023 Housing Overview by Top 50 Largest Metros  Metro AreaMedian Listing PriceMedian Listing Price YoYMedian Listing Price per Sq.

Per the agreement, Catalent needs to engage in transactions that would make Elliott own more than 10% of the company's common stock, or increase its economic exposure to more than 14.9% of its common stock.Earnings ResultCatalent also reported its preliminary fourth-quarter and fiscal 2023 results, which showed a decline of 17% and 40% in revenues and earnings, respectively, compared with the prior-year period’s level.The company attributed the lower revenues and earnings to the impact of COVID-19 on its business segments (especially Biologics segment), as well as operational challenges and higher costs related to labor, raw materials and transportation. These headwinds are likely to continue in fiscal 2024, but the company will benefit from its strategic investments in high-demand areas such as biologics, cell and gene therapy, and oral biotherapeutics.Catalent’s outlook for fiscal 2024 was better than expected, reflecting sustainable growth. The company projects revenues between $4,300 million and $4,500 million, and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $680-$760 million for the full year. Moreover, unfavorable comparison for COVID-19 related sales in fiscal 2023 will be absent in the next financial year, which will provide a clear picture of the company’s business growth.Story continuesCatalent, Inc.

MMSI is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its strong product portfolio. The optimism led by solid second-quarter 2023 performance and international exposure are expected to contribute further. However, headwinds due to forex volatility and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 12.4% compared with a 16.9% rise of the industry and 13.8% growth of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical devices provider has a market capitalization of $3.84 billion. The company projects 11.5% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 15.8% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Product Portfolio: Merit Medical has continued to gain significant momentum on the back of new products. The company is upbeat about the product pipeline, including radio and electrophysiology products, raising investors’ optimism. It has several electrophysiology products that are either on track for release or in several other stages of development.In June, Merit Medical completed the acquisition of a portfolio of dialysis catheter products and the BioSentry Biopsy Tract Sealant System from AngioDynamics. This follows Merit Medical’s acquisition of the Surfacer Inside-Out Access Catheter System from Bluegrass Vascular Technologies, Inc.International Exposure: We are optimistic about Merit Medical’s worldwide product distribution network, which includes territories in Europe, the Middle East, Africa (EMEA) and Asia, among others. On the second quarter of 2023 earnings call, Merit Medical confirmed that growth in U.S. and international sales drove its overall top line.Per management, Asia Pacific (APAC) was the primary driver of better-than-expected results, although both the EMEA and Rest of World regions were at the upper end of Merit Medical’s growth expectations in the second quarter. APAC growth was driven by sales in China, which increased year over year as the improving trends in March continued into the second quarter.Story continuesStrong Q2 Results: Merit Medical’s robust second-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company witnessed a year-over-year uptick in the top and bottom lines. The company also saw revenue growth in both its segments and across all the product categories within its Cardiovascular unit. Robust performances in the United States and outside were also seen. The expansion of gross margin bodes well for the stock.DownsidesForex Volatility: Merit Medical has been expanding its operations outside the United States. This has led to the company becoming increasingly subject to market risk relating to foreign currency, which could have a negative impact on its margins and financial results. If the rate of exchange between foreign currencies declines against the U.S. dollar, Merit Medical may not be able to increase the prices charged from its customers for products whose prices are denominated in those respective foreign currencies.Stiff Competition: Merit Medical operates in highly competitive markets, where it faces competition from many companies with greater resources. The company competes globally in several market areas, including radiology and interventional cardiology. Such resources and market presence may enable the competitors to market competing products more efficiently or at reduced prices to gain market share.Estimate TrendMerit Medical is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved a penny south to $2.88.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $306.3 million, suggesting a 6.6% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Patterson Companies, Inc.

281,0fcc42a6-60ba-3e9d-8cb5-ec02bcd10c4c,FOX,2023-08-31,"Hollywood strikes, subscriber churn, sports rights: Big media woes",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/hollywood-strikes-subscriber-churn-sports-222558647.html,1693434358,VIDEO,"['AAPL', 'WBD', 'DIS', 'PARA', 'PARAA', 'PARAP', 'NFLX', 'CMCSA', 'FOX', 'FOXA']","[Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) has named former BBC and New York Times executive Mark Thompson as its CEO. It comes at a time of great change for the media industry. Traditional media companies like Disney (DIS), Paramount (PARA), and Warner Bros. Discovery are seeing their cable businesses decline while they are investing a lot of money in their streaming businesses. Activate CEO Michael Wolf says all of these companies are trying to position themselves for the ""direct-to-consumer"" future and, as a result, they will increase their spending on content. Several of the big streamers have started raising prices. Wolf says thinks that, in the future, viewers are going to ""churn in and out among these services, price might not be the reason that determines it. It's just more about the availability of programming on those networks and streaming services,"" Wolf tells Yahoo Finance Live. When it comes to the Hollywood strikes, Wolf calls the timing of the strikes ""inopportune,"" saying the ""profit pools for programming production are drying up"" and that the ""revenue streams for these shows aren't necessarily settled.""Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: CNN has a new CEO. Warner Brothers Discovery appointing Mark Thompson as chief executive of the cable news network. He previously served as director general of the BBC as well as CEO of the ""New York Times."" Thompson coming to CNN at a critical time for the media industry as cord cutting accelerates and traditional TV struggles to keep up.Here to discuss this and much more, we want to bring in Michael Wolf, CEO of Activate. Michael, it's great to see you here. So let's start with CNN's new appointment for their CEO Mark Thompson. Is he the best candidate for this job, and why?MICHAEL WOLF: He comes with an incredible pedigree and an incredible track record. So between understanding television from the BBC and managing a massive news organization to what he accomplished as the CEO of the ""New York Times"" company, especially in terms of building a subscription base and continuing to expand their users-- now, here's what's happening.Story continuesIronically, up until recently, CNN was the largest news website, roughly about 400 million unique visitors. And just recently, ""The New York Times"" overtook it just by a couple of million. And so I think we're going to see-- it's going to continue to, of course, be a race between those two as long-- as well as others-- MSNBC and Fox News and even the ""New York Post"" and, of course, Yahoo Finance.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, we appreciate you adding that Yahoo Finance in there, Michael. You know, this, of course, comes at a time-- when you think about, especially in the streaming space, there's this real divide that's happening between linear and digital. You're talking about CNN, which we tend to think more as linear. You know, Bob Iger over at Disney is looking at options for ESPN and what to do there. I mean, what kind of shakedown you think is coming when you think about brands like Warner Brothers Discovery as well as Disney in terms of linear and digital?MICHAEL WOLF: Yeah, so part of what we're seeing and what really is driving this urge to merge among these companies is the need to really position themselves in this world, where increasingly, we have fewer and fewer subscribers. We now have 70 million people in 70 million homes in the US that are subscribing to cable.And we expect it-- at Activate, we expect it to go down into roughly 60 in the next couple of years. And at the same time, these streaming services are their big cash drains. They're very deep expenses for the next couple of years. And it's no different how long it took for each of these companies to make their cable networks profitable.So cable networks have been the golden goose. Suddenly, we have something new coming on in streaming. They're all trying to position themselves for this future, this direct-to-consumer future. And I think that-- by the way, despite the fact that the CEOs of these companies say that they're going to cut back on their spending on programming, we think and we see and we forecast that there are expenses for and then their investments in programming are going to continue to be at these levels and, in fact, continue to increase.SEANA SMITH: Michael, that, of course, then brings up the question of pricing when it comes to the streaming side of the business, right? Because we know Bob Iger time and time again has reiterated the fact that he is focusing on profitability for their streaming division. And Disney recently raising prices following a number of their competitors who have done so very recently. How do these media companies-- how are they thinking about price hikes and balancing that with making sure that they don't see a massive increase in churn?MICHAEL WOLF: Well, I mean, it's-- you really hit the nail on the head, which is they're trying to strike that right balance. And so the fact that we've seen some decline in Netflix in the last quarter, really some of that reflects a couple of things. One is price increase but the also the eliminating password sharing. And so you would have thought that would have increase the number of subscribers.So I think that what's the bigger issue is not whether those price can be sustained. But also, they're having a lot of churn. It's very easy to watch a set of shows on Disney+ and then drop it and go to Max and watch it.So it's-- we as a firm, we forecast that by 2026, the average subscriber will have six streaming services. They're just not going to be the same six. They're going to churn in and out among these services. Price might not be the reason that determines it. It's just more about the availability of programming on those networks and streaming services.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I'm surprised at that number, Michael, at six because it feels like-- you know, I was thinking back to the conversation with streaming first launched. It was about the optionality. And you--MICHAEL WOLF: Yes.AKIKO FUJITA: --don't have to pay for these massive cable bundles. And it feels like cable is cheaper when you consider six different subscriptions you have to pay for. It feels like increasingly sports could be one that could make a lot of these places very sticky because it is one that comes up on a weekly basis, maybe not as much churn. I mean, how do you think these streaming services are positioning themselves on sports with that very idea in mind that there is a limit to how many streaming services viewers want to subscribe to?MICHAEL WOLF: Yeah, I mean, precisely, they're-- the-- what we're going to see is that-- and already seeing is that between Apple and Peacock and Amazon and others, they're already getting streaming rights for sports. They're not getting all of it. So you've got Amazon with ""Thursday Night Football"" as well as they're going to do one preseason game and a special game on Black Friday. And we're going to see that all the way through to Apple really locking up Major League Soccer for the next year.So we're going to see those games go back and forth. And yes, it's going to be another reason for people to watch. But you can't get all of the games in the same place. So you're going to have to subscribe to different services. And you're going to have to keep watching them on television in order-- if you're really an avid super sports fan.SEANA SMITH: Michael, we're talking about the media landscape right now. We also have to talk about the strike that's going on, right? Because when we talk about the pressure that so many of these media Giants are facing, it almost seems like from all angles, obviously, the strike is another pressure point here for these companies, for the studios, for the streamers. How much more challenging is the next several months going to be the longer that this strike goes on for? And I guess who is best positioned given the circumstances we're in today?MICHAEL WOLF: Yeah, I'm hopeful that the strike won't last forever. Part of it is that the time is really an opportune. The profit pools for programming production are drying up there. Even though there's a whole set of new shows, there-- they're really at much lower cost levels. And so I'm not sure there's going to be a lot of profit left to distribute.And this-- the other reason why it's in an opportune time is because the revenue streams for these shows aren't necessarily settled. And so the actors and the writers may find themselves in a position where they put their earnings more at risk than less as they want to have a piece of the profits. And the profits may not be there.Interestingly, the last time that one of these strikes took place a lot, last time was well over 10 years ago. And at that point, they were arguing about who got residuals from DVD rights. So the world has changed. And yes, the relationships with writers and actors and artists are going to change. But this is a tough time to be making those demands.SEANA SMITH: And it is a tough time, certainly a tough time for both sides right now. All right, Michael, always great to have you. Thanks so much for joining me.MICHAEL WOLF: Great to be here.]"

All industrial engines currently in the field can be fueled with 100% renewable diesel, or any blend of renewable and traditional diesel, with no engine modifications required. Any renewable diesel used must meet the EN15940 standard, as defined by the European Committee for Standardization.""As we work alongside our customers toward a carbon neutral future, bridge solutions like alternative fuels are critical in decarbonizing existing equipment,"" said Gary Johansen, Cummins' Vice President, Power Systems Engineering. ""Approving unblended renewable diesel use in all high horsepower engines is one more step on our path of continued innovation to help our industrial customers reduce their carbon footprints while upholding performance and reliability standards.""Prior to this announcement, Cummins allowed up to 25% renewable diesel for high-horsepower engines for industrial applications, as well as up to 100% renewable diesel for the QSK95 engine for rail applications. Cummins was first to market in 2021 with the approval of 100% renewable diesel use in standby generator sets used in data centers and other key applications.Technical evaluations of all high-horsepower engines utilizing renewable diesel included emissions cycle, performance, transient, fuel consumption testing as well as field testing.The trials showed that exhaust emissions output continued to be comparable to engines operating on conventional diesel fuel and within established EPA targets with no changes to engine hardware and software. The trials also showed that, when compared to conventional diesel, the use of renewable diesel can serve as a drop-in replacement, as well as:This announcement is an example of Cummins' commitment to advance the company's current technology to achieve industry-leading emissions reductions.

And at the same time, these streaming services are their big cash drains. They're very deep expenses for the next couple of years. And it's no different how long it took for each of these companies to make their cable networks profitable.So cable networks have been the golden goose. Suddenly, we have something new coming on in streaming. They're all trying to position themselves for this future, this direct-to-consumer future. And I think that-- by the way, despite the fact that the CEOs of these companies say that they're going to cut back on their spending on programming, we think and we see and we forecast that there are expenses for and then their investments in programming are going to continue to be at these levels and, in fact, continue to increase.SEANA SMITH: Michael, that, of course, then brings up the question of pricing when it comes to the streaming side of the business, right? Because we know Bob Iger time and time again has reiterated the fact that he is focusing on profitability for their streaming division. And Disney recently raising prices following a number of their competitors who have done so very recently. How do these media companies-- how are they thinking about price hikes and balancing that with making sure that they don't see a massive increase in churn?MICHAEL WOLF: Well, I mean, it's-- you really hit the nail on the head, which is they're trying to strike that right balance. And so the fact that we've seen some decline in Netflix in the last quarter, really some of that reflects a couple of things. One is price increase but the also the eliminating password sharing. And so you would have thought that would have increase the number of subscribers.So I think that what's the bigger issue is not whether those price can be sustained. But also, they're having a lot of churn. It's very easy to watch a set of shows on Disney+ and then drop it and go to Max and watch it.So it's-- we as a firm, we forecast that by 2026, the average subscriber will have six streaming services. They're just not going to be the same six. They're going to churn in and out among these services. Price might not be the reason that determines it. It's just more about the availability of programming on those networks and streaming services.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I'm surprised at that number, Michael, at six because it feels like-- you know, I was thinking back to the conversation with streaming first launched. It was about the optionality. And you--MICHAEL WOLF: Yes.AKIKO FUJITA: --don't have to pay for these massive cable bundles. And it feels like cable is cheaper when you consider six different subscriptions you have to pay for. It feels like increasingly sports could be one that could make a lot of these places very sticky because it is one that comes up on a weekly basis, maybe not as much churn. I mean, how do you think these streaming services are positioning themselves on sports with that very idea in mind that there is a limit to how many streaming services viewers want to subscribe to?MICHAEL WOLF: Yeah, I mean, precisely, they're-- the-- what we're going to see is that-- and already seeing is that between Apple and Peacock and Amazon and others, they're already getting streaming rights for sports. They're not getting all of it. So you've got Amazon with ""Thursday Night Football"" as well as they're going to do one preseason game and a special game on Black Friday. And we're going to see that all the way through to Apple really locking up Major League Soccer for the next year.So we're going to see those games go back and forth. And yes, it's going to be another reason for people to watch. But you can't get all of the games in the same place. So you're going to have to subscribe to different services. And you're going to have to keep watching them on television in order-- if you're really an avid super sports fan.SEANA SMITH: Michael, we're talking about the media landscape right now. We also have to talk about the strike that's going on, right? Because when we talk about the pressure that so many of these media Giants are facing, it almost seems like from all angles, obviously, the strike is another pressure point here for these companies, for the studios, for the streamers. How much more challenging is the next several months going to be the longer that this strike goes on for? And I guess who is best positioned given the circumstances we're in today?MICHAEL WOLF: Yeah, I'm hopeful that the strike won't last forever. Part of it is that the time is really an opportune. The profit pools for programming production are drying up there. Even though there's a whole set of new shows, there-- they're really at much lower cost levels. And so I'm not sure there's going to be a lot of profit left to distribute.And this-- the other reason why it's in an opportune time is because the revenue streams for these shows aren't necessarily settled. And so the actors and the writers may find themselves in a position where they put their earnings more at risk than less as they want to have a piece of the profits. And the profits may not be there.Interestingly, the last time that one of these strikes took place a lot, last time was well over 10 years ago. And at that point, they were arguing about who got residuals from DVD rights. So the world has changed. And yes, the relationships with writers and actors and artists are going to change. But this is a tough time to be making those demands.SEANA SMITH: And it is a tough time, certainly a tough time for both sides right now. All right, Michael, always great to have you. Thanks so much for joining me.MICHAEL WOLF: Great to be here.]"

Industry watchers say that the ""double whammy"" work stoppage has already had serious economic implications, similar to the last writers' strike.According to estimates from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., the 2007-2008 strike cost the Los Angeles County economy a whopping $2.5 billion. That likely will double this time around.Kevin Klowden, chief global strategist at the Milken Institute, estimated the current strikes will soon cost the national economy $5 billion-plus, upwardly revising his previous estimate of $4 billion. He explained that the work stoppage will impact other businesses besides production, including restaurants, catering companies, trucking agencies, and dry cleaning businesses, among many others.""The main thing we're really factoring into it is the lost wages,"" Klowden told Yahoo Finance Live in an interview on Tuesday. He emphasized it's not just the industries in California that will be impacted, but also industries in New York, Atlanta, Albuquerque, Pittsburgh, and other production-friendly locations.On top of lost wages, Klowden said delayed films, including Warner Bros.' ""Dune"" sequel, and cancelled programming, such as Amazon's ""A League of Their Own,"" will also heavily contribute to losses.""Hollywood's been very heavily concentrated in terms of production activity, so anybody who does film and TV — Disney (DIS) is a classic example of that — along with Warner Bros. (WBD), Universal (CMCSA), and even at this point [Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL)] they're all getting affected,"" he said. ""But we don't see it as much on their bottom line as we do on the workers.""Story continuesStill, that doesn't mean these companies won't be hit in the future, Klowden warned.""They can put off costs right now. The catch is [as] they delay movies, that means their ability to get the revenue back, to be able to get their expenditures back, becomes harder and harder. They forego revenues and they forego any ability to easily snap back out of this strike the longer it goes on.""'Suits' resurgence highlights strategy shift amid strikesMembers of the The Writers Guild of America picket outside Paramount Pictures on May 3, 2023, in Los Angeles. Hollywood productions and promotional tours around the world have been put on indefinite hold as actors and writers are on strike against big studios and streaming services.(Ashley Landis/AP Photo)In the wake of the strikes, streaming platforms have scrambled to fill their content pipelines with strike-immune programming like reality TV, international series, and, in some cases, live sports and news.Recently, USA Networks drama ""Suits"" saw a resurgence on Netflix after the platform acquired the series in June. According to Nielsen, ""Suits"" — which debuted 12 years ago — attracted a record-breaking 18 billion minutes of viewing time in July.""We might break out of what we're seeing in terms of siloing,"" Klowden said, referencing the massive success of ""Suits,"" which was heavily driven by word of mouth in addition to Netflix strategically promoting the show on its homepage.Other streamers have also hopped on the trend with Warner Bros. Discovery's Max announcing a 60-day deal with AMC that will bring AMC+ programming like ""Fear The Walking Dead"" and ""Killing Eve"" to the platform. WBD already has a licensing deal with Netflix.USA Networks drama ""Suits"" saw a resurgence on Netflix after the platform acquired the series in June. (Courtesy: Shane Mahood/USA Network)Klowden explained the old days of streamers holding on to exclusive content could be over as syndication, or reselling shows to other channels in an effort to revive neglected content, becomes a more lucrative opportunity.""That was essentially the holy grail that people used to talk about,"" Klowden continued, adding syndication was a popular strategy that fueled the creation of channels like TNT and even streamers like Netflix, which held the rights to Paramount's ""Twilight Zone"" before the episodes left the platform in mid-2021.That strategy could speed up the timeline for media consolidation — but most likely only for mid-level companies.""There's only so much consolidation that can really happen and still be effective and efficient,"" he said, adding, ""I think you'll see more on the mid-size where companies look at it and say their financials are under pressure ... you might see more acquisitions that way, rather than at the large cap size.""Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

293,ea42567a-7476-3fa6-8939-da8dd2beb0db,UA,2023-08-31,TV anchor had a secret phone for conversations with Under Armour founder Kevin Plank,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tv-anchor-had-secret-phone-130000822.html,1693400400,STORY,['UAA'],"[A court case has uncovered the unusual relationship between Under Armour founder Kevin Plank and MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle—revealing the two communicated at ""all hours"" via a secret phone and email address.According to newly unsealed court documents, the 51-year-old billionaire allegedly shared confidential financial information about the sportswear giant with Ruhle when she was a Bloomberg Television news anchor. He also sought her assistance in countering concerns about declining sales.The duo’s close ties were first reported by the Wall Street Journal in 2019, but now their relationship—which included trips on Plank's private jet—is under the lens in court.Plank, the current executive chairman of Under Armour, stands accused of providing Ruhle with ""non-public financial information"" about the company.The lawsuit, filed by shareholders in 2017 in a federal court in Maryland, alleges that Under Armour artificially inflated its share price, resulting in losses for them.Shareholders claim that Plank and his associates were aware of a decline in sales and so employed improper tactics to sustain the growth momentum.This allegedly included enlisting Ruhle’s help to undermine a January 2016 report by Morgan Stanley which highlighted the weakening sales data.A spokesperson for Under Armour told Fortune the documents have ""no bearing on the case,"" adding that Plank had ""utilized confidential advice or counsel from a number of outside advisors from different fields of expertise, and that is what these documents show. Furthermore, none of the information was used improperly.""Highlighting that a federal judge in the Southern District of New York has previously ruled against the plaintiffs, the company added: ""The claims asserted by plaintiffs’ counsel are meritless and are being defended vigorously in the ongoing Maryland litigation, which has been pending for more than six years.""Story continuesBloomberg did not immediately respond to Fortune's request for comment.An unlikely confidantPlank has grown Under Armour—founded in 1996—from a moisture-wicking shirt maker for football players into a global brand with approximately $5.9 billion in annual sales and thousands of employees.But the sportswear giant has struggled to move on from a scrappy company culture, having been embroiled in various complaints from strip club visits to inappropriate behavior by executives.Now the latest filings around Plank and Ruhle's relationship raise a host of ethical questions about the boundary reporters must maintain with the powerful people that they cover—and vice versa.Former and current executives reportedly told the WSJ Plank’s use of the jet and his relationship with Ruhle were among the many ways the CEO blurred the distinction between his personal and professional activities.“There are clear lines between the company and Mr. Plank’s private interests, and he is accountable to the board for this,” Kelley McCormick, Under Armour’s senior vice president of communications told the publication.During a deposition earlier this year, Plank, who stepped down as Under Armour CEO in 2019 before taking the role of chairman, was asked to describe the nature of his relationship with Ruhle.""She's a confidant,"" he responded, according to the WSJ. ""I would give her counsel on her career and she would give me counsel on things I was dealing with that were either banking or media or human nature in relation.""When asked during his deposition about the Morgan Stanley report, Plank said the two “had an understanding of trust.”“She didn’t trade in this, her family doesn’t trade in this. She’s simply giving me input,” Plank said.When Ruhle sat for her deposition, she admitted to taking at least two trips with Plank on his private jet: once from Cannes, France, to New York and another time from New York to Baltimore.When pressed on whether she took the trips as Plank's friend or as a journalist, Ruhle said: ""I was flying on his plane as myself, Stephanie Ruhle. I’m not really in a category as one or the other.”The MSNBC anchor also confirmed that she had three phones: a work phone, a personal phone and a so-called “Kevin Plank phone”.""We were friends and I covered his company,"" the anchor added.Morgan Stanley email chain uncoveredOn January 10, 2016, Morgan Stanley released a report in which it downgraded the rating of Under Armour stock and lowered its price target, citing a slowdown in sales trends.Despite being in a ""quiet period"" that prevented public communication, Plank discussed privately with Ruhle how to dismiss the report, according to documents in the lawsuit.The following day, Ruhle emailed Under Armour's former communications executive Diane Pelkey for data that would contradict the report—and then advised they send it to media outlets.″This content is perfect just in case anyone decides to cover the Morgan Stanley thing—it combats any risk of negativity,” Ruhle wrote in an email littered with typos to the executive, according to the WSJ.Later that afternoon, Ruhle reportedly raised doubts about the data presented in the Morgan Stanley report on Bloomberg.A couple of weeks later, when Under Armour reported positive quarterly results, Plank emailed Ruhle “look at that stock!!!” before allegedly helping her bag an interview with basketball player and Under Armour athlete Stephen Curry.Court documents allege Plank told his communications executive in an email that the Curry interview was “a great thank you for being the only member of media to get UA’s back when [Morgan Stanley] came out against us.”On Feb. 2, Bloomberg posted the interview, which included Ruhle playing basketball with Curry.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

We will discuss the changing dynamics of the dollar and how it has impacted different industries. You can skip our detailed analysis and head straight to the 10 Most Expensive Countries in the World To Live In.Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic took to rest, the world has resorted to talking more and more about the economic implications the pandemic has left the world to deal with. The uncertainty that comes with the current economic status causes alarm to economists. As per a report by the World Economic Forum, Asia is among the fastest-growing regions in the world post-pandemic. China is expected to lead economic growth in the region, with 97% of economists predicting moderate growth. Compared to Asia, the economic outlook for Europe is particularly on the rough side. However, more evidence is required to suggest whether the region will face weak economic growth. Only 6% of respondents expected weak growth in Europe, a significant improvement from 68% of economists suggesting weak growth in January 2023. However, global economics is more complex and the strengthening of the US dollar has had a greater impact than expected. What is Happening With the Dollar?Since last year, the dollar has gained immense traction in the world. As a global currency reserve, the dollar has been in high demand by countries and the general population. However, the volatility and uncertainty surrounding global economics is a cause of alarm to economists.  The strengthening dollar ultimately has widespread implications for other economies, especially emerging markets. The US dollar particularly makes these economies cheaper for citizens. For instance, a strong dollar will indefinitely make it cheaper for people to buy goods abroad. The currency dynamics immensely benefit people traveling to other parts of the world from the United States. As of last year, there have been various reports of Europe being considerably cheaper for US citizens. Story continuesFor instance, if we look back to 2022, a report by Bloomberg published on May 22, 2022, suggested that with the dollar rising, it is the best time for Americans to take trips to other parts of the world, especially Europe. The dollar rose to new heights last year. As a foreign currency reserve, the dollar is a safe option. Additionally, the Russia-Ukraine conflict was a major blow to the Euro. Russia is a major trading partner in the region. Therefore, any conflict in the country would have significant repercussions on the value of the Euro. To cater to the declining value of the Euro in 2022, Europeans turned to purchasing the dollar as a haven. Lastly, rampant rate hikes by the Fed added to the strength of the dollar. The economic policies of the United States have boosted the value of the dollar globally. Moreover, as of last year and early 2023, economists predicted that the Fed will continue to increase interest rates and contribute to a greater global demand for the dollar.However, 2023 has only brought significant changes to the global economy. On August 30, Reuters reported that the dollar's strength against the Euro was short-lived. On Wednesday, the dollar dropped to a two-week low against the Euro. Such has made traveling to Europe more expensive, crushing the hopes of people who had already booked a summer Euro trip hoping for a cheap vacation. With this recent update, experts have begun to wonder whether the Fed will further increase interest rates, as opposed to the current pattern. According to experts, there is a 91% chance that the drop in the dollar marks the conclusion of the tightening cycle by the Fed. As global economic conditions continue to change, it has become increasingly difficult to predict economic outcomes. Therefore, we can not assess whether the US dollar will continue to rise or face a major decline in value towards the end of 2023. How Do Companies Win Against the US Dollar?The uncertainty concerning the dollar has hardly hit US companies catering significantly to the overseas market. Multinational corporations, with most of their market located outside the United States, tend to suffer the most when the dollar is volatile.However, the outlook for multinational corporations is not all bleak. Companies like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) have been standing strong against rising prices and declining global demand. On July 26, Reuters reported that the company forecasts an increase in organic revenue growth of 8-9% for the fiscal year 2023, despite an increase in the average beverage price by 10% and declining demand in North America by 1%.The Coca-Cola Company's (NYSE:KO) success tells another story. Companies like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) heavily invest in ancillary projects, ensuring they stay in demand for longer. On May 25, the company reported a partnership with global donors and the African government to improve the healthcare system in Africa systematically. Project Last Mile is focused on providing and distributing life-saving medicines to everyone in Africa. Engaging in such projects eventually gains traction for a company, reducing the price elasticity of demand, as is the case for The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).Additionally, Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) announced fourth-quarter results for the fiscal year 2023 on July 28. The company reported earnings per share of $1.37 and outperformed estimates by $0.05. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $20.55 billion, up 5.32% year over year and ahead of revenue consensus by $566.59 million. The financial results for the business looked strong against the dollar. The company reported growing organic sales in all its product categories. Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer stated:“The April-June quarter provided a very strong finish to fiscal year 2023 – top-line growth, bottom-line growth, and cash generation. The team met or exceeded our going-in plans for sales, earnings, and cash in a difficult operating environment and despite significant cost headwinds. As we look forward to fiscal 2024, we expect to deliver strong organic sales growth, EPS growth and free cash flow productivity – each in-line with our long-term growth algorithm, despite continued macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges. We remain committed to our strategy – a focus on daily use categories where performance drives brand choice, superiority (of product, package, communication, go-to-market execution and value), productivity, constructive disruption, and an agile and accountable organization structure and culture – all in pursuit of sustainable, balanced growth and value creation.”Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) reported its second-quarter results for the fiscal year 2023 on July 28, 2023. Like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), the Colgate-Palmolive Company also experienced positive returns this quarter compared to the previous year. The company's revenue for the quarter jumped 7.54% year over year and amounted to $4.82 billion, surpassing analyst estimates by $125.85 million. The company reported an EPS of $0.77 and beat expectations by $0.02. As stated by Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer:“We are pleased to have delivered another quarter of strong top-line momentum along with an increase in profitability. Net sales increased 7.5% and organic sales grew 8.0%. Gross profit margin, operating profit margin, operating profit, net income, earnings per share and free cash flow all increased versus the year ago quarter. Our strong results this quarter and in the first half add to our confidence that we are executing the right strategies to deliver on our updated 2023 financial targets, drive cash flow and generate long-term value for our stakeholders.”These statements by the chairman of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) and CEO of Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) indicate the need for companies to constantly enhance their product portfolio, invest in innovative ideas, and make calculated decisions.Now that we have discussed the implications of the US dollar on the global market, let's assess the 35 most expensive countries in the world.35 Most Expensive Countries in the World To Live InOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the 30 most expensive countries in the world to live in, we ranked countries based on their cost of living index for mid-year 2023. The numbers were extracted from Numbeo and are ranked in ascending order. 35 Most Expensive Countries in the World To Live In35.

Once a major burden to its economy, the sanctions mean little these days to Tehran, thanks to the little enforcement by the Biden administration. Iran’s crude production and exports have both been growing steadily the past two years to the consternation of the Saudis and Russians, who jointly steer OPEC+, the broader alliance of oil producers consisting of 23 countries.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude settled up $2, or 2.5%, at $83.63 per barrel. Week-to-date, the U.S. crude benchmark is up 4.8% after a combined drop of some 4% over two prior weeks and an earlier rally of 20% over seven weeks.London-traded Brent settled up $1, or 1.2%, at $86.86 per barrel. Brent rose 2.8% on the week, after a combined 2.3% drop over two weeks. Prior to that, the global crude benchmark rose for seven weeks in a row, gaining a total of 18%.“It's not entirely clear what Novak is referring to here but he said that Russia agreed with OPEC+ of further actions,” Adam Button, a commentator on oil, said on the ForexLive forum after the latest jump in crude prices. “He might be referring to an extension of Russian cuts or a larger OPEC deal.”Story continuesFor context, the Saudis, producing oil for years at below capacity to choke the market into paying higher prices, announced an additional million barrels per day cut from July which they seem determined now to carry through into October at least. The Russians, who just a few months ago seemed happy to sell their oil at whatever price they could get for a barrel to sustain their Ukraine-war-damaged economy, have joined the Saudis now in trying to squeeze the market.Until Thursday, the restart of the oil rally had been relatively slow, with crude prices gaining modestly on most days, sometimes after volatile trading on demand concerns. The latest session was the first time where it had advanced 2% in a day over the past fortnight, as the Russian threat of production cuts came on top of a sizable third-week-in-a-row tumble in U.S. crude stockpiles.(Peter Nurse and Ambar Warrick contributed to this item)Related ArticlesOil up 2% as Russia extends Saudi game of production threats U.S. crude futures climb over $2 late in sessionCoal miners forced to save for a rainy day by insurance snub]"

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.92bUS$3.24bUS$3.48bUS$3.69bUS$3.87bUS$4.02bUS$4.16bUS$4.28bUS$4.40bUS$4.52bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x4Est @ 7.48%Est @ 5.88%Est @ 4.76%Est @ 3.98%Est @ 3.43%Est @ 3.05%Est @ 2.78%Est @ 2.59% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$2.7kUS$2.9kUS$2.9kUS$2.9kUS$2.9kUS$2.8kUS$2.7kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$28bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.5b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$115bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$115b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$64bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$91b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$73.5, the company appears quite good value at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Colgate-Palmolive as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Colgate-PalmoliveStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Household Products market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDividends are not covered by earnings.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

Last week alone, U.S crude exports were at 4,528M barrels, on top of the 4,258M-barrel shipment noted for the week ended Aug. 18.The net result of the refining runs and crude exports pulled some 10.584M barrels from inventories during the week ended Aug 25, the EIA said. Prior to this, the agency reported a 6.135M drawdown for the week to Aug. 18 and a 5.960M pull for the week ended Aug. 11.On the gasoline inventory front, the EIA reported a decline of 0.214M barrels, after a slide of 1.467M barrels last week. Analysts had forecast a decline of 0.933M for last week.

Discovery (WBD) has named former BBC and New York Times executive Mark Thompson as its CEO. It comes at a time of great change for the media industry. Traditional media companies like Disney (DIS), Paramount (PARA), and Warner Bros. Discovery are seeing their cable businesses decline while they are investing a lot of money in their streaming businesses. Activate CEO Michael Wolf says all of these companies are trying to position themselves for the ""direct-to-consumer"" future and, as a result, they will increase their spending on content. Several of the big streamers have started raising prices. Wolf says thinks that, in the future, viewers are going to ""churn in and out among these services, price might not be the reason that determines it. It's just more about the availability of programming on those networks and streaming services,"" Wolf tells Yahoo Finance Live. When it comes to the Hollywood strikes, Wolf calls the timing of the strikes ""inopportune,"" saying the ""profit pools for programming production are drying up"" and that the ""revenue streams for these shows aren't necessarily settled.""Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: CNN has a new CEO. Warner Brothers Discovery appointing Mark Thompson as chief executive of the cable news network. He previously served as director general of the BBC as well as CEO of the ""New York Times."" Thompson coming to CNN at a critical time for the media industry as cord cutting accelerates and traditional TV struggles to keep up.Here to discuss this and much more, we want to bring in Michael Wolf, CEO of Activate. Michael, it's great to see you here. So let's start with CNN's new appointment for their CEO Mark Thompson. Is he the best candidate for this job, and why?MICHAEL WOLF: He comes with an incredible pedigree and an incredible track record. So between understanding television from the BBC and managing a massive news organization to what he accomplished as the CEO of the ""New York Times"" company, especially in terms of building a subscription base and continuing to expand their users-- now, here's what's happening.Story continuesIronically, up until recently, CNN was the largest news website, roughly about 400 million unique visitors. And just recently, ""The New York Times"" overtook it just by a couple of million. And so I think we're going to see-- it's going to continue to, of course, be a race between those two as long-- as well as others-- MSNBC and Fox News and even the ""New York Post"" and, of course, Yahoo Finance.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, we appreciate you adding that Yahoo Finance in there, Michael. You know, this, of course, comes at a time-- when you think about, especially in the streaming space, there's this real divide that's happening between linear and digital. You're talking about CNN, which we tend to think more as linear. You know, Bob Iger over at Disney is looking at options for ESPN and what to do there. I mean, what kind of shakedown you think is coming when you think about brands like Warner Brothers Discovery as well as Disney in terms of linear and digital?MICHAEL WOLF: Yeah, so part of what we're seeing and what really is driving this urge to merge among these companies is the need to really position themselves in this world, where increasingly, we have fewer and fewer subscribers. We now have 70 million people in 70 million homes in the US that are subscribing to cable.And we expect it-- at Activate, we expect it to go down into roughly 60 in the next couple of years. And at the same time, these streaming services are their big cash drains. They're very deep expenses for the next couple of years. And it's no different how long it took for each of these companies to make their cable networks profitable.So cable networks have been the golden goose. Suddenly, we have something new coming on in streaming. They're all trying to position themselves for this future, this direct-to-consumer future. And I think that-- by the way, despite the fact that the CEOs of these companies say that they're going to cut back on their spending on programming, we think and we see and we forecast that there are expenses for and then their investments in programming are going to continue to be at these levels and, in fact, continue to increase.SEANA SMITH: Michael, that, of course, then brings up the question of pricing when it comes to the streaming side of the business, right? Because we know Bob Iger time and time again has reiterated the fact that he is focusing on profitability for their streaming division. And Disney recently raising prices following a number of their competitors who have done so very recently. How do these media companies-- how are they thinking about price hikes and balancing that with making sure that they don't see a massive increase in churn?MICHAEL WOLF: Well, I mean, it's-- you really hit the nail on the head, which is they're trying to strike that right balance. And so the fact that we've seen some decline in Netflix in the last quarter, really some of that reflects a couple of things. One is price increase but the also the eliminating password sharing. And so you would have thought that would have increase the number of subscribers.So I think that what's the bigger issue is not whether those price can be sustained. But also, they're having a lot of churn. It's very easy to watch a set of shows on Disney+ and then drop it and go to Max and watch it.So it's-- we as a firm, we forecast that by 2026, the average subscriber will have six streaming services. They're just not going to be the same six. They're going to churn in and out among these services. Price might not be the reason that determines it. It's just more about the availability of programming on those networks and streaming services.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I'm surprised at that number, Michael, at six because it feels like-- you know, I was thinking back to the conversation with streaming first launched. It was about the optionality. And you--MICHAEL WOLF: Yes.AKIKO FUJITA: --don't have to pay for these massive cable bundles. And it feels like cable is cheaper when you consider six different subscriptions you have to pay for. It feels like increasingly sports could be one that could make a lot of these places very sticky because it is one that comes up on a weekly basis, maybe not as much churn. I mean, how do you think these streaming services are positioning themselves on sports with that very idea in mind that there is a limit to how many streaming services viewers want to subscribe to?MICHAEL WOLF: Yeah, I mean, precisely, they're-- the-- what we're going to see is that-- and already seeing is that between Apple and Peacock and Amazon and others, they're already getting streaming rights for sports. They're not getting all of it. So you've got Amazon with ""Thursday Night Football"" as well as they're going to do one preseason game and a special game on Black Friday. And we're going to see that all the way through to Apple really locking up Major League Soccer for the next year.So we're going to see those games go back and forth. And yes, it's going to be another reason for people to watch. But you can't get all of the games in the same place. So you're going to have to subscribe to different services. And you're going to have to keep watching them on television in order-- if you're really an avid super sports fan.SEANA SMITH: Michael, we're talking about the media landscape right now. We also have to talk about the strike that's going on, right? Because when we talk about the pressure that so many of these media Giants are facing, it almost seems like from all angles, obviously, the strike is another pressure point here for these companies, for the studios, for the streamers. How much more challenging is the next several months going to be the longer that this strike goes on for? And I guess who is best positioned given the circumstances we're in today?MICHAEL WOLF: Yeah, I'm hopeful that the strike won't last forever. Part of it is that the time is really an opportune. The profit pools for programming production are drying up there. Even though there's a whole set of new shows, there-- they're really at much lower cost levels. And so I'm not sure there's going to be a lot of profit left to distribute.And this-- the other reason why it's in an opportune time is because the revenue streams for these shows aren't necessarily settled. And so the actors and the writers may find themselves in a position where they put their earnings more at risk than less as they want to have a piece of the profits. And the profits may not be there.Interestingly, the last time that one of these strikes took place a lot, last time was well over 10 years ago. And at that point, they were arguing about who got residuals from DVD rights. So the world has changed. And yes, the relationships with writers and actors and artists are going to change. But this is a tough time to be making those demands.SEANA SMITH: And it is a tough time, certainly a tough time for both sides right now. All right, Michael, always great to have you. Thanks so much for joining me.MICHAEL WOLF: Great to be here.]"

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230830668215/en/Comcast Opens Free Xfinity WiFi Hotspots as Hurricane Idalia Approaches (Photo: Business Wire)Comcast has also staged emergency generators and fuel trucks in Augusta, Ga., to support a quick response. The company has brought in additional technical and network restoration teams that are ready to be deployed as the storm’s path becomes clearer.How to get connected:For a map of public Xfinity WiFi hotspots, which are located both indoors and outdoors in places such as shopping districts, parks, and businesses, visit Xfinity.com/wifi. When a hotspot is within range, select the ""xfinitywifi"" network on a device’s list of available networks and launch a browser. Sign-in options will appear for both Xfinity customers and non-customers.Xfinity Internet customers can sign in with their account credentials and they will be automatically connected to Xfinity WiFi hotspots in their range in the future. Alternatively, they can download the Xfinity WiFi Hotspots app and sign in with their account credentials.Non-Xfinity Internet subscribers need to look for the ""Get Connected"" section and agree to the Terms and Conditions to be connected. Non-customers will be able to renew their complimentary sessions every 2 hours.Please note that if a user does not see the ""Accept and Connect"" button, the hotspot he or she is trying to connect to is in a Xfinity customer’s home and is not open to the public.Story continuesIf the weather becomes severe enough, Comcast may send text alerts to customers with information about service interruptions or with tips for restoring their services. Customers can log in to My Account to make sure their mobile phone numbers are added.Here are some helpful tips and safety precautions:Customers should plug TV’s, modems, and cable boxes into a surge protector to shield them from damage in case of lightning or a sudden power outage.Emergency management procedures dictate that electricity must be restored first and Comcast must receive clearance that it is safe for our crews to begin any restoration work. Should customers experience a loss of service due to a power outage, local power must first be restored before Xfinity video, phone or internet services can begin working again.If customers have electricity but not Xfinity services, Comcast recommends restarting or resetting devices, including wireless gateways, modems, routers, and cable boxes.In some cases, customers may have power back but not their Xfinity services because commercial power has not been restored to our network in that area.Customers should always stay clear of downed power and cable lines in the interest of safety.Customers should forward a home phone number to a mobile phone number so that they can receive emergency calls, even if they are not home.Tips for Comcast Business customers:Download the Comcast Business App and enable Be Anywhere to allow another device to make calls with a business’s Caller ID.Enable Call Forwarding so business calls can be received on mobile devices.Check that the battery backup is working so Voice Services will still be available during a power outage.Make sure Connection Pro services are set up correctly.

Industry watchers say that the ""double whammy"" work stoppage has already had serious economic implications, similar to the last writers' strike.According to estimates from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., the 2007-2008 strike cost the Los Angeles County economy a whopping $2.5 billion. That likely will double this time around.Kevin Klowden, chief global strategist at the Milken Institute, estimated the current strikes will soon cost the national economy $5 billion-plus, upwardly revising his previous estimate of $4 billion. He explained that the work stoppage will impact other businesses besides production, including restaurants, catering companies, trucking agencies, and dry cleaning businesses, among many others.""The main thing we're really factoring into it is the lost wages,"" Klowden told Yahoo Finance Live in an interview on Tuesday. He emphasized it's not just the industries in California that will be impacted, but also industries in New York, Atlanta, Albuquerque, Pittsburgh, and other production-friendly locations.On top of lost wages, Klowden said delayed films, including Warner Bros.' ""Dune"" sequel, and cancelled programming, such as Amazon's ""A League of Their Own,"" will also heavily contribute to losses.""Hollywood's been very heavily concentrated in terms of production activity, so anybody who does film and TV — Disney (DIS) is a classic example of that — along with Warner Bros. (WBD), Universal (CMCSA), and even at this point [Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL)] they're all getting affected,"" he said. ""But we don't see it as much on their bottom line as we do on the workers.""Story continuesStill, that doesn't mean these companies won't be hit in the future, Klowden warned.""They can put off costs right now. The catch is [as] they delay movies, that means their ability to get the revenue back, to be able to get their expenditures back, becomes harder and harder. They forego revenues and they forego any ability to easily snap back out of this strike the longer it goes on.""'Suits' resurgence highlights strategy shift amid strikesMembers of the The Writers Guild of America picket outside Paramount Pictures on May 3, 2023, in Los Angeles. Hollywood productions and promotional tours around the world have been put on indefinite hold as actors and writers are on strike against big studios and streaming services.(Ashley Landis/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)In the wake of the strikes, streaming platforms have scrambled to fill their content pipelines with strike-immune programming like reality TV, international series, and, in some cases, live sports and news.Recently, USA Networks drama ""Suits"" saw a resurgence on Netflix after the platform acquired the series in June. According to Nielsen, ""Suits"" — which debuted 12 years ago — attracted a record-breaking 18 billion minutes of viewing time in July.""We might break out of what we're seeing in terms of siloing,"" Klowden said, referencing the massive success of ""Suits,"" which was heavily driven by word of mouth in addition to Netflix strategically promoting the show on its homepage.Other streamers have also hopped on the trend with Warner Bros. Discovery's Max announcing a 60-day deal with AMC that will bring AMC+ programming like ""Fear The Walking Dead"" and ""Killing Eve"" to the platform. WBD already has a licensing deal with Netflix.USA Networks drama ""Suits"" saw a resurgence on Netflix after the platform acquired the series in June. (Courtesy: Shane Mahood/USA Network)Klowden explained the old days of streamers holding on to exclusive content could be over as syndication, or reselling shows to other channels in an effort to revive neglected content, becomes a more lucrative opportunity.""That was essentially the holy grail that people used to talk about,"" Klowden continued, adding syndication was a popular strategy that fueled the creation of channels like TNT and even streamers like Netflix, which held the rights to Paramount's ""Twilight Zone"" before the episodes left the platform in mid-2021.That strategy could speed up the timeline for media consolidation — but most likely only for mid-level companies.""There's only so much consolidation that can really happen and still be effective and efficient,"" he said, adding, ""I think you'll see more on the mid-size where companies look at it and say their financials are under pressure ... you might see more acquisitions that way, rather than at the large cap size.""Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

With 70% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Devon Energy. View our latest analysis for Devon Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Devon Energy?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Devon Energy does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Devon Energy's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Devon Energy. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 12%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.5% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Devon EnergyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Devon Energy Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$200m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 30% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Devon Energy. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Devon Energy   (of which 2 don't sit too well with us!) you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

From ‘cigar butt’ investing to buying ‘wonderful businesses,’ here’s how he led a 3,787,464% return at Berkshire Hathaway",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-just-turned-93-160145468.html,1693411305,STORY,"['BRK-A', 'ORCL']","[Warren Buffett just turned 93 years old. It’s a moment when it’s worth taking stock. The Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO has made quite a name for himself in his 70-plus-year career as a professional investor, taking what was once a struggling textiles business and turning it into one of the largest conglomerates in history, worth nearly $800 billion.Alternately called the Sage or the Oracle of Omaha for his prescient stock-picking, Buffett has helped Berkshire acquire scores of businesses since he took the reins of the firm in 1965—from the insurance giant Geico to the largest railroad company in the U.S., BNSF Railway—and routinely turned incredible profits from his stock picks.As a result, from 1965 to the end of 2022, Berkshire’s stock soared 3,787,464%, far outperforming the S&amp;P 500’s 24,708% rise. That means if you invested $10,000 in Berkshire in 1965, you would have had $378 million by the end of last year. Along the way, Buffett has learned a few hundred things about the difference between ""cigar butts"" and what's actually worth the investment.Berkshire’s historic rise has made Buffett the seventh-richest man on the planet, but the Oracle famously prefers to live a relatively modest lifestyle with his wife in Omaha, and he pledged to give away his entire $120 billion fortune to charity when he co-created the Giving Pledge with his close friend Bill Gates.Buffett is certainly a unique, once-in-a-generation talent, but like anyone he needed some help to become the man he is today.Back in the early 1950s, he got that help from “the father of value investing,” Benjamin Graham. Buffett had the great fortune of working at Graham’s investment firm, Graham-Newman Corp., in the mid ‘50s after being inspired by his seminal book on value investing, The Intelligent Investor, in 1949.Graham taught Buffett to focus on the fundamentals of the businesses that he was buying into and to always invest with a “margin of safety”—that meant finding stocks that traded at a discount to their intrinsic value. Those weren't the only lessons, of course. Buffett has said that Graham taught him the importance of being willing to stand out from the crowd, even if it makes you look foolish, and, perhaps more importantly, to be endlessly curious and generous.Story continues“Walter Lippmann spoke of men who plant trees that other men will sit under. Ben Graham was such a man,” Buffett wrote in a 1976 tribute to Graham after his death.Buffett has always taken Graham’s advice as gospel, whether it was about life or investing, and that was particularly evident in the beginning of his career.The cigar butt startAs a value investor, Buffett spent his youth looking for used cigar butts on the street. Not literal cigar butts, of course. Before starting Berkshire, the Oracle of Omaha was known for seeking out dying businesses that most investors hated. Back in those days, Buffett wasn’t looking for a great company as he does today, he was looking for a bargain.Here’s what he told Berkshire shareholders about the philosophy in 1989:“If you buy a stock at a sufficiently low price, there will usually be some hiccup in the fortunes of the business that gives you a chance to unload at a decent profit, even though the long-term performance of the business may be terrible. I call this the ‘cigar butt’ approach to investing. A cigar butt found on the street that has only one puff left in it may not offer much of a smoke, but the ‘bargain purchase’ will make that puff all profit.”Buffett has since called this cigar butt approach to investing “a mistake.” In a lecture at the University of Georgia in 2001, he told students that “although you can make money doing it … it’s so much easier just to buy wonderful businesses.”However, there was one investment from this era that, arguably, turned into Buffett’s greatest. In 1965, while looking for cigar butts, Buffett came across a struggling, but undervalued New England textiles business called Berkshire Hathaway and purchased 49% of the company. Upon taking ownership and surveying the business he realized the purchase was “a mistake,” calling it “the dumbest stock he ever bought.” Berkshire’s old textiles business was slowly dying, so instead of wasting cash trying to prop it up, Buffett began putting the firm’s cash to work in the stock market. Over time, this helped Berkshire move beyond textiles and slowly develop into the international mega conglomerate it is today.A stock market masterBuffett may have got his start looking for cigar butt stocks, but he has since become known for his preference to buy and hold quality companies for the long term. It’s a strategy that has led to some astounding gains over the past few decades.Two of his most famous investments, in Coca-Cola and Apple, are indicative of the changing strategy over the years. Buffett turned from searching for bargains to looking for “wonderful businesses” as Berkshire grew in size because he found it increasingly difficult to find enough cigar butt stocks to turn a reasonable profit.“It was not going to scale,” Charlie Munger, Buffett’s long-time right hand man at Berkshire, told Yahoo Finance of the cigar butt tactic at an annual conference in 2019.Instead of the old investing approach, which is sometimes called extreme value investing, Munger helped Buffett transition to a focus on buying the best possible businesses. “When he started looking for investment values in great businesses that were temporarily under pressure, it changed everything for the better,” Munger said. “Now we could scale up to the big time.”That brings us to Coca-Cola, perhaps the ideal representation of Buffett’s focus on buying great businesses rather than hidden gems or discarded cigar butts.Buffett, who is known for his child-like diet and sweet tooth, first bought shares of Coke in 1988, and it has long been one of Berkshire’s top holdings. The original investment in the company was $1.3 billion, but Berkshire now receives more than half of that total each year in dividends alone from Coke. In 2022, the conglomerate netted $704 million in dividend income from the soft drink maker, and its holdings are now worth roughly $24 billion.Apple is another example of Buffett’s focus on strong, stable businesses. The Oracle was a bit late to the party when he purchased Apple in 2016. The iPhone was already a dominant force globally and Apple stock had soared throughout the previous decade. But when its share fell in late 2015 and the beginning of 2016, Buffett used it as an opportunity to purchase $36 billion of the company. That investment is now worth over $150 billion.Going all-inWhile Buffett has made a killing buying public equities, he’s also acquired scores of private companies that are critical to the American economy. Berkshire now owns 65 businesses in a variety of industries including the Acme Brick Company, the RV manufacturer Forest Rivers, the insurance giants Geico and Allegheny, the battery maker Duracell, the clothing companies Fruit of the Loom and Garanimals, and even Dairy Queen.But then there’s his famous sweet tooth.One of Buffett’s best investments was the confectioner See’s Candy. The billionaire famously wrote, in a 1994 letter to investors, that he would love to increase his exposure to See's, but hadn’t “found a way to add to a 100% holding."" And in 2019, at Berkshire’s annual conference, he revealed why. The confectioner has made “well over” $2 billion in profits for Berkshire from an original investment of just $25 million in 1972.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

The onset of the pandemic and the recent banking crisis have made these changes even more intense. Following the failure of three major US banks in March this year, worried customers and investors rushed to withdraw their funds. CNN reported that these banks had about $559 billion in total assets, surpassing the $523 billion held by 25 banks that collapsed in 2008 when accounting for inflation.The effects of the pandemic have resulted in financial companies from Wall Street shifting away from New York City and moving to the Sun Belt region. According to Bloomberg, the firms are taking almost $1 trillion worth of managed assets with them. This move is being driven by factors like taxes and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also by practical and cultural reasons. Amid the pandemic, factors like no state income tax, pleasant weather, and business-friendly offers encouraged New York-based hedge fund billionaires to move their businesses to Florida. The report also mentioned that between the beginning of 2020 and the end of March 2023, over 370 investment companies, which is about 2.5% of all US investment firms, shifted their main offices to a different state. These companies collectively managed assets worth $2.7 trillion.In one of the recent developments, shares of several US banks dropped on August 22. This happened after S&amp;P Global, a rating agency, lowered credit ratings for certain regional banks that are heavily involved in commercial real estate. These banks include KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA), and Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE:ASB). This action came after a similar move by Moody's. Both of these rating agencies are making these changes because of an ongoing banking crisis that started in March.Story continuesS&amp;P Global mentioned challenging conditions affecting the banking sector. Here is what the credit agency said in its report:""The sharp rise in interest rates and quantitative tightening deployed since March 2022 to combat high inflation are weighing on many U.S. banks' funding, liquidity and spread income. These factors have also caused the value of banks' assets to fall and raised the odds of asset quality deterioration.""Investing in financial stocks means putting money into the top businesses that offer banking, insurance, credit cards, and various other financial services around the world. Since the financial sector is central to the worldwide economy, it's a smart idea for investors to seriously think about including financial stocks as a significant part of their investment collections. Due to the ongoing issues in the finance industry, the sector is struggling to match the pace of the market. The S&amp;P 500 Financials, which tracks the performance of some of the most prominent finance companies such as Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), is down by 1.11% year-to-date. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 gained 14.44% this year so far.Also read: 12 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy NowInvesting in dividend stocks within the finance sector can be a prudent strategy for income investors.

320,571583f2-644b-38a1-beaa-29476fe798fd,AXP,2023-08-31,"With 65% institutional ownership, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/65-institutional-ownership-american-express-120029209.html,1693483229,STORY,['AXP'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in American Express implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 12 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessEvery investor in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 65% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about American Express. Check out our latest analysis for American Express ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About American Express?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that American Express does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at American Express' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. American Express is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. with 21% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.4% and 6.1% of the stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 12 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of American ExpressWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that American Express Company insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$164m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in American Express. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 21% of the American Express shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.Many find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past.

The key pillars of focus in the Knee and Hip business are poised to drive pricing stability, mix benefits and competitive conversions. An updated financial outlook for 2023 also buoys optimism.Meanwhile, global supply-chain pressures are hurting Zimmer Biomet’s business performance. The company also faces intense competition from its peers in the industry.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has increased 12.2% against the 0.9% fall of the industry and the 12.2% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The leading musculoskeletal healthcare company has a market capitalization of $24.56 billion. The company has an earnings yield of 6.39% against the industry’s -1.89%. Zimmer Biomet surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and was breakeven in one, delivering an average earnings surprise of 4.47%.Let’s delve deeper.TailwindsA Solid Q2 Performance: Zimmer Biomet’s last reported second-quarter performance benefited from the continued procedure recovery, significant traction with new product innovations and the team’s solid execution. The strong performance of the Knee business was driven by the four pillars of focus, centered on a very attractive Persona portfolio, combined with the benefits of the ROSA robotic platform.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company has nearly 40 planned product launches between 2023 and 2025, which are expected to drive near-term growth. A revised outlook for the full-year 2023 induces management’s confidence to grow the company’s top line above market rates.Innovative Hip Portfolio Holds Potential: ZBH has a strong portfolio with ROSA and Hip Insight, which are technology shifts in robotics and mixed reality that are setting up greater adoption and growth of the franchise. Zimmer Biomet’s current flagship product, Avenir Complete primary hip, combined with G7, puts the company in a firm position in the attractive direct anterior and revision submarkets of hip.Story continuesManagement expects an enhanced position, with work being done on a triple taper stem, which will fully round out its direct interior approach portfolio. In addition, the company is set for the upcoming full launch of HAMR, an automated impaction system that creates surgical efficiencies while bringing personalized precision to every patient.Meaningful Pillars Within the Knee Franchise: The business is seeing continued global traction with the powerful combination of the ROSA robotic platform and Persona cementless knee. The Persona Revision provides a meaningful conversion and mix opportunities inside the revision category. It also acts as a powerful tip-of-the-spear product for conversions and primary needs.The overall shift of ZBH’s legacy knee systems to the fully rounded out Persona portfolio is a meaningful mix benefit, which the company is likely to take advantage of. Further, Persona IQ, the world’s first and only smart knee implant, offers surgeons unparalleled data access despite being in a limited launch. The company cites this as an attractive option for patients who want more direct engagement with their care recovery.DownsidesMacroeconomic Challenges Persist: Zimmer Biomet’s operations are exposed to the supply-constrained environment, inflationary pressure, a tough labor market and geopolitical landscape and staffing shortage. Reimbursement headwinds within the restorative therapies business are another downside. Within Sports and Trauma, the company faced acute supply challenges in the second quarter of 2023.A Competitive Landscape: The medical device market is intensely competitive. The orthopedic industry, in particular, is comprised of players like Stryker, Johnson &amp; Johnson's DePuy, Smith &amp; Nephew and Medtronic. ZBH needs to constantly introduce or acquire new products to withstand competitive pressure and maintain its market share.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Zimmer Biomet’s 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has moved up from $7.46 to $7.51 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $7.40 billion.

324,9f6b9118-154c-314b-b8e5-9bfdef8227ec,PNR,2023-08-31,Factors That Make Pentair (PNR) Stock a Lucrative Bet Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/factors-pentair-pnr-stock-lucrative-162800833.html,1693412880,STORY,"['PNR', 'AOS']","[Pentair PNR has been benefiting from pricing actions, cost-cutting initiatives and progress on its Transformation initiatives. The ongoing momentum in the Industrial and Flow Technologies, and Water Solutions segments has helped offset the impact of low volumes in the pool business on its results.Focus on product introductions, acquisitions and investments, which are in sync with its strategy to expand in the areas of pool, and residential and commercial water treatment, will continue to aid growth.Top Zacks Rank &amp; Upbeat Price PerformancePNR currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares of the company have gained 54.7% in a year compared with the industry’s 10.2% growth. The Zacks Industrial Products sector has gained 17% and the S&amp;P 500 composite has risen 13.8% in the same time frame. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Solid Q2 Earnings &amp; Upbeat View for 2023Pentair has reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.03 in the second quarter of 2023, which was higher than the company’s guidance of earnings of 94-96 cents per share. Earnings improved 1% from $1.02 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.Results were aided by the company’s transformation initiatives, improved performances in the Industrial and Flow Technologies and Water Solutions segments. This helped negate the weak performance of the Pool segment due to lower demand in new pools and the ongoing channel inventory correction.The company expects the channel inventory correction in Pool to be completed by the end of the third quarter and gains from the transformation initiatives are expected to accelerate. These factors, along with pricing actions and gains from the Manitowoc Ice acquisition, will help offset the impact of higher costs and low pool volumes on the company’s results.Pentair now expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.75 in 2023, higher than its previous guidance of earnings per share of $3.60-$3.70. The company had reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.68 in 2022.Story continuesUpward Revision in EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for PNR’s earnings for 2023 has moved up 1% over the past 30 days and is currently pegged at $3.74 per share. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings has also seen a northward revision of 2% to $4.23 per share.Demand Prospects Hold PromiseEven though the pool business is currently bearing the brunt of weak demand and ongoing inventory correction, it is expected to eventually pick up. The company estimates that the pool industry in North America is catering to a large installed base of approximately 5.4 million pools, with the average age of these pools being 20-25 years. Around 60% of the industrial demand is for repairing, 20% for major remodeling and 20% for new pools. Pentair is well-poised to gain from these demand trends in the long term. Also, given that half of the installed pools lack any form of automation, the growing preference for more autonomous and energy-efficient pools will benefit the company as well.Strategic Initiatives to Aid GrowthPentair is focused on expanding digital transformation, innovation, technology and brand building. The company has a strong product pipeline. It is also expanding particularly in the areas of pool and residential and commercial water treatment through acquisitions. In July 2022, Pentair completed the acquisition of Manitowoc Ice, a leading provider of commercial ice makers. The strategic acquisition enables the company to enhance and deliver total water management offerings to an expanded network of channel partners and customers. It will expand Pentair’s commercial water solutions platform and drive growth in the food service industry.Pentair has embarked on a Transformation program to accelerate growth and drive margin expansion. The program is structured in multiple phases and is expected to drive operational efficiency, streamline processes, reduce complexity while meeting financial objectives. The company is targeting to make its return on sales to be around 23% by 2025, through the program from the 18.6% return on sales in 2022. It will also be using automation to increase productivity.Solid Balance Sheet Bodes WellOver the past five years, the company has generated a cumulative free cash flow of more than $2 billion. The company has a long-term target to consistently generate free cash flow greater than the 100% conversion of its net income. Its total debt to total capital ratio stood at 0.42 at the end of second-quarter 2023. It has no significant long-term debt maturing in the next five years. Pentair's times interest earned was 6.1.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the Industrial Products sector are Terex Corporation TEX, Astec Industries, Inc. ASTE and A. O.

Furthermore, unemployment is below 4%, the S&amp;P 500 grew roughly 20% this year, and economists surveyed by the Philadelphia Fed stated that GDP is projected to grow by 1.6% in Q3 2023. The rise in interest rates has led to the emergence of the best oil stocks to buy. The consensus among analysts is still headed toward the fact that the economy will end up in a soft landing rather than a recession. Further data from the study resulted in the projections for the annual average level of nonfarm payroll employment to gain at a monthly rate of 288,600 in 2023 and 94,800 in 2024. The recent growth in the economy has brought a wave of optimism for investors, and with the economy gaining momentum, the surge in oil stocks has caught the attention of many. Notably, there are three specific stocks that show strong potential to outperform the market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo here are the best oil stocks to buy at the end of August.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is an American petroleum corporation that manufactures petroleum and explores hydrocarbons in the U.S. and the Middle East.OXY stock is up 4.95% YTD. Analysts have issued 36 “buy” ratings since May, with a median 12-month price target of $66.50 and a range of $57 to $80. The oil and gas industry was valued at $7,330.80 billion in 2023 and is forecasted to grow by over 6% CAGR by 2030. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that oil demand will grow from 55.1 to 56.5 million barrels per day in 2024, and as interest rates are falling, oil prices will rise. This helps make it one of those best oil stocks to buy.Financials for Occidental are well, with 2022 revenue of $36.63 billion up 41.14% YoY. EPS was $0.63, which declined by 81.84% YoY, but a P/E ratio of 10.75 indicates a cheap stock. A gross profit margin of 60.69% signals sustainable profitability and a strong competitive advantage over the long term. Story continuesOccidental is the top producer in the Permian Basin, one of the world’s most abundant reservoirs in the U.S., and has markets including Oman, Canada, and Chile. Furthermore, the company’s exceptional products generated over $50 billion in revenue in the U.S. alone, setting the stage for long-term growth in the construction, healthcare, and automobile industries. Occidental has further achieved remarkable growth under the impressive leadership of CEO Vicki Hollub, owing to strategic alliances forged with countries such as Colombia and the Middle East. Occidental is a ‘buy’ for any investor bullish on the oil market due to its economies of scale, and exceptional products that have alliances with the Middle East and Colombia. Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD)Oil. 3D Illustration. Oil stocks are up.Source: Pavel Ignatov / Shutterstock.comPioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is an oil and gas exploration and production firm that provides energy to communities around the globe. Its leading presence in the resource-heavy Permian Basin makes it an unmatched competitive advantage as it is the area’s largest acreage holder. This abundance allows for lucrative low production costs, which generates strong free cash flow. PXD stock is up 7.74% YTD, and the latest quarter’s earnings are impressive. Revenue of $4.06 billion outperformed expectations by $23.04 million, and EPS of $4.49 beat projections by $0.25. Further, Pioneer’s latest cost of goods sold (COGS) of $2,129 million decreased 25.56% YoY to a higher profit margin. Yahoo! Finance additionally reports 27 analysts holding an average one-year price target of $256.00, with the low being $219.00 and the high being $332.00. In its recent press release, management announced an operations update with promising applications for future profitability. The company plans to up its number of 15,000-foot lateral wells, or wells drilled at a horizontal angle to provide more effective drainage and productivity. This enhancement in “well type” will act as a catalyst for growth as management states it will yield more “capital savings on a per foot basis” and create an “internal rate of return (IRR) that is on average 35% higher” than the current type of well they most commonly use. Moreover, improvement efforts as such signal that management sees potential for Pioneer to grow even further. This helps to make it one of those best oil stocks to buy.The still-growing oil and gas industry is additionally a tailwind for PXD stock amid such operations developments. The market was valued at $664.69 billion in 2022 and is forecasted to grow at a 6.35% CAGR to $1,230.25 by 2032. Diamondback Energy (FANG)3D rendered two black oil barrels on digital financial chart screen with yellow numbers and rising, green, falling, red arrows on black background. Oil stocksSource: stockwars / Shutterstock.comDiamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) is an energy company that focuses on oil production in the Permian Basin. While oil is generally not considered ethical, Diamondback’s ESG pulse is 0.98 out of 1, as it drills in less environmentally important areas and has adequate working conditions.FANG stock is up 12.68% YTD. Yahoo! Finance reports 27 analysts having a mean 12-month price target of $170.96, with the range spanning from a low of $140.00 to a high of $222.00.The oil industry was valued at $6.99 trillion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a 4.3% CAGR to $8.67 trillion in 2027. However, while the industry is growing in the short term, it is important to remember that the world is moving away from oil in the long term.Earnings were down due to a decrease in oil prices. Revenue decreased by 32%, net income decreased by 61%, but net change in cash increased by 70%. While these earnings may look insufficient, this is the norm in this industry as earnings increase and decrease alongside oil prices.  Diamondback is positioned especially well for growth, as it recently acquired Firebird and Lario. It is estimated that these acquisitions can increase cash flow by $570 million. Additionally, because these two companies are also based in the Permian Basin of West Texas, merging operations will equate to a greater economy of scale. Because Diamondback is proving that it is centered around drilling in the Permian Basin, it will not face the same level of protest or regulation as projects like Willow in Alaska. The public relations side of this will become especially critical as Biden seeks to encourage more oil production while damaging the environment as little as possible ahead of the 2024 elections. Given Diamondback’s increasing profitability through profitable acquisitions and its positioning in the face of favorable oil prices, FANG stock emerges as an undervalued buy recommendation for investors. On the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Boston Scientific (BSX) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to BSX for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Boston Scientific's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Boston Scientific's main business drivers.Headquartered in Natick, MA and founded in 1979, Boston Scientific Corporation manufactures medical devices and products used in various interventional medical specialties worldwide. The company has adopted the organic as well as inorganic routes for success.In 2022, Boston Scientific has reorganized its operational structure and aggregated its core businesses, each of which generates revenues from the sale of Medical Devices, into two reportable segments, MedSurg (38.5% of total revenue; 2022 organic growth was 7.7% over 2021) and Cardiovascular (accounting for the rest; 10.1% organic growth in 2022).Within the Cardiovascular segment, the newly formed Cardiology division represents the combined former Rhythm Management and Interventional Cardiology businesses.MedSurg group comprises 3 sub segments, viz. Endoscopy; Urology and Pelvic Health; and Neuromodulation.The company is one of the leading players in the interventional cardiology market with its coronary stent product offerings. Boston Scientific markets a broad portfolio of internally-developed and self-manufactured drug eluting stents including the Promus PREMIER, Promus Element and Promus Element Plus everolimus-eluting stents. In addition, in Europe, it markets the SYNERGY Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System featuring an ultra-thin abluminal (outer) bioabsorbable polymer coating.Story continuesThe company also markets balloon catheters, rotational atherectomy systems, guide wires, guide catheters, embolic protection devices, and diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures, as well as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging systems.Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Boston Scientific ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in August 2013 would be worth $5,129.46, or a 412.95% gain, as of August 30, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 174.55% and gold's return of 32.38% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for BSX.Boston Scientific is registering consistent growth in the legacy business across several geographies even amid numerous macroeconomic issues. Among all other regions, the company is particularly focusing on expanding its foothold in the emerging markets. The Endoscopy business within MedSurg is gaining from strong worldwide demand for its broad range of GI and pulmonary treatment options. Meanwhile, the next generation WATCHMAN FLX is strongly capturing the European market. Strategic acquisitions too are contributing to the topline. The increased 2023 guidance increases investors’ confidence, indicating that the company is well-poised to handle the industry-wise trend of currency headwinds and global inflationary pressure. On the flip side, mounting costs are major concerns. FX headwinds largely offset the company’s performance.Shares have gained 5.38% over the past four weeks and there have been 13 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Vertex’s CF sales continue to grow, driven by its triple therapy, Trikafta/Kaftrio. New reimbursement agreements in ex-U.S. markets and label expansions in younger age groups are driving Trikafta/Kaftrio sales higher, a trend expected to continue in the second half of the year.While CF remains the main area of focus, Vertex is also developing treatments for sickle cell disease (SCD), beta thalassemia (TDT), acute and neuropathic pain, APOL1-mediated kidney disease, type I diabetes and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. It has earlier-stage programs in diseases such as muscular dystrophies.This year is expected to be a catalyst-rich year for Vertex. Several important clinical milestones are expected over the next 12 months in its CF and non-CF portfolio.So far this year, the stock has risen 21.6% against the industry’s 12.8% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVertex is evaluating its CF medicines in younger patient populations and aims to have small-molecule treatments for most people with CF.In the CF franchise, all eyes will be on the triple combination of vanzacaftor, a CFTR potentiator, deutivacaftor, a CFTR corrector and tezacaftor. Vertex is developing the triple combination CF regimen for patients 12 year and older. Vertex has completed enrollment in two pivotal phase III on the triple combination regimen. This new once-a-day combination medicine has the potential to offer enhanced patient benefits than Trikafta. It can potentially treat CF patients who have discontinued Trikafta or other Vertex CF medicines. It can also improve dosing (once daily) and lower the royalty burden. The studies are expected to be completed by the end of 2023 with phase III data readouts expected in early 2024.Additionally, Vertex is developing a mRNA therapeutic, VX-522, in partnership with Moderna MRNA for approximately 5,000 people with CF who cannot benefit from its CFTR modulators. Vertex and Moderna are conducting a single ascending dose (SAD) clinical study on VX-522, after the FDA cleared the investigational new drug application in December 2022. Vertex and Moderna expect to complete SAD and initiate the multiple ascending dose study in 2023.Story continuesMany of its non-CF candidates represent multibillion-dollar opportunities. Six of the programs are past the proof-of-concept stage.Vertex has co-developed a gene-editing treatment, exa-cel, in partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics CRSP, for two devastating diseases — SCD and TDT. Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics have submitted a BLA to the FDA for exa-cel in SCD and TDT indications, with a final decision expected by Dec 8, 2023 (priority review) and Mar 30, 2024, respectively. Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics’ submissions on exa-cel in the European Union and the United Kingdom are under review. Vertex expects exa-cel to be its next commercial launch. Vertex believes exa-cel has the potential to be a one-time functional cure for SCD and TDT patients, with an estimated patient population of approximately 32,000.Investors are paying a lot of attention to pain asset VX-548, which, they believe, has blockbuster potential. VX-548, a novel first-in-class, non-opioid NaV1.8 inhibitor, is being evaluated in two pivotal phase III acute pain studies, one following bunionectomy surgery and the other following abdominoplasty surgery. The pivotal program is expected to be completed in late 2023 or early 2024. Vertex initiated a phase II study of VX-548 in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a form of peripheral neuropathic pain, in 2022. The neuropathic pain study is also expected to be completed by the end of 2023.

The Nasdaq Composite Index in particular went from a 34% loss in 2022 to a 29% gain so far this year. Yet even with all the major indexes trading higher than they were at the start of the year, The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500, and the Nasdaq are all well below their all-time highs of 2021. That suggests investors can still readily find no-brainer stocks to buy if they’re willing to look. And it doesn’t take a lot of money to make money anymore.Thanks largely to Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD), the online brokerage popular with millennials and Gen Z investors, virtually all online brokerages have eliminated the friction costs of buying and selling stock. You can trade now with no fees imposed. If you have only $600 to invest, all of that money can now be put to work. The following three stocks are no-brainer stocks to buy now.Altria (MO)Altria office sign in Virginia capital city tobacco business closeup by road streetSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.comCigarette smoking is in a secular decline, but Altria (NYSE:MO) remains a solid stock to buy-and-hold for the long term. The tobacco giant still holds sway because of its tremendous pricing power. Economists call it price elasticity. No matter how much Altria raises prices, most smokers still buy its cigarettes. It notes that unlike other industries, its business is not impacted by inflation. Altria, of course, owns the dominant U.S. brand Marlboro. Although rising prices have caused a number of smokers to trade down to discount brands, Marlboro still commands a 42.1% share of the market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIt also recently completed the $2.7 billion acquisition of NJOY, the third largest electronic cigarette manufacturer. As the industry prepares for a post-combustible cigarette future, Altria will have a significant role in this new phase of growth. And while marijuana has been more of a hindrance than tailwind, Altria also owns a 41% stake in Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON). Should marijuana ever be legalized nationally in the U.S., the tobacco company will have a vehicle to drive future growth.Story continuesAltria pays a dividend yielding 8.8% annually, and trades at a deeply discounted eight times the free cash flow (FCF) it generates.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX)Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) logo visible on display screenSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comBiotech Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) is another one of the no-brainer stocks to consider despite considerable risk.We’ll get the rough stuff out of the way first. Buying Vertex means you’re buying a stock very narrowly focused on treating one disease, cystic fibrosis (CF). The biotech told investors it expects to generate between $9.7 billion to $9.8 billion in revenue this year, all of which comes from its four approved CF therapies. But Vertex is also the 800-pound gorilla in the space. It treats more than two-thirds of the approximately 88,000 people with CF in North America, Europe and Australia.Importantly, Vertex has a robust pipeline of drugs in trials that will expand its portfolio. The biotech is also investigating therapies for sickle cell, anemia, diabetes, kidney disease and muscular dystrophy.Like Altria, the biotech exhibits marketplace pricing power. That gives it flexibility to meet customer demand based on ability to pay. With 70% of its operating expenses going to research and development, it needs to recoup profits to continue creating new therapies. It offers flexible options so that patients globally have access to its medicines.Vertex isn’t a cheap stock, but it is one with a lot of cash on its balance sheet, $11.2 billion at last count, and always adding more. It’s one that will keep growing for years to come.Walmart (WMT)Walmart (WMT) logo on a store frontSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comRetail king Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is a rather dull stock compared to the other two on the list. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t warrant a closer look.Comparable store sales in the second quarter rose 6.4% year-over-year. E-commerce sales growth was more than double those of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), 24% compared to 11%. That means it is taking market share from its online rival. It may also be surprising to learn Walmart has an extensive advertising business. Its digital platforms offer extensive reach for advertisers to consumers. It grew 35% in the second quarter. The number of advertisers on its platforms grew 60% from last year. Walmart also generated $9 billion worth of FCF last quarter.Like Vertex, the retailer’s stock is not cheap. It goes for 22 times forward earnings, four times its estimated earnings growth rate, and 35 times FCF. Yet it’s a solid, consistent producer that pays a healthy dividend yielding 1.4% annually.On the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in MO stock.

(Operator Instructions). I would now like to hand the conference over to Sue Perram, Vice President, Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.Susanne J. PerramThank you, and good morning, everyone. I would like to thank each of you for joining us today for Brown-Forman's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Lawson Whiting, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Leanne Cunningham, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and except as required by law, the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise. This morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the first quarter fiscal year 2024 in addition to posting presentation materials that Lawson and Leanne will walk through momentarily. Both the release and the presentation can be found on our website under the section titled Investors, Events and Presentations. In the press release, we have listed a number of the risk factors you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial condition and results of operations, are contained in the press release and investor presentation. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Lawson.Story continuesLawson E. WhitingThank you, Sue, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be able to speak to you today about Brown-Forman's first quarter results for fiscal 2024. Before we get into the details of the quarter, there are a few key drivers of our first quarter results that you will hear about repeatedly throughout this call. First, the rebuilding of distributor inventories, primarily in the United States, in the prior year period had a significant impact on our first quarter results. As you will recall, this rebuilding in the prior year occurred as a result of supply chain disruptions. If you reference Schedule D in today's earnings release, it will provide you with additional information to put this quarter into better context. Second, the timing and phasing of our operating expenses had an impact on our first quarter operating income as we launched and acquired new brands while also investing in our existing portfolio. As you can surmise from our full year guidance, we expect this to moderate as we continue throughout the rest of the fiscal year. And finally, and most importantly, we believe the health of our brands and our business remain strong as evidenced by consumer takeaway trends. We continue to be confident that we have the best portfolio and the best people in the market, and it's this confidence that allows us to reaffirm our full year outlook for fiscal 2024. With this backdrop, let me quickly walk you through our high-level results for the first quarter. From a top line perspective, our reported and organic top line results were below our longer-term historical trends. Much of this is being driven by the comparison to the strong double-digit top line growth in the first quarter of last year. You'll recall our glass supply significantly increased in the spring and summer of 2022 which allowed us to rebuild distributor inventories, which created a strong comparison for the first quarter of this fiscal year. Our gross margin expanded with favorable price mix and the removal of the U.K. tariffs. These gains more than offset increased input costs, foreign exchange headwinds and the impact of our recent acquisitions. In the first quarter, we also made significant investments behind our brands and our people which resulted in a year-over-year decrease in reported and organic operating income. Now let's go into each of the P&amp;L items a little bit more. I'll briefly provide a few more details on the top line from a brand perspective, and then I'll turn it over to Leanne who will share additional insights on our geographic performance as well as other financial heights before closing with some comments on our fiscal 2024 outlook. Our reported net sales growth increased 3% with organic net sales growth increasing 2% after adjusting for the recent acquisitions and the negative effect of foreign exchange. Organic net sales growth in the quarter was driven by the continued growth for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple and El Jimador. This growth was partially offset by declines related to the estimated net decrease in distributor inventories, particularly for brands such as Woodford Reserve, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire and Gentleman Jack as we cycled against the significant inventory rebuild in the first quarter of last year. In total, we estimate that the net change in distributor inventories had a 6% impact on our overall top line results. If you were to factor in the net change in distributor inventory, our net sales growth would have actually been above our long-term growth expectations. As I mentioned earlier, we believe our business is strong. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey led our growth as organic net sales increased 2% after lapping organic net sales increase of 21% in the prior year period. We believe the consumer demand is normalizing and estimate that the growth rate on Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in the first quarter was lower by approximately 2 percentage points due to the net change in distributor inventory. Growth continues to benefit from our pricing strategy as well as our revenue growth management initiatives. Second, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple grew organic net sales more than 50% as we lap the impact of the glass supply constraints in the year ago period, and we're better able to meet consumer demand, particularly in markets such as Brazil. The brand also benefited from a strong launch in South Korea. Demand for Tequila, particularly in the U.S., remains strong. El Jimador was the third largest contributor to overall company organic growth, increasing organic net sales 26%. We continue to see strong momentum in our ready-to-drink portfolio, which grew organic net sales 5%. This was led by the launch of Jack Daniel's in Coca-Cola and the continued growth of new mix which performed well as the RTD category in Mexico is growing and the brand is increasing share. The growth was partially offset by planned declines in Jack &amp; Cola as the market's prepared for the Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola launch. I know there's been tremendous energy and curiosity around our new Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola RTD. So I thought I'd share a bit more detail on the continued launch. Impressively, the global volume has already grown to 1.8 million cases across 11 markets, led by the U.S. and Japan. As we've shared before, some markets are being led by Brown-Forman, whereas others are being led by the Coca-Cola Company. Therefore, this total case volume is not reflected in our 9-liter depletion results. We expect that this total volume will continue to grow as we plan to expand from 11 to 30 markets by the end of calendar 2024. In the U.S., the Jack Daniels and Coca-Cola RTD launch has been the most successful launch in Brown-Forman history, having achieved the second highest level of off-premise distribution across the portfolio only behind Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. Today, it has reached over 2% of the RTD categories value share. And overall, we're pleased with the initial launch of this iconic product and believe our success is driven in part by the strong investment behind the launch including significant investments in broad-reach media, events and trade execution. As the launch evolves, we would naturally expect this investment to normalize. We're also excited by the brand visibility, the market share gains and the positive feedback from distributors, retailers and most importantly, consumers. I must say, you know you're doing something right when consumers start wearing your spirit brands. And I just saw a picture of the first reported Jack &amp; Coke RTD Tattoo. The loyalty of our Jack Daniel's fans is strong and impressive. The Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola RTD has been a strong addition to the portfolio, which as you know we have been very strategically reshaping over the last couple of decades to focus on premium and super premium brands. We continue to believe this premiumization provides us with the best opportunity for long-term growth and value creation. The integration of our newest brands, Gin Mare and Diplomático continues to go well. The brands increased reported net sales in the first quarter by 2%, and we continue to expect these brands will be meaningful contributors to our long-term growth. Also as a part of this portfolio evolution, we announced the sale of Finlandia Vodka earlier in the quarter. Finlandia has played an important role in the global growth of Brown-Forman since it joined our portfolio fully in 2004, and we appreciate the many talented employees who worked hard over the 2 decades to build the brand. We know this brand will continue to evolve in the capable hands of Coca-Cola HBC when the sale closes in the second half of the 2023 calendar year. Before turning the call over to Leanne, I'd also like to add some additional perspective on our gross margins and operating expenses. In the first quarter of 2024, our reported and organic gross profit increased 5%, both ahead of the respected top line growth rates. While we experienced some headwinds in the form of higher input costs and the negative effect of foreign exchange, they were more than offset by the tailwinds of favorable price/mix, lower supply chain disruption related costs and lower tariff-related costs due to the removal of the U.K. tariffs on American whiskey. This resulted in 90 basis points of gross margin expansion in the quarter. We continue to be focused on the execution of our long-term pricing strategy and believe the health and relevance of our brands, supported by our continued brand-building investments will allow us to continue to achieve our strategic priorities. Our brand-building investments were evident in our first quarter as organic advertising expenses grew 14%. This was largely due to the timing of our increased spend to support the launch of the Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola RTD, which, as I mentioned earlier, is significantly skewed to first few months of our fiscal year as well as increased investment for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. We also continue to invest behind our people. Organic SG&amp;A investment increased 12%, driven primarily by higher compensation-related expenses related to organizational changes including our route to consumer expansions, which we believe will support Brown-Forman's long-term success. In summary, we're off to a good start in fiscal 2024 and remain optimistic that we can achieve our full year goals. While consumer demand for our brands begins to reflect a normalization back to our more historical trends, we expect to continue to benefit from our long-term pricing and revenue growth management strategies as well as a more normalized cost environment. We're still operating in a highly dynamic world. Yet we have remained agile, focused and committed to the long-term growth of our people, our brands and our business. We take pride in our ability to deliver consistent and reliable growth year after year, decade after decade, and we believe this tradition of excellence will continue in fiscal 2024. With that, I'll turn the call over to Leanne and she'll provide more details on our first quarter results.Leanne D. CunninghamThank you, Lawson, and good morning, everyone. As Lawson mentioned, I will provide additional details on our geographic performance, other financial highlights as well as our fiscal 2024 outlook. From a geographic perspective, collectively, our emerging international markets continued to deliver very strong double-digit organic net sales growth, driven by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, particularly in the United Arab Emirates due to increased distribution and strong consumer demand in Türkiye, where the premium whiskey category is accelerating. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey led by Türkiye as well as Brazil, where the brand is returning to normal levels of supply and new mix, which continues to grow strong double digits in Mexico, where the RTD category is accelerated, and we are gaining share. As the international airline travel and cruise business continued to return to more normalized growth levels, the travel retail channel grew organic net sales 9%, led by higher volumes of Woodford Reserve. Our business in this channel continues to remain above pre-pandemic levels. Organic net sales for our developed international markets collectively were flat for the first quarter as growth in the United Kingdom, South Korea and Germany was offset by declines in Australia and Japan. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple was the largest contributor to growth driven by the successful launch of the brand in South Korea. This growth was offset by year-over-year declines for Jack Daniel's RTDs, driven by Australia, where macroeconomic pressures negatively impacted volume growth and the United Kingdom, where we are transitioning from Jack Daniel's and Cola to Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola partially offset the growth in Germany and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, which had strong growth in the United Kingdom, but was negatively impacted by Japan due to an estimated net decrease in distributor inventory where we remain on track for our transition to own distribution on April 1st of this fiscal year. And for the United States, organic net sales decreased 9% as a result of lower volumes due to an estimated net decrease in distributor inventories of 11%, partially offset by higher prices across our portfolio. As Lawson highlighted, in the first quarter, we cycled against the significant inventory rebuild during the same period last year, which was particularly impactful to the United States market as we focused on rebuilding distributor inventory for brands with substantial volume in the U.S., including Woodford Reserve, Gentleman Jack, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire. With the rebuilding of finished goods inventory across the 3-tiered system, we accomplished in fiscal 2023, we believe that distributor inventories have returned to more normal levels. The consumer premiumization trend continued to drive demand for our super premium Jack Daniel's products and partially offset the decline. This included growth from Jack Daniel's Sinatra, our specialty launches such as Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Rye, Barrel Proof and the newest member of our Bonded series, Jack Daniel's Bonded Rye. These products highlight our whiskey credentials and give consumers the opportunity to explore and discover within the Jack Daniel's family while premiumizing the Jack Daniel's family of brands. The Tequila category also continued to experience growth in the United States with El Jimador leading the growth of our Tequila portfolio, delivering double-digit organic net sales growth and the launch of Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola RTD drove a high single-digit organic net sales increase for the Jack Daniel's ready-to-drink portfolio. From a takeaway perspective, the data reflects a normalization as total distilled spirits as well as Brown-Forman delivered value growth in the mid-single digits, driven by growth in RTDs, Tequila and U.S. whiskey. As Lawson shared, the details of our gross margin expansion and operating expenses for the quarter, I will now turn to our operating income. In total, reported and organic operating income decreased 4% and 6%, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, largely driven by the phasing of our operating expense growth, partially offset by our gross margin expansion. These results, combined with a decrease in our effective tax rate and an increase in interest expense resulted in a 7% diluted EPS decrease to $0.48 per share. And finally, to our fiscal 2024 outlook which we are reaffirming. In what has been a highly dynamic operating environment, we continue to be optimistic. We continue to believe global trends will normalize after 2 years of very strong growth. And while consumer demand for our brands is also starting to reflect more historical trends, we expect to continue to grow on this elevated base as a result of our long-term pricing and revenue growth management strategies as well as the addition of 2 super premium brands, Gin Mare and Diplomático to our portfolio, partially offset by a portfolio mix shift to RTDs. We'll also note that due to the timing of the Gin Mare and Diplomático acquisitions, which were in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the contribution of these brands in the first half of fiscal 2024 will only appear in our reported results as the operating activity in this period will be noncomparable year-over-year. Once we lap the acquisitions, the results will then be included in our organic results. While we remain cautious due to the current macroeconomic volatility and the potential impact of inflation on consumer spending, we maintain our belief that the collective strength of our U.S. and international markets, along with the travel retail channel should reflect our longer-term growth algorithm and therefore, reiterate our organic net sales growth expectation for fiscal 2024 in the 5% to 7% range. Today, we have intentionally highlighted the impact of our results from the strong shipments in the year ago period related to the rebuilding of distributor inventories. As a reminder, we began rebuilding distributor inventories in the second half of fiscal 2022 through the first half of fiscal 2023. I also want to remind you of the stronger shipments associated with the launch of Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola RTD in the United States in the back half of fiscal 2023 will have to be lapped in the second half of fiscal 2024. Both are reflected in our guidance. We believe inflation will continue to negatively impact our input cost which will partially be offset by lower year-over-year costs associated with the supply chain disruption we incurred in fiscal 2023. On the topic of input cost I'd like to take a moment here to share some thoughts on the recent changes in the (inaudible) pricing. As we have discussed with you over the last few quarters, given the increase in tequila demand, there was a significant increase in the number of planting several years ago. We have long believed that this would lead to an eventual increase in supply and subsequent decrease in cost, assuming the tequila category remained strong. In the last 3 months, we have seen a significant decrease in agave cost from MXN 28 to MXN 30 per kilo to MXN 16 to MXN 18 per kilo depending on the quality of the agave. While we are very encouraged that prices are finally coming down the benefits to our cost of goods sold will not be immediate for 3 reasons. First, we have finished goods inventory produced prior to the reduction in agave prices that need to be sold. Secondly, more than half of our tequila is aged liquid for expressions such as Reposado and Anejo, which will require some time before it is bottled and sold. For our Blanco expression, we will begin to see a benefit more quickly, in addition and as we have shared, we both grow agave internally and source it externally, and this mix can vary based up our needs and the volume growth by expression. So while the overall agave pricing trend is increasingly favorable, we still believe that inflation will be a headwind for our overall input cost in fiscal 2024. Turning our attention to the full year operating expenses. Our outlook continues to reflect a normalization of incremental advertising spend aligned with our long-term philosophy for advertising spend to be aligned with our top line growth. And SG&amp;A growth is still likely to remain higher than historical averages as we continue to expect higher compensation-related expenses and expenses related to the transition to own distribution in Japan. Based on these expectations, we continue to anticipate organic operating income growth in the 6% to 8% range for the full fiscal year. We also expect our fiscal 2024 effective tax rate to be in the range of approximately 21% to 23% and our capital expenditures to be in the range of $250 million to $270 million for the full year. In summary, we have had a good start to fiscal 2024. The results reflect the continued normalization of consumer demand as well as the comparison against the very strong shipments related to the rebuilding of distributor inventories in the year ago period. They also include the benefit of our pricing strategy and the phasing of our brand investments. While our short-term organic results in the quarter were below our historical trends, we believe our brand and our business are healthy. We remain optimistic as we look ahead to the full fiscal year and are confident in our ability to deliver our near-term goals and our long-term strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. Please open the line for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Nadine Sarwat with Bernstein.Nadine SarwatI'd like to zoom in on the distributor inventory in 2 parts. So the first, could you just quantify how much of the change in distributor inventory was due to the tough comp you highlighted versus how much is due to actual distributor destocking? And if there is a fair amount of actual destocking, what is driving this? And then secondly, are you happy with current distributor stock levels? Or should we be expecting some destocking in the next quarter?Leanne D. CunninghamI'll start with the first part of your question, which is we have talked about the comp that we had in the first quarter compared to the comp that we had in the last -- the first quarter of last year, when we had very strong shipments. And if you go back to our -- what is that point in time with the Schedule C, you would have seen the impact that we had there. So it is partially that we are comping the very strong comp. It's also -- we don't see it as destocking. We have finally gotten our inventory levels back up to what we believe is normal. We've been working on that for a year and bringing you along in that story along the way. What we see now is a change in distributor buying patterns in that other part that you're asking about. And it really comes back to, we continue that with lapped everything related to the pandemic. We now have to comp the things related to supply chain disruption. And as we got into supply chain disruption, before that, we had a very consistent cadence and seasonality of our shipments. But due to the various ways that we determined that we needed to rebuild our distributor inventories, first, prioritizing Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, which would have started in the second half of 2020 and then moving into the first half of 2023, where we were able to prioritize Woodford Reserve, Gentleman Jack and Jack Daniel's flavors, we also prioritized markets for the U.S. first and then Europe and emerging international as we worked our way through the rebuilding of the inventory. So the cadence and timing of our shipments are abnormal from what we would -- our historic norms. So once we're back into a stable inventory position for long enough, we believe that it will become less volatile and would be kind of backed to our historic norms. But again, for us, we have been working for a year to get back up to that normal level of inventory across the world, and we now believe that we're there. So I hope that helps.Lawson E. WhitingLet me try to add on to that, Nadine, a little bit, too, because I do want to make sure everybody sort of -- I get that this is really confusing. And I do make sure reiterate really what Leanne said, that this is a comparison issue though, it is not a destocking, (inaudible) why it's not a destocking because I know that would sort of feel normal at this point. So but if you go -- literally, you can go back 3 years, the summer of 2020 into the fall really into the spring of -- I'm talking calendar years here, not fiscals. We -- it was kind of the boom years. It was the post-COVID, Nielsen numbers were up at like 30% for everyone, and there was just an enormous uplift in the entire industry. You get to the summer of '21, it begins to show up in terms of glass shortages. Really for Brown-Forman, it's seemingly worse than everyone else. But we really began to have those challenges in the summer of '21, and it was a challenge for about 8 months, where we ran global inventories down so low, and that would be going so far as to say the consumer inventory, the retail inventories, layers of distributors have got very low and we had out of stocks all over the place. We are, at that time, working very hard. We're diversifying our glass supply. We're moving bottling lines. We're doing all sorts of things to try to alleviate the glass shortage and it starts to come back right in the spring of '22. And as Leanne said, we prioritized Jack because at that point, the on-premise is opening around the world and we did not want to miss that. But so Jack Daniel's really begins to move and had a huge year in fiscal '22 and had a big year in fiscal '23 also. So Jack gets replenished in the spring and into the early summer, but now you get into the summer of '22, which is the one we're comparing against as we said earlier good for Gentleman Jack, all 3 flavors and basically our whole portfolio really begins to come back online. Now the reason there's not a destock here, this is where it takes -- it doesn't -- you wouldn't think at first, but what was happening because retail inventories were so low that those cases of Woodford and the Gentleman Jack, the entire portfolio got to the distributor warehouse and they were outside the back door in about 20 minutes because the retail environment was so desperate for the product. So our days never crept up. And so we haven't had to take them down. I mean, so it's not a days of inventory issue, and it's not a destocking issue. It's just these comparisons against some crazy quarters. And I'll finish this off, and I don't want to spend that much more time on this. But Q1 of last year, JD, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey was plus 21%, total company was plus 17%. So you're comping against numbers like that. Q2, just a sort of foreshadow everyone is a big quarter, too. So we have another one as we continue to replenish these inventories through Q2 of last year and then the comps get much, much easier. But it's been a volatile ride. It's been a volatile ride for 5 years. But the business is solid. I think if you look at the Nielsen numbers, in particular right now, they're kind of -- they've normalized. But as we said last quarter, normal is good. We've got this business, I think, rolling in the right direction and momentum is good and the volatility, we don't love the volatility, but it is there. We've got a little bit longer to go, but I still argue or not argue, but I'm still venture to say that our underlying business is in pretty good shape.Nadine SarwatAll right. That's very helpful. So just to clarify, I know in the release you called out that it was partially due to the comp issue, are you saying that there is no destocking whatsoever? There isn't a change in distributor buying patterns more caution. This is purely a comp cadence issue? And then if you could just clarify what we should expect for Q2? Thank you.Leanne D. CunninghamYes. So just for clarification, we said partially comping the rebuilding and it's also partially a change in the distributor buying patterns because we are off our normal cadence of shipments our historical trends because of how we chose to prioritize, how we rebuilt our brands and in what markets we were rebuilding those. So over the longer period of time, that will begin to normalize.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.Bryan Douglass SpillaneThanks, operator, and good morning, Lawson, Leanne. So thanks for all of that commentary on inventory. And I guess if I were to sum it up, if you deplete 10 cases, you'll ship 10 cases, right? That's what the plan is built on.Lawson E. WhitingPretty much.Bryan Douglass SpillaneOkay. And then, Lawson, maybe could you just give a little perspective on depletions in the quarter. Volume depletions were up 1%. And so could you just kind of put that in context of -- is that more or less in line with what you were expecting? Maybe what that looks like relative to the industry? There's a lot of focus right now on volume and volume growth and just what's happening with consumption, not just for Brown-Forman, just more broadly across I know our entire coverage, consumer coverage inverse. So just trying to get a sense of, if you could put that into perspective of just what you're seeing in terms of volume consumption trends and whether kind of a 1% to 2% type depletion is maybe what we should be thinking about in terms of Brown-Forman and maybe just the industry for the year.Leanne D. CunninghamI'll add some color to that. And if you look at Schedule B, you can see that really, for the most part, shipments and depletions are aligned except for where you -- we get down to the Jack Daniel's ready-to-drink and that's all about the launch of the Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola in the U.S. So where we are right now is they're in line. Over a longer period of time as shipments over the last few years have been stronger than depletions as we've been working to rebuild inventories. We do expect that depletions would need to come back in line and will exceed our shipments in this year, is what is built into our guidance. So as we think about that, we will continue to update you as we go through the quarters. But right now, we still believe our depletions will be a bit ahead of our shipments as we go through this fiscal year.Lawson E. WhitingI mean, I think, [shared] part a little bit by geography. I mean, the U.S. market, if you look at GDS in Nielsen, it's sort of between 5 and 6, I think. We're right there, too. So the U.S. market, I mean, there's so much noise in the sales numbers, I know. But the U.S. market is in a pretty decent shape. It's definitely being elevated by the RTD piece of things. So I do -- I think it's fair to say the full strength has the -- some of it's comparisons, but the full strength market has softened a little bit. But it's being made up for us for the most part in our international markets, which continue to be really strong in particularly the emerging markets, which really is in its third year of pretty outstanding growth. That growth is coming from a very wide variety of markets, which is always nice also. It's one of the -- while we are so dependent on Jack Daniel's, when you talk about the international markets, there's so much geographic diversification that for instance, South America and Mexico, we've had an outstanding run and the markets in Eastern Europe that are on really strong runs right now. So we've got really strong pockets of growth coming out of some of the most important markets. U.K. is actually in pretty good shape right now, too, and is delivering well. So no, the business is not turning into a 1% growth. No one is thinking of that.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Serotta with Morgan Stanley.Eric Adam SerottaWith regards to the comment that you made in the press release and on the prepared remarks about declines in the old Jack &amp; Cola offsetting growth in the Jack &amp; Coke launch. If I remember correctly, the previous comments that you made were that Jack &amp; Coke was nicely incremental. So just looking for some color as to why they largely offset in the quarter. Was there a timing issue with getting some of the old Jack &amp; Cola out of the channel or was some of this -- a lot of this growth reported on Coke [stocks] and not yours. Any color into that dynamic would be very, really helpful.Lawson E. WhitingYes. So sure, because this is one of the topics but also is a little bit confusing. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the global volumes, it's about 1.8 million cases across the 11 markets. Now the part -- I think most people know, but a reminder, I guess, some markets are led by Brown-Forman and others are being led by the Coca-Cola Company. So that is what is throwing some of our volume numbers off in the spreadsheet. And I think it's what you're referring to. There are markets where Coca-Cola is taking the lead, and I'll use the U.K. as a good -- probably the clearest example. We had a big Jack &amp; Cola business there, and now we are evolving that over to Jack &amp; Coke. So those sales of the actual sales to the Tescos of the world, will not be on our books anymore, it's going to be on the Coca-Cola's books. It doesn't mean the business is going away, it's just we're taking out the cola and replenishing or replacing it with Jack &amp; Coke. And so that's why the numbers look like they're going down, but that's not really the case. In system-wide, they're not. It's just the way that's being reflected on our financial statements. So and I think -- look, I'd also reiterate, I mean, this has been a great launch. It's an iconic product. We are really investing highly behind this launch as is the Coca-Cola Company. And so -- there's been a lot of broad reach media, there's events, there's trade execution, but it's [gone] and it is off to a very strong start. So the increased visibility, I think, is important. The market share gains we're getting. We've got a lot of positive factors. So and it's got 2% of the category. In the U.S. It's got 2% share already, and it's only been 3 or 4 months. So it's off to a good start, and we feel pretty good about it. And I think the long-term potential is exciting and a lot of things that it does for the health of the brand, along with the actual business proposal itself. So it's off to a good start.Eric Adam SerottaGreat. And then just to follow up on the inventory dynamic. Hopefully, this is one of the last questions on it, but you did mention or you did flag rightfully so, I think some tough comp again in the second quarter. My recollection is the rebuild last year in the second quarter was somewhat less than it was in the first quarter. Am I remembering that correctly, and should we expect some sort of moderation in that year-on-year headwind in the second quarter before all things being equal, should be about neutral in the second half.Leanne D. CunninghamYou're remembering that correctly. And what we're talking about as far as comp is the entire company because we had the really strong shipments in the first half of last year. But you are correct that as we get into the second quarter, the shipments and depletions more normalized. But the one thing we have to remember is, and we'll share this with you every quarter as we get into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, then we'll have to lap the launch of Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola in the U.S.Lawson E. WhitingYes. I mean, so it is less. Q2, I said a minute ago, Jack was still up 14% in Q2. So it's still -- we've still got high comps, but it is normalizing.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Andrea with JPMorgan.Drew Nolan LevineThis is Drew Levine on for Andrea. So I wanted to pick up on the U.S. So it looked like underlying trends were up around 2% in the quarter and a loss as you mentioned TDS was up sort of mid-single digit. And the track channels, it looks like even Brown-Forman was stronger than that. So just curious if you can elaborate maybe on what the disconnect there is? And if we just see that sort of delta between the underlying growth rate and what we're seeing in track channels narrow looking ahead?Lawson E. WhitingWell, I mean, those numbers never tick and tie exactly. I think the 5% growth number, which includes Jack and Coke, it's a pretty solid sort of result. The U.S. for like a decade has been between 4% and 5% with the exception of these sort of post-COVID years when it really blew up. Yes, the difference between the -- getting from minus 9 on organic basis and adjusting for the distributor inventories is what gets you to the two. I don't know if I can explain that the between the 2 and 5 necessarily. I don't think it's not a huge number.Leanne D. CunninghamIt's really about the launch of the Jack and Coke and the buying patterns that are in there. So that's creating a lot of noise in the difference between what you would see in our takeaway trends and what's happening in our net sales. So it's just -- again, as we were coming through and the gap was narrowing over the last few quarters, but then as we launched Jack and Coke and it's not all the way through into those takeaway numbers yet. That's creating the gap for us.Drew Nolan LevineAll right. Fair enough. And then if I could ask a follow-up on gross margins. So it looks like costs were about 100 bps headwind this quarter moderated from the fourth quarter, which I think was around [320] bps. And you mentioned you'll be lapping a lot of those supply chain mitigation efforts from last year. So can you maybe offer some more color on gross margin expectations looking ahead? Should we think about gross margins potentially over 60% here going forward? And then on the Blanco or agave situation. Is there any sort of way to think about the internal versus external mix of supply there?Leanne D. CunninghamOkay. Great. Thanks. So I'll start with our gross margin for the first quarter, which was, as you noted, expanded 90 basis points, and it's where our price/mix more than offset the inflation on our input cost. And it was really driven by our price mix, which was plus 250 basis points that was driven by kind of the price increases across our portfolio that was led by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. We also still, and I'll just point this out, is the last time I'll have the opportunity to say it is the last of the benefit from the removal of the U.K. tariffs on American whiskey because they rolled off June 1 of '22. And as you pointed out, the impact of inflation on our input cost has been partially offset by supply chain disruption costs. And then so that's a good segue for me to go into the full year. And again, everything I say here is built into our operating income guidance. But we do expect price mix to continue to be a leader for us this year with our long-term pricing and that new growth management strategies. We'll have the -- from a cost perspective, we'll have the absence of the supply chain disruption costs that will be significantly less to zero in F '24. And we'll still have inflation that will negatively impact our input cost in total, but though at a lower level. And to your question, I'll talk to you about a couple of our key input items starting with agave. And it really is about what we said. We've been talking about this for a very long time. We're really excited that it's finally starting to come down. We've been looking out there for such a long period of time seeing those large number of plantings and waiting for supply to catch up with the demand, and we are approaching and arriving to that now. We just wanted to be clear, though, with everybody, though, like we said in our prepared remarks, we do have finished cases in the supply chain -- in the supply chain and our inventory that need to be sold through, and it varies back to how much inventory we have, but generally speaking, that would be 3 to 4 months depending on SKUs. So well, we need to work through that. And then like we talked about for our portfolio of tequilas, Reposado and Anejo and some of our other expression are aged liquid. So we need to continue to let them, go through their aging cycle before they're bottled and the inventory is sold through. But as we get to expressions like Blanco or any nonaged expressions, we'll see that benefit more quickly. So it's really more about the inventory -- moving through the aged liquid and the finished goods inventory. Though there a bit of it will be the mix, just between what do we need to meet our needs. So we do grow our own internal agave. And but where we have needs, we source on the spot market. As you know, we've been clear with that over time. So balancing all those things, I think I'll just say that in a number of months from now, we're going to continue -- we're going to see a meaningful benefit that will come towards the end of our fiscal '24 and well into F '25, which continues to make us excited about as we look ahead because we know agave and the cost of wood have been our 2 biggest challenges over the last number of years as it relates to our costs. And just to give you a quick update on wood while I'm here, the commodity cost for wood continues to remain high, but we have made a lot of strategic changes to our wood supply chain that is beginning to benefit us and yield those benefits. And we continue to believe, we are going to continue to see those benefits as we move through '24 and then well into the future as well. So we've got that position well. I'll real quickly hit just in case anybody is curious [bringing] for us, which is largely corn. It's below its peak. We're expecting it to be stable but well below kind of the prior year's prices. And with the reduction of natural gas and diesel prices, we will still see a bit of a slight increase in our glass cost but less than what we've had. So all in all, this is built into our guidance. And in total, our cost trends are moving and appeared to be moving in a favorable direction for us. So I hope that helps as you think about gross margin where we were for the quarter and kind of where we're thinking for the full year.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen.Vivien Nicole AzerI was hoping to ask about advertising spending a little bit. Understanding that the growth this quarter is really a phasing, and we heard you loud and clearly on kind of the longer-term aspiration to grow A&amp;P in line with sales. But Leanne or Lawson, I was just curious how you're viewing the evolution of the competitive dynamic in TBA in the United States, for a whole host of reasons, a number of large public beer companies are stepping up their A&amp;P for the remainder of the year. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the potential impact on the sell spirit sales as a result and the potential need for you guys to spend more.Lawson E. WhitingYes. I mean I had not heard that the beer companies were really stepping up that much. But I do think, as you said, the long-term philosophy is to keep it in step with sales. We have significantly increased our [thought of] spending in the last 2 years by well over a $100 million. And so I think we feel pretty good that we have gotten ourselves in a comfortable place. And I think we can manage the P&amp;L from there. I mean, look, the beer companies are struggling. And so they are -- I'm quite sure they are trying to figure out ways to obviously turn their brands around, some brands are in real trouble. And they're going to find a way to try to spend their way out of that. But I don't see us doing that. And I don't really think, at least in the short term, I don't see much of a reaction out of us because of that. Their challenges are sort of unique to them, and we'll continue to [pop] forward the way we have.Leanne D. CunninghamYes. And if you don't mind, Vivien, I'll kind of scope back out, and I'll kind of talk about our full year because I think we need to put what happened in Q1 into context with how we're thinking about the full year. So I'm going to go a little bit broader first, just to say, like I've shared, we've left the impact of the pandemic to a more normalized level, and we're on that elevated base. We're still lapping impact of just supply chain disruption. But the reasons we believe that we're going to deliver our full year guidance is we lap those strong shipments of the rebuilding of our distributor inventory. And like we talked about here today, once we adjust for the estimated net change in distributor inventories that you've seen on Schedule D, we believe our brands and our business are really healthy. So I'll tie that back to how we're investing in it. The investment really kind of came with the launch of Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola in the U.S. We are getting ready to launch that in September, which is just a few days away in Germany. So when Lawson said in his prepared remarks that the majority of that hit in the first few months of the year, is to support those launches, and we're going to get back to that normal trend. But I think it's important to go ahead and say, for our full year, we've got our pricing and our revenue strategies, we've got the addition in the back half of the year. That's not in the first half of the year, which is the impact of Gin Mare and Diplomático that will be moving into our organic results. So we feel good about our top line guidance. We also feel good about the absence of supply chain disruptions and the costs associated with that. We feel good that from a full year perspective, we will invest in our brands in a way that lands with how we planned it, which is in line with top line growth that heavily skewed to the front end. And that, we've said this already, but from an operating expense perspective, SG&amp;A, we continue to invest in our route to consumers. We know that's Japan and also Slovakia for fiscal 2024. And we've got all this built into our guidance. So even with all the noise that we're talking through today, we believe we're going to land our operating income growth at that 6% to 8%.Lawson E. WhitingIn fact one more comment on the beer versus spirits thing more to the RTD world. I think it's just -- and they need to advertise because the malt-based RTD is obviously have gone through a huge amount of (inaudible) in the last few years where they exploded and then they've taken a sharp dive. Most a lot of it is coming at the expense of the spirit-based RTDs which I just -- I found interesting. I don't think any of us predicted that to happen. But I think at the end of the day, the consumer is willing to pay more substantially more for spirit-based RTD, than a malt-based RTD because they taste better. And that is making the numbers get a little bit wild in the world of Nielsen and all the rest of it. But I think we have -- we, not Brown-Forman, but I mean, the industry is showing that the consumer is willing to pay a little bit more for something that tastes really good. And it's been interesting to watch those dynamics.Vivien Nicole AzerAbsolutely. If I could just squeeze in a quick follow-up on Japan specifically. We've observed Brown-Forman evolve the route-to-market process in a number of different markets historically. I've never seen this much dislocation. So can you just help us think through the 80% decline in Japan and how that evolves over the course of the year?Leanne D. CunninghamYes. So again, we've been working, again, scoping out, working on our, increasing our route to consumer into own distribution models for quite some time. We've had prior to 2020 -- fiscal 2024, we've had 14 markets move into own distribution. We've seen a lot of success. They deliver a lot of things like they fuel our growth, strengthen our position. They do unlock value for us, and we're continuing to move forward in that. So specifically, in this year as it relates to Japan, we are in the process of transition. We know that if you were to look at a year ago period, we were with our distributor partner. We had inventory in that market to supply the sales, and we're going through just the transition. And so as we -- again, all of this is built into our full year plan. But again, at fiscal 2024 for us is going to be a year of transition in Japan. And with that, we have SG&amp;A costs associated with it, and we have a bit of volatility in our inventory levels as we make that transition.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Bill Kirk with ROTH MKM.William Joseph KirkI wanted to ask about your inventory levels, not necessarily the distributor levels. Naturally, they're up from the glass shortage error. You highlighted that. However, if I go back further, I have the days up about 25% over fiscal '19. So I guess, how do you feel about the amount of inventory you hold?Leanne D. CunninghamSo what I would say and you can probably see some of this on a cash flow statement is that, again, as we compare to a prior year period where we were working really, really hard to get all of the supply chain replenished with finished goods inventory. We now have what we've talked about, all of the parts of the chain replenished, including our own inventory. We go into probably the important holiday selling period ready to supply that. So we believe by the time, it's a bit high right now, again, if you look for our own inventories. But as we go through the holiday period, we will, by the end of the year, our plan is that we have that work down and then our own inventories, too, are back in the normal. That's the last piece of the chain that we will be normalizing and we are ready to make those shipments for the holiday season.William Joseph KirkOkay. Excellent. And then there were 2 comments I want to try to tie together. I think Lawson, you made both of them. One was you mentioned that absent distributor inventory changes, net sales would have been above long-term growth expectations. But you also suggested that 1% depletions are below what people should expect going forward. So I guess how are the net sales ex-shipment timing above long term, but the completions below long term? I'm having a little trouble with those 2 comments.Lawson E. WhitingWell, that's just going straight to that Schedule D. So that's where we would I think Leanne said, if you adjust the distributor inventory topic, we'd be running it at an 8% top line. So that's the reference to the higher than sort of -- higher than historical norms in terms of sales growth. And that's the part that gets -- honestly gets us feeling confident because that number is pretty healthy. Now the 1%, I think we talked about that a few minutes ago, there's a lot of RTD movement in there, it's suppressing it. And the other part of it is volumes. We've taken a lot of pricing. I think that contributes to it too because we're getting more of our sales growth now is coming from pricing than it has over the historical periods. So it's a little bit of a balance.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank.Stephen Robert R. PowersI had 2 follow-ups on 2 different questions. The first one, just quickly on the agave topic, Leanne. Is there a way to summarize or quantify the percentage of the company's agave needs that you currently have the capacity to self-grow versus source externally?Leanne D. CunninghamWe've never shared that then and it changes over time depending on the category, demand, our finished goods inventory, our liquid inventory. So it does ebb and flow and we do grow our own and we supplement it with the external as we see demand above what we are able to grow ourselves and then our sourcing strategy that's implied in there. So again, we are excited that is finally coming down, that supply is coming on. We continue to think that, that's going to be a tailwind for us as we move through F '24 and well through F '25.Stephen Robert R. PowersOkay. Okay. Fair enough. And then probably Lawson for you. On Jack &amp; Coke, I was wondering if you could talk at all about through the incremental distribution gains, new launches that are planned over the balance of the fiscal year, that should I think at least partially offset the tougher comp in the fourth quarter as you lap the U.S. launch. Any perspective there would be helpful. But also, love, if you have it, any details on consumer repeat rates or what have you. The trial has been great. Just curious as to how much of the demand we are seeing is incremental, like first-time trial versus repeated consumption.Lawson E. WhitingAll right. Let me answer the second one, first a little bit because it is -- we were obviously getting prepared for this, I knew that question would come. It was very difficult to get sort of terms of repeat purchase rates. It's just too early. We're getting massive distribution flow and that has been impressive and very good. And so we've essentially reached most of our goals in a pretty short period of time. But we just don't have that. We'll have that -- I assume by next quarter, we'll probably have some indications on that, that will be a little bit better, but it's just playing too early. Now as the year -- as the year goes on, the highlight or the highlights, I guess, we've launched in the U.K. We've launched in Spain and Poland, and all has gone pretty well, and I think we've talked about that. We're really, the big one that's coming is Germany. So that's going to happen in September. And Germany is a very large RTD market for Brown-Forman. And so sort of getting that right is obviously going to be very important, but that will be exciting to watch, and we'll see how that goes. And then Coca-Cola is taking it in a lot of other -- getting bigger in a lot of other markets, places like Japan, we talked about the Philippines, the U.K., Poland, Hungary, Netherlands, Ireland. So the international rollout continues throughout this fiscal year.OperatorThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, due to the interest of time, I would now like to turn the call back over to Sue for closing remarks.Susanne J. PerramThank you. And thank you to Lawson and Leanne, and thank you to everyone for joining us today for Brown-Forman's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global beer market, the prohibition on alcohol in several countries, the rising popularity of non-alcoholic beer in the Middle East, the major players in the region’s beverage industry, and the new horizons for Formula 1, and go directly to 5 Countries that Drink the Least Beer per Capita. The role of beer in our world has evolved over thousands of years, changing alongside our reasons for consuming it. From its origins in the grain-rich empires of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, brewing has spread across the world and made possible civilization as we know it. Beer has been held in the highest esteem and it has been vilified. It is a commodity and a luxury, an industry and a craft. Whatever your personal opinion on beer, it is an example of a creation that has shaped our lives, history, and culture. Global Beer Market:As we mentioned in our article – 20 Countries that Drink the Most Beer per Capita – the global brewing industry recovered partially from the devastating effects of the pandemic and reported a global production of 1.86 billion hectolitres in 2021, a 4% increase from the previous year. However, the market is yet to return to its pre-pandemic levels, when production peaked at 1.91 billion hectolitres in 2019. If your idea of relaxing at the end of the day involves cracking open a beer, you're not the only one. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global beer market was valued at $793.74 billion last year and is projected to grow from $821.39 billion in 2023 to $1.07 trillion by 2030, with a CAGR of 3.88% during the forecast period. Europe is the continent that drinks the most beer in the world, with the Czech Republic being the Country that Drinks the Most Beer in Europe. Alcohol Prohibition: Most of the names in our list of Countries with the Lowest Consumption of Beer are Muslim nations with strict alcohol laws, thus preventing beer companies from penetrating their markets. Drinking alcohol is considered haram, or forbidden, in Islam. It is believed that the Quran forbids alcohol because it harms one’s health, can lead to addiction, and disrupts society. Story continuesAlcohol is completely banned in some parts of the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Yemen, and the Emirate of Sharjah, and consumption remains low even in those countries where drinking (and in some cases producing) alcohol is allowed. As such, the Middle East has historically not been a priority target market for the beverage alcohol industry. The Rising Popularity of Non-Alcoholic Beer: The Middle East, a region where traditionally less alcohol is consumed compared with other parts of the world, is fast embracing the non-alcoholic trend. In cosmopolitan cities across the region, there is an unsatisfied demand for premium beverages as consumers become increasingly discontent by soft drinks – a category that has not witnessed great innovation or disruption in recent years. Saudi Arabia, one of the most conservative markets, has recently seen a spate of openings of innovative bar concepts, in look and ambience indiscernible from any metropolitan bar in the world but, crucially, stocked with only non-alcoholic beverage offerings.Saudi Arabia was the sixth largest market for alcohol-free beer consumption in the world in 2019, and an IWSR analysis indicates that it will remain in this position until 2024. Depending on whether one counts malt beverages, which are not true de-alcoholised beers, Iran would rank very high on the list too. Budweiser 0.0 and Heineken 0.0 are some of the popular alcohol-free beers in Saudi Arabia. Major Players in the Beverage Industry: The Middle East represents a unique demographic for many beverages brands, making it difficult to sell alcohol and therefore easier to sell soft drinks. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) has a strong portfolio of brands across the region and is a market leader, with a market share of more than 40%. The company’s beverage brands are marketed through a variety of channels including, retailers, e-commerce, and direct-to-home. However, Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL)’s focus on other markets like Africa and South America means that the multinational company has outsourced most of its beverage operations to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in the Middle East. Unilever PLC sits in our list of the Best FTSE Dividend Stocks to Invest In. The Coca Cola Company (NYSE:KO) also boasts a strong presence in the Middle East and represents nearly 40% of all carbonated soft drink sales in the region. Saudi Arabia leads the regional market in terms of its consumption of offerings from The Coca Cola Company (NYSE:KO), with Palestine not far behind. The Coca Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a part of the Dow 30 Stocks List: Ranked By Hedge Fund Bullishness Index. Similarly, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has also historically enjoyed a firm hold in the Middle Eastern market, due, in part, to a historic Arab league-imposed boycott on Coca-Cola, which began when the firm decided in 1968 to open a bottling plant in Israel. With sustainability at its core, the New York-based company boasts several popular beverage brands in its regional portfolio, including Shani and Sting etc. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) ranks among the Goldman Sachs Dividend Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks. New Horizons for Formula 1:Before the first Saudi Grand Prix was about to take place in Jeddah in 2021, there was a question on everyone’s mind – in a conservative country like Saudi Arabia, where alcohol is completely banned, will F1 get a pass? Many had also hoped that maybe the grand event would mark the end of Saudi Arabia’s ban on alcohol, especially after a multitude of liberal reforms implemented under the rule of Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Salman. However, Saudi Arabia’s answer was witnessed by the whole world when the customary champagne (or sparkling wine since 2021) sprayed on the winner’s podium was instead replaced with a pink and sugary water drink. Even Max Verstappen made that revelation after his 2021 race podium celebration, when he said:“There was no champagne. Wouldn‘t have been fun.”And thus, even the F1 drivers aren’t above a country’s laws and Islamic beliefs. However, every restriction comes with an opportunity for a replacement and this is exactly what investors can look forward to with the Saudi Grand Prix alcohol ban. Formula 1 is a money-making behemoth and the sport generates a lot of attention, carrying with it a monumental amount of international viewership. With the no-alcohol policy, the sport can attract a fresh set of sponsors in the Middle Eastern countries with a simple substitute – non-alcoholic beverages.For no-ABV beverage companies, the Middle East is a booming market. Saudi Arabia, in particular, is currently trying to transform its global image and has already made massive investments under the Vision 2030 initiative. This is an excellent opportunity for alcohol-free beverages to make their mark in the market and what better stage to announce one’s brand than the big race in Jeddah. With that said, here are the Countries that Drink the Least Beer per Capita. 20 Countries that Drink the Least Beer per CapitaSyda Productions/Shutterstock.comMethodology: To collect data for this article, we have referred to the Global Health Observatory of the World Health Organization, looking for Countries with the Lowest Beer Consumption of Beer per Capita. The total beer consumption by country has been measured in liters of pure alcohol per year. Beer typically contains around 5% of pure alcohol by volume, which means that 1 liter of beer contains around 0.05 liters of pure alcohol. When two countries had the same consumption of beer, we ranked them by their total alcohol consumption per capita.If you also wish to read about countries with the highest rate of alcohol-use disorder, here are the 20 Countries with Highest Rates of Alcoholism. 20. JordanBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.06 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.69 litersAlthough public displays of drunkenness are frowned upon, drinking alcohol in Jordan is accepted as long as it is done in moderation. Some restaurants will serve alcoholic beverages and there are also a number of bars in Amman. Amstel – owned by Heineken N.V. – remains the most consumed beer in the country with a 90% Muslim population. Jordan ranks among the Countries with the Highest Percentage of Non-Drinkers. 19. IndonesiaBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.06 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.57 litersIndonesia is home to the world’s largest Muslim population and consumes the least alcohol for any country in Southeast Asia – just 0.6 liters of alcohol per person or not even bottle wine a year. Beer is the most popular alcoholic drink in Indonesia and the country’s beer industry is worth around $600 million. 18. DjiboutiBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.05 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.43 litersDjibouti has a predominantly Muslim population and while drinking is permitted, drunken behavior could result in a two year prison term. There is no brewery in Djibouti so the country relies on imports, mostly from its neighboring African countries. Djibouti sits among Countries with the Lowest Beer Consumption per Capita in 2023. 17. ComorosBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.04 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.69 litersAlthough alcoholic beverages are available in certain parts of Comoros (notably the large Volo-Volo market in the national capital Moroni), the public consumption of alcohol is generally frowned upon on the islands, as over 95% of the country’s population are devout Sunni Muslims. Castle beer from South Africa is common in the East African country. 16. NigerBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.04 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.67 litersAlthough alcohol is legal to drink in Niger after the age of 18, people usually enjoy their alcohol behind closed doors and out of the public eye. The national beer is called, appropriately, Biere Niger. The only other locally produced beer is a franchise of the French West-African Flag brewery. 15. TongaBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.03 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.8 litersTonga is a Polynesian kingdom of more than 170 Pacific islands, many uninhabited, most lined in white beaches and coral reefs and covered with tropical rainforest. Produced by Tonga Breweries in Ma'ufanga, the Tonga Lager is a popular beer in the country.14. SyriaBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.02 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.24 litersAlcohol is not banned in Syria as it is in some Muslim countries. Nor is it reserved for the upper class elite or religious minorities. Syria’s constitution uses Islamic jurisprudence as a primary source of law, but the Baathist regime has kept alcohol legal, available, and cheap. The leading brands in the Syrian beer market are Almaza, Heineken, and Al-Rayess. Syria is among the Countries that Drink the Least Beer. 13. YemenBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.02 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.05 litersYemen has banned alcohol to the extent that its citizens cannot purchase or drink alcohol at all. The two largest cities, Aden and Sana’a, have some large hotels and nightclubs in which alcohol can be sold to visiting foreigners. The National Brewing Company was the only legal brewery in Yemen but it was destroyed by the northern troops entering Aden at the end of the 1994 war. 12. TuvaluBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.01 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 1.52 litersTuvalu doesn’t produce its own brews and the only beer available in the country is San Miguel from the Philippines, which comes in three flavors: Light, Pale Pilsen, and the strong Red Horse – the seamen's favorite. Tuvalu ranks among Countries with the Lowest Consumption of Beer.11. BhutanBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.01 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.43 litersDespite being an integral part of Bhutanese culture, alcohol consumption in Bhutan is low with 0.43 liters per capita. The South Asian kingdom boasts several breweries and produces its own beer. 10. IranBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.00 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 1.03 litersAlcohol has been illegal for Muslim Iranian citizens since the establishment of the Islamic Republic government in 1979. However, the strong public demand benefits the illegal multibillion-dollar business of importing alcoholic beverages and facilitating their production inside Iran. Iran sits among the Top 10 Countries that Drink the Least Beer per Capita. 9. SudanBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.00  liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.51 litersAlcohol in Sudan has been broadly illegal since 1983, when the single-party Sudan Socialist Union passed the Liquor Prohibition Bill, making it illegal to manufacture, sell, and consume any form of alcohol for the Muslim citizens of the country. However, in 2020, Sudan legalized the consumption of alcohol by non-Muslims, which make up 3% of the North African country’s total population. 8. PakistanBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.00 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.34 litersAlcohol is largely prohibited for Muslims in Pakistan, but this doesn’t stop a black market from ensuring the supply of illicit liquor. However, non-Muslims with a liquor license can consume alcohol in Pakistan. Made with a combination of sugar, fruits, herbs, vegetables, and natural extract of citrus fruits, Rooh Afza is a popular refreshing drink in the country. 7. AfghanistanBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.00 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.21 litersIn Afghanistan, the possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages is prohibited for Afghan nationals. However, the government provides a license for various outlets to distribute alcoholic beverages to foreign journalists and tourists, and black-market alcohol consumption is prevalent as well. Non-alcoholic beer is a popular thirst-quencher in the capital city of Kabul. 6. Saudi ArabiaBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.00 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.19 litersIt should come as no surprise that alcohol is not exactly the most popular drink in the birthplace of Islam. Alcohol consumption, import, brewing, and selling is completely banned in Saudi Arabia. With alcoholic drinks prohibited under Islamic law, beer sales in the Saudi Arabian market are totally reliant on non alcoholic beer. Saudi Arabia ranks 6th in our List of Countries with the Lowest Beer Consumption. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Countries that Drink the Least Beer per Capita. Suggested Articles:20 States that Produce the Most Craft BeerTop 20 Wine Producing Countries in the WorldTop 20 Wine Drinking Countries in the WorldDisclosure: None. 20 Countries that Drink the Least Beer per Capita is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

We will discuss the changing dynamics of the dollar and how it has impacted different industries. You can skip our detailed analysis and head straight to the 10 Most Expensive Countries in the World To Live In.Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic took to rest, the world has resorted to talking more and more about the economic implications the pandemic has left the world to deal with. The uncertainty that comes with the current economic status causes alarm to economists. As per a report by the World Economic Forum, Asia is among the fastest-growing regions in the world post-pandemic. China is expected to lead economic growth in the region, with 97% of economists predicting moderate growth. Compared to Asia, the economic outlook for Europe is particularly on the rough side. However, more evidence is required to suggest whether the region will face weak economic growth. Only 6% of respondents expected weak growth in Europe, a significant improvement from 68% of economists suggesting weak growth in January 2023. However, global economics is more complex and the strengthening of the US dollar has had a greater impact than expected. What is Happening With the Dollar?Since last year, the dollar has gained immense traction in the world. As a global currency reserve, the dollar has been in high demand by countries and the general population. However, the volatility and uncertainty surrounding global economics is a cause of alarm to economists.  The strengthening dollar ultimately has widespread implications for other economies, especially emerging markets. The US dollar particularly makes these economies cheaper for citizens. For instance, a strong dollar will indefinitely make it cheaper for people to buy goods abroad. The currency dynamics immensely benefit people traveling to other parts of the world from the United States. As of last year, there have been various reports of Europe being considerably cheaper for US citizens. Story continuesFor instance, if we look back to 2022, a report by Bloomberg published on May 22, 2022, suggested that with the dollar rising, it is the best time for Americans to take trips to other parts of the world, especially Europe. The dollar rose to new heights last year. As a foreign currency reserve, the dollar is a safe option. Additionally, the Russia-Ukraine conflict was a major blow to the Euro. Russia is a major trading partner in the region. Therefore, any conflict in the country would have significant repercussions on the value of the Euro. To cater to the declining value of the Euro in 2022, Europeans turned to purchasing the dollar as a haven. Lastly, rampant rate hikes by the Fed added to the strength of the dollar. The economic policies of the United States have boosted the value of the dollar globally. Moreover, as of last year and early 2023, economists predicted that the Fed will continue to increase interest rates and contribute to a greater global demand for the dollar.However, 2023 has only brought significant changes to the global economy. On August 30, Reuters reported that the dollar's strength against the Euro was short-lived. On Wednesday, the dollar dropped to a two-week low against the Euro. Such has made traveling to Europe more expensive, crushing the hopes of people who had already booked a summer Euro trip hoping for a cheap vacation. With this recent update, experts have begun to wonder whether the Fed will further increase interest rates, as opposed to the current pattern. According to experts, there is a 91% chance that the drop in the dollar marks the conclusion of the tightening cycle by the Fed. As global economic conditions continue to change, it has become increasingly difficult to predict economic outcomes. Therefore, we can not assess whether the US dollar will continue to rise or face a major decline in value towards the end of 2023. How Do Companies Win Against the US Dollar?The uncertainty concerning the dollar has hardly hit US companies catering significantly to the overseas market. Multinational corporations, with most of their market located outside the United States, tend to suffer the most when the dollar is volatile.However, the outlook for multinational corporations is not all bleak. Companies like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) have been standing strong against rising prices and declining global demand. On July 26, Reuters reported that the company forecasts an increase in organic revenue growth of 8-9% for the fiscal year 2023, despite an increase in the average beverage price by 10% and declining demand in North America by 1%.The Coca-Cola Company's (NYSE:KO) success tells another story. Companies like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) heavily invest in ancillary projects, ensuring they stay in demand for longer. On May 25, the company reported a partnership with global donors and the African government to improve the healthcare system in Africa systematically. Project Last Mile is focused on providing and distributing life-saving medicines to everyone in Africa. Engaging in such projects eventually gains traction for a company, reducing the price elasticity of demand, as is the case for The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).Additionally, Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) announced fourth-quarter results for the fiscal year 2023 on July 28. The company reported earnings per share of $1.37 and outperformed estimates by $0.05. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $20.55 billion, up 5.32% year over year and ahead of revenue consensus by $566.59 million. The financial results for the business looked strong against the dollar. The company reported growing organic sales in all its product categories. Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer stated:“The April-June quarter provided a very strong finish to fiscal year 2023 – top-line growth, bottom-line growth, and cash generation. The team met or exceeded our going-in plans for sales, earnings, and cash in a difficult operating environment and despite significant cost headwinds. As we look forward to fiscal 2024, we expect to deliver strong organic sales growth, EPS growth and free cash flow productivity – each in-line with our long-term growth algorithm, despite continued macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges. We remain committed to our strategy – a focus on daily use categories where performance drives brand choice, superiority (of product, package, communication, go-to-market execution and value), productivity, constructive disruption, and an agile and accountable organization structure and culture – all in pursuit of sustainable, balanced growth and value creation.”Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) reported its second-quarter results for the fiscal year 2023 on July 28, 2023. Like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), the Colgate-Palmolive Company also experienced positive returns this quarter compared to the previous year. The company's revenue for the quarter jumped 7.54% year over year and amounted to $4.82 billion, surpassing analyst estimates by $125.85 million. The company reported an EPS of $0.77 and beat expectations by $0.02. As stated by Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer:“We are pleased to have delivered another quarter of strong top-line momentum along with an increase in profitability. Net sales increased 7.5% and organic sales grew 8.0%. Gross profit margin, operating profit margin, operating profit, net income, earnings per share and free cash flow all increased versus the year ago quarter. Our strong results this quarter and in the first half add to our confidence that we are executing the right strategies to deliver on our updated 2023 financial targets, drive cash flow and generate long-term value for our stakeholders.”These statements by the chairman of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) and CEO of Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) indicate the need for companies to constantly enhance their product portfolio, invest in innovative ideas, and make calculated decisions.Now that we have discussed the implications of the US dollar on the global market, let's assess the 35 most expensive countries in the world.35 Most Expensive Countries in the World To Live InOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the 30 most expensive countries in the world to live in, we ranked countries based on their cost of living index for mid-year 2023.

To skip our detailed analysis of the green energy market and Goldman Sachs' second quarter holdings, you can go directly to see the Goldman Sachs Solar and Green Energy Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.The Global Climate Change EnvironmentRenewable energy and the sources from which it is borne, such as wind and solar, have become hot topics not only among your everyday consumers but also among businesses, investors, and financial professionals. As global warming continues to ramp up with each passing moment, the global community is becoming increasingly fixated on ways to curb the impact of rapid climate change in an attempt to preserve the planet and its resources for future generations. As a result of this sense of urgency, renewable energy and the companies working to make such energy available have both steadily begun to gain popularity among consumers, governments, and businesses alike.According to the United States Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, renewable energy was generating about 20% of all US electricity in 2022. Of this 20%, 9.2% comes from wind, 6.3% from hydropower, 2.8% from solar, 1.3% from biomass, and 0.4% from geothermal resources. In 2022 alone, solar and wind energy resources were expected to add over 60% of the utility-scale generating capacity to the US power grid, representing a split of 46% from solar and 17% from wind. This widespread use of renewable energy in the country has many reasons. One notable reason is the continued effort on the part of the government to promote renewable energy-related programs and projects. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, there are several programs in place right now for the purpose of promoting the use of sustainable energy. These include the Combined Heat and Power Partnership, Energy Star, and WaterSense. The Combined Heat and Power Partnership program aims to reduce the environmental impact of power generation by promoting the use of combined heat and power. At the same time, Energy Star is working to provide an energy management strategy that can help measure current energy performance, set goals, track energy savings, and reward improvements. Finally, the WaterSense program is working to protect the American water supply by offering simpler ways to use less water with water-efficient products.Story continues""This Country Should Be Ahead Of Where It Is""These are merely a few examples of the immense effort that is going into promoting renewable energy in the US today. Such efforts are also aiding companies like Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG), and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in their renewable energy projects today. Despite this, major investors such as billionaire Warren Buffett still believe that the country is falling behind its environmental obligations. Here's what Buffett had to say on his company's contributions to the renewable energy space at the 2023 Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting:""We've probably spent more money than any other utility I'd guess in the United States. And we've just scratched the surface. But it is not easy when you cross state lines, I mean you have different jurisdictions. This country should be ahead of where it is in terms of transmission. We have been the biggest factor in helping that.""Buffett's comments make it clear that there is an expectation of major companies in the US to make large contributions to the continuing progress of the renewable energy transformation. Many companies have been following suit with environmental programs and projects to make these very contributions for the betterment of the environment and the planet as a whole. Considering the amount of money and effort that is thus being piled into this space at the moment, we have compiled a list of some of the top renewable energy and solar stocks to invest in according to Goldman Sachs, an institutional investor.

It's also near the maximum capacity of 86 billion cubic feet but within safety standards set by another state agency.“This vote is a slap in the face to the community members who have been living with the ongoing consequences of the worst gas blowout in American history,” Andrea Vega of the group Food &amp; Water Watch said in a statement. “Aliso Canyon poses a significant danger to the health and safety of our communities and is entirely unnecessary to maintain California’s energy reliability.”She accused the commission of siding with “irresponsible and greedy fossil fuel interests.”The expanded storage was requested by Southern California Gas Co., which operates the facility, and was backed by the commission's staff. SoCalGas and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. said it would be better to buy natural gas during the summer and fall months when it's generally cheaper and store it for winter use.The move “is a prudent step to advance our shared goal of maintaining energy reliability at just and reasonable rates,” SoCalGas spokesperson Chris Gilbride said in a statement.The commission’s president, Alice Busching Reynolds, said the expansion was needed to keep gas bills affordable given the unpredictability of extreme weather events due in part to climate change, as well as the volatile wholesale natural gas market. She noted that California imports 90% of its natural gas from out of state.Story continuesShe vowed that the commission will work toward weaning the region off the facility while the state transitions to cleaner energy.“We will reduce our dependency on Aliso Canyon, but we also need to allow people, especially low income and vulnerable communities, to access affordable energy as we move to a new electrified economy,” she said before announcing her approval of the expansion.The commission, which regulates and oversees gas, electric and other utilities, said the increase could save customers anywhere from $200 million to $450 million this winter.The 2015 Aliso Canyon gas leak, which took four months to control, released more than 120,000 metric tons of methane and other gases into the atmosphere over communities in the San Fernando Valley.Thousands of residents were forced to move out of their homes to escape a sulfurous stench and maladies including headaches, nausea and nose bleeds. SoCalGas and its parent company, Sempra Energy, agreed to pay up to $1.8 billion in settlements to more than 35,000 victims in 2021.Earlier this month, the company reached another settlement with the utilities commission, agreeing to pay more than $70 million to the Aliso Canyon Recovery Account to address the impacts from the leak on air quality and public health.Speakers at Thursday's commission meeting were uniformly opposed to permitting more storage.“My mind is just blown that we’re actually talking about this again,” said Jane Fowler of the Granada Hills neighborhood and co-founder of the Aliso Moms Alliance. “We’re trying to get off fossil fuels for our future, for everyone’s future. Why would we be going backward?""The commissioners were all appointed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has endorsed a plan to shut down the facility by 2027.Democratic lawmakers were among opponents who argued that the field is a present danger and the state needs to move ahead more quickly to close it.“Given the history of disaster and risks from continued operations at Aliso Canyon, I continue to support closing the facility on an expedited timeline,” U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein wrote in a letter to the commission’s president this month. “This proposed decision to increase capacity, however, appears to go in the opposition direction.”The field, which stores gas in old wells, was at 50% capacity for years following the leak. But the commission started increasing its storage in 2020, saying it needed to ensure supplies of natural gas for the winter months. The volume is currently at 41.16 billion cubic feet.Administrative Law Judge Zhen Zhang for the commission proposed allowing the increased storage capacity, noting that California and the West saw sharp spikes in the price of wholesale natural gas last winter that affected customers’ energy bills.“On balance, as a matter of policy, it is prudent to take the conservative approach by protecting natural gas and electricity customers from reliability and economic impacts during the upcoming 2023-2024 winter,” the judge wrote.In a letter signed by dozens of environmental organizations opposing the increase, activists said no shortages were reported in the two years after the blowout when Aliso Canyon was offline.“This is an unnecessary danger to people,” said Issam Najm, an environmental engineer and resident of Los Angeles’ Porter Ranch suburb, where thousands of residents were sickened by the leak.Each day the facility remains open, it is emitting cancer-causing chemicals including benzene, said Najm, citing reports by the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the regulatory agency monitoring air pollution in the area.___Watson reported from San Diego.]"

If you want to skip our introduction to short interest, then check out 5 Stocks With Lowest Short Interest. Short selling is also quite entertaining if you're watching from the sidelines. And it was one aspect of the market that caught media waves by storm during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic. The conditions created by the virus, namely lockdowns that left people with nothing much to do but sit in front of their computer screens and receive money from the government in the form of stimulus checks, created a rather interesting set of conditions. The retail investing boom of the pandemic is a well known fact by now, and one way in which it materialized was in the form of serious share price action around GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME).GameStop is a well known retailer and is a one-stop shop for anyone's gaming needs. However, like other traditional brick and mortar retailers, the firm has struggled to adapt to a digital age, and its operations were particularly harmed when video game developers cut the middle man and allowed gamers to directly download games. Not only did this reduce the price that gamers paid for their favorite titles, but firms also managed to reduce the costs of selling games, in a win win situation for both that left GameStop scratching its head.Analysts and hedge funds were as hawk eyed as ever and had shorted GameStop's shares as they believed that the firm would continue to bleed cash and lose market share. However, retail investors teamed up on Reddit and started buying the company's shares in bulk. These purchases were large enough to boost GameStop's share price from roughly $2.5 in April 2020 to a stunning $483 in January 2021 roughly three weeks after the meme buying frenzy started on Reddit. In the immediate aftermath of the retail stock frenzy, short sellers in GameStop had lost $6 billion and some hedge funds even went out of business.Story continuesSince then, even though GameStop buffeted its cash reserves by issuing more shares, the firm has been unable to successfully undertake a turnaround. GameStop has gone through multiple chief executive officers and chief financial officers and experimented with non fungible tokens (NFTs). The firm continues to post annual losses and its quarterly revenues continue to remain flat. However, GameStop still has plenty of cash left from its earlier share sales, so the jury's still out about the firm. As to what analysts think, the average share price target is $13.10 for a $5 downside from the current share price of $18.37. Analysts have also rated the shares as Underperform which have lost 35% over the past 12 months but made modest 6% gains this year.So, looks like short sellers are often on the dot when they short stocks, and today we'll look at some stocks with the lowest short interest.

We need to discuss with the partners how we will handle financial and corporate issues,"" the head of InterRAO, Boris Kovalchuk, told reporters.InterRAO, which owns about 51% of the venture, called Russian Gas Turbines (RGT), has the option to buy out GE's stake.Kovalchuk said his company, which bought a Siemens Energy turbine business in Russia last year, wanted to discuss the terms of the venture with GE next year.GE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(NYSE:VLO) is a large petroleum refining group and a member of the S&amp;P 500 Index. The company discloses information to the market in a very transparent manner and, for the most part, is a bet on refining margins. However, it has growing ethanol and renewable diesel segments.The stock has a GF Score of 88 out of 100, meaning it has good outperformance potential. Refining margins fluctuate but tend to be driven by the demand for gasoline, making Valero an inherent bet on the U.S. consumer.VLO 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VLOValero Energy Has a Strong Investment ThesisSWOT analysisStrengthsLike all companies, Valero has several strengths supporting it.The first is its robust refining and marketing operations. Valero stands as the largest independent refiner in the U.S., boasting an impressive refining capacity exceeding 3.3 million barrels per day. Complemented by a vast network of over 7,000 convenience stores, the company commands a substantial market share in the refining and marketing of transportation fuels. Valero also has a refinery in Europe, meaning it is slightly more diversified compared to other U.S. refiners.Further, Valero's consistent track record of operational efficiency has been a cornerstone of its success. This efficiency is derived from factors such as its scale, focus on health and safety and integration of advanced technologies, resulting in optimized cost structures.A strong balance sheet and a Gurufocus financial strength score of 8 out of 10 also position Valero favorably. This financial stability equips the company to navigate economic uncertainties and invest in emerging technologies. The company also has a Piotroski F-Score of 7 out of 9 and an Altman Z-Score of 5.4, which are both attractive scores.Finally, Valero's strategic commitment to technological advancement is noteworthy. Investments in renewable energy, carbon capture and storage and digitalization underscore its proactive approach to refining and marketing operations, as well as future-proofing its business.Story continuesWeaknessesDespite these strengths, Valero also faces inherent weaknesses and external threats that investors should take into consideration.The first is price exposure. Valero's profitability is vulnerable to fluctuations in crude oil and refined product prices. Given its largely fixed cost structure, decreases in these refining margins directly erode profit margins.It also has an environmental impact. Emissions stemming from Valero's refining operations do expose the company to environmental scrutiny and regulatory pressure to mitigate its environmental footprint.The refining industry is marked by fierce competition, with established players vying for market share. This competitive landscape poses challenges for Valero's market maintenance and profit expansion. Valeros refineries are typically more complex, however, which gives its refineries more optionality and profitability relative to the simple refineries owned by smaller companies.OpportunitiesNext, I look at the company's opportunities. Valero is well positioned to harness the rising renewable energy market. Its investments in ethanol production and exploratory forays into biodiesel and bio-jet fuel underscore its potential to align with evolving consumer preferences and tap into new revenue streams.Valeros Gulf Coast refineries can supply international markets, such as Asia, presenting it with opportunities to extend its customer base and revenue sources, diversifying its operations beyond current domains.By acquiring refining or marketing entities, Valero could foster growth and access new markets, fostering synergies that elevate its market reach and asset portfolio.ThreatsThere are also some headwinds to consider.For instance, regulatory changes. The possibility of increased government regulations, including carbon taxes and emissions limits, poses a threat to Valero's profitability and operational ease.Further, in the face of a significant economic downturn, the demand for gasoline and refined products could diminish, subsequently impacting Valero's earnings.The emergence of new technologies, particularly electric vehicles, carries the potential to disrupt the refining industry, reducing demand for traditional gasoline and refined products, which in turn affects Valero's profits. However, with the growth of carbon capture and storage, the petroleum industry is set to continue for decades.Financial results so far in 2023Valero's financial performance in 2023 thus far showcases favorable trends, buoyed by robust global demand for petroleum-based transportation fuels. This heightened demand, coupled with constraints on worldwide supply, kept refining margins robust.For the second quarter, Valero reported net income of $1.9 billion, which was down from $4.7 billion recorded in the same period of 2022. This shift of $2.8 billion primarily resulted from a $3.5 billion reduction in operating income, tempered by a decrease of $747 million in income tax expenses.ValuationThe GF Value Line shows the stock as fairly valued based on its historical ratios, past financial performance and analysts' future earnings projections.Valero Energy Has a Strong Investment ThesisHowever, the stock scores well for profitability, growth and financial strength, receiving 8 out of 10 in each of these categories.OutlookAs Valero charts its course into the latter half of 2023 and beyond, a series of significant factors are poised to shape its operational trajectory.The resurgence of gasoline and diesel demand to pre-pandemic levels is anticipated to align with customary seasonal patterns. Jet fuel demand, particularly in the U.S., is showing promising signs of approaching pre-pandemic levels.Additionally, light product inventories (gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel) remain below historical benchmarks in both the U.S. and Europe. This scarcity underscores continued robust utilization of refining capacity.Valero anticipates ongoing consistent renewable diesel margins, reflective of its proactive investments in renewable energy sectors.Ethanol demand is poised to adhere to customary seasonal patterns, mirroring historical trends. There has also been speculation that airlines want to start blending ethanol into sustainable aviation fuel, which might create a demand boost for ethanol.In conclusion, Valero Energy stands as a resilient player in the energy sector, marked by strengths that bolster its market influence and operational efficiency. While navigating weaknesses and threats, the company is well-positioned to harness opportunities in the renewable energy market, potential market expansions and strategic acquisitions.As it moves forward, Valero remains able to respond to changing demands, economic shifts and the transformative impact of new technologies on the refining industry.

EL is bearing the brunt of continued inflationary pressures. The leading skincare, makeup, fragrance and hair care product provider is battling unfavorable currency headwinds.The company is grappling with challenges in its Asia travel retail business, which continued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Margins also remained soft in the quarter. Moreover, management offered a dull view for first-quarter fiscal 2024. Shares of the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock have slumped 35.8% year-to-date compared with the industry’s 23.1% decline. The stock has underperformed the Zacks Consumer Staples’s decline of 4.1% during this time.Let’s delve deeper.Margin Pressure ContinuesIn fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, The Estee Lauder Companies’ adjusted gross profit came in at $2,467 million, down 3% year over year. The gross margin contracted to 67.8% from 71% reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was caused by the under-absorption of overhead in its plants stemming from the pull-down of production during the year. The company’s operating income fell 66% to $71 million while its operating margin contracted 380 basis points (bps) to 2%. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 70 bps, thanks to increased advertising and promotional activities.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnfavorable Currency Movements HurtOwing to The Estee Lauder Companies’ solid international presence, it remains exposed to unfavorable currency fluctuations. Any adverse currency fluctuation will likely weigh on the company’s operating performance. For fiscal 2024, management projects an unfavorable currency impact of 1% on net sales. Currency headwinds will likely affect net earnings per share (EPS) by nearly 11 cents in fiscal 2024.Dull Outlook a ConcernIn its last earnings call, management highlighted that it remains cautious about economic hurdles in China, volatile inflation levels, foreign currency fluctuations and concerns surrounding recession (in several global markets). For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Estee Lauder anticipates reported and organic net sales to decline 12-10% year over year. The bottom line is envisioned in the band of a loss of 31 cents per share and a loss of 21 cents in the fiscal first quarter. On a cc basis, the bottom line is likely to range between a loss of 29 cents and a loss of 19 cents per share.Story continuesWrapping UpThe Estee Lauder Companies has a strong e-commerce business, which is expected to be a significant growth engine in the upcoming years. Management is expanding its omnichannel capabilities to aid flexible and convenient shopping options for consumers.

We will discuss the changing dynamics of the dollar and how it has impacted different industries. You can skip our detailed analysis and head straight to the 10 Most Expensive Countries in the World To Live In.Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic took to rest, the world has resorted to talking more and more about the economic implications the pandemic has left the world to deal with. The uncertainty that comes with the current economic status causes alarm to economists. As per a report by the World Economic Forum, Asia is among the fastest-growing regions in the world post-pandemic. China is expected to lead economic growth in the region, with 97% of economists predicting moderate growth. Compared to Asia, the economic outlook for Europe is particularly on the rough side. However, more evidence is required to suggest whether the region will face weak economic growth. Only 6% of respondents expected weak growth in Europe, a significant improvement from 68% of economists suggesting weak growth in January 2023. However, global economics is more complex and the strengthening of the US dollar has had a greater impact than expected. What is Happening With the Dollar?Since last year, the dollar has gained immense traction in the world. As a global currency reserve, the dollar has been in high demand by countries and the general population. However, the volatility and uncertainty surrounding global economics is a cause of alarm to economists.  The strengthening dollar ultimately has widespread implications for other economies, especially emerging markets. The US dollar particularly makes these economies cheaper for citizens. For instance, a strong dollar will indefinitely make it cheaper for people to buy goods abroad. The currency dynamics immensely benefit people traveling to other parts of the world from the United States. As of last year, there have been various reports of Europe being considerably cheaper for US citizens. Story continuesFor instance, if we look back to 2022, a report by Bloomberg published on May 22, 2022, suggested that with the dollar rising, it is the best time for Americans to take trips to other parts of the world, especially Europe. The dollar rose to new heights last year. As a foreign currency reserve, the dollar is a safe option. Additionally, the Russia-Ukraine conflict was a major blow to the Euro. Russia is a major trading partner in the region. Therefore, any conflict in the country would have significant repercussions on the value of the Euro. To cater to the declining value of the Euro in 2022, Europeans turned to purchasing the dollar as a haven. Lastly, rampant rate hikes by the Fed added to the strength of the dollar. The economic policies of the United States have boosted the value of the dollar globally. Moreover, as of last year and early 2023, economists predicted that the Fed will continue to increase interest rates and contribute to a greater global demand for the dollar.However, 2023 has only brought significant changes to the global economy. On August 30, Reuters reported that the dollar's strength against the Euro was short-lived. On Wednesday, the dollar dropped to a two-week low against the Euro. Such has made traveling to Europe more expensive, crushing the hopes of people who had already booked a summer Euro trip hoping for a cheap vacation. With this recent update, experts have begun to wonder whether the Fed will further increase interest rates, as opposed to the current pattern. According to experts, there is a 91% chance that the drop in the dollar marks the conclusion of the tightening cycle by the Fed. As global economic conditions continue to change, it has become increasingly difficult to predict economic outcomes. Therefore, we can not assess whether the US dollar will continue to rise or face a major decline in value towards the end of 2023. How Do Companies Win Against the US Dollar?The uncertainty concerning the dollar has hardly hit US companies catering significantly to the overseas market. Multinational corporations, with most of their market located outside the United States, tend to suffer the most when the dollar is volatile.However, the outlook for multinational corporations is not all bleak. Companies like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) have been standing strong against rising prices and declining global demand. On July 26, Reuters reported that the company forecasts an increase in organic revenue growth of 8-9% for the fiscal year 2023, despite an increase in the average beverage price by 10% and declining demand in North America by 1%.The Coca-Cola Company's (NYSE:KO) success tells another story. Companies like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) heavily invest in ancillary projects, ensuring they stay in demand for longer. On May 25, the company reported a partnership with global donors and the African government to improve the healthcare system in Africa systematically. Project Last Mile is focused on providing and distributing life-saving medicines to everyone in Africa. Engaging in such projects eventually gains traction for a company, reducing the price elasticity of demand, as is the case for The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).Additionally, Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) announced fourth-quarter results for the fiscal year 2023 on July 28. The company reported earnings per share of $1.37 and outperformed estimates by $0.05. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $20.55 billion, up 5.32% year over year and ahead of revenue consensus by $566.59 million. The financial results for the business looked strong against the dollar. The company reported growing organic sales in all its product categories. Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer stated:“The April-June quarter provided a very strong finish to fiscal year 2023 – top-line growth, bottom-line growth, and cash generation. The team met or exceeded our going-in plans for sales, earnings, and cash in a difficult operating environment and despite significant cost headwinds. As we look forward to fiscal 2024, we expect to deliver strong organic sales growth, EPS growth and free cash flow productivity – each in-line with our long-term growth algorithm, despite continued macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges. We remain committed to our strategy – a focus on daily use categories where performance drives brand choice, superiority (of product, package, communication, go-to-market execution and value), productivity, constructive disruption, and an agile and accountable organization structure and culture – all in pursuit of sustainable, balanced growth and value creation.”Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) reported its second-quarter results for the fiscal year 2023 on July 28, 2023. Like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), the Colgate-Palmolive Company also experienced positive returns this quarter compared to the previous year. The company's revenue for the quarter jumped 7.54% year over year and amounted to $4.82 billion, surpassing analyst estimates by $125.85 million. The company reported an EPS of $0.77 and beat expectations by $0.02. As stated by Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer:“We are pleased to have delivered another quarter of strong top-line momentum along with an increase in profitability. Net sales increased 7.5% and organic sales grew 8.0%. Gross profit margin, operating profit margin, operating profit, net income, earnings per share and free cash flow all increased versus the year ago quarter. Our strong results this quarter and in the first half add to our confidence that we are executing the right strategies to deliver on our updated 2023 financial targets, drive cash flow and generate long-term value for our stakeholders.”These statements by the chairman of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) and CEO of Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) indicate the need for companies to constantly enhance their product portfolio, invest in innovative ideas, and make calculated decisions.Now that we have discussed the implications of the US dollar on the global market, let's assess the 35 most expensive countries in the world.35 Most Expensive Countries in the World To Live InOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the 30 most expensive countries in the world to live in, we ranked countries based on their cost of living index for mid-year 2023.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly. Top 5 Upgrades: Goldman Sachs upgraded PDD Holdings (PDD) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $129, up from $99, following what the firm calls a ""significant"" Q2 earnings beat, driven mostly from domestic online ad revenue being up 50% year-over-year.Citi upgraded Sunrun (RUN) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $21, down from $25. While headwinds from higher interest rates and net energy metering impacts appear to be largely priced into the shares, Sunrun is not getting due credit for its market share gains from third party owner shift, path to free cash flow generation, no corporate level equity raises, projected component cost deflation, and success in selling battery storage, the firm says.Scotiabank upgraded UDR (UDR) to Outperform from Sector Perform with a price target of $45, up from $44. The firm sees a relative valuation discount in UDR shares that ""offers an attractive entry point.""Compass Point upgraded Hercules Capital (HTGC) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $17.50, up from $17. Hercules raised $108M in fresh capital through a syndicated equity offering of 6.5M shares in early August and the ""only reason to do a syndicated equity offering is that originations are accelerating faster than expected,"" the firm notes.JPMorgan upgraded Cemig (CIG) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of R$16, up from R$14.50. The firm believes state-owned utilities controlled by the state of Minas Gerais are being mispriced by the market. Top 5 Downgrades:Bernstein downgraded Texas Instruments (TXT) to Underperform from Market Perform with an unchanged price target of $145. The firm says Street models do not appear to contemplate the consequences of Texas Instruments' capex and inventory plans. TD Cowen downgraded Ambarella (AMBA) to Market Perform from Outperform with a price target of $65, down from $90, following the Q2 report. The company announced ""another hard expectation cut"" as customer inventory burn accelerates, leaving Ambarella with little visibility in the near and intermediate term, the firm notes.Craig-Hallum downgraded Box (BOX) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $30, down from $35. Growth at Box is slowing to a halt as customers continue to lower their rate of seat expansion, the firm says.Morgan Stanley downgraded Centene (CNC) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $73, down from $94. The firm has lowered confidence in the visibility and stability of the company's long term earnings growth profile. Barclays downgraded Rockwell Automation (ROK) to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $287, down from $300. The company has attractive end market exposures and an un-levered balance sheet, but the stock's valuation is ""quite rich"" after rallying 20% year-to-date, the firm argues.Top 5 Initiations: WestPark Capital initiated coverage of Palo Alto Networks (PANW) with a Buy rating and $340 price target. The firm believes Palo Alto is ""leaving competitors far behind"" and that the company's growing scale will provide additional competitive benefits versus smaller point solutions.HSBC initiated coverage of Align Technology (ALGN) with a Buy rating and $450 price target. The firm believes the dental market is under-penetrated, with an addressable size of $20B and a solid growth profile, and says ageing demographics and consumer spending patterns are long- and mid-term drivers of growth.Citi initiated coverage of Cognex (CGNX) with a Neutral rating and $52 price target. The firm says softer near-term demand trends across most of the company's end markets and its ""still relatively elevated"" valuation could keep shares relatively range-bound in the near-term.B. Riley initiated coverage of AZZ Inc. (AZZ) with a Buy rating and $64 price target.  The firm believes the company has ""several compelling investment attributes,"" including the durability of cash flows, a leading position in its respective markets, and disciplined capital allocation.Janney Montgomery Scott initiated coverage of BCB Bancorp (BCBP) with a Buy rating and $18.50 fair value estimate. The traditional lender focused on commercial lending, not thrift-related assets, in Northern New Jersey is an ""inexpensive community bank"" that currently trades at a 30% discount to tangible book value, or TBV, per share, the firm tells investors.]"
364,15119dd6-a91f-361f-ad64-f79f566b5340,VNO,2023-08-31,Vornado (VNO) Enters PPP Venture to Develop Studio Campus in NYC,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vornado-vno-enters-ppp-venture-164000593.html,1693413600,STORY,"['VNO', 'HPP']","[Vornado Realty Trust VNO recently entered into Manhattan’s first public-private partnership (“PPP”) venture with Hudson Pacific Properties HPP, Blackstone BX, the City of New York and New York City Economic Development Corporation to build a 266,000-square-foot purpose-built studio campus at Pier 94 with a joint investment amount of around $350 million.More than 1,300 construction jobs and 400 permanent jobs are anticipated to be created through the project. In addition, the local economy will likely benefit from a contribution of $6.4 billion over the next 30 years. This will make New York one of the leading places for the film and television industry. Consequently, Vornado’s portfolio of premier New York City office and retail assets is likely to benefit from the expected favorable economic conditions of the region.Vornado, Hudson Pacific and Blackstone’s institutional Core+ Real Estate strategy will own a stake of 49.9%, 25.6% and 24.5%, respectively, in the studio campus. Notably, Vornado contributed its long-term leasehold for Pier 94 to the PPP venture. Also, this will mark Hudson Pacific’s first New York location and Blackstone’s growing studio platform and synergistic with its existing Los Angeles operations.The construction of this first-of-its-kind space with state-of-the-art film and production technology is set to begin in the third quarter of 2023 using the $183 million in construction financing led by RBC. The project is expected to be completed by year-end 2025.Vornado will be in charge of the development, while the design oversight and management of the facility’s leasing and operations will be taken care of by Hudson Pacific.Pier 94 Studios will sport six purpose-built soundstages with production control room facilities and production support space and offices spanning 145,000 square feet. The space will overlook the Hudson River and offer ample room for on-site parking. Moreover, multiple stages will be equipped with technological infrastructure for the adaptation to virtual production.Given the facility’s location, design, size and technological capabilities, world-class convenience and flexibility for episodic television, live audience television and feature films can be facilitated here.A program to support workforce development and training programs to connect local residents to opportunities in film, television, commercial and other media production will also be in place.Furthermore, the local communities will benefit from several public amenities, including new public restrooms for Hudson River Park, a 1,850-square-foot community amenity space, 25,000 square feet of waterfront open space and pier access, and safety improvements to the bikeway.Regarding sustainability, Sunset Pier 94 Studios will target achieving LEED Gold and Fitwel certification and powering its operations with 100% renewable energy. This strategy is in sync with the broader Sunset Studios portfolio.Per Michael Franco, president and CFO of Vornado Realty Trust, “Our partnership with Blackstone, Hudson Pacific, and the City of New York will solidify New York as a leading market for content production and studio space, create jobs, drive economic momentum, and deliver a host of amenities to the surrounding community. Together we’ll raise the bar for one of New York City’s signature industries and breathe new life into a key waterfront site.”Vornado has been experiencing healthy leasing activity across its portfolio of top-quality office spaces in a few select, high-barrier-to-entry markets of New York on the back of healthy demand for premium assets with class-apart amenities.However, given a choppy office real estate market, demand for office properties may remain subdued in the near term, raising concerns for the company. Elevated supply and high-interest rates add to its woes.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 16% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s decline of 2.3%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNote: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:AAL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 59% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of American Airlines Group. See our latest analysis for American Airlines Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About American Airlines Group?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.American Airlines Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at American Airlines Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in American Airlines Group. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. With 5.7% and 5.6% of the shares outstanding respectively, PRIMECAP Management Company and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of American Airlines GroupThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in American Airlines Group Inc.. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$117m worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 40% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over American Airlines Group. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

The union backed up the vote with picketing at several airports.Union President Julie Hedrick said the vote tells company management that flight attendants, who have not received raises since 2019, are “fired up."" American executives, she said, “ignore this strike vote at their peril.”American said, “We’re proud of the progress we’ve made in negotiations with the APFA, and we look forward to reaching an agreement that provides our flight attendants with real and meaningful value. We understand that a strike authorization vote is one of the important ways flight attendants express their desire to get a deal done.”The vote does not mean that a strike is imminent or even likely. Federal law makes it difficult for airline unions to conduct legal strikes — they need a decision from federal mediators that further negotiations would be pointless, which rarely happens. The president and Congress can also get involved to delay or block a strike.Earlier this month, American's pilots ratified a contract that will raise average pay more than 40% over four years. Flight attendants are not expected to reap that kind of increase, as they have less leverage than pilots, who are in short supply.Other airline unions are also pushing for new contracts.

Boyd Group International President Mike Boyd joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the safeguards in place to monitor pilots, including their own labor unions.""Now, we have systems if a pilot is fired at one airline, there's basically a database that will tell another airline what happened there, supposedly,"" Boyd says. ""It's getting better, but we're dealing with humans.""Boyd details the pressure working pilots may be feeling under labor shortages and the counseling services that airlines and unions offer.Video Transcript- When you think about the idea that perhaps some pilots don't feel comfortable coming forward because it means they'll be barred from the cockpit, talk about some of the what goes into some of the decision-making behind this and perhaps some of the support that you think would benefit some of these pilots.MIKE BOYD: Well, yes, some of them really don't have a lot of faith or trust in the FAA, and that's understandable. But keep in mind too the majority of US airline pilots have labor unions, ALPA, APA, SWAPA, and these are more safety organizations every bit as much as they are labor organizations. So that's probably the refuge they should take because they have professionals who can work with that. Let's keep in mind, this is a very, very small percentage of people in that pilot population.- How does this change, if at all, the existing, the training, the work through that for a lot of commercial airlines, and you were mentioning kind of that part of this larger figure, how they evaluate and make sure that pilots are fit for even going through training in order to get onto some of the flight schedules?MIKE BOYD: Well now, we have systems. If a pilot is fired at one airline, there's basically a database that will tell another airline what happened there supposedly. So we have that safeguard in place, and that was from some accident that happened back in the '90s. So it's getting better.Story continuesBut we're dealing with humans, and humans do crazy things. The Chinese captain that-- actually co-pilot at that point who flew an airplane straight into the ground in China, there were no indications he had any problems other than being demoted. We don't know, we're all human, and these things can happen but it's not something the consumer should be really worried about.- And Mike, obviously this is something that people would have to self-report. But as you mentioned there, if you're saying that this isn't perhaps a broader problem. But in terms of the checks and balances that are out there for pilots, especially since there was a pilot shortage, you had COVID a lot of times when you weren't seeing a lot of pilots getting trained, how much pressure are pilots under on a day to day basis?MIKE BOYD: Well, they're under probably as much pressure as before, the problem is they may be doing some more flying. But keep in mind, there are limits to what they can fly. Now, there's always been arguments between airline crews schedulers and pilots that goes back to ancient times, I think. But the reality of this is that there are limits to what they can fly, and airlines and particularly pilots unions are working very hard to make sure pilots aren't flying out there tired and hungry, if you will.- How can airline operators do better at even baking in counseling services, baking in things that pilots are afraid to self-report in order to make sure that everyone's in the right headspace as they're going about the operation?MIKE BOYD: I think airlines have that. But again, they don't get credit for it, but airline pilots unions have systems like this also for their members because like I say, airline pilots unions are as much safety organizations as they are labor organizations. So pilots do have options there. And you're going to find some people who will lie in every population, every type of category of work. There will be a few pilots that will be lying to get around the system, no question about it. But it's no different than bankers or people who work out in the field.]"

AAL is benefiting from improved air travel demand and debt-reduction efforts. However, escalating fuel costs are worrisome.Factors Favoring AALContinued recovery in air travel demand, particularly on the domestic front, bodes well for American Airlines. Recently, management lifted the earnings per share forecast for 2023, primarily driven by the rosy air-travel-demand scenario.The company now expects 2023 earnings per share (on an adjusted basis) to be between $3 and $3.75 (earlier view: $2.5-$3.5). Driven by upbeat demand, the current-year adjusted operating margin is now anticipated in the 7-9% band (earlier guidance:11-13%).The carrier's debt-reduction efforts are impressive as well. Management aims to reduce its debt by $15 billion by 2025 end. The company aims to attain this objective through naturally occurring amortization. Also, it intends to utilize surplus cash and free cash flow to pay down prepayable debt. As of Jun 30, 2023, the carrier reduced its debt levels by more than $9 billion from peak levels in mid-2021.Key RisksThe current scenario of rising fuel costs does not bode well for the airline. Oil price is moving northward mainly due to supply concerns triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war.  Even though fuel price has come down from the highs witnessed earlier, it still remains at an elevated level. Fuel cost per gallon is projected in the range of $2.55-$2.65 for third-quarter 2023.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global beer market, the prohibition on alcohol in several countries, the rising popularity of non-alcoholic beer in the Middle East, the major players in the region’s beverage industry, and the new horizons for Formula 1, and go directly to 5 Countries that Drink the Least Beer per Capita. The role of beer in our world has evolved over thousands of years, changing alongside our reasons for consuming it. From its origins in the grain-rich empires of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, brewing has spread across the world and made possible civilization as we know it. Beer has been held in the highest esteem and it has been vilified. It is a commodity and a luxury, an industry and a craft. Whatever your personal opinion on beer, it is an example of a creation that has shaped our lives, history, and culture. Global Beer Market:As we mentioned in our article – 20 Countries that Drink the Most Beer per Capita – the global brewing industry recovered partially from the devastating effects of the pandemic and reported a global production of 1.86 billion hectolitres in 2021, a 4% increase from the previous year. However, the market is yet to return to its pre-pandemic levels, when production peaked at 1.91 billion hectolitres in 2019. If your idea of relaxing at the end of the day involves cracking open a beer, you're not the only one. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global beer market was valued at $793.74 billion last year and is projected to grow from $821.39 billion in 2023 to $1.07 trillion by 2030, with a CAGR of 3.88% during the forecast period. Europe is the continent that drinks the most beer in the world, with the Czech Republic being the Country that Drinks the Most Beer in Europe. Alcohol Prohibition: Most of the names in our list of Countries with the Lowest Consumption of Beer are Muslim nations with strict alcohol laws, thus preventing beer companies from penetrating their markets. Drinking alcohol is considered haram, or forbidden, in Islam. It is believed that the Quran forbids alcohol because it harms one’s health, can lead to addiction, and disrupts society. Story continuesAlcohol is completely banned in some parts of the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Yemen, and the Emirate of Sharjah, and consumption remains low even in those countries where drinking (and in some cases producing) alcohol is allowed. As such, the Middle East has historically not been a priority target market for the beverage alcohol industry. The Rising Popularity of Non-Alcoholic Beer: The Middle East, a region where traditionally less alcohol is consumed compared with other parts of the world, is fast embracing the non-alcoholic trend. In cosmopolitan cities across the region, there is an unsatisfied demand for premium beverages as consumers become increasingly discontent by soft drinks – a category that has not witnessed great innovation or disruption in recent years. Saudi Arabia, one of the most conservative markets, has recently seen a spate of openings of innovative bar concepts, in look and ambience indiscernible from any metropolitan bar in the world but, crucially, stocked with only non-alcoholic beverage offerings.Saudi Arabia was the sixth largest market for alcohol-free beer consumption in the world in 2019, and an IWSR analysis indicates that it will remain in this position until 2024. Depending on whether one counts malt beverages, which are not true de-alcoholised beers, Iran would rank very high on the list too. Budweiser 0.0 and Heineken 0.0 are some of the popular alcohol-free beers in Saudi Arabia. Major Players in the Beverage Industry: The Middle East represents a unique demographic for many beverages brands, making it difficult to sell alcohol and therefore easier to sell soft drinks. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) has a strong portfolio of brands across the region and is a market leader, with a market share of more than 40%. The company’s beverage brands are marketed through a variety of channels including, retailers, e-commerce, and direct-to-home. However, Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL)’s focus on other markets like Africa and South America means that the multinational company has outsourced most of its beverage operations to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in the Middle East. Unilever PLC sits in our list of the Best FTSE Dividend Stocks to Invest In. The Coca Cola Company (NYSE:KO) also boasts a strong presence in the Middle East and represents nearly 40% of all carbonated soft drink sales in the region. Saudi Arabia leads the regional market in terms of its consumption of offerings from The Coca Cola Company (NYSE:KO), with Palestine not far behind. The Coca Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a part of the Dow 30 Stocks List: Ranked By Hedge Fund Bullishness Index. Similarly, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has also historically enjoyed a firm hold in the Middle Eastern market, due, in part, to a historic Arab league-imposed boycott on Coca-Cola, which began when the firm decided in 1968 to open a bottling plant in Israel. With sustainability at its core, the New York-based company boasts several popular beverage brands in its regional portfolio, including Shani and Sting etc. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) ranks among the Goldman Sachs Dividend Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks. New Horizons for Formula 1:Before the first Saudi Grand Prix was about to take place in Jeddah in 2021, there was a question on everyone’s mind – in a conservative country like Saudi Arabia, where alcohol is completely banned, will F1 get a pass? Many had also hoped that maybe the grand event would mark the end of Saudi Arabia’s ban on alcohol, especially after a multitude of liberal reforms implemented under the rule of Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Salman. However, Saudi Arabia’s answer was witnessed by the whole world when the customary champagne (or sparkling wine since 2021) sprayed on the winner’s podium was instead replaced with a pink and sugary water drink. Even Max Verstappen made that revelation after his 2021 race podium celebration, when he said:“There was no champagne. Wouldn‘t have been fun.”And thus, even the F1 drivers aren’t above a country’s laws and Islamic beliefs. However, every restriction comes with an opportunity for a replacement and this is exactly what investors can look forward to with the Saudi Grand Prix alcohol ban. Formula 1 is a money-making behemoth and the sport generates a lot of attention, carrying with it a monumental amount of international viewership. With the no-alcohol policy, the sport can attract a fresh set of sponsors in the Middle Eastern countries with a simple substitute – non-alcoholic beverages.For no-ABV beverage companies, the Middle East is a booming market. Saudi Arabia, in particular, is currently trying to transform its global image and has already made massive investments under the Vision 2030 initiative. This is an excellent opportunity for alcohol-free beverages to make their mark in the market and what better stage to announce one’s brand than the big race in Jeddah. With that said, here are the Countries that Drink the Least Beer per Capita. 20 Countries that Drink the Least Beer per CapitaSyda Productions/Shutterstock.comMethodology: To collect data for this article, we have referred to the Global Health Observatory of the World Health Organization, looking for Countries with the Lowest Beer Consumption of Beer per Capita. The total beer consumption by country has been measured in liters of pure alcohol per year. Beer typically contains around 5% of pure alcohol by volume, which means that 1 liter of beer contains around 0.05 liters of pure alcohol. When two countries had the same consumption of beer, we ranked them by their total alcohol consumption per capita.If you also wish to read about countries with the highest rate of alcohol-use disorder, here are the 20 Countries with Highest Rates of Alcoholism. 20. JordanBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.06 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.69 litersAlthough public displays of drunkenness are frowned upon, drinking alcohol in Jordan is accepted as long as it is done in moderation. Some restaurants will serve alcoholic beverages and there are also a number of bars in Amman. Amstel – owned by Heineken N.V. – remains the most consumed beer in the country with a 90% Muslim population. Jordan ranks among the Countries with the Highest Percentage of Non-Drinkers. 19. IndonesiaBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.06 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.57 litersIndonesia is home to the world’s largest Muslim population and consumes the least alcohol for any country in Southeast Asia – just 0.6 liters of alcohol per person or not even bottle wine a year. Beer is the most popular alcoholic drink in Indonesia and the country’s beer industry is worth around $600 million. 18. DjiboutiBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.05 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.43 litersDjibouti has a predominantly Muslim population and while drinking is permitted, drunken behavior could result in a two year prison term. There is no brewery in Djibouti so the country relies on imports, mostly from its neighboring African countries. Djibouti sits among Countries with the Lowest Beer Consumption per Capita in 2023. 17. ComorosBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.04 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.69 litersAlthough alcoholic beverages are available in certain parts of Comoros (notably the large Volo-Volo market in the national capital Moroni), the public consumption of alcohol is generally frowned upon on the islands, as over 95% of the country’s population are devout Sunni Muslims. Castle beer from South Africa is common in the East African country. 16. NigerBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.04 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.67 litersAlthough alcohol is legal to drink in Niger after the age of 18, people usually enjoy their alcohol behind closed doors and out of the public eye. The national beer is called, appropriately, Biere Niger. The only other locally produced beer is a franchise of the French West-African Flag brewery. 15. TongaBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.03 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.8 litersTonga is a Polynesian kingdom of more than 170 Pacific islands, many uninhabited, most lined in white beaches and coral reefs and covered with tropical rainforest. Produced by Tonga Breweries in Ma'ufanga, the Tonga Lager is a popular beer in the country.14. SyriaBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.02 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.24 litersAlcohol is not banned in Syria as it is in some Muslim countries. Nor is it reserved for the upper class elite or religious minorities. Syria’s constitution uses Islamic jurisprudence as a primary source of law, but the Baathist regime has kept alcohol legal, available, and cheap. The leading brands in the Syrian beer market are Almaza, Heineken, and Al-Rayess. Syria is among the Countries that Drink the Least Beer. 13. YemenBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.02 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.05 litersYemen has banned alcohol to the extent that its citizens cannot purchase or drink alcohol at all. The two largest cities, Aden and Sana’a, have some large hotels and nightclubs in which alcohol can be sold to visiting foreigners. The National Brewing Company was the only legal brewery in Yemen but it was destroyed by the northern troops entering Aden at the end of the 1994 war. 12. TuvaluBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.01 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 1.52 litersTuvalu doesn’t produce its own brews and the only beer available in the country is San Miguel from the Philippines, which comes in three flavors: Light, Pale Pilsen, and the strong Red Horse – the seamen's favorite. Tuvalu ranks among Countries with the Lowest Consumption of Beer.11. BhutanBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.01 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.43 litersDespite being an integral part of Bhutanese culture, alcohol consumption in Bhutan is low with 0.43 liters per capita. The South Asian kingdom boasts several breweries and produces its own beer. 10. IranBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.00 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 1.03 litersAlcohol has been illegal for Muslim Iranian citizens since the establishment of the Islamic Republic government in 1979. However, the strong public demand benefits the illegal multibillion-dollar business of importing alcoholic beverages and facilitating their production inside Iran. Iran sits among the Top 10 Countries that Drink the Least Beer per Capita. 9. SudanBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.00  liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.51 litersAlcohol in Sudan has been broadly illegal since 1983, when the single-party Sudan Socialist Union passed the Liquor Prohibition Bill, making it illegal to manufacture, sell, and consume any form of alcohol for the Muslim citizens of the country. However, in 2020, Sudan legalized the consumption of alcohol by non-Muslims, which make up 3% of the North African country’s total population. 8. PakistanBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.00 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.34 litersAlcohol is largely prohibited for Muslims in Pakistan, but this doesn’t stop a black market from ensuring the supply of illicit liquor. However, non-Muslims with a liquor license can consume alcohol in Pakistan. Made with a combination of sugar, fruits, herbs, vegetables, and natural extract of citrus fruits, Rooh Afza is a popular refreshing drink in the country. 7. AfghanistanBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.00 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.21 litersIn Afghanistan, the possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages is prohibited for Afghan nationals. However, the government provides a license for various outlets to distribute alcoholic beverages to foreign journalists and tourists, and black-market alcohol consumption is prevalent as well. Non-alcoholic beer is a popular thirst-quencher in the capital city of Kabul. 6. Saudi ArabiaBeer Consumption per Capita: 0.00 liters Overall Alcohol Consumption per Capita: 0.19 litersIt should come as no surprise that alcohol is not exactly the most popular drink in the birthplace of Islam. Alcohol consumption, import, brewing, and selling is completely banned in Saudi Arabia. With alcoholic drinks prohibited under Islamic law, beer sales in the Saudi Arabian market are totally reliant on non alcoholic beer. Saudi Arabia ranks 6th in our List of Countries with the Lowest Beer Consumption. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Countries that Drink the Least Beer per Capita. Suggested Articles:20 States that Produce the Most Craft BeerTop 20 Wine Producing Countries in the WorldTop 20 Wine Drinking Countries in the WorldDisclosure: None. 20 Countries that Drink the Least Beer per Capita is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

As pre-existing antibodies to the AAV can pose a potential risk to patient safety as well as limit the therapeutic potential, patients must be screened for antibodies to determine patient eligibility.ii Testing to identify the quantity of total binding antibodies (TABs) can help identify eligible patients.iiiAbout Quest DiagnosticsQuest Diagnostics empowers people to take action to improve health outcomes.

This blog was written by Andre Heller, Program Director of Signpost. Signpost, is an International Rescue Committee (IRC)-led consortium project that creates digital information hubs to equip and empower clients in times of crisis.This year's World Humanitarian Day theme is ""No Matter What"" - a recognition that the humanitarian community strives to reach people in crisis with lifesaving assistance, regardless of the dangers or difficulties in making that happen. That tenacious spirit is both fitting and necessary this year. Since last August, long-standing humanitarian crises in places like Syria and Venezuela have not abated. At the same time, new crises have emerged or conditions have deteriorated to alarming extents in countries as far-flung as Afghanistan, Haiti, Niger and Sudan.In the face of these mounting challenges, it is understandable to feel despair. But there are reasons to hope. People facing unimaginable difficulty constantly find new ways to persist, recover, and eventually thrive. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) sees their courage and resilience firsthand every day. And the humanitarian community that serves them, in partnership with donors and grassroots communities around the world, are developing new and more powerful ways to move humanity to a better place.A powerful example of this is Signpost, an IRC-led consortium project that creates digital information hubs to equip and empower clients in times of crisis. Signpost platforms deliver critical information through local teams equipped with cutting-edge digital tools - providing communities with timely and actionable information. That information is vital for people to solve difficult and complex problems and make pivotal decisions on their course of action in times of crisis.The correct information at the right time helps people understand big questions like: is it safe to flee the country? Am I eligible for a food program to support my family? Where can I find employment? Where to find the hospital that can help with a chronic illness? How do I enroll my children in a new school in a new city? Where can my family find shelter in a place that is safe from violence?Signpost helps people approach these questions with up-to-date, accurate information. It is now active in 22 countries across five continents and plans to expand in the months and years ahead.From the beginning, partnership has been a key element of Signpost's power and success. Cisco's support empowered the Signpost technology team to innovate and remove years of backlog. In just one year Signpost built the following technologies that helped exponentially grow the reach and impact of the program:Service Map RebuildA low-code data management system for Service Mapping Officers across the globe to map service locations so our clients can better access the places they need. This tool can connect to chatbots, geospatial data, and manage real-time incoming information.Universal Analytics StackA central hub where all Signpost data is securely stored to facilitate better targeting of humanitarian information and aid in humanitarian advocacy.New Front EndA quick-deploy and centrally administered web-application deployed to over 10 countries. This template can function online and offline, and store critical information with a utilitarian approach.In the past year of Cisco's support, Signpost reached 32 million people, served 5.74 million users, with 131,830 unique two-way communications with clients, nearly doubling our impact numbers from all years (2015-2022) preceding. This support led to a 188% increase in reach, 187% increase in users, and 393% increase in two-way communications over last year's annual count.In recognition of Signpost's success in connecting people in crisis with vital and vetted information, the United Nations recently awarded the project with a prestigious Sustainable Development Goal Action Award. There is no question that bold and innovative partnerships like Signpost have a huge role to play in helping the international community both reach the United Nations' Sustainable Development goals and in helping the humanitarian community serve its clients more broadly.To learn more about the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and its partnership with Cisco, as well as how you can support and donate, visit the Cisco Crisis Response page and IRC's website.View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.Cisco Systems Inc., Wednesday, August 30, 2023, Press release pictureView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/778501/cisco-signpost-reminds-us-that-great-things-are-possible-through-collaboration]"
