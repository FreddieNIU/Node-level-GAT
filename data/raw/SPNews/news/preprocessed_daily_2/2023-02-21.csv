It has amassed assets over $2.55 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.05%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.47%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 27.30% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 5.51% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon Com Inc (AMZN).The top 10 holdings account for about 21.98% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSCHK seeks to match the performance of the Schwab 1000 Index before fees and expenses. The Schwab 1000 Index is a float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that includes the 1,000 largest stocks of publicly traded companies in the United States, with size being determined by market capitalization. The index is designed to be a measure of the performance of large- and mid-cap U.S. stocks.Story continuesThe ETF has gained about 7.04% so far this year and is down about -5.96% in the last one year (as of 02/20/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $34.56 and $45.01.The ETF has a beta of 1.02 and standard deviation of 25.43% for the trailing three-year period. With about 994 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab 1000 Index ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SCHK is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF has $307.53 billion in assets, SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF has $374.49 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.Bottom-LineRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments How Quickly Is Texas Instruments Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Shareholders will be happy to know that Texas Instruments' EPS has grown 22% each year, compound, over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. While we note Texas Instruments achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 9.2% to US$20b. That's encouraging news for the company!You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Texas Instruments' future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre Texas Instruments Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Texas Instruments, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$195m. This comes in at 0.1% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Does Texas Instruments Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Texas Instruments' strong EPS growth. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Texas Instruments' continuing strength. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 3 warning signs for Texas Instruments (2 make us uncomfortable!) that you should be aware of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features.

4,62cba063-3bb8-3381-a0cf-0197d2a3e152,RRC,2023-02-21,Range Resources (RRC) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/range-resources-rrc-reports-next-150003026.html,1676905203,STORY,"['RRC', 'LNG']","[Range Resources (RRC) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis independent oil and gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.12 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +16.7%.Revenues are expected to be $1.02 billion, down 35% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 33.57% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Range Resources?For Range Resources, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.71%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Range Resources will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Range Resources would post earnings of $1.36 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.37, delivering a surprise of +0.74%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Range Resources doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, Cheniere Energy (LNG) is soon expected to post earnings of $6.87 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +687.2%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $8.72 billion, up 32.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Cheniere Energy has been revised 5.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -19.75%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cheniere Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

5,8aef91ad-5a8a-35da-8662-721a5167e26b,NUE,2023-02-21,3 Overlooked Industrial Stocks Worth Your Attention,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-overlooked-industrial-stocks-worth-214659693.html,1676670419,STORY,"['NUE', 'DE']","[American industry is back. Accordingly, investors are increasingly looking at U.S. industrial stocks as a place to invest in this difficult market.The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act is one of the key drivers of industrial stocks investors are focusing on. Most of this Act’s $370 billion in aid is aimed at building supply chains, which start with heavy industry processing raw materials.With American manufacturing getting an immense aid package, there is value in industrial stocks. These are the early days of the renaissance, but some industrial companies were already doing quite well. If you owned them in 2022, you made money. If you buy them now, you should make even more money.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe companies in this gallery are all involved in heavy industry. They include a steel company, an equipment manufacturer, and a chemical company. All gained in value last year. All dominate their markets. And all are positioned to do well in 2023. They even pay dividends which, if interest rates start falling later in the year, should lift their stock values further.Without further ado, let’s look at three overlooked industrial stocks to consider right now.NUENucor$169.82DEDeere$402.96DDDuPont$75.47Nucor (NUE)Steel stocks: rods, bars and other forms of steelSource: ShutterstockAmerica’s best steel company doesn’t make steel. That is, it doesn’t mine iron and coal to produce steel from its raw materials.Nucor (NYSE:NUE) is a steel recycler. It uses electric arc furnaces to turn scrap metal into new steel. The company has been doing this for a half century. Think of it as a steel technology outfit constantly looking for new processes. Impressively, NUE stock is up 40% over the last year.If any steel company can be called green, it’s Nucor. That’s because the company has 70 scrap metal yards supplying it with raw steel, run through a unit called David J. Joseph Co., which brokers scrap and operates junk car yards under the name U-Pull-And-Pay. The unit continues growing through acquisitions.Story continuesThis business is also very profitable. Last year Nucor earned $7.6 billion, $28.88 per share, on revenue of $41.5 billion. About 18 cents of every dollar that came in turned into net income. Those are tech numbers, not industrial numbers. Indeed, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had  22% of its revenue flow through to its bottom line.But since Nucor is still making steel, it also offers value. The company’s current price-to-earnings ratio is below 6-times, near the bottom of the business cycle. Nucor is a buy-and-hold stock, not a stock you trade, which may be why Tipranks counts only four analysts, only one of whom wants you to buy it. But if you’re going to beat the averages, you buy good companies when no one wants you to, then hold them through the business cycle.Deere (DE)Deere equipment in harvested fieldSource: Deere &amp; CompanyOne of the enduring images of the Ukraine War is of tractors hauling away damaged Soviet tanks. Most of them seemed to be Deere (NYSE:DE) tractors. The company was founded in 1837 and had generations of farmers as lifelong fans.But tractors today aren’t what they were. As with cars, they use a lot of computer chips. They use so many that the company could disable the tractors remotely; when Russians looted a Deere dealership in Ukraine last year, they could disable them remotely. (The company can no longer do this in the U.S. under “right to repair” rulings.)Deere’s fiscal year ends in October. For fiscal 2022 the company earned $7.1 billion, or $23.28 per share, on revenue of $52.5 billion. Both were up about 20% from the year before. That means 13.5% of the company’s revenue became net income, allowing Deere to afford a dividend of $1.20 per quarter, which has doubled over the last five years.Small wonder that analysts are treating Deere like a 2021 tech stock. There are 18 now following the company, and 12 say you should buy it, expecting a one-year gain of nearly 19%.DuPont (DD)The Dupont de Nemours logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: ShutterstockToday’s DuPont (NYSE:DD) isn’t yesterday’s DuPont.The original company was founded in 1802 by a French chemist making black powder for explosives. It built a fortune worth $14.3 billion, now spread among 3,500 living relatives. (I worked with the late Pete DuPont in the 1990s.)A 2017 merger with rival Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW), followed by a 2019 de-merger which reorganized the U.S. chemical industry, eliminating domestic competition, but increasing global competitiveness.Today’s DuPont combines what the specialty chemical units of both companies were. Its brands include Kevlar, Styrofoam, and Tyvek. Dow got commodity chemicals, while a spin-off called Corteva Agriscience (NASDAQ: CTVA) took the agriculture business.The new DuPont makes low-volume but high-margin products protected by patents and copyright for cars, consumer products, and electronics. Until recently, the stock was going nowhere fast, but it has been rising since late September.In 2022 DuPont earned $5.8 billion, $11.61 per share, on revenue of $13 billion. This was mainly achieved by selling most of its Mobility &amp; Materials business to Celanese (NYSE: C.E.) for $11 billion in cash. The deal to Celanese let DuPont retire $2.5 billion in long-term debt and buy back $3.25 billion of stock, as well as hike that dividend.The changes have analysts pounding the table for DuPont. Last year’s lower sales were blamed on China, which contributed 20% of its revenue. This year DuPont expects to earn $3.75 per share from sales of $12.6 billion. Analysts expect it to do even better. Currently, nine of the 13 analysts following it at Tipranks want you to buy it. I like it, too.On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held long positions in MSFT and AAPL.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $2,232 million, indicating a rise of about 6.8% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of 36 cents suggests growth of almost 100% from the year-ago period’s tally. The consensus mark has been stable over the past 30 days.A glance at this grocery retailer’s performance over the trailing four quarters shows that it has an earnings surprise of 8.4%, on average.Factors to NoteSpartanNash fourth-quarter results are likely to benefit from the solid execution of its Winning Recipe plan, which focuses on transforming its supply chain to boost overall growth. The company is focused on streamlining its operations and making strategic investments, including the expansion of capabilities across the distribution centers.In addition, SPTN remains committed to boosting its solutions across both the digital and physical platforms, and expansion of its grocery services. All these tailwinds coupled with the improving trends at SPTN’s Retail unit might have aided the results during the quarter under review.On the flip side, a tough operating landscape including inflationary pressures might have been concern. Any deleverage in the operating expenses is likely to show on SpartanNash’s bottom-line performance in the upcoming quarterly release. The company has been witnessing higher operating costs for a while now.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for SpartanNash this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.

(NYSE:TMO) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/89-ownership-thermo-fisher-scientific-130024181.html,1676984424,STORY,['TMO'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Thermo Fisher Scientific implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price49% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Insiders have sold recently To get a sense of who is truly in control of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 89% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Thermo Fisher Scientific. See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Thermo Fisher Scientific?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Thermo Fisher Scientific does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Thermo Fisher Scientific's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Thermo Fisher Scientific. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.3% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.8% and 5.3% of the stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Thermo Fisher ScientificThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$300m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 11% stake in Thermo Fisher Scientific. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

9,4615106d-b995-367e-9632-4192a509a9ab,TMO,2023-02-21,3 Stocks With Sales Growth to Buy Amid Persistent Inflation,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-sales-growth-buy-113311102.html,1676979191,STORY,"['TMO', '6758.T', 'RE']","[Though the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s ultra-aggressive monetary tightening is being witnessed, inflation is turning out to be “sticky.” Hence, the central bank is likely to raise interest rates in the near term.This has made investors wary about entering the stock market, as higher rates will likely lead to a recession/economic slowdown in 2023. Hence, a conventional stock-picking strategy is the need of the hour. One such way is selecting stocks with steady sales growth. In this regard, stocks like Everest Re Group, Ltd. RE, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. TMO and Sony Group Corporation SONY are worth considering.While assessing any company, revenues are often more scrutinized than earnings. This is because investors want to make sure that a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an increasing customer base. Steady or declining sales growth reflects obstacles at the company. Stagnant companies may generate profit in the near term but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.Without robust revenue growth, bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable. While a company can show earnings strength by lowering costs, continued bottom-line expansion usually requires strong sales growth.Nonetheless, sales growth alone doesn’t show much about a company’s prospects. So, taking into account a company’s cash position along with its sales number can be a practical investment strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments.Selecting the Potential Winning StocksTo shortlist stocks with impressive sales growth and a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow of more than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. Hence, we have added other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.P/S Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (four weeks) greater than X-Industry: Estimate revisions, better than the industry, are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (average last five years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs — an optimal situation.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means that the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform, irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are three of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Bermuda-based Everest Re writes property and casualty, reinsurance and insurance in the United States, Bermuda and international markets. RE also offers other innovative products like excess and surplus lines of insurance.Everest Re’s expected sales growth rate for 2023 is 13.1%.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, both Thermo Fisher Scientific and Idexx Laboratories are holding a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.TMO currently has a forward P/E ratio of 23.75, while IDXX has a forward P/E of 52.23. We also note that TMO has a PEG ratio of 1.90. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. IDXX currently has a PEG ratio of 2.90.Another notable valuation metric for TMO is its P/B ratio of 4.99. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, IDXX has a P/B of 67.54.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help TMO earn a Value grade of B, while IDXX has been given a Value grade of C.Both TMO and IDXX are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that TMO is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:CF) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 16, 2023Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to CF Industries' 2022 Full Year and Fourth Quarter Financial results. All participants will be in listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today, Mr. Martin Jarosick with CF Investor Relations. Sir, please proceed.Martin Jarosick: Good morning, and thanks for joining the CF Industries' earnings conference call. With me today are Tony Will, CEO; Chris Bohn, CFO; and Bert Frost, Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development and Supply Chain. CF Industries reported its results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022 yesterday afternoon. On this call, we will review the results, discuss our outlook and then host a question-and-answer session. Statements made on this call and in the presentation on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements.More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. Also, you will find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in the press release and presentation posted on our website. Now, let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.Tony Will: Thanks Martin and good morning everyone. Yesterday afternoon, we posted results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022 that reflected a phenomenal year at CF Industries, highlighted by outstanding execution from our team. Our plants ran extremely well, producing nearly 10 million tons of ammonia. And most importantly, we continue to operate safely. At the end of the year, our 12-month recordable incident rate was 0.33 incidents per 200,000 labor hours, well below industry averages. Against the backdrop of a persistently tight global nitrogen supply/demand balance, these achievements led to extraordinary results. We produced record full year earnings, record fourth quarter and full year adjusted EBITDA, and record full year free cash flow.Story continuesWe also made significant progress decarbonizing our network and furthered our leadership position in low-carbon ammonia production. Over the last 12 months, we've signed an MOU with Mitsui for the development of a new blue ammonia production facility, our BluePoint complex in Louisiana. We signed a CO2 transportation and sequestration agreement with ExxonMobil. We signed an MOU with JERA for the supply of low-carbon ammonia, and we recently signed an agreement with BP to purchase certified low methane emissions natural gas. All of which put CF Industries at the forefront of decarbonization and sustainability within the nitrogen industry. Turning to the market, the last 18 months have been particularly volatile period for our industry. High energy prices, geopolitical events, and economic weakness leading to reduced industrial demand affected both nitrogen production rates and nitrogen prices.In the near-term, we expect continued volatility in the global nitrogen market. As we look at the first half of 2023, we believe typical spring demand in the Northern Hemisphere is going to be weighted to the second quarter as buyers have taken a wait-and-see approach to their nitrogen procurement. CF Industries network with our combination of in-market production, extensive storage and logistics capabilities and export optionality is well suited to navigate this type of environment. Longer-term, we continue to see a positive operating environment for the company. Industry fundamentals remain strong, resilient demand driven by the need to replenish global grain stocks, significant energy spreads between North America, compared to Europe and Asia and the emergence of demand for low-carbon ammonia as a clean energy source are all very favorable for our cost advantaged network.Nitrogen, Fertilizer, AgriculturePhoto by Chris Ensminger on UnsplashAs a result, we continue to generate -- we expect to continue to generate substantial free cash flow in the years ahead. This will enable us to both invest in growth and return capital to shareholders. We are enthusiastic about the growth opportunity that low-carbon blue and green ammonia provides for our company and believe our MOU with JERA demonstrates tangible emerging demand for low-carbon ammonia as a clean energy source. We will continue to focus on disciplined investments to decarbonize our network and accelerate our ability to produce low-carbon blue and green ammonia to help meet this developing new demand. Alongside these growth investments, we expect to continue returning substantial capital to shareholders. In 2022, we returned nearly 60% of our free cash flow, $1.65 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.And in the last two years, we have reduced our outstanding share count by 11%. We expect to further leverage the $3 billion share repurchase program recently authorized by the Board to continue building on this track record and providing our long-term shareholders with ever-increasing participation in our business. With that, let me turn the call over to Bert, who will discuss the global nitrogen market conditions in more detail.Bert Frost: Thanks, Tony. The global nitrogen market was pushed to extremes in 2022. The need to replenish global grain stocks drove prices for feed grains to the highest levels in a decade. This supported resilient demand for nitrogen and major agricultural production regions like North America, Brazil and India. At the same time, we believe historically high nitrogen prices led to lower demand and smaller subsistence focused agricultural areas in Asia and Latin America. Industrial demand in Europe and Asia was also softer than expected due to higher prices and recession fears. Additionally, we -- very high natural gas prices in Europe and Asia significantly curtailed production in those regions. This, along with government actions restraining nitrogen trade, reduced product availability further supporting high global nitrogen prices.These dynamics were exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which triggered disruptions and a large realignment of trade flows. The combination of these events push global nitrogen prices to all-time highs in the spring of 2022. Through the second half of last year, the shock of these factors moderated as global trade flows of natural gas and nitrogen adjusted and the world absorbed previously delayed urea capacity additions. In addition, a mild winter in the Northern Hemisphere resulted in higher natural gas stocks, lower natural gas prices and therefore, lower global nitrogen prices. Global nitrogen prices were also pushed lower as many agricultural buyers took a risk off just-in-time approach to purchasing. This is not unusual, nitrogen prices are historically high, and demand for the spring application season seems distant.This buyer behavior has persisted longer than normal as declining global prices reinforced the wait-and-see approach. Over the last two weeks, we have seen retailers and wholesalers begin to step back into the market at attractive price levels. The decrease in global nitrogen pricing has improved farmer economics dramatically and should spur demand globally that was discouraged at higher prices. We expect significant demand to emerge in North America in the coming weeks as the value chain moves into catch-up mode that will likely last into and through the second quarter. We believe inventories are lower at the farm and retail level given the extent of the Q4, Q1 purchasing slowdown. Additionally, nitrogen imports into the US since July are lower year-over-year, while nitrogen exports were significantly higher.As a result, we believe there is a good amount of product movement yet to occur and purchases required to meet spring needs. From a longer term perspective, we believe that industry fundamentals continue to point to a tight global nitrogen supply and demand balance. As you can see on slide 9, global grain stocks did not improve from last year's growing season per weather conditions in many key growing areas along with lower production in Ukraine due to the war limited global yields. As a result, global course grain stocks use ratios remain low, supporting high global grain prices for longer. This has been farming highly profitable and low cost exporting regions of the world, such as the US, Canada and Brazil. We expect this will support resilient demand for nitrogen as the agricultural sector focuses on maximizing food production and farm incomes.We project that 92 million to 93 million acres of corn will be planted in the United States in 2023 along with strong wheat, cotton and canola plantings across North America. We believe we'll take at least two more growing seasons at trend yields to fully replenish global stocks. In our view, Europe remains the marginal nitrogen producer in the industry. While forward energy curves have moderated, the current decline in global nitrogen values suggest that producer profitability in the region will continue to be challenged. We believe this is reflected in the estimated 20% to 30% of European ammonia capacity that is currently curtailed. With European production supplying the marginal product ton in the industry, the marginal opportunity for CF Industries remain substantial, as you can see on slide 10.With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.Chris Bohn: Thanks, Bert. For the fourth quarter of 2022, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $860 million or $4.35 per diluted share. EBITDA was $1.25 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $1.3 billion. For the full year, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $3.35 billion or $16.38 per diluted share. EBITDA was $5.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $5.9 billion. Full year net cash from operations was approximately $3.9 billion, and free cash flow was $2.8 billion, both CF Industries records for a calendar year. We generated this free cash flow even after making $491 million in one-time tax and interest payments in the fourth -- third and fourth quarters related to a US Canada tax matter dating back to the early 2000s.Excluding these payments, free cash flow was$3.3 billion, representing a free cash flow to adjusted EBITDA conversion rate of 56% and a free cash flow yield of almost 20%. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect ammonia production will be approximately 9.5 million tons. Capital expenditures are projected to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million in 2023. These amounts reflect a normal turnaround schedule. They also include expenditures related to our low carbon ammonia projects. We expect our green ammonia project at Donaldsonville to be finished around year-end. Fabrication of the electrolyzer is complete and site work is ongoing for its installation and integration later this year. The blue ammonia project at Donaldsonville remains on track for start-up in early 2025.Engineering activities and procurement of major equipment for the CO2 dehydration and compression facility are in progress. Longer term, we remain focused on increasing our free cash flow generation capacity and growing shareholder participation in our free cash flow. We do this in four ways: disciplined growth initiatives in clean energy, investing in high return projects within our current network, pursuing inorganic growth opportunities that offer returns well above our cost of capital; and returning capital to shareholders. In line with this approach, we have a number of high-quality clean energy investments in motion, with some of the world's best companies, as you can see on slide 15. We also expect to return substantial capital to shareholders.With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks, before we open the call to Q&amp;A.Tony Will: Thanks, Chris. Before we move on to your questions, I want to thank everyone at CF Industries for their outstanding work in 2022. Their expertise and unwavering commitment to safety is the foundation of everything we do. I particularly want to recognize, the more than 400 CF Industries employees, who contributed to the successful upgrade of our enterprise resource planning system, which we have had operating since the beginning of the year. This was our largest business technology implementation ever, and it was completed on time and on budget, an outcome that is extremely rare for these types of projects. And while the work may not generate headlines, it is fundamental for our future growth. We are proud of the outstanding 2022 that we had at CF Industries, but we're even more excited about the opportunities ahead.Given our operational focus, disciplined capital stewardship, positive market outlook and strong return profile from our clean energy initiatives, we expect to continue to generate superior free cash flows. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to build on our proven track record and continue to create substantial shareholder value. With that, operator, we will now open the call to your questions.See also 15 Countries that Export the Most Beef and 12 Countries that Export the Most Whiskey.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

A bullish long-term growth strategy buoys optimism on the stock. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Edwards Lifesciences exited the fourth quarter of 2022 on a bullish note with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company also registered year-over-year growth on both fronts. The company’s TMTT segment registered strong growth driven by the continued adoption of the PASCAL platform in Europe.During the quarter, the company initiated the launch of the PASCAL platform in the United States. Further, the growth within Surgical Structural Heart was aided by increased adoption of the company's premium RESILIA technologies around the world, including the recent launch of the company's MITRIS surgical mitral valve. Moreover, the expansion of both margins is encouraging.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation PriceEdwards Lifesciences Corporation PriceEdwards Lifesciences Corporation price | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteCritical Care sales were up 13% on an underlying basis in the fourth quarter of 2022. Sales growth was driven by contributions from all product lines and regions led by HemoSphere and Smart Recovery.In the company’s Smart Recovery portfolio, the adoption of FloTrac and ClearSight sensors featuring the unique hypotension prediction index algorithm RECONNECT remains strong. Moreover, Edwards Lifesciences registered strong demand for the company’s pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU due to elevated hospitalizations in the United States.In the fourth quarter, the company’s Surgical Structural Heart sales improved 8.1% on an underlying basis. It witnessed strong global growth driven by the increased penetration of premium RESILIA products despite COVID challenges in certain regions.The adoption of the MITRIS RESILIA valve in the United States increased in the fourth quarter. Built upon previous generations of proven mitral valve technology, MITRIS offers greater ease of use and is designed to facilitate potential future transcatheter interventions.Story continuesEdwards Lifesciences expects to maintain its leadership position in the global TAVR market through an increased focus on expanding patient access by actively leveraging current valve platforms for additional indications. This includes developing next-generation valve platforms and maintaining trusted relationships with clinicians, payers and regulators.On the flip side, in the past year, Edwards Lifesciences has underperformed its industry. The stock has lost 39.8% compared with the 23.5% decline of the industry.During the fourth quarter, TAVR procedure volumes were impacted by U.S. hospital staffing constraints and the holiday season slowdown. The choppy market conditions due to the continued foreign exchange impact and COVID-related hospital staffing issues are concerning.We also remain worried about the significant challenges Edwards Lifesciences faced, owing to unfavorable foreign currency impact that has been affecting the company’s gross margin over the past few quarters. Per management, significant currency fluctuations could have a material effect on revenues, cost of sales and operational results.Stiff competition in Edwards Lifesciences’ TAVR business continues to ail the company.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

13,05c1f277-9ba6-39a2-8c70-f6c7c88931c3,WMT,2023-02-21,Walmart beats Q4 expectations during holiday shopping period,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-beats-q4-expectations-during-130203147.html,1676984523,STORY,['WMT'],"[NEW YORK (AP) — Walmart on Tuesday reported strong sales during the holiday season as budget-conscious consumers looking for better deals on groceries and other items flocked to its stores.The report was a good showing for the company, considering consumers had cut back on their overall spending during the traditional November-December shopping period. Though sales rebounded at stores and restaurants last month, showing shoppers are still spending despite higher prices and several interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in an effort to curb the problem.The nation’s largest retailer also delivered full-year sales of $611.3 billion, up 6.7% compared to the prior year. But it gave cautious guidance for the next fiscal year, saying it expects sales to increase between 2.5% to 3% and U.S. sales to jump 2% to 2.5%. And it forecast adjusted earnings per share ranging from $5.90 to $6.05, excluding fuel. Analysts surveyed by FactSet forecast $6.52 per share, on average. Shares rose less than 1% in early morning trading.Also on Tuesday, Home Depot posted strong profits in its final quarter of 2022, but a muted outlook for this year sank its shares before markets opened. Amazon, which reported strong fourth quarter sales earlier this month, has also warned about a slower growth period for the coming months.Walmart executives told analysts on a call that their guidance reflects the unknowns in the economy as consumers face rising interest rates, delinquencies and are putting less money in their savings.“While the supply chain issues have largely abated, prices are still high and there is considerable pressure on the consumer,” said Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey on the call.Rainey said the company’s earnings projections are also based on other factors, such as expenses from more interest payments and its planned buyouts of South African retailer Massmart and the robotics firm Alert Innovation.Walmart saw a boost during the pandemic as homebound shoppers spent more on discretionary items like décor to beautify their houses. But consumers are now focusing more on necessities like groceries, which left the company with a glut of excess inventory and dented profits it could make from high-margin discretionary merchandise.Story continuesThe big-box retailer has noted shoppers have been watching how they spend and trading down to private brands in categories such as baking goods in order to save costs. That shift, which began last March, accelerated more during the fourth quarter, executives said on the call Tuesday.High-income shoppers looking for deals on groceries have also been flocking to its stores, and the company has said its looking to retain them by offering fresh food and clothing assortments. December was the largest sales month in Walmart's history, led by food sales, Rainey said. Meanwhile, the company saw a slight decline in general merchandise sales, such as toys, electronics, apparel and home items.Walmart CEO Doug McMillon noted the retailer also ended the quarter with its once-bloated inventory flat compared to last year, which he said was better than they anticipated.The company reported revenue of $164 billion in the quarter that ended on January 27, up 7.3% compared to the same period last year. Profits reached $6.28 billion, up from $3.56 billion last year. Meanwhile, per-share earnings adjusted for one-time costs and benefits were $1.71, beating Wall Street expectations of $1.52.Overall, holiday sales in November and December rose a weaker-than-expected 5.3%, a slowdown from 13.5% in 2021, according to the National Retail Federation. Major retailers, including Walmart and Target, began offering discounts in October to help consumers spread out their spending. And Black Friday doorbusters, which typically drew massive crowds, were also exchanged for weeks-long discount events.At Walmart, comparable sales — those from established stores and online operating over the past 12 months -- rose 8.3%, slightly higher than 8.2% from the previous quarter. Online sales rose 17%.Sam's Club, which is owned by Walmart, reported sales growth of 12.2%. Company executives said on the call that its seeing membership growth among mid to high-income households, as well as millennials and Gen Z.]"

For more semiconductor stocks, head on over to 5 High Growth Semiconductor Stocks that are Profitable. The semiconductor industry is the backbone of the technological world. This is simply due to the principles of computer science, as any gadget, whether it is a small smoke detector or a mega supercomputer, must have a processor or semiconductor to perform the required functions. Therefore, as long as there is technology, the chip sector will be present to power all the devices out there.However, while on the surface the industry appears to make only chips, the reality is that there a countless different firms that contribute to the manufacturing process. Broadly speaking, the chip sector is divided into several categories such as design equipment manufacturers, product designers, equipment providers, manufacturers, and front end firms that package the final product into usable forms. Together, these make up an ecosystem responsible for transforming sand into a high end processor.In terms of market value, the semiconductor industry was worth $556 billion in 2021 according to DigiTimes Research, and from then until 2030, it is slated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7% to sit a $1 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Out of this estimate, the biggest portion will be for communications and computing devices, according to the research firm. These are products that are used in computers, smartphones, and other products and cover chips such as central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and modems. Within the market, the communications sector will grow slower when compared to the broader market through a 6% CAGR to $318 billion, with the computing sector also exhibiting a similar CAGR and sitting at $360 billion by 2030. However, the current gold rush in the electric vehicle segment and the increasing use of electronics will lend the automotive sector a faster than the average growth rate. DigiTimes estimates that this industry will have a whopping 12% CAGR and grow to $145 billion.Story continuesTechnologically, there are several emerging trends in the industry right now. For instance, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is currently engaged in mass producing chips on the 3-nanometer node - which is the most advanced chip making process in the world. At its heels is the chip giant Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), who, according to statements by its chief executive officer Mr. Patrick Gelsinger, aims to catch up to TSMC in less than two years. On the backend side of things, both Intel and TSMC along with other chipmakers are in a rush to procure the latest chipmaking machines from ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) before they become short. ASML is the only company capable of making machines used in fabricating advanced chips, and the new equipment, called High-NA, is capable of producing crisper chip designs.Today, we'll look at the top profitable semiconductor firms, and those that stand out are Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:MPWR), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), and Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI).12 High Growth Semiconductor Stocks that are ProfitableEgorov Artem/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology We used the Finviz stock screener to pick out which chip firms are highly profitable. The firms are selected based on a net profit margin that is greater than 15%. The net profit margin divides the firm's net income by its overall sales, and those with a higher percentage earn more cents on each dollar of sales. They were then further sifted through based on a quarterly revenue growth greater than 15%. Finally, the companies' income statement was analyzed to confirm that the net income is not influenced by a one off event, such as a business unit sale. The final candidates are ranked through their sequential sales growth.High Growth Semiconductor Stocks that are Profitable12.

However, 2022 still emerged as one of the strongest years for the industry. In reality, semiconductor sales had one of their best years ever regionally owing to robust demand.Demand is still robust, which has been assisting in boosting sales despite worries that the semiconductor market may shrink now that the supply-chain issue has significantly subsided. Also, the United States is working to increase its semiconductor manufacturing output in order to become self-sufficient, thanks to a new law that was developed last year with this aim. Given this situation, semiconductor stocks like Analog Devices ADI, Microchip Technology MCHP, Silicon Laboratories Inc. SLAB and STMicroelectronics N.V. STM are likely to benefit in the near term.Semiconductor Sales GrowingAccording to SIA, worldwide semiconductor sales increased 3.2% to $573.5 billion in 2022 from $555.9 billion in 2021, according to data released on Feb 3. Although global semiconductor sales declined both in the fourth quarter and December, demand for semiconductors has remained high almost throughout the year.Year over year, sales dropped $130.2 billion or 14.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022. According to SIA, the semiconductor market in 2022 experienced major ups and downs, with sales falling off in the second half of the year.“Despite short-term fluctuations in sales due to market cyclicality and macroeconomic conditions, the long-term outlook for the semiconductor market remains incredibly strong, due to the ever-increasing role of chips in making the world smarter, more efficient, and better connected,” said John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO.Semiconductor sales skyrocketed soon after the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020. There was a rise in the demand for communication tools and accessories as more people studied and worked from home. A large part of demand was also driven by the auto industry.Story continuesHigh demand coupled with lockdowns in several countries resulted in a shortage of semiconductors. This resulted in a supply-chain crisis and manufacturers struggled to meet the demand from several industries.However, over the past year, the issue has largely been resolved, which brought down the pressure of high demand from different industries.Besides, a number of interrelated issues, such as rising prices, geopolitical tensions, and pandemic aftereffects, have combined to cause the current short-term decline. These elements have influenced consumer spending, macroeconomic uncertainty and swings in semiconductor demand.For instance, the demand for semiconductors that power consumer gadgets like PCs, cellphones, and tablets have declined along with household expenditure on those items.Even then, demand for semiconductors is quite high, which is driving sales.Additionally, the need for semiconductors is being fueled by the development of technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and the Internet of Things.Our ChoicesGiven the continued demand, it would be wise to invest in semiconductor stocks. Below are four chip stocks that investors can gain from in the current scenario.Analog Devices is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing (“DSP”) integrated circuits.

28,baf71175-3bdf-396b-b6bc-dcf293375755,MET,2023-02-21,Why MetLife (MET) is a Top Dividend Stock for Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-metlife-met-top-dividend-164504149.html,1676911504,STORY,['MET-PE'],"[Whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.MetLife in FocusMetLife (MET) is headquartered in New York, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 0.23% since the start of the year. The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.5 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.76%. This compares to the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield of 1.92% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.58%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $2 is up 1% from last year. MetLife has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 4.54%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. MetLife's current payout ratio is 29%, meaning it paid out 29% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, MET expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $8.28 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 20.88%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, MET is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

29,562bb75f-77b3-394d-ab7d-d7f08b601771,O,2023-02-21,Biden urged not to approve oil terminals that could create ‘carbon bombs’,The Guardian,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-urged-not-approve-oil-130111778.html,1676984471,STORY,"['CL=F', 'NG=F']","[Photograph: Richard Carson/ReutersJoe Biden’s administration has been urged not to sink its own climate goals by approving an unprecedented ramp-up of oil export infrastructure off the Texas coast that could result in planet-heating emissions equivalent to three years of the US’s entire emissions output.Related: What do we know about the Ohio train derailment and toxic chemical leak?The federal government has already quietly approved the Sea Port oil terminal project, a proposed offshore oil platform located 35 miles off the Texas coast, south of Houston, and will decide whether to allow three other nearby oil terminal proposals. Combined, the four terminals would expand US oil exports by nearly 7m barrels every day, handling the capacity of half of all current national oil exports.Should all of these projects be allowed to proceed and then operate at full capacity for their expected 30-year lifespan, it will result in an incredible 24bn metric tonnes of greenhouse gases once the transported oil is burned, an analysis conducted for the Guardian by Global Energy Monitor has found.These huge “carbon bomb” projects, critics say, fatally undermine Biden’s image as a president who has acted decisively to stem the climate crisis. No new major fossil fuel infrastructure can be built if the world is to avoid dangerous global heating, the International Energy Agency has warned.“The amount of oil going through these projects, and the resulting emissions, are pretty astounding,” said Baird Langenbrunner, an analyst at Global Energy Monitor, who added that the emissions total is likely a worst-case scenario as it is unlikely all four terminals will be built and then operate at full capacity for decades.Interactive“But even if the emissions are a bit lower then, we are fast-forwarding ourselves to the date where we have to stop completely emitting,” said Langenbrunner. “Any extra emissions are in direct conflict with climate goals and it’s hypocritical for the Biden administration to allow these things to get built and then say the US wants to decrease its own emissions.”Story continuesThe oil shipped from the planned terminals would be extracted from the vast Permian basin that lies beneath Texas and New Mexico, and fed through a network of pipelines to huge tankers that would convey it from the Gulf of Mexico to buyers overseas. The emissions from the burned oil would not count towards the US’s total carbon pollution, which Biden has vowed to halve this decade, but will still escalate the disastrous climate crisis.The Sea Port oil terminal, a joint venture between Enterprise, Enbridge and Chevron, will be the US’s largest oil export terminal once built, with a capacity of 2m barrels a day. This is around a quarter of all the oil the US currently exports each day and is part of a national boom in oil extraction that will hit record levels this year and next, despite Biden’s climate pledges and Republican claims that the US president has shut down domestic drilling.The project will link 140 miles of land-based and underwater pipelines to an onshore storage facility near the city of Freeport. Two underwater pipelines will run to the deepwater port located offshore, a key requirement for an oil industry that is keen to shift huge amounts of the resource from the Permian basin but has been frustrated by a lack of deep ports on the Texas coast with the capacity for the very largest oil tankers.In November, the maritime administration, an arm of the US Department of Transport, approved the construction of the Sea Port oil terminal, referencing the heightened demand for new oil and gas in Europe following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The project “is in the national interest because the project will benefit employment, economic growth, and US energy infrastructure resilience and security”, the agency wrote in its decision. “The port will provide a reliable source of crude oil to US allies in the event of market disruption.”InteractiveThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also recommended that the Sea Port oil terminal go ahead, albeit with mitigating features to avoid “disproportionate adverse impacts” to low-income people and people of color who will probably bear the brunt of the new development. Brazoria county, which includes Freeport, already fails to meet national clean air standards for ozone, a pollutant linked to a range of respiratory problems.The approval of the port has triggered a lawsuit from a coalition of green and local groups, which allege the oil terminal will threaten the critically endangered Rice’s whale, expose already overburdened communities of color to toxic air and create emissions equivalent to running 90 coal-fired power plants, a situation they say is “a stain on the Biden administration’s climate and environmental justice record”.The maritime administration, meanwhile, is poised to decide upon permits for three other proposed terminals – called Texas Gulf Link, Blue Marlin Offshore Port and Bluewater Texas – that are at various stages of development. The Texas GulfLink project is located just a few miles from the Sea Port oil terminal, running through the small town of Jones Creek.Until 2015, when Congress lifted a ban on crude oil exports, the US barely exported any fossil fuels, but following a glut of shale oil and fracking activity the country is now the world’s third largest oil exporter and the leading exporter of liquified natural gas, or LNG.At least 16 gas export terminals have been approved or are under construction along the Gulf of Mexico coast, which, along with the new oil activity, has spurred fresh concerns among environmental justice advocates for coastal communities already dealing with toxic air pollution and safety concerns. In June last year, a large LNG export plant in Freeport exploded, due to what regulators say were systemic failures in its operation.The Bryan Mound strategic petroleum reserve near Freeport, Texas. The area is already home to many pollution-producing facilities. Photograph: Adrees Latif/Reuters“It’s shocking the number of pipelines we already have and the dangers we face, such as explosions and oil spills, it’s just too much,” said Melanie Oldham, an air quality activist and Freeport resident who said that many of her neighbours suffer asthma and other health conditions from living next to a tangle of polluting facilities.“We are a low-income community – 65% of people here are Hispanic and this seems to be where they always want to build oil terminal projects,” she said. “We are a sacrifice zone. It’s a constant worry and we just wonder when it will all stop.”Oldham was part of a protest in Washington DC last year over the proposed oil terminals, which ended with four arrests. She said she is “extremely disappointed” that Biden has overseen a surge in oil drilling, despite promising to shut it down when he was a candidate for president. Biden has repeatedly called for expanded oil drilling to bring down gasoline costs for US drivers and during his recent State of the Union address said: “We’re going to need oil for at least another decade, and beyond that.”The Biden administration’s continuing embrace of fossil fuel drilling projects, likely including the controversial Willow project in the Alaska Arctic, risks undermining its major triumphs in confronting the climate crisis, such as the passage last year of the Inflation Reduction Act, a $370bn (£308bn) package to shift the US to clean energy. Biden’s term has been a confounding one for many climate activists.“These oil terminals will lock us into decades of greenhouse gas emissions and jeopardises our ability to meet national and international climate goals,” said Kelsey Crane, senior policy advocate at Earthworks, an environmental group. “The Biden administration’s continued fossil fuel expansion contradicts the science on what we need to do to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of climate change.“We can’t invest in clean energy if we’re not phasing out fossil fuels – we need to reinstate the ban on oil exports and think about a managed decline for fossil fuels within this administration.”A spokesperson for the maritime administration didn’t answer questions on how its approvals fit in with climate goals but said the Sea Port oil terminal will create “a safer, more efficient mechanism for exporting oil”.]"

But that shouldn't obscure the pleasing returns achieved by shareholders over the last three years. After all, the share price is up a market-beating 68% in that time.While this past week has detracted from the company's three-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Occidental Petroleum became profitable within the last three years. So we would expect a higher share price over the period.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Occidental Petroleum's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Occidental Petroleum the TSR over the last 3 years was 75%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Occidental Petroleum shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 60% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 1.1% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Occidental Petroleum better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

At Least $3 MillionPutin Says Russia to Suspend New START Nuke Pact ParticipationPutin Halts Nuke Pact With US, Vows to Push War in UkraineWorld’s Largest Four-Day Work Week Trial Finds Few Are Going BackThe Biden White House Operated Under Cloak-and-Dagger Secrecy to Plan His Ukraine TripOverall flows last month were at the highest at any point since the invasion of Ukraine a year ago and surpassed a record set in April 2020, according to data intelligence firm Kpler. Exports of fuel oil surged to an all-time high.The buying spree was likely underpinned by private refiners, but state-owned processors are now showing more interest in Russian crude after concerns around potential blowback from the US and allies kept them on the sidelines.China is toe-to-toe with India as the biggest buyer of Russian crude after the war in Ukraine re-shaped global energy flows. Moscow has had to offer discounts to entice a shrinking pool of customers, a move welcomed by Asian buyers trying to control inflation. The West wants to deprive the Kremlin of funds for its war but would also like to keep a lid of on global oil prices.Russia’s overall crude and fuel oil exports to China reached 1.66 million barrels a day last month, according to Kpler data as of Feb. 20. That’s more than the previous record set in April 2020 when the Asian nation was emerging from its initial virus restrictions. Crude and condensate flows rose to 1.52 million barrels a day, just short of a record set almost three years ago.The uptick in Chinese buying is evidence the country’s economic recovery is picking up, which should help to buoy global oil prices. The International Energy Agency last week cited China for a boost in its demand forecasts, while OPEC producer Iran is tipping Brent to rise above $100 a barrel this year.Story continuesIt can take more than six weeks for cargoes shipped from Russia’s western ports to arrive in China, while barrels sent from the Far East typically arrive the same month.Offers for Russian Urals and ESPO crude were pegged at a discount of $13 and $8 a barrel, respectively, to Brent on a delivered basis, according to traders. That’s much cheaper than similar West African grades, which were priced at near parity or a premium to Brent.Asia’s largest economy has dominated buying of ESPO, a grade that can be shipped quickly from Russia’s Far East, since late-2022. Private refiners have been key consumers, but traders are watching for demand from state-owned refiners such as China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corp., or Sinopec, as well as CNOOC Ltd.China not only bought the entire monthly loading schedule of ESPO for January, it also purchased Arctic grades and Urals, said Viktor Katona, lead crude analyst at Kpler. Its buying spree on fuel oil mainly comes from the Black Sea and Baltic Sea regions, he said.Ship-tracking data indicates that more oil could flow to China from Russia’s western ports of Primorsk and Novorossiysk, where grades including Urals are loaded. The uptick can be partly attributed to state-run refiners speeding up purchases, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Russian exports of straight-run fuel oil and high-sulfur fuel oil to China hit a record of about 142,000 barrels a day in January, according to Kpler.Fuel oil can be processed in place of crude in large distillation units, or used in secondary plants such as cokers to make diesel or gasoline. HSFO can also be blended into marine fuel or bitumen. It was at a $16 to $17 a barrel discount to Brent before taxes, the traders said.China’s private refiners have been buying more straight-run fuel oil since late-2022 due to attractive prices, said Mia Geng, an analyst at industry consultant FGE. Private refiners sometimes opt to refine fuel oil over crude in an effort to skirt government-issued quotas meant to limit crude imports, but the recent surge in purchases was more likely due to processors being able to reap sizable profits from processing, she said.--With assistance from Kevin Dharmawan.(Updates with analyst quote in 10th paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Staged Bomb Scare That Backfired on Mumbai’s Notorious CopsZantac’s Maker Kept Quiet About Cancer Risks for 40 YearsThe World’s War Machine Is Running Low on AmmunitionHow to Make Sure Your Resume Isn’t Overlooked — Without LyingSpy Balloons Are the Slow and Silent Future of Surveillance©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Start your free 7-day trial to get this news first.Salesforce and Elliott Management negotiating a settlement: reportSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) and activist investor Elliott Management Corp are in talks to reach an agreement that may end a possible board challenge, according to the report from Reuters on Friday, citing two people familiar with the matter.Activist investors, including Elliott Management, have challenged Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff as the company's growth slowed sharply in recent quarters, resulting in a 10% workforce reduction announced last month.The software firm has faced criticism from Elliott, Inclusive Capital Partners and Starboard Value, who have pushed for increased growth and margins, more buybacks, and have expressed concerns about recent acquisitions.The possible settlement between Salesforce and Elliott, which unveiled its stake in January, could end the dispute, though details of the potential agreement are unknown. Neither Salesforce nor Elliott has commented on the matter.Natixis says it doesn't own a 6% stake in TeslaOn Wednesday, Natixis confirmed to InvestingPro that a reported 189,784,078-share stake in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which was disclosed in its recent Q4 13F filing with the SEC, was posted in error.The filling had caused a stir on Wall Street, as it would have represented a 6% stake in Tesla, worth $39.7 billion, and made Natixis one of the top 5 holders of the company.There was speculation that Natixis may have purchased the stock on behalf of a sovereign wealth fund, but that was found to be false. It seems that an additional ""zero"" was mistakenly added to the stake. Natixis told InvestingPro they would refile its 13F with the correct stake amount.Silvergate Capital surges on Kenneth Griffin's Citadel Securities stake disclosureCitadel Securities reported a 5.5% stake in cryptocurrency-focused lender Silvergate Capital (NYSE:SI) Corp worth about $25M, according to a Reuters article on Tuesday. Following the report, Silvergate shares surged 18% and closed the week with more than a 20% gain.Story continuesA person familiar with the matter said that this disclosure is a result of the firm's market making operations, rather than a directional investment in Silvergate.Later the same day, Soros Fund Management disclosed a put options position against 100,000 shares of Silvergate in a regulatory filing. Based on Silvergate's closing price of $17.40 at the end of 2022, the value of those shares would be about $1.74M. Details regarding the strike price of the puts, their value, and whether they are part of a broader trade remain unknown.Michael Burry’s Scion bets big on Chinese giantsMichael Burry's Scion Asset Management fund turned over nearly its entire portfolio in Q4 2022, according to its latest 13F filing. The famed Big Short investor sold off most of his cable industry and private prison industry positions while making a sizable bet on two Chinese giants.Burry had purchased 50,000 shares of Alibaba (HK:9988) (NYSE:BABA) worth $4.4M and opened a $4.2M position in JD.com (HK:9618) (NASDAQ:JD), potentially anticipating the reopening of China this year. Burry's last positions also include MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM). Scion closed its positions in CoreCivic (NYSE:CXW) and Charter Communications Inc (NASDAQ:CHTR).YouTube CEO steps down Turning to management changes, Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube, has announced her decision to step back from her role after almost 25 years at Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG). In a note sent to YouTube employees on Thursday, Wojcicki said she plans to focus on personal projects, family, and health, and will be replaced by Neal Mohan, who will take over as the new head of YouTube.Wojcicki will continue to work with Mohan to help with the transition, coach team members, and meet with creators in the short term, and will take on an advisory role across Google and Alphabet in the longer term.2 more big management changes this past weekRestaurant Brands (NYSE:QSR) appointed Joshua Kobza as the company's CEO effective March 1, 2023, as part of its ongoing succession planning process.Kobza has held several senior roles with the company over the last 11 years, including CFO, CTO and Development Officer, and COO.DoorDash (NYSE:DASH) COO Christopher Payne announced his intention to resign, effective March 1, 2023. He will remain with the company through a transition period and retire at the end of May 2023.Related ArticlesSalesforce and Elliott in talks: Hedge funds and C-suites weekly | Pro RecapWalmart earnings beat by $0.19, revenue topped estimatesAnalysis-Looming U.S. default risk prompts investors to cut some debt exposure]"

When the yield curve inverts, it reflects long-term interest rates falling below short-term rates. The move is indicative of investors putting more money to work in longer dated bonds amid fear of near-term economic prospects.Fear an inverted yield curve?Second, according to Matejka, money supply continues to move lower in the both the U.S. and Europe as interest rates remain on an upward trajectory.And lastly is that bank lending standards have been tightening, leading to slower demand for credit and usually serving as a precursor to recessions.""We do not see recession as off the table now, and believe the rally will fade as we move through Q1,"" Matejka wrote. ""Recession view is being priced out… however, key monetary signals are all sending warnings signs.""A woman walks by Caution Falling Ice sign in downtown Chicago, Illinois, on January 26, 2021. (Photo by KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI/AFP via Getty Images)Thus far in 2023, markets have ignored all of these macro warning signals. Investors have also overlooked a borderline dreadful earnings season.The blended earnings decline for the fourth quarter for the S&amp;P 500 is tracking at 4.7% according to Factset. If this drop holds, it will mark the first year on year profit decline for the S&amp;P 500 since the third quarter of 2020.Yet, here we are with solid returns in markets year to date.The Nasdaq Composite has churned out a 12.6% gain year-to-date on the back of pure hype around new artificial intelligence applications from the likes of Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA). Hopes for a Fed pivot on interest rate policy have only lit a further flame to the bid in often high-risk tech stocks.Story continuesThe S&amp;P 500 has advanced 6.2%, meanwhile, as investors position for a rebound of the Chinese economy following the loosening of COVID lockdowns.At the same time, various Fed officials have walked back any talk of a pivot on interest rates this month, which has weighed on stocks this month. And earnings from the likes of Walmart and Home Depot this week stand to offer up a mixed view on the U.S. consumer, at best.All in all, as argued by Matejka, investors may be setting themselves for a springtime disappointment as reasons to be optimistic take a few hits.""Now fed funds are almost 5%, quantitative tightening is proceeding, the yield curve is negative (has been for three months), and M2 in February is probably down almost -3% year on year (a significant decline),"" EvercoreISI chairman Ed Hyman wrote in a research note.

Secure your seat todayNefarious market participants are attempting to cash in on the ongoing ChatGPT craze in technology circles by issuing fake tokens branded after the artificial intelligence chatbot despite having no official association with the tool.Hundreds of such tokens have been issued in the past few weeks. Of this, 132 different tokens have been issued on BNB Chain, 25 tokens on Ethereum and 10 separate tokens on other blockchains such as Solana, Arbitrum, OKChain and Cronos.These fake issuances follow software giant Microsoft’s move to integrate OpenAI’s chatbots for search services on Microsoft’s internet browsers.While OpenAI is the creator of ChatGPT, Microsoft’s own chatbot is a bespoke tool and is said to be an improvement over the publicly accessible ChatGPT.Scammers are not wasting a chance to monetize on the hype, however. Several “BingChatGPT” have been issued, seeded with liquidity and are seeing thousands of dollars in trading volumes – despite red flags.“PeckShield has detected dozens of newly created #BingChatGPT tokens, of which 3 appear to be #honeypots &amp; 2 have high sell tax,” blockchain security firm PeckShield said in a tweet Monday.“2 of them have already dropped over -99%.

Console-making rival Sony Group Corp. has objected, saying that Microsoft will eventually turn Call of Duty and other marquee titles in the Activision portfolio into exclusives for its Xbox console and subscription service. Call of Duty is consistently at the top of sales charts and its most recent release has occupied the No. 1 spot in the US since its launch in November, according to market tracker NPD.For Nintendo, which is known for producing family-oriented content like homemaking simulator Animal Crossing or the cartoonish paintball shooter Splatoon, Call of Duty is an unusually adult-themed title. But expanding into other genres would help the Kyoto-based games maker retain players on its own platforms and prevent them from looking elsewhere, analysts said.“We need to remember kids grow up and customer retention is always less costly than customer acquisition,” said Carolina Milanesi, principal analyst at Creative Strategies. “You can remain a family-friendly brand even with content that is not strictly kid-oriented. Apple has been very successful in doing so with Apple TV+. It is about striking a balance, but also about values, parental controls and privacy.”Story continuesA Nintendo spokesperson confirmed the agreement with Microsoft but declined to comment further.

View our latest analysis for Parker-Hannifin While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational.

This EPS growth is lower than the 14% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Parker-Hannifin, it has a TSR of 109% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Parker-Hannifin has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 21% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 16%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Parker-Hannifin better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   4 warning signs for Parker-Hannifin  you should be aware of, and 1 of them makes us a bit uncomfortable.Parker-Hannifin is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

Same-unit revenues attributable to patient volume inched up 4.1% year over year on the back of solid growth across all services.Total operating expenses increased 10.9% year over year to $477.8 million due to a 14.8% escalation in practice supplies and other operating expenses, a 10.2% uptick in practice salaries and benefits and a 16.6% rise in depreciation and amortization expenses. The figure came higher than our estimate of $442.5 million.General and administrative expenses of $51.1 million dropped 13.4% year over year in the fourth quarter, courtesy of cost savings resulting from net staffing reductions, a decline in incentive compensation expense and lower revenue cycle management expenses.Interest expense plunged 39.8% year over year to $10 million, attributable to a declining debt level and reduced interest rates from the refinancing transactions of Pediatrix closed in the first quarter of 2022.Adjusted EBITDA of $66.5 million tumbled 17.9% year over year in the quarter under review but surpassed our estimate of $65.7 million.Story continuesFinancial Update (as of Dec 31, 2022)Pediatrix exited 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $9.8 million, which declined nearly 40-fold from the 2021-end figure as the company used cash to redeem its 6.25% senior notes and pay-related fees and expenses.Total assets of nearly $2,347 million decreased from $2,722 million at 2021-end.Net debt, including finance leases, amounted to $645 million, down from $1,004 million at 2021-end.Total equity of $891.6 million slipped from $896.7 million at 2021-end.In 2022, net cash provided by operating activities more than doubled the past year’s figure of $76.7 million to $166 million.Pediatrix repaid substantially all their borrowings on the revolving credit facility bringing down the leverage to 2.6.Preliminary 2023 ViewFor 2023, management anticipates adjusted EBITDA within $235-$245 million compared with $241 million in 2022.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Goldman Sachs in FocusHeadquartered in New York, Goldman Sachs (GS) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 7.32% so far this year. The investment bank is currently shelling out a dividend of $2.5 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.71%. This compares to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.43% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.58%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $10 is up 11.1% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Goldman Sachs has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 29.39%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Goldman's current payout ratio is 33%. This means it paid out 33% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.GS is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $32.64 per share, with earnings expected to increase 8.58% from the year ago period.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, GS is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:GPN) insiders sold US$3.2m worth of stock, possibly signalling a downtrend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-payments-inc-nyse-gpn-110016663.html,1676977216,STORY,['GPN'],"[Over the past year, many Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Global Payments Global Payments Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Senior EVP, David Green, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.1m worth of shares at a price of US$130 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$116). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 8.65k shares worth US$835k. But insiders sold 25.57k shares worth US$3.2m. All up, insiders sold more shares in Global Payments than they bought, over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Global Payments Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last quarter, Global Payments insiders have spent a meaningful amount on shares. We can see that Independent Director Robert H. Baldwin paid US$335k for shares in the company. No-one sold. That shows some optimism about the company's future.Story continuesDoes Global Payments Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Global Payments insiders own 0.9% of the company, worth about US$273m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The Global Payments Insider Transactions Indicate?The recent insider purchase is heartening. On the other hand the transaction history, over the last year, isn't so positive. The recent buying by an insider , along with high insider ownership, suggest that Global Payments insiders are fairly aligned, and optimistic. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example, Global Payments has 3 warning signs (and 1 which is concerning) we think you should know about.But note: Global Payments may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

In the last reported quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 15.15%.Perrigo’s shares have lost 1.4% in the past year compared to the industry’s decline of 35.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPerrigo’s earnings performance has been dismal over the trailing four quarters. The company’s earnings missed estimates in three of the last four quarters and beat the same once, registering a negative earnings surprise of 7.93% on average.Perrigo Company plc Price and EPS Surprise Perrigo Company plc Price and EPS SurprisePerrigo Company plc price-eps-surprise | Perrigo Company plc Quote Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors at PlayIn the fourth quarter, the performance of Perrigo’s Consumer Self Care Americas (“CSCA”) and Consumer Self Care International (“CSCI”) segments is expected to have been aided by products added through its HRA Pharma acquisition. Significant sales growth of new products is likely to have boosted sales further during the soon-to-be-reported quarter. However, currency movements are likely to have an unfavorable impact on the company’s ex-U.S. sales.Strong demand for cough/cold products globally and higher demand for infant formula in the U.S. are also likely to have boosted the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Perrigo reported higher net price realization for its products through strategic price increases during the third quarter. The improving price trend will likely be reflected in the company’s fourth-quarter sales, benefiting the top line.However, loss of sales due to discontinued products and the exited businesses might have offset the gain from the new products.To reduce its structural cost base and improve profitability in its operations, management initiated a supply chain reinvention program in 2022. As part of this program, Perrigo announced last November that it made a $170-million strategic investment and bought Nestle’s Gateway infant formula plant to strengthen its infant formula manufacturing in the United States. It also bought the U.S. and Canadian rights to Good Start infant formula and other related brands.Story continuesWe expect macroeconomic factors like cost headwinds (including the higher cost of goods sold), the rising cost of capital and supply chain disruptions in certain parts of the world amid the Russia-Ukraine war to have hurt the company’s operating margins.Investors are likely to ask questions about potential product launches this year. We also expect management to provide an update on the expected impact of macroeconomic pressures in 2023.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Perrigo this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. Unfortunately, that is not thecase here, as you will see below.

Per management, this resulted from higher demand and price achievement from the start of the multi-year portable medical exit that the company announced in 2021.Revenues at the Cardio &amp; Vascular business totaled $185.7 million, up 19.8% from the prior-year quarter on a reported basis and up 13.1% organically. The strong year-over-year performance was driven by strong organic demand across all markets, especially the structural heart and key products (such as guidewires) and incremental sales from Oscor and Aran acquisitions. The business also benefited from the improved delivery performance from the complex catheter supplier that negatively impacted the third quarter of 2022.Story continuesRevenues at the Cardiac Rhythm Management &amp; Neuromodulation business were $142.7 million, up 13.7% year over year on a reported and up 8.1% on an organic basis. The business was driven by sales growth in Oscor and improved supplier delivery performance compared with the prior-year period, particularly for neuromodulation products.This compares to our fourth-quarter projections of $26.3 million, $186 million and $137.7 million, respectively, for each of the product lines.Revenues in the Non-Medical segment totaled $15.6 million, up 40.9% year over year. This was driven by strong sales at the Electrochem product line, part of the Non-Medical segment, across all market segments and supplier delivery recovery.This figure compares to our segmental projection of $11.5 million for the fourth quarter.Integer Holdings Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseInteger Holdings Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseInteger Holdings Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Integer Holdings Corporation QuoteMargin AnalysisInteger Holdings generated a gross profit of $97.9 million in the fourth quarter, up 19.6% year over year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.49 billion.The company expects full-year adjusted EPS to be in the band of $4.00-$4.30 (suggesting a rise of 3-11% from the 2022 reported figure). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $4.22.Our TakeInteger Holdings exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected results. The strong year-over-year top-line and bottom-line performances are impressive. Robust performances by both segments and strength in all three product lines of the Medical Sales segment are encouraging. Continued benefits from the Oscor and Aran acquisitions look promising. The expansion of both margins bodes well for the stock.Integer Holdings’ strong product development pipeline in high-growth markets, emerging customer product launches, successful tuck-in acquisitions and underlying strength of existing programs also look promising for the stock.However, the company’s business was continued to be widely hampered by challenging labor and supply chain environment, which raised our apprehension.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderInteger Holdings currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc. CAH, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 10 Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks Today.2022 was one of the worst years for the NASDAQ, primarily because it is dominated by tech, and tech stocks crashed as interest rates climbed. The NASDAQ lost roughly more than one-third of its value in 2022. However, in 2023 things seem to have taken an interesting turn. The NASDAQ has been rising and, as of February 17, the tech-heavy index has gained 13.48% year to date.""I Think Growth Comes Back and Tech Outperforms""Is the tech sector making a comeback in 2023? Fundstrat's head of technical strategy, Mark Newton, thinks so. On February 7, Mark Newton appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed why he thinks growth and technology are making a comeback in 2023. Here are some comments from Mark Newton:""There's 3 main things for investors to look at. One is that momentum and breadth have improved substantially in the last couple of months. The second is that, we are in seasonally a very bullish period. Pre-election year seasonality for the first quarter is better than any other of the 16 quarters that make up the presidential cycle. The third is that we continue to see pretty excessive bearish sentiment across the board... The near term sentiment has gotten a little more optimistic. However, if we saw anything from recent reports of investor risk, people are very much on the sidelines and we're seeing very high levels of investor cash. That makes me think that we are in very much a bull market that can continue.""Mark Newton's views are remarkably similar to those of billionaire investor Ken Fisher. Newton thinks that the market bottomed somewhere in October 2022 and now we are in a bull market. Newton thinks that technology, which was one of the worst-performing sectors in 2022, is now making a comeback. Newton supported his thesis by elaborating on how the market has ""gone from extreme pessimism to now skepticism"". While ""we haven't reached bullishness yet"", according to Mark Newton, ""the market's respecting inflation selling off sharply as well as a pivot potentially with the Fed"".Story continuesMark Newton thinks ""both energy and healthcare have a chance of snapping back"". However, he sees tech ""being a phenomenally good sector to position in for 2023"". According to Mark Newton, interest rates will ""continue to come down over the course of the year"" and ""that should fuel growth"". Newton thinks ""growth comes back and tech outperforms"" in 2023, and he also revealed that his year-end target for the S&amp;P 500 is 4,500.Some of the most profitable NASDAQ stocks today are Meta Platforms, Inc.

We considered the annual net income as a measure of a company's profitability. We narrowed down our screen and looked for companies that had a trailing twelve-month net income of greater than $4 billion. We used data from Yahoo Finance to verify each company’s net income and finally picked the 25 companies that had reported the highest annual net income for fiscal 2022. We have ranked these stocks in ascending order of their TTM net income, as of fiscal 2022. Since companies use different fiscal years, we have mentioned the end-date of each company’s fiscal year along with its net income.Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks Today25.

(NASDAQ:REGN) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“There have been some bright spots in our long book. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”23.

The company reported better-than-expected subscriber additions for 3Q and provided strong 4Q guidance. Netflix added 2.4 million subscribers in the quarter, beating the Street’s expectation of 1.1 million added subscribers, and management guided to 4.5 million subscriber additions for 4Q, above expectations for 4.1 million.We believe that 2022 was an inflection year for Netflix as the company became free cash flow (“FCF”) positive during 1Q22 and FCF should scale from here (management guided to $1 billion FCF for 2022). A combination of strategic initiatives, price increases and a stabilization of content investment should position the company for high-single digit annual revenue growth, while driving improved operating margin to more than 25% over the next few years. Revenue grew 6% for 3Q22 and operating margin was 19%, up from 10% in 2018. In addition to its opportunities in TV and movie streaming, the company recently launched a mobile gaming service that opens an additional $100 billion-plus market for future growth.”In addition to tech giants Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:GILD) was the top contributor in the quarter based on positive data released in a study evaluating Trodelvy versus comparative chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The detailed findings increased investor confidence the drug would receive incremental approvals for a broader range of breast cancer treatments.

After a qualitative review of Lam Research, we believe the company will face a number of headwinds that could make for an unfavorable risk-reward position, given the highly cyclical nature of its business in a slowing global economy. We are also expecting fundamentals to turn negative as sales and operating profits are poised to decelerate, resulting in negative earnings revisions. While the stock trades at an attractive valuation multiple, we believe that this is more a sign that earnings will decline meaningfully.”20. Adobe Inc.

Adobe also has a suite of customer experience products that help other businesses sell more easily to consumers. All of Adobe’s products have high switching costs and sold on a subscription basis.Adobe’s business qualities enable extremely high margins and predictable, recurring revenues. The company had revenues of $17.6 billion in its last fiscal year with operating margins in the mid-30s. The company has also grown revenues at double-digit rates every year since 2015. Despite a good record of investing in its businesses, it still has an excess of cash on its balance sheet. As such, Adobe has returned cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. Since 2015 the company has returned a total of $24.5 billion.”19. Honeywell International Inc.

Throughout 2022, investors became increasingly concerned about a cyclical downturn in semiconductors and pending trade regulations that would restrict the sale of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment to Chinese customers.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors was dominated by  Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”13.

Two of our top five largest individual detractors for the period were in the health care sector: Sanofi(NASDAQ:SNY) and Bayer (OTCPK:BAYZF). Sanofi, a French pharmaceutical and health care company, saw its share price fall after it was named as a co-defendant in a class action lawsuit alleging that Sanofi and other sellers of the heartburn medication Zantac failed to warn of the drug’s risk of containing a possible carcinogen.”12.

Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”11. Micron Technology, Inc.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this internet video service have returned +1.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.4% change. The Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, to which Netflix belongs, has gained 7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Netflix is expected to post earnings of $2.81 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -20.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $11.18 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12.4%. This estimate has changed +5.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.29 indicates a change of +27.8% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.7%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Netflix is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NFLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Netflix, the consensus sales estimate of $8.18 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.9%. The $34.15 billion and $38.12 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +8% and +11.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNetflix reported revenues of $7.85 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.9%. EPS of $0.12 for the same period compares with $1.33 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.84 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.18%. The EPS surprise was -74.47%.Over the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Netflix is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One stock to keep an eye on is PBF Energy (PBF). PBF is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 4.53. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 5.61. Over the last 12 months, PBF's Forward P/E has been as high as 17.43 and as low as 1.56, with a median of 4.31.Investors should also recognize that PBF has a P/B ratio of 1.13. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 2. Within the past 52 weeks, PBF's P/B has been as high as 2.09 and as low as 0.78, with a median of 1.07.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. PBF has a P/S ratio of 0.11. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.28.Story continuesFinally, investors should note that PBF has a P/CF ratio of 1.95. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 4.27. Over the past year, PBF's P/CF has been as high as 7.13 and as low as 1.41, with a median of 2.08.If you're looking for another solid Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing value stock, take a look at Phillips 66 (PSX).

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Phillips 66 (PSX) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Phillips 66 currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.00, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 2.00 indicates Buy.Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, six are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 42.9% and 14.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PSXBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PSXCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Phillips 66 here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Phillips 66, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is PSX Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Phillips 66, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 5% over the past month to $15.25.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Phillips 66. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Phillips 66 may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this oil refiner have returned -6.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.4% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Phillips 66 belongs, has lost 2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Phillips 66 is expected to post earnings of $3.86 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +192.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +23%.The consensus earnings estimate of $15.25 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -18.8%. This estimate has changed +5% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.87 indicates a change of -15.6% from what Phillips 66 is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +9%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Phillips 66.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PSX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Phillips 66, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $35.09 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $144.74 billion and $130.42 billion estimates indicate -17.6% and -9.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPhillips 66 reported revenues of $40.91 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.9%. EPS of $4 for the same period compares with $2.94 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $34.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +19.26%. The EPS surprise was -7.83%.Over the last four quarters, Phillips 66 surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Phillips 66 is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Phillips 66. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 10 Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks Today.2022 was one of the worst years for the NASDAQ, primarily because it is dominated by tech, and tech stocks crashed as interest rates climbed. The NASDAQ lost roughly more than one-third of its value in 2022. However, in 2023 things seem to have taken an interesting turn. The NASDAQ has been rising and, as of February 17, the tech-heavy index has gained 13.48% year to date.""I Think Growth Comes Back and Tech Outperforms""Is the tech sector making a comeback in 2023? Fundstrat's head of technical strategy, Mark Newton, thinks so. On February 7, Mark Newton appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed why he thinks growth and technology are making a comeback in 2023. Here are some comments from Mark Newton:""There's 3 main things for investors to look at. One is that momentum and breadth have improved substantially in the last couple of months. The second is that, we are in seasonally a very bullish period. Pre-election year seasonality for the first quarter is better than any other of the 16 quarters that make up the presidential cycle. The third is that we continue to see pretty excessive bearish sentiment across the board... The near term sentiment has gotten a little more optimistic. However, if we saw anything from recent reports of investor risk, people are very much on the sidelines and we're seeing very high levels of investor cash. That makes me think that we are in very much a bull market that can continue.""Mark Newton's views are remarkably similar to those of billionaire investor Ken Fisher. Newton thinks that the market bottomed somewhere in October 2022 and now we are in a bull market. Newton thinks that technology, which was one of the worst-performing sectors in 2022, is now making a comeback. Newton supported his thesis by elaborating on how the market has ""gone from extreme pessimism to now skepticism"". While ""we haven't reached bullishness yet"", according to Mark Newton, ""the market's respecting inflation selling off sharply as well as a pivot potentially with the Fed"".Story continuesMark Newton thinks ""both energy and healthcare have a chance of snapping back"". However, he sees tech ""being a phenomenally good sector to position in for 2023"". According to Mark Newton, interest rates will ""continue to come down over the course of the year"" and ""that should fuel growth"". Newton thinks ""growth comes back and tech outperforms"" in 2023, and he also revealed that his year-end target for the S&amp;P 500 is 4,500.Some of the most profitable NASDAQ stocks today are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Let's now discuss these stocks, among others, in detail.25 Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks TodayPhoto by Pascal Bernardon on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe screened for companies trading on the NASDAQ. We considered the annual net income as a measure of a company's profitability. We narrowed down our screen and looked for companies that had a trailing twelve-month net income of greater than $4 billion. We used data from Yahoo Finance to verify each company’s net income and finally picked the 25 companies that had reported the highest annual net income for fiscal 2022. We have ranked these stocks in ascending order of their TTM net income, as of fiscal 2022. Since companies use different fiscal years, we have mentioned the end-date of each company’s fiscal year along with its net income.Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks Today25.

(NASDAQ:REGN) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“There have been some bright spots in our long book. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”23. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 115Net Income (TTM) as of December 31, 2022: $4.49 billionFor the trailing twelve-month period ending on December 31, 2022, Netflix, Inc.

The company reported better-than-expected subscriber additions for 3Q and provided strong 4Q guidance. Netflix added 2.4 million subscribers in the quarter, beating the Street’s expectation of 1.1 million added subscribers, and management guided to 4.5 million subscriber additions for 4Q, above expectations for 4.1 million.We believe that 2022 was an inflection year for Netflix as the company became free cash flow (“FCF”) positive during 1Q22 and FCF should scale from here (management guided to $1 billion FCF for 2022). A combination of strategic initiatives, price increases and a stabilization of content investment should position the company for high-single digit annual revenue growth, while driving improved operating margin to more than 25% over the next few years. Revenue grew 6% for 3Q22 and operating margin was 19%, up from 10% in 2018. In addition to its opportunities in TV and movie streaming, the company recently launched a mobile gaming service that opens an additional $100 billion-plus market for future growth.”In addition to tech giants Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:GILD) was the top contributor in the quarter based on positive data released in a study evaluating Trodelvy versus comparative chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The detailed findings increased investor confidence the drug would receive incremental approvals for a broader range of breast cancer treatments. Shares also received a boost on news the TAF patent portfolio for HIV drugs will be extended from the middle of this decade through the early 2030s, thereby lengthening the company’s long-term opportunity in the virology market.”21.

After a qualitative review of Lam Research, we believe the company will face a number of headwinds that could make for an unfavorable risk-reward position, given the highly cyclical nature of its business in a slowing global economy. We are also expecting fundamentals to turn negative as sales and operating profits are poised to decelerate, resulting in negative earnings revisions. While the stock trades at an attractive valuation multiple, we believe that this is more a sign that earnings will decline meaningfully.”20. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 93Net Income (TTM) as of November 30, 2022: $4.75 billionAt the close of the third quarter of 2022, 93 hedge funds were eager on Adobe Inc.

Adobe also has a suite of customer experience products that help other businesses sell more easily to consumers. All of Adobe’s products have high switching costs and sold on a subscription basis.Adobe’s business qualities enable extremely high margins and predictable, recurring revenues. The company had revenues of $17.6 billion in its last fiscal year with operating margins in the mid-30s. The company has also grown revenues at double-digit rates every year since 2015. Despite a good record of investing in its businesses, it still has an excess of cash on its balance sheet. As such, Adobe has returned cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. Since 2015 the company has returned a total of $24.5 billion.”19. Honeywell International Inc.

Charter is not sitting still; the company is adapting via footprint expansion into underserved areas, price-advantaged mobile line growth, and so on. Charter’s hefty free cash flows are valuable in the hands of proven, astute capital allocators.

With Comcast, uncertainty surrounding broadband growth due to rising competition and lower market activity, as well as the continued deterioration of the traditional media business, led to a less attractive risk/ reward tradeoff and we chose to reallocate that capital to more attractive ideas.”16.

Throughout 2022, investors became increasingly concerned about a cyclical downturn in semiconductors and pending trade regulations that would restrict the sale of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment to Chinese customers. This uncertainty caused the stock to become oversold, in our opinion. The stock price recovered in the fourth quarter as investors were able to size the impact of export controls and, we believe, as investors increasingly understood the long-term, structural demand for semiconductors and the equipment that produces them.”14.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors was dominated by  Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”13.

Two of our top five largest individual detractors for the period were in the health care sector: Sanofi(NASDAQ:SNY) and Bayer (OTCPK:BAYZF). Sanofi, a French pharmaceutical and health care company, saw its share price fall after it was named as a co-defendant in a class action lawsuit alleging that Sanofi and other sellers of the heartburn medication Zantac failed to warn of the drug’s risk of containing a possible carcinogen.”12.

Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”11. Micron Technology, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At AmgenIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP, Jonathan Graham, sold US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$242 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$241. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).In the last year Amgen insiders didn't buy any company stock.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Amgen insiders own 0.1% of the company, currently worth about US$192m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Amgen Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Amgen insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for Amgen that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course Amgen may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Its operating subsidiaries are: PSEG Power, Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&amp;G) and PSEG Long Island. (PRNewsfoto/PSEG)PSEG also reported Net Income for the fourth quarter of 2022 of $788 million, or $1.58 per share.  This compares to Net Income of $445 million, or $0.88 per share in 2021's fourth quarter.  Non-GAAP Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $318 million, or $0.64 per share, compared to fourth quarter 2021 non-GAAP Operating Earnings of $352 million, or $0.69 per share.  Non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022 and 2021, respectively, exclude items shown in Attachments 8 and 9.""We are pleased to report strong operating and financial results for 2022, marking the 18th year in a row that PSEG has delivered results within management's non-GAAP Operating Earnings guidance.  The main contributor to our results, PSE&amp;G, posted an 8.2% annual increase in Net Income, representing approximately 90% of PSEG's consolidated non-GAAP Operating Earnings,"" said Ralph LaRossa – chair, president and chief executive officer of PSEG.""PSEG successfully navigated last year's challenges including inflation, supply chain disruptions, energy price spikes, and the steep rise in interest rates to deliver financial results above the midpoint of our 2022 non-GAAP Operating Earnings guidance.  The Edison Electric Institute recognized PSE&amp;G with its 2022 Edison Award, the electric power industry's highest honor for leadership and innovation.  We completed the sale of our fossil generating plants in February 2022, which simplified our business mix to approximately 90% regulated, and completed a $500 million share repurchase in May 2022.  The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act last August will help to preserve the financial viability of our carbon-free nuclear fleet into the next decade, and creates valuable incentives in the near-term for our customers to transition to electric vehicles and advance New Jersey's decarbonization goals.""Story continues""The simplified business platform created by the strategic actions PSEG has taken over the past two years now drives our long-term, compound annual earnings growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2027.  Moving into this year, we extended our 2022 dividend increase of $0.12 per share to set the 2023 indicative rate at $2.28 per share – a testament to the financial discipline that has enabled us to pay a common dividend to our shareholders for 116 years.""""Recognizing the critical importance shareholders place on the predictability and visibility of our financial results and goals, I have made increasing both factors a key focus of PSEG's strategic plan.  We intend to share the details of this plan at our upcoming investor conference on March 10.  I am honored to lead this company and its 12,500 dedicated employees.  Together, we will be guided by PSEG's longstanding commitment to operational excellence, disciplined investment and financial strength as we continue building a practical path towards decarbonizing the New Jersey economy,"" said LaRossa.The following tables provide a reconciliation of PSEG's Net Income/(Loss) to non-GAAP Operating Earnings for the full year and the fourth quarter.

O&amp;M was flat versus the prior-year quarter.  Higher distribution depreciation and interest expense each reduced results by $0.01 per share, reflecting higher plant in service and investment.  Lower pension expense added $0.01 per share versus the year-ago quarter.  Flow through taxes, the impact of lower shares, and other items added $0.10 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, with $0.07 of that amount reversing the timing impact of taxes from prior quarters in 2022.During 2022, the BPU authorized our $511 million Infrastructure Advancement Program (IAP) to improve the reliability of the ""last mile"" of our electric distribution system and address aging substations and gas metering and regulation stations.  PSE&amp;G invested over $3 billion in planned capital spending to upgrade transmission and distribution facilities, enhance reliability and increase resiliency, implement clean energy future programs, and launch the IAP.  At year-end 2022, PSE&amp;G's rate base was approximately $26.4 billion, a 7.7% increase over year-end 2021.The number of Electric and Gas customers, the driver of margin growth under the CIP, rose by approximately 1% each in 2022.  Weather-normalized Electric sales increased by ~2% for the year; with Residential sales flat, while C&amp;I sales increased by ~3%.  Weather-normalized Gas sales were flat for the year, with Residential sales down by ~1%, while C&amp;I sales increased by ~2%.Earlier in February 2023, PSE&amp;G reduced its Basic Gas Supply Service residential rate by $0.15 to $0.50 cents per therm for the balance of the winter 2022/2023 heating season.  This decrease in the pass-through commodity charge will reduce the typical residential winter gas bill by $13 per month, or 11.5%.  On the electric side, the BPU recently completed its annual Basic Generation Service auction for default electric supply rates beginning June 1, 2023.  A typical PSE&amp;G residential customer will see this latest BGS auction reflected in an average estimated monthly bill increase of 3.3%.During 2022, PSE&amp;G was named the most reliable electric utility in the Mid-Atlantic region for the 21st year in a row by PA Consulting.  In addition, PSE&amp;G ranked first in Residential customer satisfaction in the East among large utilities in both the Electric and Gas J.D. Power 2022 Studies.We have narrowed PSE&amp;G's forecast of Net Income for 2023 to $1,500 million - $1,525 million, which reflects lower pension and OPEB income compared to 2022, offset by the benefit of near contemporaneously recovered investments, the predictability of utility margin from the Conservation Incentive Program, as well as the implementation of the pension accounting filing effective January 1, 2023.PSEG Carbon-Free, Infrastructure &amp; Other (CFIO)Carbon-Free, Infrastructure &amp; Other Fourth Quarter &amp; Full Year Comparative Results($ millions, except per share amounts)4Q 20224Q 2021FY 2022FY 2021Net Income/(Loss)$436$174$(534)$(2,094)Earnings/(Loss) Per Share (EPS)$0.88$0.35$(1.06)$(4.16)Non-GAAP Operating Earnings$(34)$81$174$407Non-GAAP EPS (Loss)$(0.06)$0.16$0.35$0.80For full-year 2022, CFIO's Net Loss of $534 million reflected higher losses on both mark-to-market transactions and nuclear decommissioning trust (NDT) fund related activity. The Net Loss for full-year 2021 included impairments and debt extinguishment costs related to the Fossil sale.  Non-GAAP Operating Earnings declined to $174 million from $407 million for the full-year 2021, reflecting the absence of Fossil.For the fourth quarter of 2022, CFIO's Net Income improved to $436 million, from $174 million in the prior year period, reflecting higher gains on mark-to market transactions and NDT fund related activity.  Net Income for the fourth quarter of 2021 included debt extinguishment costs and other charges related to the Fossil sale. The non-GAAP Operating Earnings of ($34) million compares to non-GAAP Operating Earnings of $81 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, which included the cessation of depreciation and lower interest costs related to the Fossil sale.The nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 85.8% during the fourth quarter, which included a scheduled refueling at our 100%-owned Hope Creek station, and produced 7.3 TWh of generation. An unplanned outage at Salem unit 2 in late December 2022 occurred during a PJM region-wide generation emergency action and resulted in capacity performance penalties.  The net financial impact of the outage, including replacement power, capacity penalties, as well as bonuses earned by the other operating PSEG units, is not expected to be material.For the full-year, the nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 92.2% and produced 31.3 TWh of carbon-free, base load power.  PSEG is forecasting total baseload nuclear generation of approximately 31 TWh for the full year of 2023, hedged 95%-100% at an average price of $31 per MWh – an increase of approximately $4 per MWh compared to 2022.  For 2024, total nuclear generation is forecast to be approximately 31 TWh and is 55%-60% hedged at an average price of $32 per MWh.PSEG Power had net cash collateral postings of $1.5 billion at December 31, primarily related to out-of-the-money hedge positions because of higher energy prices throughout 2022.  As of February 17, 2023, net cash collateral postings were approximately $700 million, reflecting recent declines in power prices.In January 2023, PSEG announced it would sell its 25% equity interest in the Ocean Wind 1 offshore wind generation project to Ørsted.  The sale is expected to close in the first half of 2023.  PSEG has also decided not to exercise its option to purchase 50% of Ørsted's two Skipjack generating projects in Maryland or pursue an ownership interest in Ørsted's Ocean Wind 2 project or other offshore wind generation projects.  PSEG is evaluating its options for the potential sale of its 50% interest in Garden State Offshore Energy, which holds rights to an offshore wind lease area south of New Jersey.We have narrowed our forecast of non-GAAP Operating Earnings for Carbon-Free, Infrastructure and Other to $200 million - $225 million, from our prior guidance of $185 million - $235 million.PSEG will host a conference call to review its Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2022 results with the financial community at 11AM EDT today.  You can register to access this event by visiting https://investor.pseg.com/investor-news-and-events.Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) (NYSE: PEG) is a predominantly regulated infrastructure company focused on a clean energy future.

(PSE&amp;G), PSEG Power and PSEG Long Island (https://corporate.pseg.com).Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresManagement uses non-GAAP Operating Earnings in its internal analysis, and in communications with investors and analysts, as a consistent measure for comparing PSEG's financial performance to previous financial results. Non-GAAP Operating Earnings exclude the impact of returns (losses) associated with the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT), Mark-to-Market (MTM) accounting and material one-time items.See Attachments 8 and 9 for a complete list of items excluded from Net Income/(Loss) in the determination of non-GAAP Operating Earnings. The presentation of non-GAAP Operating Earnings is intended to complement, and should not be considered an alternative to the presentation of Net Income/(Loss), which is an indicator of financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, non-GAAP Operating Earnings as presented in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.Due to the forward-looking nature of non-GAAP Operating Earnings, PSEG is unable to reconcile this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure because comparable GAAP measures are not reasonably accessible or reliable due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying measures that would be required for such reconciliation. Namely, we are not able to reliably project without unreasonable effort MTM and NDT gains (losses), for future periods due to market volatility. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and may have a material impact on our future GAAP results.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain of the matters discussed in this report about our and our subsidiaries' future performance, including, without limitation, future revenues, earnings, strategies, prospects, consequences and all other statements that are not purely historical constitute ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Combined, the four terminals would expand US oil exports by nearly 7m barrels every day, handling the capacity of half of all current national oil exports.Should all of these projects be allowed to proceed and then operate at full capacity for their expected 30-year lifespan, it will result in an incredible 24bn metric tonnes of greenhouse gases once the transported oil is burned, an analysis conducted for the Guardian by Global Energy Monitor has found.These huge “carbon bomb” projects, critics say, fatally undermine Biden’s image as a president who has acted decisively to stem the climate crisis. No new major fossil fuel infrastructure can be built if the world is to avoid dangerous global heating, the International Energy Agency has warned.“The amount of oil going through these projects, and the resulting emissions, are pretty astounding,” said Baird Langenbrunner, an analyst at Global Energy Monitor, who added that the emissions total is likely a worst-case scenario as it is unlikely all four terminals will be built and then operate at full capacity for decades.Interactive“But even if the emissions are a bit lower then, we are fast-forwarding ourselves to the date where we have to stop completely emitting,” said Langenbrunner. “Any extra emissions are in direct conflict with climate goals and it’s hypocritical for the Biden administration to allow these things to get built and then say the US wants to decrease its own emissions.”Story continuesThe oil shipped from the planned terminals would be extracted from the vast Permian basin that lies beneath Texas and New Mexico, and fed through a network of pipelines to huge tankers that would convey it from the Gulf of Mexico to buyers overseas. The emissions from the burned oil would not count towards the US’s total carbon pollution, which Biden has vowed to halve this decade, but will still escalate the disastrous climate crisis.The Sea Port oil terminal, a joint venture between Enterprise, Enbridge and Chevron, will be the US’s largest oil export terminal once built, with a capacity of 2m barrels a day. This is around a quarter of all the oil the US currently exports each day and is part of a national boom in oil extraction that will hit record levels this year and next, despite Biden’s climate pledges and Republican claims that the US president has shut down domestic drilling.The project will link 140 miles of land-based and underwater pipelines to an onshore storage facility near the city of Freeport. Two underwater pipelines will run to the deepwater port located offshore, a key requirement for an oil industry that is keen to shift huge amounts of the resource from the Permian basin but has been frustrated by a lack of deep ports on the Texas coast with the capacity for the very largest oil tankers.In November, the maritime administration, an arm of the US Department of Transport, approved the construction of the Sea Port oil terminal, referencing the heightened demand for new oil and gas in Europe following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The project “is in the national interest because the project will benefit employment, economic growth, and US energy infrastructure resilience and security”, the agency wrote in its decision. “The port will provide a reliable source of crude oil to US allies in the event of market disruption.”InteractiveThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also recommended that the Sea Port oil terminal go ahead, albeit with mitigating features to avoid “disproportionate adverse impacts” to low-income people and people of color who will probably bear the brunt of the new development. Brazoria county, which includes Freeport, already fails to meet national clean air standards for ozone, a pollutant linked to a range of respiratory problems.The approval of the port has triggered a lawsuit from a coalition of green and local groups, which allege the oil terminal will threaten the critically endangered Rice’s whale, expose already overburdened communities of color to toxic air and create emissions equivalent to running 90 coal-fired power plants, a situation they say is “a stain on the Biden administration’s climate and environmental justice record”.The maritime administration, meanwhile, is poised to decide upon permits for three other proposed terminals – called Texas Gulf Link, Blue Marlin Offshore Port and Bluewater Texas – that are at various stages of development. The Texas GulfLink project is located just a few miles from the Sea Port oil terminal, running through the small town of Jones Creek.Until 2015, when Congress lifted a ban on crude oil exports, the US barely exported any fossil fuels, but following a glut of shale oil and fracking activity the country is now the world’s third largest oil exporter and the leading exporter of liquified natural gas, or LNG.At least 16 gas export terminals have been approved or are under construction along the Gulf of Mexico coast, which, along with the new oil activity, has spurred fresh concerns among environmental justice advocates for coastal communities already dealing with toxic air pollution and safety concerns. In June last year, a large LNG export plant in Freeport exploded, due to what regulators say were systemic failures in its operation.The Bryan Mound strategic petroleum reserve near Freeport, Texas. The area is already home to many pollution-producing facilities. Photograph: Adrees Latif/Reuters“It’s shocking the number of pipelines we already have and the dangers we face, such as explosions and oil spills, it’s just too much,” said Melanie Oldham, an air quality activist and Freeport resident who said that many of her neighbours suffer asthma and other health conditions from living next to a tangle of polluting facilities.“We are a low-income community – 65% of people here are Hispanic and this seems to be where they always want to build oil terminal projects,” she said. “We are a sacrifice zone. It’s a constant worry and we just wonder when it will all stop.”Oldham was part of a protest in Washington DC last year over the proposed oil terminals, which ended with four arrests. She said she is “extremely disappointed” that Biden has overseen a surge in oil drilling, despite promising to shut it down when he was a candidate for president. Biden has repeatedly called for expanded oil drilling to bring down gasoline costs for US drivers and during his recent State of the Union address said: “We’re going to need oil for at least another decade, and beyond that.”The Biden administration’s continuing embrace of fossil fuel drilling projects, likely including the controversial Willow project in the Alaska Arctic, risks undermining its major triumphs in confronting the climate crisis, such as the passage last year of the Inflation Reduction Act, a $370bn (£308bn) package to shift the US to clean energy. Biden’s term has been a confounding one for many climate activists.“These oil terminals will lock us into decades of greenhouse gas emissions and jeopardises our ability to meet national and international climate goals,” said Kelsey Crane, senior policy advocate at Earthworks, an environmental group. “The Biden administration’s continued fossil fuel expansion contradicts the science on what we need to do to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of climate change.“We can’t invest in clean energy if we’re not phasing out fossil fuels – we need to reinstate the ban on oil exports and think about a managed decline for fossil fuels within this administration.”A spokesperson for the maritime administration didn’t answer questions on how its approvals fit in with climate goals but said the Sea Port oil terminal will create “a safer, more efficient mechanism for exporting oil”.]"

There were no shortages. And our energy: We managed to make sure he didn’t use this weapon in the effective way.""The war, however, fueled an energy price crisis in the EU that sent the bills of households and businesses through the roof.“Our citizens did have to bear the brunt of his manipulations,"" Timmermans added. “But he didn’t get us. He didn’t divide us and he certainly didn’t get us on our knees.""In response to reduced supplies of Russian energy, the EU introduced last year counter measures that included launching a nearly 300 billion-euro ($320 billion) program to promote more efficient fuel use and a faster rollout of renewable power.The EU also introduced embargoes on Russian coal and oil, accompanied by a price cap on Russian oil exports. In addition, the bloc diversified its energy sources by sealing deals for liquefied natural gas to compensate for the loss of Russian gas and fill its stocks for the winter while reducing its use of gas and electricity.Story continuesAs Putin continues to justify his invasion of Ukraine by accusing Western countries of threatening Russia, Timmermans said the Russian leader's use of energy as a weapon has backfired. In January, gas prices on the European spot market were back to their prewar level.“He’s losing a lot of income because of this,"" Timmermans said. “He’s selling his oil and cut prices to India and China. He has to reduce the sale of gas. He thought he could use that as a weapon. But the weapon turned against him, and it has sped up.""Some EU member countries reduced their natural gas consumption by more than 20% this year, Timmermans said. The war ""is changing the way we relate to energy and it’s helping us understand that we need to move quicker in terms of renewable energy,"" he added.According to the bloc’s data, gas consumption in the EU dropped by 19.3% in the period August 2022-January 2023, compared with the average gas consumption for the same months between 2017 and 2022.To meet the EU's goal of becoming climate neutral by 2050, the European Commission supports a target of 45% renewable energy sources in the bloc’s energy mix by 2030 as countries look to wind and solar power to bolster their energy security.According to a review by global energy think tank Ember, “a massive scale-up in clean energy is on its way"" in Europe. Wind and solar in 2022 generated a record 22% of the bloc's electricity and for the first time overtook gas, which accounted for 20%. Coal power accounted for 16%.“We have a unique opportunity to move toward clean technologies that will need no emissions, that will be circular, so you don’t have to keep digging up primary materials,"" Timmermans said. “If we move in that direction, clean growth is possible. I am optimistic about the potential of that, but we have to move quicker than we’re moving now.""Timmermans insisted that time is running out to keep average global temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. That target, laid down in the 2015 Paris climate accord, appears increasingly doubtful as temperatures have already increased by more than 1.1 C.“And we need to make sure that our policies will keep us well below 2 degrees of temperature increase,"" he added. “If we continue with the policies of today, we will overshoot 2 degrees and we will be in a completely different territory.""___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine and of tje climate and environment at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment]"

(NASDAQ:PDCO)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-patterson-companies-165829654.html,1676912309,STORY,['PDCO'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Patterson Companies is US$27.13 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityWith US$28.82 share price, Patterson Companies appears to be trading close to its estimated fair valueOur fair value estimate is 20% higher than Patterson Companies' analyst price target of US$32.50Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Patterson Companies The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$47.0mUS$96.0mUS$115.0mUS$129.1mUS$140.9mUS$150.8mUS$159.2mUS$166.4mUS$172.7mUS$178.3mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 12.23%Est @ 9.18%Est @ 7.05%Est @ 5.55%Est @ 4.51%Est @ 3.78%Est @ 3.26% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% -US$43.9US$83.7US$93.6US$98.1US$100US$100.0US$98.5US$96.1US$93.2US$89.8(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$809mWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$178m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.1%) = US$3.6bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.6b÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$1.8bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$2.6b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$28.8, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Patterson Companies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.846. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Patterson CompaniesStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Healthcare market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

If you want to see more high growth low debt stocks to buy, go directly to 5 High Growth Low Debt Stocks to Buy.High growth stocks have various definitions to different people.For this article, we define high growth as a company with an estimated average annual EPS growth rate of over 10% a year for the next 5 years.For high growth stocks, a substantial percentage of a company's value is based on future predicted growth. If a high growth company's growth doesn't meet expectations, market growth expectations for the future might decrease and the company's value estimated by the market could decrease. As a result, the company's stock price could decline, in some cases substantially depending on various factors. Given they are more uncertain, many high growth stocks could be potentially riskier than blue chip stocks.In terms of EPS growth rate in the future, inflation is an important factor for many companies.If inflation is higher, it would be easier for some companies in certain industries to grow their EPS a little faster simply by maintaining their profit margin and realizing higher revenues as a result of the inflation.If long term inflation in the future is 5%, there could be a lot more companies that grow their EPS by 10% or more each year. If they keep their profit margins the same and realize 5% more revenues, those companies would have 5% profit increases. If they buy back a lot of their stock, they would have even higher EPS growth if they maintain the same level of profitability. If the companies do other things to increase their EPS enough, those companies would have a 10%+ EPS growth rate. For those of you interested, check out 15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.Given the Federal Reserve's actions with interest rates, however, it is likely that inflation will eventually normalize to 2% or perhaps slightly higher than that in the long term.Story continuesLow Debt StocksLow debt stocks are stocks of companies without a lot of debt. With interest rates higher, the cost of variable debt is higher and as a result, many companies are paying more in interest payments on debt. Because they don't have as much debt, low debt stocks don't have to pay as much in terms of interest on debt payments as similar companies with more debt.If there is a recession or an economic slowdown, not having that much debt would be a good characteristic as it would give management more flexibility.Of course, the success of a company depends on many different things rather than just debt ratios or expected growth ratios. Markets can be unpredictable and as a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Logo, Sign, Building, Symbol, Corporation, Microsoft Corporate Building,Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 10 High Growth Low Debt Stocks to Buy, we chose 10 stocks with competitive advantages that have an estimated average annual EPS growth rate of over 10% a year for the next 5 years according to FINVIZ.com.We filtered the stocks based on stocks that had less than a debt to equity ratio of 0.7.What is considered low debt varies from industry to industry.The debt-to-equity ratio and EPS Next 5 Year Ratio are from FINVIZ.com.EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is the estimated average annual EPS growth rate in the next 5 years.10 High Growth Low Debt Stocks to Buy10.

Combined, the four terminals would expand US oil exports by nearly 7m barrels every day, handling the capacity of half of all current national oil exports.Should all of these projects be allowed to proceed and then operate at full capacity for their expected 30-year lifespan, it will result in an incredible 24bn metric tonnes of greenhouse gases once the transported oil is burned, an analysis conducted for the Guardian by Global Energy Monitor has found.These huge “carbon bomb” projects, critics say, fatally undermine Biden’s image as a president who has acted decisively to stem the climate crisis. No new major fossil fuel infrastructure can be built if the world is to avoid dangerous global heating, the International Energy Agency has warned.“The amount of oil going through these projects, and the resulting emissions, are pretty astounding,” said Baird Langenbrunner, an analyst at Global Energy Monitor, who added that the emissions total is likely a worst-case scenario as it is unlikely all four terminals will be built and then operate at full capacity for decades.Interactive“But even if the emissions are a bit lower then, we are fast-forwarding ourselves to the date where we have to stop completely emitting,” said Langenbrunner. “Any extra emissions are in direct conflict with climate goals and it’s hypocritical for the Biden administration to allow these things to get built and then say the US wants to decrease its own emissions.”Story continuesThe oil shipped from the planned terminals would be extracted from the vast Permian basin that lies beneath Texas and New Mexico, and fed through a network of pipelines to huge tankers that would convey it from the Gulf of Mexico to buyers overseas. The emissions from the burned oil would not count towards the US’s total carbon pollution, which Biden has vowed to halve this decade, but will still escalate the disastrous climate crisis.The Sea Port oil terminal, a joint venture between Enterprise, Enbridge and Chevron, will be the US’s largest oil export terminal once built, with a capacity of 2m barrels a day. This is around a quarter of all the oil the US currently exports each day and is part of a national boom in oil extraction that will hit record levels this year and next, despite Biden’s climate pledges and Republican claims that the US president has shut down domestic drilling.The project will link 140 miles of land-based and underwater pipelines to an onshore storage facility near the city of Freeport. Two underwater pipelines will run to the deepwater port located offshore, a key requirement for an oil industry that is keen to shift huge amounts of the resource from the Permian basin but has been frustrated by a lack of deep ports on the Texas coast with the capacity for the very largest oil tankers.In November, the maritime administration, an arm of the US Department of Transport, approved the construction of the Sea Port oil terminal, referencing the heightened demand for new oil and gas in Europe following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The project “is in the national interest because the project will benefit employment, economic growth, and US energy infrastructure resilience and security”, the agency wrote in its decision. “The port will provide a reliable source of crude oil to US allies in the event of market disruption.”InteractiveThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also recommended that the Sea Port oil terminal go ahead, albeit with mitigating features to avoid “disproportionate adverse impacts” to low-income people and people of color who will probably bear the brunt of the new development. Brazoria county, which includes Freeport, already fails to meet national clean air standards for ozone, a pollutant linked to a range of respiratory problems.The approval of the port has triggered a lawsuit from a coalition of green and local groups, which allege the oil terminal will threaten the critically endangered Rice’s whale, expose already overburdened communities of color to toxic air and create emissions equivalent to running 90 coal-fired power plants, a situation they say is “a stain on the Biden administration’s climate and environmental justice record”.The maritime administration, meanwhile, is poised to decide upon permits for three other proposed terminals – called Texas Gulf Link, Blue Marlin Offshore Port and Bluewater Texas – that are at various stages of development. The Texas GulfLink project is located just a few miles from the Sea Port oil terminal, running through the small town of Jones Creek.Until 2015, when Congress lifted a ban on crude oil exports, the US barely exported any fossil fuels, but following a glut of shale oil and fracking activity the country is now the world’s third largest oil exporter and the leading exporter of liquified natural gas, or LNG.At least 16 gas export terminals have been approved or are under construction along the Gulf of Mexico coast, which, along with the new oil activity, has spurred fresh concerns among environmental justice advocates for coastal communities already dealing with toxic air pollution and safety concerns. In June last year, a large LNG export plant in Freeport exploded, due to what regulators say were systemic failures in its operation.The Bryan Mound strategic petroleum reserve near Freeport, Texas. The area is already home to many pollution-producing facilities. Photograph: Adrees Latif/Reuters“It’s shocking the number of pipelines we already have and the dangers we face, such as explosions and oil spills, it’s just too much,” said Melanie Oldham, an air quality activist and Freeport resident who said that many of her neighbours suffer asthma and other health conditions from living next to a tangle of polluting facilities.“We are a low-income community – 65% of people here are Hispanic and this seems to be where they always want to build oil terminal projects,” she said. “We are a sacrifice zone. It’s a constant worry and we just wonder when it will all stop.”Oldham was part of a protest in Washington DC last year over the proposed oil terminals, which ended with four arrests. She said she is “extremely disappointed” that Biden has overseen a surge in oil drilling, despite promising to shut it down when he was a candidate for president. Biden has repeatedly called for expanded oil drilling to bring down gasoline costs for US drivers and during his recent State of the Union address said: “We’re going to need oil for at least another decade, and beyond that.”The Biden administration’s continuing embrace of fossil fuel drilling projects, likely including the controversial Willow project in the Alaska Arctic, risks undermining its major triumphs in confronting the climate crisis, such as the passage last year of the Inflation Reduction Act, a $370bn (£308bn) package to shift the US to clean energy. Biden’s term has been a confounding one for many climate activists.“These oil terminals will lock us into decades of greenhouse gas emissions and jeopardises our ability to meet national and international climate goals,” said Kelsey Crane, senior policy advocate at Earthworks, an environmental group. “The Biden administration’s continued fossil fuel expansion contradicts the science on what we need to do to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of climate change.“We can’t invest in clean energy if we’re not phasing out fossil fuels – we need to reinstate the ban on oil exports and think about a managed decline for fossil fuels within this administration.”A spokesperson for the maritime administration didn’t answer questions on how its approvals fit in with climate goals but said the Sea Port oil terminal will create “a safer, more efficient mechanism for exporting oil”.]"

There were no shortages. And our energy: We managed to make sure he didn’t use this weapon in the effective way.""The war, however, fueled an energy price crisis in the EU that sent the bills of households and businesses through the roof.“Our citizens did have to bear the brunt of his manipulations,"" Timmermans added. “But he didn’t get us. He didn’t divide us and he certainly didn’t get us on our knees.""In response to reduced supplies of Russian energy, the EU introduced last year counter measures that included launching a nearly 300 billion-euro ($320 billion) program to promote more efficient fuel use and a faster rollout of renewable power.The EU also introduced embargoes on Russian coal and oil, accompanied by a price cap on Russian oil exports. In addition, the bloc diversified its energy sources by sealing deals for liquefied natural gas to compensate for the loss of Russian gas and fill its stocks for the winter while reducing its use of gas and electricity.Story continuesAs Putin continues to justify his invasion of Ukraine by accusing Western countries of threatening Russia, Timmermans said the Russian leader's use of energy as a weapon has backfired. In January, gas prices on the European spot market were back to their prewar level.“He’s losing a lot of income because of this,"" Timmermans said. “He’s selling his oil and cut prices to India and China. He has to reduce the sale of gas. He thought he could use that as a weapon. But the weapon turned against him, and it has sped up.""Some EU member countries reduced their natural gas consumption by more than 20% this year, Timmermans said. The war ""is changing the way we relate to energy and it’s helping us understand that we need to move quicker in terms of renewable energy,"" he added.According to the bloc’s data, gas consumption in the EU dropped by 19.3% in the period August 2022-January 2023, compared with the average gas consumption for the same months between 2017 and 2022.To meet the EU's goal of becoming climate neutral by 2050, the European Commission supports a target of 45% renewable energy sources in the bloc’s energy mix by 2030 as countries look to wind and solar power to bolster their energy security.According to a review by global energy think tank Ember, “a massive scale-up in clean energy is on its way"" in Europe. Wind and solar in 2022 generated a record 22% of the bloc's electricity and for the first time overtook gas, which accounted for 20%. Coal power accounted for 16%.“We have a unique opportunity to move toward clean technologies that will need no emissions, that will be circular, so you don’t have to keep digging up primary materials,"" Timmermans said. “If we move in that direction, clean growth is possible. I am optimistic about the potential of that, but we have to move quicker than we’re moving now.""Timmermans insisted that time is running out to keep average global temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. That target, laid down in the 2015 Paris climate accord, appears increasingly doubtful as temperatures have already increased by more than 1.1 C.“And we need to make sure that our policies will keep us well below 2 degrees of temperature increase,"" he added. “If we continue with the policies of today, we will overshoot 2 degrees and we will be in a completely different territory.""___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine and of tje climate and environment at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment]"

But Qualcomm has used its wireless communication specialty to enter other markets where devices need to talk to the internet, such as automobiles and factories.Qualcomm Aware, as the new service is called, works with Qualcomm chips that go into tracking devices for shipping containers, pallets, packages and other parts of supply chains to help companies track where their goods and materials are.Most of those trackers are made by third parties, but Qualcomm makes a few devices of its own, such as a tilt sensor that can be attached to utility poles to report whether they have toppled over during storms.Qualcomm has already shipped hundreds of millions of the chips involved, which typically cost less than $10 each, Jeff Torrance, senior vice president and general manager of Qualcomm's smart connected systems business, told Reuters in an interview.The software service announced Tuesday aims to let Qualcomm customers program their chips from one central spot, with updates sent to the chips over the air.The service also aims to make better use of the data from the chips.Torrance said Qualcomm's software will connect to other cloud-based such as Microsoft Corp's Dynamics 365 service, which corporations use to keep tabs on their inventory and supplies.Companies could use the two systems to build things like virtual dashboards that show where all of a firm's inventory is at a given moment.Qualcomm did not publicly announce pricing for the new service, but it represents a push to make more money off its chips by charging when the chip is sold then for cloud-based services using the chip afterward.""We believe there's value in the chip and in the cloud service,"" Torrance told Reuters.(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Marguerita Choy)]"

Some travel comparison shopping websites haven't recovered in 2022 to pre-pandemic levels. k4dordy / FlickrTravel metasearch sites such as Trivago and Tripadvisor fell considerably short of pre-pandemic 2019 revenue levels in 2022 while travel companies in other sectors, such as Airbnb in short-term rentals, and tours and activities provider Viator greatly exceeded their marks from three years ago.The following chart shows that Trivago reached only 64 percent of 2019 revenue last year while Tripadvisor’s hotel metasearch feature climbed to just 85 percent of pre-pandemic revenue numbers in 2022. In the hotel sector, Marriott came up just short of the mark, having achieved 99 percent of 2019 revenue last year.Source: Skift and public financial filingsAirbnb; Viator, which is part of Tripadvisor; United, and Expedia Group all surpassed their 2019 revenue numbers last year. In 2022, Airbnb and Viator exceeded their prepandemic top lines by 75 percent and 71 percent, respectively. United (up 4 percent) and Expedia (2 percent) inched ahead. Expedia might have been a tad further ahead of 2019 if it hadn't sold its corporate travel unit, Egencia, which generated $620 million in revenue that year, to American Express Global Business Travel in November 2021.Booking Holdings hasn't reported its fourth quarter and full-year 2022 numbers yet, but in the third quarter of 2022 it blew past the revenue amount it recorded three years earlier by 21 percent. So one would expect Booking to show that it recovered considerably faster than rival Expedia when Booking publishes its 2022 financials on Thursday.What Is Travel Metasearch?What are travel metasearch sites? In general, they are websites where online travel agencies and hotels can bid for placement within a hotel listing, for example, and consumers can view their rates on a given date range, and then click over to these online travel agency and hotel websites to complete their bookings. Google, for one, supplements paid booking links from advertisers with free links from hotels and online travel agencies. Online travel agencies are the largest advertisers in metasearch compared with hotels, use these sites as an important vehicle to market their hotel offerings, and pay them each time a traveler clicks on one of their links.Story continuesThe following is a Tripadvisor metasearch listing for a stay at the Ibis Madrid Calle Alcala hotel on the night of February 24. Expedia likely bid the most for the featured position, and there are about 16 other deals displayed, all from online travel agencies with the exception of one hotel, Ibis. (Notice that in this instance all of the nightly rates are within $1 of one another.)Are Tripadvisor and Trivago Outliers?Kayak co-founder and CEO Steve Hafner, whose metasearch company is part of Booking Holdings, said of Trivago and Tripadvisor: ""They definitely lag the big OTAs (online travel agencies) but that mainly reflects their desire to focus on profitability versus top-line growth.""While Tripadvisor's hotel metasearch globally generated only 85 percent of its 2019 revenue in 2022, the company stated Tuesday during its fourth quarter earnings call that its metasearch revenue in the U.S. achieved parity with 2019 levels in 2022, and trended upward in the fourth quarter of last year.The question remains whether Trivago and Tripadvisor metasearch are currently weak links in the metasearch sphere — compared with Google — or whether the entire sector is in a swoon. Hafner wouldn't comment on Kayak's performance, nor would Trivago concerning the reasons it lagged the online travel agency recovery.Our focus has been on public companies Trivago and Tripadvisor, which publicized their metasearch performance. The leading metasearch player, Google, doesn't break out the performance of its comparative shopping service, Google Travel, and wouldn't comment on its trajectory.Google Metasearch May Be the BenefactorHowever, advertising revenue from the travel industry and the retail sector were Google's strongest performers in the fourth quarter, the company reported. While Alphabet, Google’s parent, saw its overall advertising revenue tick down 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter, travel and retail revenue increased. It should be pointed out, though, that Google generates its travel advertising revenue from two sources: Google.com and its metasearch feature travel.google.com. So it's unclear from Google's telling how Google's metasearch feature in particular has performed.However, Skift Research argued in December that metasearch sites such as Trivago and Tripadvisor have been losing market share to Google metasearch. ""Metasearch sites have been losing consumer traffic share to Google metasearch,"" a Skift Research report said. ""Data from SimilarWeb backs this up and suggests that Google became even more dominant during the pandemic jumping from a ~51% traffic share in the U.S. to 62%.""Other FactorsBeyond Google's ascendance and the fact that public company metasearch firms are emphasizing profitability over growth, there are other factors behind the tepid revenue recovery of some metasearch companies as compared with more robust growth at travel companies in other sectors. Among them, online travel agencies are leaning into brand marketing to elicit more direct bookings and loyalty program signups, and may be seeing declining marketing efficiencies when advertising in metasearch. Hotels saw  an increased percentage of direct bookings earlier in the pandemic, but that may be swinging back in the other direction now.Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates also impeded 2022 revenue numbers at metasearch and online travel agency sites when measured against 2019. Another potential factor is that Expedia Group has helped Marriott and IHG clamp down on smaller online travel agencies making unauthorized use of discounted wholesale rates from these two hotel brands and advertising them on metasearch sites.    Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$476). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price.

While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Lockheed Martin Insiders?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. On the other hand the transaction history, over the last year, isn't so positive. We don't take much heart from transactions by Lockheed Martin insiders over the last year. But they own a reasonable amount of the company, and there was some buying recently. In short they are likely aligned with shareholders. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Lockheed Martin you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

95,367dcd07-a2dd-363a-b106-40a660138a82,LMT,2023-02-21,The 3 Stocks With the Biggest Dividend Potential in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-biggest-dividend-potential-140452427.html,1676642692,STORY,"['CVX', 'COST', 'LMT']","[The January rally may be subsiding, but as of this writing, the bulls are still trying to push the market higher. Maybe growth stocks are coming back into fashion. But right now, it still looks like a good time to find dividend stocks to buy.There’s ample reason for caution. In case you haven’t noticed, a lot is going on in the economy and the world. Inflation is showing no signs of abating at a meaningful level. The U.S. military is shooting down strange objects that are still a mystery. And then there’s the upcoming debate about raising the debt ceiling.However, like any asset class, there are differences between dividend stocks. The best of the best have strong cash positions and earnings growth that not only support but help to grow their dividends. And in this article, I give you three dividend stocks to buy that offer both the opportunity for dividend growth and some stock price growth as well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTickerCompanyPriceCVXChevron$166.57COSTCostco$504.10LMTLockheed Martin$471.25Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comIn his State of the Union address, President Joe Biden declared that fossil fuels would be needed for the next 10 years. I’ll take the over on that, but either way, the outlook for energy stocks continues to look bullish in 2023. And when you’re looking at energy stocks that are also smart dividend stocks to buy, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is an exceptional choice.According to the U.S. Energy Department, prices for Brent crude oil, a global benchmark, will be 18% below 2022 levels. But oil prices will still be historically high at $83 a barrel. And Chevron is still well above its breakeven price, which was $50 as of their latest earnings report. But Chevron is also one of the leading exporters of liquified natural gas (LNG), which is seeing increased demand, particularly in Europe.Story continuesTo be fair, Chevron has already increased its dividend in 2023. On January 25, 2023, the oil and gas giant announced it was increasing its quarterly payout to $1.52 per share. That comes out to $6.08 per share annually. And with a payout ratio of around 31% to go along with a free cash flow of $37 billion in 2022, the dividend is sustainable now and will likely continue to grow in the future.Chevron is also on the list of Dividend Aristocrats, a designation highlighting a select group of companies that have increased their dividends for at least 25 years.Costco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comThe January reading of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed that inflation might be stickier than we hoped. Who knew, right? But I am not particularly eager to bet against the American consumer. That’s why I’m making Costco (NASDAQ:COST) the next company on my list of dividend stocks to buy.Consumers are handling inflation in several ways. But aside from simply not buying items, they are buying private label brands or changing where – and how – they shop. Both of those behaviors play nicely with Costco’s business model.Consumers can shop in bulk, which often means they can stick with their favorite brands. And Costco also has a private-label brand, which is an understatement. The company’s Kirkland Signature brand delivers approximately 25% of the company’s revenue and covers over 350 different products.The COST stock dividend has been growing at over 11%, and with a payout ratio of just 26% to go along with healthy free cash flow, Costco should have no problem delivering a dividend increase later in 2023. This makes it easy to overlook the company’s dividend yield, which sits at just 0.75%.Lockheed Martin (LMT)An F-16 and an F-35 model at the background, at the Lockheed Martin exhibition stand in Thessaloniki International Fair.Source: Giannis Papanikos / Shutterstock.comIf Russia’s war with Ukraine wasn’t enough to keep geopolitical tensions, are we now looking at an intergalactic threat? That remains to be seen, but the temperature between China and the U.S. is becoming frostier by the day. And Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is a solid choice when you’re looking for a stock that can help your portfolio weather whatever comes next.Whether or not the company’s signature F-35 jets will find their way to Ukraine, demand is only likely to increase. And that goes along with a backlog of over $135 billion on the company’s books.Lockheed Martin is also generating a significant amount from its space sector. And with a lucrative contract from NASA to build 12 Orion spacecraft, my guess is that the company will beat expectations for earnings growth of around 7% over the next five years. If it does, that will make the company’s dividend payout, which is currently around 55%, look very sustainable, as will be growth in the LMT stock dividend, which is currently a robust $12 per share per year.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in CVX stock.

The organic comparison excludes a $379 million negative impact from foreign currency translation and a $26 million contribution from the company's fiscal first quarter acquisition of Intersect ENT, which is reported in the Specialty Therapies division in the Neuroscience Portfolio. Unless otherwise stated, all revenue growth rates in this press release are on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation and revenue from the Intersect ENT acquisition.The company's third quarter organic revenue results reflect strong performances in the Cardiovascular and Neuroscience portfolios, in Diabetes markets outside the U.S., as well as improved product availability across certain businesses. This was partially offset by unfavorable impacts from ventilator sales, given the increased COVID-19 related demand in the prior year, and sales in China, given volume-based procurement (VBP) tenders and the impact of COVID-19 resurgence on procedure volumes.As reported, third quarter GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $1.222 billion and $0.92, respectively, decreases of 17% and 16%, respectively. As detailed in the financial schedules included at the end of this release, third quarter non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS were $1.727 billion and $1.30, respectively, decreases of 6% and 4%, respectively. The company's earnings decline reflects the continued unfavorable macroeconomic impact of foreign currency translation and inflation.Story continuesThird quarter U.S. revenue of $4.062 billion represented approximately 52% of company revenue and increased 3% as reported and 2% organic. Non-U.S. developed market revenue of $2.294 billion represented 30% of company revenue and decreased 6% as reported and increased 6% organic. Emerging Markets revenue of $1.371 billion represented 18% of company revenue and decreased 1% as reported and increased 5% organic.""We returned to mid-single digit organic growth as we continue to execute our strategy with urgency. Our Cardiovascular and Neuroscience portfolios had strong, high-single digit organic growth as we launched new products and demonstrated continued strength in our established, market-leading Cardiac Rhythm Management and Spine franchises,"" said Geoff Martha, Medtronic chairman and chief executive officer. ""I'm very encouraged by the rebound in our revenue growth, despite procedure volumes remaining a little softer in a few markets and volume-based procurement in China. We are confident in delivering durable revenue growth over the coming quarters as recent revenue headwinds continue to dissipate, and we drive execution across our businesses.""Cardiovascular PortfolioThe Cardiovascular Portfolio includes the Cardiac Rhythm &amp; Heart Failure (CRHF), Structural Heart &amp; Aortic (SHA), and Coronary &amp; Peripheral Vascular (CPV) divisions. Cardiovascular revenue of $2.772 billion increased 1% as reported and 7% organic, with high-single digit increases in CRHF and SHA and a low-single digit increase in CPV, all on an organic basis.Cardiac Rhythm &amp; Heart Failure revenue of $1.431 billion increased 2% as reported and increased 7% organic. Cardiac Rhythm Management revenue increased high-single digits, with high-single digit growth in both Defibrillation Solutions and Cardiac Pacing Therapies, including mid-teens growth in leadless pacemakers from continued global adoption of Micra™ transcatheter pacing systems. Cardiac Ablation Solutions revenue increased low-single digits, including low-double digit growth in the U.S. on the continued adoption of its Arctic Front™ cryoablation catheters. Cardiovascular Diagnostics revenue increased low-double digits, given increased supply and strong market adoption of the LINQ II™ insertable cardiac monitor.Structural Heart &amp; Aortic revenue of $760 million increased 3% as reported and 9% organic. Structural Heart increased high-single digits, with low-double digit growth in transcatheter aortic valves (TAVR) as the company continues to build on its strong durability data and the U.S. launch of the Evolut™ FX TAVR system. Aortic also increased low-double digits with high-teens growth in abdominal aortic stent graft systems on improved product availability. Cardiac Surgery increased mid-single digits, driven by growth in surgical valves and perfusion systems.Coronary &amp; Peripheral Vascular revenue of $581 million decreased 4% as reported and increased 1% organic. Coronary increased low-single digits with strength in coronary balloons and U.S. drug-eluting stent share gains from the continued launch of the Onyx Frontier™ drug-eluting stent. Peripheral Vascular Health also increased low-single digits, with low-double digit growth in drug-coated balloons and high-single digit growth in vascular embolization and superficial venous products.Medical Surgical PortfolioThe Medical Surgical Portfolio includes the Surgical Innovations (SI) and the Respiratory, Gastrointestinal &amp; Renal (RGR) divisions. Medical Surgical revenue of $2.137 billion decreased 7% as reported and 2% organic, with low-single digit declines in both SI and RGR. Excluding the unfavorable impact of ventilator sales, given the increased COVID-19 related demand in the prior year, and sales in China, given the unfavorable impact of provincial VBP tenders, Medical Surgical revenue increased 3% organic.Surgical Innovations revenue of $1.425 billion decreased 6% as reported and 1% organic. SI revenue increased 5% organic excluding the unfavorable impact of sales in China. The company won back share sequentially, as it recovered from supply challenges faced in prior quarters. Advanced Surgical Instruments decreased low-single digits, with Advanced Stapling low-double digit declines resulting from China VBP tenders offsetting mid-single digit growth in Advanced Energy. In Surgical Robotics, the company increased sales in markets outside the U.S. and announced first patient enrollment in its Expand URO U.S. clinical trial for the Hugo™ robotic-assisted surgery system.Respiratory, Gastrointestinal &amp; Renal revenue of $712 million decreased 8% as reported and 3% organic. RGR revenue was flat organic excluding the impact of ventilator sales. Respiratory Interventions decreased low-double digits, with sales of ventilators declining high-twenties as demand continued to be well below pre-pandemic levels as expected. Patient Monitoring increased low-single digits, with low-single digit growth in Nellcor™ pulse oximetry and mid-single digit growth in Perioperative Complications. In October 2022, the company announced its intention to separate the combined Respiratory Interventions and Patient Monitoring businesses, which it continues to expect to be completed in the second half of its fiscal year 2024. Gastrointestinal revenue increased high-single digits on strength in sales of GI Genius™ intelligent endoscopy module. Renal Care Solutions decreased high-single digits given product availability challenges. In May 2022, Medtronic announced its intention to contribute its Renal Care Solutions business into a new, independent kidney care-focused medical device company together with DaVita, which it expects to close in the fourth fiscal quarter.Neuroscience PortfolioThe Neuroscience Portfolio includes the Cranial &amp; Spinal Technologies (CST), Specialty Therapies, and Neuromodulation divisions. Neuroscience revenue of $2.248 billion increased 5% as reported and 7% organic, with a low-double digit organic increase in Specialty Therapies and mid-single digit organic increases in Neuromodulation and CST.Cranial &amp; Spinal Technologies revenue of $1.128 billion increased 2% as reported and 5% organic, as the company continues to benefit from its Aible™ spine technology ecosystem. Spine &amp; Biologics increased low-single digits, with mid-single digit growth in Core Spine offsetting high-single digit declines in Biologics. Neurosurgery increased high-single digits, with double digit growth in robotics, navigation, imaging, and powered surgical instruments.Specialty Therapies revenue of $699 million increased 10% as reported and 11% organic. Neurovascular increased high-single digits, with double digit growth in aspiration, flow diversion, and liquid embolic products, and high-single digit growth in mechanical thrombectomy. Pelvic Health increased mid-single digits on the continued adoption of its InterStim™ sacral neuromodulation systems. ENT increased low-twenties on an organic basis driven by strength in NIM Vital™ nerve monitoring systems and improved product availability.Neuromodulation revenue of $420 million increased 3% as reported and 6% organic. Pain Therapies increased low-double digits, with low-double digit growth in both Pain Stim and Targeted Drug Delivery, and low-single digit growth in Interventional. Brain Modulation decreased low-single digits on continued declines of replacement devices.DiabetesDiabetes revenue of $570 million decreased 2% as reported and increased 3% organic. U.S. revenue declined mid-teens, given the absence of new product approvals. This was more than offset by high-teens growth in non-U.S. developed markets and low-twenties growth in emerging markets. Sales outside the U.S. included high-teens growth of insulin pumps and mid-thirties growth of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) products on strong sales of the MiniMed™ 780G system and the associated increase in CGM attachment rates on the strength of the Guardian™ 4 sensor.GuidanceThe company today issued fourth quarter revenue growth guidance and tightened its full year EPS guidance for fiscal 2023.The company expects fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 4.5% to 5.0%, which brackets current Street consensus and raises the company's full fiscal year organic growth outlook. If foreign currency exchange rates as of the beginning of February hold, fourth quarter revenue would be unfavorably affected by approximately $165 million to $215 million.The company increased the lower end of its fiscal year 2023 diluted non-GAAP EPS guidance from the prior range of $5.25 to $5.30 to the new range of $5.28 to $5.30, which includes an estimated 21 cent unfavorable impact from foreign currency at rates as of the beginning of February.""Given our third quarter performance, we are raising our full year outlook and expect our momentum to continue in the fourth quarter,"" said Karen Parkhill, Medtronic chief financial officer. ""As we look ahead, we are focused on delivering durable topline growth and significant expense reductions as we navigate through macro headwinds from foreign currency and inflation. And, we are committed to continued investment in our growth drivers to ensure long-term value creation.""Webcast InformationMedtronic will host a webcast today, February 21, at 8:00 a.m. EST (7:00 a.m. CST) to provide information about its businesses for the public, investors, analysts, and news media.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Medtronic (MDT) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.27 a share one day away from its upcoming earnings release on February 21, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.27 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.26 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Medtronic has an Earnings ESP of 0.21%.MDT is just one of a large group of Medical stocks with a positive ESP figure. DexCom (DXCM) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.DexCom, which is readying to report earnings on April 27, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.15 a share, and DXCM is 66 days out from its next earnings report.DexCom's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 2.89% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.15.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, MDT and DXCM could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Its Lagevrio pill, also known as molnupiravir, was given every 12 hours for five days and was compared with a placebo group.Participants treated with the pill were 23.6% less likely to develop COVID than those given a placebo through day 14, failing to meet the main goal of the trial, Merck said.Pfizer's Paxlovid and Merck's Lagevrio pills were given emergency use authorization in Dec. 2021 for patients with mild-to-moderate COVID that tested positive for the virus, and who were at risk of progressing to severe COVID. Earlier in February, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration removed the need for a positive test for Merck and Pfizer's treatments in a bid to increase access to the drugs.

Investors, analysts, members of the media and the general public are invited to listen to a live webcast of the presentation at http://www.merck.com/investor-relations/events-and-presentations.Story continuesAbout sotaterceptSotatercept is an investigational, potential first-in-class activin signaling inhibitor biologic being studied for the treatment of PAH (WHO Group 1). PAH is a rare disease caused by hyperproliferation of cells in the arterial walls in the lung, leading to narrowing and abnormal constriction. In pre-clinical models, sotatercept has been shown to modulate vascular cell proliferation, reversing vascular and right ventricle remodeling.Sotatercept has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as Priority Medicines designation by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of PAH. Merck acquired exclusive rights to sotatercept in the pulmonary hypertension field through the acquisition of Acceleron Pharma Inc. Sotatercept is the subject of a licensing agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb.About MK-0616MK-0616 is an investigational, potentially first oral PCSK9 inhibitor designed to lower low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. MK-0616 is a macrocyclic peptide that binds to PCSK9 and inhibits the interaction of PCSK9 with LDL receptors. This results in greater numbers of LDL receptors available on the cell surface to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood.About VERQUVO® (vericiguat) tablets for once daily oral use (2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg)VERQUVO is a stimulator of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), an important enzyme in the nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway. When NO binds to sGC, the enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a second messenger that plays a role in the regulation of vascular tone, cardiac contractility, and cardiac remodeling. Heart failure is associated with impaired synthesis of NO and decreased activity of sGC, which may contribute to myocardial and vascular dysfunction. By directly stimulating sGC, independently of and synergistically with NO, vericiguat augments levels of intracellular cGMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation.Selected Safety Information for VERQUVOWARNING: EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITYFemales of reproductive potential: Exclude pregnancy before the start of treatment. To prevent pregnancy, females of reproductive potential must use effective forms of contraception during treatment and for one month after stopping treatment. Do not administer VERQUVO to a pregnant female because it may cause fetal harm.VERQUVO is contraindicated in patients with concomitant use of other soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. VERQUVO is contraindicated in pregnancy. Based on data from animal reproduction studies, VERQUVO may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Obtain a pregnancy test before the start of treatment. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with VERQUVO and for at least one month after the final dose.In a clinical trial, the most commonly observed adverse events with VERQUVO vs placebo, occurring at a frequency greater than or equal to 5%, were hypotension (16% vs 15%) and anemia (10% vs 7%).There are no data on the presence of VERQUVO in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from VERQUVO, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with VERQUVO.Concomitant use of VERQUVO with PDE-5 inhibitors is not recommended because of the potential for hypotension.The vericiguat program is co-developed by Bayer and Merck. Merck has the commercial rights to vericiguat in the U.S. and Bayer has the exclusive commercial rights in the rest of world. The companies share equally the costs of the development of vericiguat.Merck’s focus on cardiovascular diseaseMerck has a long history of making an impact in cardiovascular disease.

The Phase 3 MOVe-AHEAD trial evaluated people who did not have COVID-19 at baseline (confirmed by a negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 test and no signs and symptoms) but lived with someone who was recently diagnosed with COVID-19. In the primary endpoint of participants who did not have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline (confirmed by a negative SARS-CoV-2 test), the LAGEVRIO treated group was observed to be 23.6% less likely than those who received placebo to develop COVID-19 through Day 14 (a positive post-baseline SARS-CoV-2 test with evidence of signs and symptoms); the primary endpoint was not met. The safety profile of LAGEVRIO in this trial was generally consistent with that observed in previously reported clinical studies and post-authorization experience in the treatment of COVID-19. Merck intends to submit full results from this study for presentation at a scientific meeting or for publication.""Results from this post-exposure prevention study are scientifically interesting as we continue to learn more about COVID-19. We are grateful to the MOVe-AHEAD trial participants and investigators for their contributions to this study,"" said Dr. Dean Y. Li, president, Merck Research Laboratories. ""This was not a treatment study and these results do not impact the efficacy and safety data observed in our Phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19. We remain focused on our ongoing efforts to bring LAGEVRIO as treatment to appropriate high-risk patients with COVID-19 where its use is authorized or approved, as well as to further study the ways it may benefit patients with other infectious diseases, such as RSV.""Story continuesLAGEVRIO is approved or authorized in several markets including the U.S., United Kingdom, Australia, China and Japan, for the treatment of certain adults who have been diagnosed with COVID-19. See additional information on the authorized use of LAGEVRIO in the U.S. below. LAGEVRIO is not authorized for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19.About the MOVe-AHEAD StudyMOVe-AHEAD (MK-4482-013) (NCT04939428) was a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of orally administered LAGEVRIO (molnupiravir) compared to placebo in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, within households. The trial enrolled over 1,500 participants who were randomized to receive either LAGEVRIO (800 mg) or placebo orally every 12 hours for five days. The study enrolled participants who were at least 18 years of age and resided in the same household with someone who received a positive test for SARS-CoV-2, had at least one sign or symptom of COVID-19 and had not had those signs and symptoms for more than five days. Participants were not eligible for the trial if they received the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine more than seven days prior to enrollment, previously had COVID-19 within the past six months or were showing any signs or symptoms of COVID-19.The primary endpoints of the trial included percentage of participants who have undetectable SARS-CoV-2 in baseline nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and develop COVID-19 through Day 14, percentage of participants with an adverse event and percentage of participants who discontinued study intervention due to an adverse event.The trial was conducted globally in countries including Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Colombia, Egypt, France, Guatemala, Hungary, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Philippines, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United States.About Merck’s Global Efforts to Accelerate Access to LAGEVRIO (molnupiravir) Following Regulatory Authorizations or ApprovalsGlobal access has been a priority for Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP, a biotechnology company focused on emerging infectious diseases, since the inception of their LAGEVRIO collaboration. The companies are committed to providing timely access to LAGEVRIO globally through our comprehensive supply and access approach, which includes:Supply: Patients around the world have received approximately 4 million courses of LAGEVRIO. Merck has supplied LAGEVRIO to more than 40 markets worldwide.Voluntary licenses: As part of its commitment to widespread global access, Merck granted voluntary licenses (VLs) to generic manufacturers and to the Medicines Patent Pool to make generic molnupiravir available in more than 100 low- and middle-income countries following approvals or emergency authorization by local regulatory agencies. Through our voluntary licensing agreements with generic manufacturers, more than 5 million courses of generic molnupiravir have been delivered to 22 markets through December 2022. Additionally, Hetero Labs, Ltd. has received WHO prequalification, an important step in enabling broader access to molnupiravir.UNICEF: To supplement the supply from licensed generic manufacturers and bridge to the availability of WHO prequalified generic supply, Merck entered into an agreement with UNICEF to allocate up to 3 million courses of LAGEVRIO to facilitate timely supply to low- and middle-income countries. Merck has also committed 2 million patient courses of LAGEVRIO, available to USAID at Merck’s best access price to increase access in lower-income countries.Product donation: Merck has donated 100,000 courses of therapy to Direct Relief, a global humanitarian aid organization, for distribution to refugees, including 50,000 courses of therapy for people affected by the invasion of Ukraine.Purchase and supply agreements: Merck entered into a procurement agreement with the U.S. government under which the company supplied approximately 3.1 million courses of LAGEVRIO to the U.S. government, upon Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has created a Test-to-Treat locator to help identify pharmacies and community health centers across the nation where people can get tested for COVID-19 and receive appropriate treatments, as needed.Merck has also entered into additional advance purchase and supply agreements for LAGEVRIO with governments of more than 40 markets worldwide and is currently in discussions with additional governments. Merck is implementing a tiered-pricing approach based on World Bank country income criteria to reflect countries’ relative ability to finance their health response to the pandemic.Responding to global needs with urgency: In September 2022, Merck announced a cooperation framework agreement with Sinopharm Group Co. Ltd., under which Merck granted distribution and exclusive import rights for LAGEVRIO to Sinopharm following authorization. To date, we have shipped more than one million courses of LAGEVRIO to China, with additional shipments planned.Authorized Use of LAGEVRIO (molnupiravir) in the U.S.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an EUA for the emergency use of the unapproved product LAGEVRIO, a nucleoside analogue that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication by viral mutagenesis, for the treatment of adults with a current diagnosis of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, and for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options approved or authorized by FDA are not accessible or clinically appropriate. LAGEVRIO is not FDA-approved for any use, including the treatment of COVID-19.The emergency use of LAGEVRIO is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 564(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1) unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner.LAGEVRIO is not authorized for use in patients less than 18 years of age or for initiation of treatment in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Benefit of treatment with LAGEVRIO has not been observed in subjects when treatment was initiated after hospitalization due to COVID-19. LAGEVRIO is not authorized for use for longer than five consecutive days. LAGEVRIO is not authorized for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19. LAGEVRIO may only be prescribed for an individual patient by physicians, advanced practice registered nurses, and physician assistants that are licensed or authorized under state law to prescribe drugs in the therapeutic class to which LAGEVRIO belongs (i.e., anti-infectives).Selected Safety Information for LAGEVRIOContraindicationsNo contraindications have been identified based on the limited available data on the emergency use of LAGEVRIO authorized under this EUA.Warnings and PrecautionsThere are limited clinical data available for LAGEVRIO. Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with LAGEVRIO use.LAGEVRIO is not recommended for use during pregnancy. Based on findings from animal reproduction studies, LAGEVRIO may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant individuals. There are no available human data on the use of LAGEVRIO in pregnant individuals to evaluate the risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.LAGEVRIO is authorized to be prescribed to a pregnant individual only after the healthcare provider has determined that the benefits would outweigh the risks for that individual patient. If the decision is made to use LAGEVRIO during pregnancy, the prescribing healthcare provider must document that the known and potential benefits and the potential risks of using LAGEVRIO during pregnancy were communicated to the pregnant individual.There is a pregnancy registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to LAGEVRIO during pregnancy. The prescribing healthcare provider must document that a pregnant individual was made aware of the pregnancy registry at https://covid-pr.pregistry.com or 1-800-616-3791. Pregnant individuals exposed to LAGEVRIO or their healthcare providers can also report the exposure by contacting Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme LLC, Rahway, NJ USA at 1-877-888-4231.Advise individuals of childbearing potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use an effective method of contraception correctly and consistently during treatment with LAGEVRIO and for 4 days after the final dose.Prior to initiating treatment with LAGEVRIO, assess whether an individual of childbearing potential is pregnant or not, if clinically indicated.Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with LAGEVRIO. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue LAGEVRIO and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.LAGEVRIO is not authorized for use in patients less than 18 years of age because it may affect bone and cartilage growth. The safety and efficacy of LAGEVRIO have not been established in pediatric patients.Adverse ReactionsThe most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥1% of subjects in the LAGEVRIO treatment group in the Phase 3 double-blind MOVe-OUT study were diarrhea (2% versus placebo at 2%), nausea (1% versus placebo at 1%), and dizziness (1% versus placebo at 1%) all of which were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate).Serious adverse events occurred in 7% of subjects receiving LAGEVRIO and 10% receiving placebo; most serious adverse events were COVID-19 related. Adverse events leading to death occurred in 2 (&lt;1%) of the subjects receiving LAGEVRIO and 12 (2%) of subjects receiving placebo.Drug InteractionsNo drug interactions have been identified based on the limited available data on the emergency use of LAGEVRIO. No clinical drug-drug interaction trials of LAGEVRIO with concomitant medications, including other treatments for mild to moderate COVID-19, have been conducted.Pregnancy/BreastfeedingThere are no data on the presence of molnupiravir or its metabolites in human milk. It is unknown whether molnupiravir has an effect on the breastfed infant or effects on milk production. Based on the potential for adverse reactions in the infant from LAGEVRIO, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with LAGEVRIO and for 4 days after the final dose. A lactating individual may consider interrupting breastfeeding and may consider pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment and for 4 days after the last dose of LAGEVRIO.Males of Reproductive PotentialNonclinical studies to fully assess the potential for LAGEVRIO to affect offspring of treated males have not been completed. Advise sexually active individuals with partners of childbearing potential to use a reliable method of contraception correctly and consistently during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose of LAGEVRIO. The risk beyond three months after the last dose of LAGEVRIO is unknown.Required Reporting for Serious Adverse Events and Medication ErrorsThe prescribing healthcare provider and/or the provider’s designee is/are responsible for mandatory reporting of all serious adverse events and medication errors potentially related to LAGEVRIO within 7 calendar days from the healthcare provider’s awareness of the event.Submit adverse event and medication error reports, using FDA Form 3500, to FDA MedWatch using one of the following methods:Complete and submit the report online: www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htmComplete and submit a postage-paid FDA Form 3500 (https://www.fda.gov/media/76299/download) and return by:Mail to MedWatch, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852-9787, orFax to 1-800-FDA-0178 orCall 1-800-FDA-1088 to request a reporting formIn addition, please provide a copy of all FDA MedWatch forms to: Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme LLC, Rahway, NJ USA by: Fax: 215-616-5677 E-mail: dpoc.usa@merck.comAbout LAGEVRIO (molnupiravir)LAGEVRIO (molnupiravir) (MK-4482) is an investigational, orally administered nucleoside analog that inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19.Merck and Ridgeback’s ""orange COVID-19 pill"" is a Swedish Orange opaque capsule with the Merck corporate logo and ""82"" printed in white ink, available in certain markets as LAGEVRIO.Molnupiravir was invented at Emory University. Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory (DRIVE), LLC, which was formed by Emory to develop early-stage drug candidates for viral diseases of global concern, advanced molnupiravir through IND submission. Emory/DRIVE received some research funding from the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. National Institutes of Health. LAGEVRIO is being developed by Merck in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. Ridgeback received an upfront payment from Merck and also is eligible to receive contingent payments dependent upon the achievement of certain developmental and regulatory approval milestones. Any profits from the collaboration will be split between the partners equally. Since licensed by Ridgeback, all funds used for the development of LAGEVRIO have been provided by Merck and Ridgeback.LAGEVRIO was evaluated in MOVe-OUT, a global Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-site study of non-hospitalized adult patients with symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed mild to moderate COVID-19 and at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcomes. The Phase 3 portion of the MOVe-OUT trial was conducted globally in more than 170 sites in locations including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, France, Germany, Guatemala, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States. For further information about the MOVe-OUT trial, please visit clinicaltrials.gov.LAGEVRIO is being studied in other diseases beyond coronaviruses. Early work on additional programs has begun, and a study evaluating LAGEVRIO for RSV (NCT05559905) is recruiting participants.About MerckAt Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, we are unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.

(MRK) Worth Betting on Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/most-watched-stock-merck-co-140002696.html,1676901602,STORY,['MRK'],"[Merck (MRK) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned -0.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.4% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Merck belongs, has lost 3.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Merck is expected to post earnings of $1.41 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -34.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -17.6%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.85 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -8.4%. This estimate has changed -5.8% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.60 indicates a change of +25.5% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Merck.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MRK _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Merck, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.81 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -13.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $58.53 billion and $62.24 billion estimates indicate -1.3% and +6.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMerck reported revenues of $13.83 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.3%. EPS of $1.62 for the same period compares with $1.80 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.65%. The EPS surprise was +3.85%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Merck is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

110,7ddfc940-2720-36f3-b839-062729aa9f28,MOS,2023-02-21,Mosaic (MOS) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mosaic-mos-report-q4-earnings-135901272.html,1676901541,STORY,"['MOS', 'KWR', 'TECK', 'EGO']","[The Mosaic Company MOS is set to release fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 22, after the closing bell.The fertilizer maker delivered a negative earnings surprise of around 4.3%, on average, over the trailing four quarters. The company’s fourth-quarter results are likely to reflect the benefits of higher prices and demand for phosphate and potash. Shares of Mosaic have gained 10.8% in the past year compared with a 0.9% rise of the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Do the Estimates Indicate?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Mosaic’s fourth-quarter consolidated sales is currently pegged at $4,307 million, calling for a rise of 12.1% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales in the Phosphates segment is currently pegged at $1,536 million, suggesting an increase of 4.8% year over year.Moreover, the consensus mark for net sales in the Potash segment is currently pegged at $1,321 million, indicating an increase of 47.3% year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales in the Mosaic Fertilizantes segment is currently pegged at $1,719 million, which calls for an increase of 12% year over year.Factors at PlayMosaic is expected to have benefited from higher demand for phosphate and potash in the fourth quarter. Higher agricultural commodity prices and attractive farm economics are driving demand for fertilizers globally. Global phosphate markets remain favorable on healthy demand and low producer and channel inventories. Higher prices are also likely to have driven sales across its segments in the quarter to be reported.The company is also likely to have benefited from actions to reduce costs amid a still-challenging operating environment. Its actions to improve its operating cost structure through transformation plans are expected to have boosted its profitability. Transformational savings are also likely to have supported margins in the December quarter.However, it is likely to have faced headwinds due to higher prices of key raw material in the fourth quarter. Prices of sulfur and ammonia remain elevated, made worse by the uncertainties over the supply from Russia amid the war.  Plant shutdowns and maintenance have also led to a tight supply of raw materials. As such, the company is expected to have faced margin pressure associated higher input costs.Story continuesThe Mosaic Company Price and EPS Surprise The Mosaic Company Price and EPS SurpriseThe Mosaic Company price-eps-surprise | The Mosaic Company QuoteZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Mosaic this season.

111,b4fea29d-26a9-33ee-abf7-1585344033f5,ROK,2023-02-21,Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Rockwell Automation (ROK) is a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-170005506.html,1676912405,STORY,['ROK'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Rockwell Automation (ROK), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Rockwell Automation currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if ROK is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this industrial equipment and software maker holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor ROK, shares are up 4.4% over the past week while the Zacks Industrial Automation and Robotics industry is down 0.33% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 10.27% compares favorably with the industry's 0.18% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of Rockwell Automation have risen 12.41%, and are up 12.52% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 3.78% and -5.37%, respectively.Investors should also take note of ROK's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, ROK is averaging 741,190 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with ROK.Over the past two months, 8 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost ROK's consensus estimate, increasing from $10.64 to $11.02 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that ROK is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Rockwell Automation on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

112,c9b97148-b77f-38df-901c-57eb44fda7ed,WMB,2023-02-21,"Williams Joins United Nations’ Methane Performance Initiative, Strengthening Transparency in Emissions Reporting and Decarbonization of Natural Gas Value Chain",Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/williams-joins-united-nations-methane-120000086.html,1676980800,STORY,['WMB'],"[TULSA, Okla., February 21, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Williams (NYSE: WMB) today announced it has joined the United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP) Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP 2.0), the global initiative designed to improve the energy industry’s methane emissions reporting and to encourage progress in reducing those emissions. Joining OGMP 2.0 supports Williams’ next generation natural gas strategy to drive transparency and decarbonization of the natural gas value chain through technology investments, providing path-specific methane intensity certifications to utilities, LNG export facilities and other clean energy users.OGMP 2.0 is UNEP’s flagship oil and gas reporting and mitigation program. It is the only comprehensive, measurement-based international reporting framework for the sector. In the past two years, nearly 100 companies with operations in more than 60 countries have joined the initiative. They represent more than 35 per cent of global oil and gas production. OGMP 2.0 member companies strive to report methane emissions in accordance with what are widely recognized as the highest established standards while setting industry-leading methane reduction targets.""Williams is committed to achieving the most stringent methane performance standards as prescribed by OGMP 2.0, thus setting the pace for the midstream sector in the United States,"" said Alan Armstrong, Williams President and CEO. ""We handle one third of U.S. natural gas, giving us unique visibility to how gas molecules are produced, processed, transported and used. By leveraging new technology across our nationwide infrastructure footprint, we are confident we can enhance the trust and transparency needed to grow a differentiated low-emissions gas market and provide clean, reliable gas supplies to domestic and international buyers focused on a low-carbon future.""""We are glad to welcome Williams as part of our global initiative, which incentivizes member companies to reduce methane emissions and allocate capital efficiently,"" said Giulia Ferrini, OGMP 2.0 Project Manager, UNEP. ""We look forward to Williams’ contribution as OGMP 2.0 is more than a rigorous reporting framework: it is a unique platform for collective action and peer learning among our members, who jointly develop new industry norms on methane management.""Story continuesWilliams’ NextGen Gas program provides verified emissions profiles and captures the progress from greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions across the natural gas value chain – from customers and its own operations – using monitoring and measurement technologies including satellites, flyovers and multiple sensing devices, as well as real-time internal operational data that is designed to meet the OGMP 2.0 protocols. As part of this program, Williams recently invested in Orbital Sidekick, a satellite-based emissions monitoring company and LongPath Technologies, a provider of laser-based continuous emissions monitoring and quantification technology. Data from these technologies will be aggregated with other forms of measurement data and synthesized by Context Labs’ Decarbonization as a Service (DasS) platform to provide verified emissions profiles and capture the progress from reductions across the natural gas value chain for Williams and its customers.Today’s announced membership in OGMP 2.0 complements other methane performance initiatives in which Williams is engaged, including ONE Future, a group of natural gas companies working to voluntarily reduce methane emissions to less than 1% across the natural gas value chain. Williams also belongs to the Energy Emissions Modelling and Data Lab (EEMDL), a collaborative initiative involving the University of Texas at Austin, Colorado State University and the Colorado School of Mines to provide science-based greenhouse gas emissions assessments of global oil and gas supply chains.In 2022, Williams was once again recognized across several key rankings – including CDP Climate Change Questionnaire, S&amp;P Global ESG Score, Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) and MSCI – for the company’s commitment to transparency and governance around climate change and other ESG topics. Williams was named for the third consecutive year to the DJSI North America index and for the second consecutive year to the DJSI World index.About WilliamsAs the world demands reliable, low-cost, low-carbon energy, Williams (NYSE: WMB) will be there with the best transport, storage and delivery solutions to reliably fuel the clean energy economy. Headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Williams is an industry-leading, investment grade C-Corp with operations across the natural gas value chain including gathering, processing, interstate transportation, storage, wholesale marketing and trading of natural gas and natural gas liquids.

Our natural gas-focused strategy once again resulted in record performance in 2022 with contracted transmission capacity, gathering volumes and Adjusted EBITDA all surpassing previous highs. Despite macroeconomic impacts of inflation, higher interest rates and recession risks, Williams delivered outstanding results that exceeded our financial guidance, even after we raised it twice during the year.""In addition to the outstanding financial results in 2022, we also reached agreements on three acquisitions that bolster our ability to deliver growth through a variety of macroeconomic conditions. We significantly expanded our footprint with the strategic acquisitions of NorTex Midstream and Trace Midstream’s Haynesville assets, a key link in our Gulf Coast wellhead-to-water strategy. And just last week, we closed on our acquisition of MountainWest, enhancing our asset footprint in the western U.S. and growing our fully contracted demand based services. These investments along with our slate of high-return growth opportunities along our existing infrastructure give us a clear path to significant growth for years to come.""Armstrong added, ""Looking ahead, Williams will continue to set the pace for sustainable midstream companies by driving best-in-class emissions performance across the entire value chain. Natural gas is one of the most important tools available to reduce emissions on a global scale, and the build out of electrification and renewables will require our infrastructure and deep expertise in reliable energy delivery, resulting in continued earnings growth for Williams and long-term value creation for our shareholders.""Williams Summary Financial Information4QFull YearAmounts in millions, except ratios and per-share amounts.

These improvements were partially offset by an unfavorable change of $128 million in net unrealized gains/losses on commodity derivatives, higher operating expenses, including higher employee-related costs, and increased intangible asset amortization. The tax provision increased primarily due to higher pretax income.Full-year 2022 net income increased by $532 million compared to the prior year reflecting the benefit of higher service revenues as described above and also reflecting higher commodity-based rates and Transco’s Leidy South project being in service, higher results from our upstream operations, and higher commodity margins, which include unfavorable write-downs of inventory to lower period-end market prices. These improvements were partially offset by higher operating and administrative expenses driven by the increased scale of our upstream operations and higher employee-related costs, including costs from the Sequent acquisition for the full 2022 period, increased intangible asset amortization, an unfavorable change of $140 million in net unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives and the absence of a $77 million favorable impact in 2021 from Winter Storm Uri. The tax provision changed favorably as the impact of higher pretax income was more than offset by $134 million associated with the release of valuation allowances on deferred income tax assets and federal income tax settlements in the second quarter and the net benefit from a lower estimated state deferred income tax rate in the third quarter.Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased as compared to 2021 primarily due to higher operating results exclusive of non-cash items partially offset by unfavorable net changes in working capital. Full-year 2022 cash flow from operations also increased compared to 2021 driven by higher operating results exclusive of non-cash items, favorable changes in margin deposits associated with commodity derivatives, and higher distributions from equity-method investments, partially offset by unfavorable net changes in working capital.Non-GAAP MeasuresFourth-quarter 2022 Adjusted EBITDA increased by $291 million over the prior year, driven by the previously described benefits from service revenues, commodity margins, and upstream operations, partially offset by higher operating costs. Full-year 2022 Adjusted EBITDA increased by $783 million over the prior year due to similar drivers, but also reflecting higher administrative costs and the absence of the favorable impact in 2021 from Winter Storm Uri.Fourth-quarter 2022 Adjusted Income improved by $177 million over the prior year, driven by the previously described impacts to net income, adjusted primarily to remove the effects of net unrealized gains/losses on commodity derivatives and amortization of certain assets from the Sequent acquisition. Full-year 2022 Adjusted Income improved by $570 million over the prior year driven by the previously described impacts to net income, adjusted primarily to remove the effects of net unrealized gains/losses on commodity derivatives, amortization of certain assets from the Sequent acquisition, and favorable income tax benefits.Fourth-quarter 2022 Available Funds From Operations (AFFO) increased by $312 million compared to the prior year primarily due to higher operating results exclusive of non-cash items. Full-year 2022 AFFO increased by $845 million reflecting higher operating results exclusive of non-cash items and higher distributions from equity-method investments.Business Segment Results &amp; Form 10-KWilliams' operations are comprised of the following reportable segments: Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico, Northeast G&amp;P, West and Gas &amp; NGL Marketing Services, as well as Other.

Definitions of Modified EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and schedules reconciling to net income are included in this news release. Transmission &amp; Gulf of MexicoFourth-quarter 2022 Modified and Adjusted EBITDA improved compared to the prior year driven by higher service revenues from the NorTex acquisition, partially offset by higher operating and administrative costs. Year-to-date 2022 Modified and Adjusted EBITDA improved compared to the prior year driven by higher service revenues reflecting Transco’s Leidy South project going in service and the NorTex acquisition, as well as the absence of hurricane related impacts, partially offset by higher operating and administrative costs. Modified EBITDA for the 2022 periods was further impacted by certain regulatory, abandonment, and monitoring charges which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.Northeast G&amp;PFourth-quarter 2022 Modified and Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year driven by higher service revenues from Ohio Valley Midstream, partially offset by lower contributions from equity-investees reflecting lower cost-of-service rates, lower commodity-based rates, lower volumes and impact from winter weather.Both Modified and Adjusted EBITDA also improved for the full-year 2022 period, driven by Ohio Valley Midstream and gathering rate increases, partially offset by lower Susquehanna volumes, higher operating and administrative costs, lower net equity-investee contributions reflecting lower cost-of-service rates partially offset by higher commodity-based rates, lower volumes and impact from winter weather.WestFourth-quarter and full-year 2022 Modified and Adjusted EBITDA increased compared to the prior year benefiting from higher Haynesville gathering volumes including contributions from Trace Midstream acquired in April as well as higher net realized commodity-based rates, partially offset by winter weather impact in the Wamsutter and Rocky Mountain Midstream joint venture as well as higher operating and administrative costs.Gas &amp; NGL Marketing ServicesFourth-quarter 2022 Modified EBITDA improved from the prior year primarily reflecting higher commodity margins which included higher write-downs of inventory to lower period-end market prices, partially offset by a $122 million net unfavorable change in unrealized gains/losses on commodity derivatives, which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.Full-year 2022 Modified EBITDA declined from the prior year primarily reflecting a $168 million net unfavorable change in unrealized loss on commodity derivatives, which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, as well as the absence of a $58 million favorable impact in 2021 from Winter Storm Uri and higher administrative costs associated with the Sequent business acquired in July 2021. These decreases were partially offset by higher commodity margins which included higher write-downs of inventory to lower period-end market prices.OtherFourth-quarter 2022 Modified and Adjusted EBITDA improved compared to the prior year primarily reflecting higher volumes from our upstream operations in the Haynesville Shale, partially offset by winter weather impact in the Wamsutter.Full-year 2022 Modified EBITDA also improved compared to the prior year primarily reflecting higher prices and volumes from our upstream operations and a $25 million net favorable change in unrealized gain/loss on commodity derivatives related to our upstream operations, which is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Both measures were also impacted by higher operating expenses and the absence of a $22 million favorable impact in 2021 from Winter Storm Uri. The full-year results were partially offset by winter weather impact in the Wamsutter.2023 Financial GuidanceThe company expects 2023 Adjusted EBITDA between $6.4 billion and $6.8 billion. The company also expects 2023 growth capex between $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion and maintenance capex between $750 million and $850 million, which includes capital of $250 million for emissions reduction and modernization initiatives. Importantly, Williams anticipates a leverage ratio midpoint of 3.65x, which will allow it to retain financial flexibility. The dividend has been increased by 5.3% on an annualized basis to $1.79 in 2023 from $1.70 in 2022.Williams 2023 Analyst Day Scheduled for Tomorrow, Materials to be Posted ShortlyWilliams is hosting its 2023 Analyst Day event on Tuesday, Feb. 21, 2023 beginning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (7:30 a.m. Central Time).

But if you look at the last five years the returns have not been good. You would have done a lot better buying an index fund, since the stock has dropped 42% in that half decade.After losing 3.1% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance. View our latest analysis for Boeing Boeing wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually expect strong revenue growth. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth.In the last five years Boeing saw its revenue shrink by 12% per year. That puts it in an unattractive cohort, to put it mildly. On the face of it we'd posit the share price fall of 7% compound, over five years is well justified by the fundamental deterioration. We doubt many shareholders are delighted with this share price performance. Risk averse investors probably wouldn't like this one much.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on BoeingWhat About The Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We've already covered Boeing's share price action, but we should also mention its total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Boeing's TSR of was a loss of 39% for the 5 years. That wasn't as bad as its share price return, because it has paid dividends.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Boeing shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 6.5% over one year. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 7% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

If you want to see more companies in this selection, go directly to the 5 Most Valuable Golf Companies In The World.According to the National Golf Foundation, 3.2 million people started playing golf in the US in 2021, while 25.1 million, or 8% of the total population in the US, played golf on a golf course in 2021. Historically, golf has been a male-dominated sport, but the pandemic saw women adopt the sport at a rapid pace. For instance, 25% of female golfers played the sport for the first time at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The sport is also gaining acceptance from Gen Z, as 27% of new golfers are in the 18 to 34 years age bracket. Overall, 6 million people playing golf belong to Gen-Z. This is a positive development for the sport because, in the past, it has usually gained attention from middle-aged and older groups. The emergence of young and dynamic players like Rory Mcllroy has helped the sport gain more prominence amongst the new generation.Despite the lockdowns and restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 502 million rounds of golf were played in 2020. This reflected a 14% year-over-year (YoY) increase from the 2019 level of 441 million rounds. Experts attribute the increase in rounds to the people’s need to go outdoors during the pandemic, which was curtailed due to lockdowns and restrictions. Overall, there are 40,000 golf courses around the world, and around 43% of the golf courses are located in the US. In 2020, the market for golf equipment was estimated to be worth $7,041.3 million, and by 2030, it is anticipated to grow to $10,150.3 million, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.9% from 2021 to 2030.Some of the most popular companies involved in the golf industry include NIKE, Inc.

A decline in imports may indicate a future contraction in industrial production as firms cut purchases of materials and equipment for production.(Reporting by Khanh Vu and Donny Kwok in Hong Kong Editing by Ed Davies and Sonali Paul)]"

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nike (NKE) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Nike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.69, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.69 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 59.3% and 11.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NKEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NKECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Nike here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Nike, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is NKE a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.6% over the past month to $3.12.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nike. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Nike may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If approved, RSVpreF would be the first vaccine for administration to pregnant individuals to help protect against the complications of RSV disease in infants from birth through six monthsThis action follows the recent acceptance of the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Pfizer’s RSV vaccine candidate by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) under accelerated assessment for both older adults and maternal immunizationThe maternal immunization regulatory filings are supported by results of the pivotal Phase 3 trial MATISSE, which will be presented to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), as well as during the ReSViNET Foundation’s 2023 Global Conference, on February 23NEW YORK, February 21, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review a Biologics License Application (BLA) for its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine candidate PF-06928316 or RSVpreF for the prevention of medically attended lower respiratory tract illness (MA-LRTI) and severe MA-LRTI caused by RSV in infants from birth up to six months of age by active immunization of pregnant individuals. This decision follows the FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy Designation for RSVpreF in March 2022. The FDA has accepted the BLA for priority review and has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of August 2023.""If approved, RSVpreF would help protect infants at their first breath from the devastating effects of this infectious disease, which though well-known, has been particularly evident throughout this RSV season,"" said Annaliesa Anderson, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, Vaccine Research &amp; Development, Pfizer. ""We look forward to progressing the review of Pfizer’s RSV maternal vaccine candidate with the FDA and other regulatory authorities, given its significant potential to positively contribute to global health in the prevention of RSV in infants.""Story continuesIn addition, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has accepted Pfizer’s marketing authorization application (MAA) under accelerated assessment for its RSV vaccine candidate for both older adults and maternal immunization to help protect infants. A decision is expected in the second half of 2023.The maternal immunization regulatory submission is supported by the positive top-line results from MATISSE (MATernal Immunization Study for Safety and Efficacy), a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of RSVpreF against MA-LRTI and severe MA-LRTI in infants born to healthy women vaccinated during pregnancy. These data will be presented on February 23 to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and, separately, during the ReSViNET Foundation’s 2023 Global Conference on Novel RSV Preventive and Therapeutic Interventions.Additional ACIP PresentationsDuring the ACIP meeting on February 22-23, the company also will present positive Phase 3 results supporting the regulatory filings of Pfizer’s pentavalent meningococcal vaccine (MenABCWY) candidate, as well as Pfizer’s 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (20vPnC) candidate for pediatric use.In December 2022, Pfizer announced that the FDA had accepted for review a BLA for its MenABCWY candidate for the prevention of meningococcal disease caused by the most common serogroups in individuals 10 through 25 years of age. The PDUFA goal date for a decision by the FDA on the MenABCWY application is in October 2023. If approved and recommended, MenABCWY could help simplify the meningococcal vaccination schedule and provide the broadest serogroup coverage of any meningococcal vaccine. Top-line results from a randomized, active-controlled, and observer-blinded Phase 3 trial of Pfizer’s pentavalent meningococcal vaccine candidate (NCT04440163) were previously announced in September 2022.Similarly, in January 2023, Pfizer announced that the FDA had granted priority review to a supplemental BLA for its 20vPnC candidate for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by the 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) serotypes contained in the vaccine in infants and children 6 weeks through 17 years of age, and for the prevention of otitis media caused by seven of the 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes contained in the vaccine. The PDUFA goal date for the FDA’s decision on the 20vPnC application is in April 2023. If approved, 20vPnC would have the potential to cover more of the clinically significant remaining burden of infant pneumococcal disease than any other available pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. In August 2022 Pfizer announced top-line results from its pivotal U.S. Phase 3 study (NCT04382326), which support the FDA application.Burden of RSVRSV is a contagious virus and a common cause of respiratory illness.1 The virus can affect the lungs and breathing passages of an infected individual and can potentially cause severe illness in young infants, older adults, and individuals with certain chronic medical conditions.2,3,4Among children younger than five years old in the U.S., RSV infections account for approximately 2.1 million outpatient visits and 58,000 hospitalizations each year.5,6 Virtually all children get an RSV infection by the time they are 2 years old7, and RSV is a leading cause of hospitalization in children &lt;1 year of age.8 Worldwide, RSV results in the death of approximately 102,000 children annually, with about half of those in infants less than six months old and the vast majority in developing countries.9,10RSV bronchiolitis is the leading cause of infant hospitalization due to viral respiratory illness, characterized by respiratory distress that can result in death. There is no specific treatment for RSV, only supportive care measures like oxygen and fluids. Currently, there is no vaccine to help prevent RSV in the U.S., leaving most infants without protection. The only available preventive agent is recommended for use among the highest-risk infants in limited settings as a monthly injection with five doses administered during the RSV season.Among adults 65 years and older, RSV infections account for approximately 60,000–160,000 hospitalizations and 6,000–10,000 deaths each year in the U.S. alone.11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 There are currently no targeted prophylactic, therapeutic, or vaccine options for RSV in older adults, and treatment is limited to offering supportive care for adults with the illness.About RSVpreFPfizer’s investigational RSV vaccine candidate builds on foundational basic science discoveries including those made at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which detailed the crystal structure of prefusion F, a key form of the viral fusion protein (F) that RSV uses to enter human cells. The NIH research showed that antibodies specific to the prefusion form were highly effective at blocking virus infection, suggesting a prefusion F-based vaccine may confer optimal protection against RSV. After this important discovery, Pfizer tested numerous versions of a stabilized prefusion F protein and identified a candidate that elicited a strong anti-viral immune response in pre-clinical evaluations. The bivalent vaccine candidate is composed of equal amounts of recombinant RSV prefusion F from subgroups A and B.Pfizer is currently the only company with a maternal RSV vaccine candidate in late-stage development to help protect against RSV. In December 2022, Pfizer announced that the FDA had granted priority review to a biologics license application for RSVpreF for the prevention of RSV disease in older adults.About the Pentavalent Meningococcal Vaccine Candidate (MenABCWY)Pfizer’s pentavalent meningococcal vaccine candidate combines the components from its two licensed meningococcal vaccines, Trumenba® (meningococcal group B vaccine) and Nimenrix® (meningococcal groups A, C, W-135, and Y conjugate vaccine); approvals of Nimenrix® and Trumenba® vary by country. Together, the 5 serogroups included in MenABCWY are responsible for the majority of currently circulating meningococcal disease globally.19INDICATIONS FOR TRUMENBA® IN THE U.S.Trumenba® is a vaccine indicated for individuals 10 through 25 years of age for active immunization to prevent invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis group BIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONTrumenba® should not be given to anyone with a history of a severe allergic reaction to any component of Trumenba®Some individuals with weakened immune systems may have a reduced immune responsePersons with certain complement deficiencies and persons receiving treatments such as Soliris® (eculizumab), are at increased risk for invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis group B even with receipt of vaccination with Trumenba®Vaccination with Trumenba® may not protect all vaccine recipients against N meningitidis group B infectionsFainting can occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines, including Trumenba®The most common adverse reactions in adolescents and young adults were pain at injection site, fatigue, headache, and muscle painData are not available on the safety and effectiveness of using Trumenba® and other meningococcal group B vaccines interchangeably to complete the vaccination seriesTell your health care provider if you are pregnant, or plan to become pregnantAsk your health care provider about the risks and benefits of Trumenba®.

(PFE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-inc-pfe-attracting-investor-140002665.html,1676901602,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer (PFE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this drugmaker have returned -4.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.4% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Pfizer belongs, has lost 3.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $1.06 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -34.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -13.5%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.82 points to a change of -42% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -25.6%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.87 indicates a change of +1.3% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -12%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Pfizer.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PFE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate of $17.94 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -30.1%. The $68.97 billion and $69.57 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -31.3% and +0.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $24.29 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.9%. EPS of $1.14 for the same period compares with $1.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.2 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.36%. The EPS surprise was +10.68%.Over the last four quarters, Pfizer surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Pfizer is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But the times are changing, increasing the likelihood that investors who find good AI stocks to buy will profit over the medium term and the long term.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFor one, the market is, at last, becoming friendlier to high-tech growth stocks. And, of course, the huge amount of publicity surrounding ChatGPT has made Street and retail investors aware of the vast power of AI.Here are three AI stocks to buy. I believe these three names will benefit meaningfully over the long term from their focus on and exploitation of AI.TickerCompanyPriceSTEMStem$9.74INTCIntel$28.20MUMicron$60.05AI Stocks to Buy: Stem (STEM)Close-up of letters ""AI"" written on a computer chip, symbolizing artificial intelligence and AI stocksSource: shutterstock.com/YAKOBCHUK VAs I explained in an August 2021 column, “Stem’s AI platform, Athena, increases the efficiency of energy storage systems that work in tandem with renewable energy ‘by automatically switching between battery power, onsite generation and grid power.’”Given the electrification of transportation, the extremely rapid proliferation of storage batteries and renewable energy, and the huge power of AI, Athena should be able to save companies loads of money.Morgan Stanley is also upbeat on STEM stock. Last month, the firm raised its rating on the shares to “overweight” from “equal weight.” As reasons for its bullishness, the bank cited “improvement in global battery supply, Inflation Reduction Act support and Stem’s focus on driving higher-margin software sales.” Stem’s emphasis on software should serve it well, added MS, which has a $15 price target on the name.Story continuesStem recently announced a joint venture with America’s leading EV charger operator, ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT). That deal looks poised to boost Stem’s financial results considerably in the longer term.In the first nine months of 2023, Stem generated $260.3 million of revenue, versus $127.4 million for all of 2021.Intel (INTC)The Intel (INTC) booth at the CES show in Las Vegas on January 08 2017 , CES is the world's leading consumer-electronics show.Source: Kobby Dagan / Shutterstock.comAmid Intel’s current troubles, the chip maker is looking to cut costs, but it does not appear to be scaling back its efforts to produce semiconductors that enable AI. Indeed, according to a website called HPC wire, Intel is moving “full-speed ahead” on developing its new Gaudi AI chip, Gaudi3, which “will have much more memory, compute and networking than its predecessor,”  the website reported.And impressively, “Gaudi has shown potential to handle large language models powering applications like ChatGPT,” while Gaudi2 trained AI systems faster than a competing Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) chip. Nvidia’s latest offering surpassed Gaudi2, but INTC is, as mentioned earlier, working on Gaudi3, and the chip maker’s ability to, apparently, nearly keep pace with NVDA is very encouraging.Moreover, Intel is looking to combine the Gaudi line with its existing GPU chips that are also used to facilitate AI. The combination could be much better than the two individually.Micron (MU)An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock.Source: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.comMicron is another chip maker that’s well-positioned to benefit from the tremendous growth of AI.Specifically, the company reports that its memory storage products “and multi-chip packages” are enabling the AI revolution.And, driven partly by data centers’ ability to process much more data as a result of using AI, Micron expects individual servers’ memory requirements to double between 2021 and 2025. Moreover, due to the same trend, it expects individual servers’ storage capacity to triple during those same years. Of course, that’s great news for MU since the company specializes in selling memory and storage solutions.Micron’s earnings per share, excluding some items, soared 38% in its fiscal year that ended in September. While that marked a big slowdown from the 114% adjusted EPS growth it enjoyed in its prior fiscal year, the 38% increase is still very impressive for such a large, well-established company amid the decline of consumers’ purchasing of computing products.Despite Micron’s strong growth drivers and its rapid EPS growth, MU stock has a very low price-earnings ratio of just 11.25.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of STEM.  The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Larry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

Since announcing the Revitalization Plan in 2019, Molson Coors has made incredible progress and the strategy is beginning to yield results. We have powerful core brands across our global markets that are seeing renewed strength, with Coors Light and Miller Lite in the U.S. posting their strongest combined full-year dollar share performance in a decade. In Canada, Molson Canadian grew industry share for the full year, and in the U.K., Carling continues to be the number one brand in the market. The Company has continued to aggressively premiumize its portfolio, not only with hard seltzers, but with Simply Spiked Lemonade in the U.S. and Madri in the U.K., which has become one of our top 5 above premium brands globally. And in the fourth quarter, Molson Coors' four largest economy brands in the U.S. combined to grow industry dollar share.Despite an uncertain near-term macro environment, we believe Molson Coors is well-positioned for long-term success. The strength of the Company's brands, coupled with its continued investments in marketing and operational capabilities, provide a strong foundation for expected continued growth in 2023 and beyond.Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer Statement:""In 2022, Molson Coors delivered strong results for the year that exceeded our top-line guidance and met our bottom-line guidance for the full year. Our business is healthier today than it has been in many years, and our trajectory is strong. We have delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of top-line growth on a constant currency basis, driven by the strength of our core brands and growth in our above premium portfolio. We believe our 2022 results are not an aberration or a moment in time but a product of three years of work under our Revitalization Plan. And it is a milestone on our path to delivering sustainable growth, year after year.""Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer Statement:""We are proud of our accomplishments in 2022 particularly given the challenging inflationary and operating environment. While we expect these challenges to continue to impact us and our industry in 2023, we are issuing guidance for the year that anticipates continued growth while investing prudently in the long term health of the business and returning cash to shareholders.""CONSOLIDATED PERFORMANCE - FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2022For the three months ended($ in millions, except per share data) (Unaudited)December 31,2022December 31,2021ReportedIncrease(Decrease)ForeignExchangeImpactConstantCurrencyIncrease(Decrease)(1)Net sales$2,629.5$2,619.20.4%$(89.1)3.8%U.S. GAAP income (loss) before income taxes$(564.1)$109.5N/M$9.2N/MUnderlying income (loss) before income taxes(1)$328.6$215.552.5%$2.951.1%U.S. GAAP net income (loss)(2)$(590.5)$80.0N/MPer diluted share$(2.73)$0.37N/MUnderlying net income (loss)(1)$281.9$176.260.0%Per diluted share(3)$1.30$0.8160.5%N/M = Not meaningfulFor the years ended($ in millions, except per share data) (Unaudited)December 31,2022December 31,2021ReportedIncrease(Decrease)ForeignExchangeImpactConstantCurrencyIncrease(Decrease)(1)Net sales$ 10,701.0$ 10,279.74.1 %$ (298.0)7.0 %U.S. GAAP income (loss) before income taxes$ (62.5)$ 1,239.0N/M$ (15.1)N/MUnderlying income (loss) before income taxes(1)$ 1,104.8$ 1,049.55.3 %$ (24.0)7.6 %U.S. GAAP net income (loss)(2)$ (175.3)$ 1,005.7N/MPer diluted share$ (0.81)$ 4.62N/MUnderlying net income (loss)(1)$ 892.6$ 902.1(1.1) %Per diluted share(3)$ 4.10$ 4.15(1.2) %N/M = Not meaningful(1)Represents income (loss) before income taxes and net income (loss) attributable to MCBC adjusted for non-GAAP items.

Financial volumes decreased 6.9% primarily due to lower Americas brand volumes and cycling the rebuild of U.S. distributor inventory levels in the prior year, partially offset by higher EMEA&amp;APAC financial volumes. Brand volumes decreased 5.2% due to a 6.6% decline in the Americas as a result of softer industry performance.Net sales per hectoliter on a financial volume basis in constant currency increased 11.4%, primarily due to positive net pricing and favorable sales mix resulting from portfolio premiumization and favorable channel mix.Cost of goods sold (COGS) per hectoliter: increased 3.9% on a reported basis primarily due to cost inflation, mainly on materials, transportation and energy costs, mix impacts primarily from portfolio premiumization and volume deleverage, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency movements, changes in our unrealized mark-to-market commodity positions and cost savings programs. Underlying COGS per hectoliter: increased 11.5% in constant currency primarily due to cost inflation, mainly on materials, transportation and energy costs, mix impacts from portfolio premiumization, and volume deleverage, partially offset by cost savings programs.Marketing, general &amp; administrative (MG&amp;A): decreased 13.5% on a reported basis due to the cycling of higher marketing spend in the prior year and the favorable impact of foreign currency movements. Underlying MG&amp;A: decreased 9.9% in constant currency.U.S. GAAP income (loss) before income taxes: U.S. GAAP loss before income taxes of $(564.1) million declined $673.6 million on a reported basis from income in the prior year primarily due to a non-cash $845 million partial goodwill impairment charge in our Americas segment, lower financial volumes and cost inflation, mainly on materials, transportation and energy costs, partially offset by positive net pricing, lower MG&amp;A expense, changes in our unrealized mark-to-market commodity positions and favorable sales mix. The partial goodwill impairment charge in our Americas segment was largely driven by macroeconomic factors including the recent rising interest rate environment, cost inflation pressures in the near to medium term and a softening beer market in certain markets in which we operate.Underlying income (loss) before income taxes: Underlying income before income taxes of $328.6 million improved 51.1% in constant currency primarily due to positive net pricing, lower MG&amp;A expense and favorable sales mix, partially offset by lower financial volumes and cost inflation, mainly on materials, transportation and energy costs.QUARTERLY SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS (VERSUS FOURTH QUARTER 2021 RESULTS)Americas SegmentNet sales: decreased 0.7% on a reported basis and increased 0.4% in constant currency. The increase in constant currency was primarily due to positive net pricing and favorable sales mix, partially offset by lower financial volumes. Financial volumes decreased 10.5% driven by an 11.2% decrease in U.S. domestic shipments attributed to lower brand volumes and cycling the rebuild of distributor inventory levels in the prior year, as well as lower shipments in Canada. Brand volumes decreased 6.6% including declines of 6.8% in the U.S. which were driven by softer industry performance as well as the timing impacts related to one less trading day in the quarter and a shift in volume due to price increases taken in the fourth quarter. Canada brand volumes declined 5.0% due to a softer beer industry and Latin America brand volumes declined 6.9%.Net sales per hectoliter on a financial volume basis in constant currency increased 12.1% primarily due to positive net pricing and favorable sales mix.U.S. GAAP income (loss) before income taxes: U.S. GAAP loss before income taxes of $(499.2) million declined $757.6 million on a reported basis from income in the prior year primarily due to a non-cash $845 million partial goodwill impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2022, lower financial volumes, and cost inflation, mainly on materials, transportation and energy costs, partially offset by positive net pricing, lower MG&amp;A expense and favorable sales mix. The lower MG&amp;A spend was driven by the cycling of higher marketing spend in the prior year.Underlying income (loss) before income taxes: Underlying income before income taxes of $346.5 million increased 29.8% in constant currency primarily due to positive net pricing, lower MG&amp;A expense and favorable sales mix, partially offset by lower financial volumes and cost inflation, mainly on materials, transportation and energy costs.EMEA&amp;APAC SegmentNet sales: increased 6.2% on a reported basis and 20.3% in constant currency, primarily due to higher financial volumes, positive net pricing and favorable sales mix. Financial volumes increased 4.7% primarily due to growth in our above premium portfolio, including the cycling of on-premise restrictions that occurred during the last quarter of 2021, particularly in the U.K. Brand volumes decreased 1.0%, primarily due to markets impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, partially offset by higher volumes due to lapping prior year pandemic restrictions.Net sales per hectoliter on a financial volume basis in constant currency increased 14.9% primarily due to positive net pricing and favorable sales mix resulting from portfolio premiumization and positive channel mix including the cycling of on-premise restrictions that occurred during the last quarter of 2021.U.S. GAAP income (loss) before income taxes: U.S. GAAP income before income taxes of $12.4 million improved $29.2 million on a reported basis from a loss in the prior year primarily due to higher financial volumes, positive net pricing and favorable sales mix, partially offset by cost inflation, mainly on materials, transportation and energy costs.Underlying income (loss) before income taxes: Underlying income before income taxes of $28.1 million improved $23.7 million in constant currency from the prior year, primarily due to higher financial volumes, positive net pricing and favorable sales mix, partially offset by cost inflation, mainly on materials, transportation and energy costs.FULL YEAR CONSOLIDATED HIGHLIGHTS (VERSUS 2021 RESULTS)Net sales: increased 4.1% on a reported basis, and 7.0% in constant currency primarily due to positive net pricing and favorable sales mix resulting from portfolio premiumization and favorable channel mix, partially offset by lower financial volumes. Financial volume decreased 2.1% primarily due to industry softness in the Americas, cycling the rebuild of U.S. distributor levels in the prior year and the impacts of the Québec labor strike, partially offset by growth in Western Europe due to less onerous coronavirus pandemic restrictions.Net sales per hectoliter on a financial volume basis increased 9.3% in constant currency, primarily due to positive net pricing and favorable sales mix driven by portfolio premiumization and favorable channel mix.Cost of goods sold (COGS) per hectoliter: increased 15.6% on a reported basis primarily due to a $462 million increase as a result of changes in our unrealized mark-to-market commodity positions, cost inflation, mainly on materials, transportation and energy costs, mix impacts from portfolio premiumization, higher factored volumes and volume deleverage, partially offset by favorable impacts from foreign currency movements, lower depreciation expense and cost savings programs. Underlying COGS per hectoliter: increased 11.0% in constant currency primarily due to cost inflation, mainly on materials, transportation and energy costs, mix impacts from portfolio premiumization, higher factored volumes and volume deleverage, partially offset by lower depreciation expense and cost savings programs.Marketing, general &amp; administrative (MG&amp;A): increased 2.5% on a reported basis primarily due to the cycling of lower people-related costs in the prior year and the recording of a $56.6 million accrued liability related to potential losses as a result of the ongoing Keystone litigation case including associated interest, partially offset by the favorable impacts from foreign currency movements and reductions in marketing spend on non-core and discontinued brands. Underlying MG&amp;A: increased 3.7% in constant currency.U.S. GAAP income (loss) before income taxes: U.S. GAAP loss before income taxes of $(62.5) million declined $1,301.5 million on a reported basis from income in the prior year primarily due to a non-cash $845 million partial goodwill impairment charge recognized in our Americas segment in the fourth quarter of 2022, changes in our unrealized mark-to-market commodity positions of $462 million, cost inflation, mainly on materials, transportation and energy costs, lower financial volumes and higher MG&amp;A spend, partially offset by positive net pricing, favorable sales mix and lower depreciation expense.Underlying income (loss) before income taxes: Underlying income before income taxes of $1,104.8 million improved 7.6% in constant currency primarily due to positive net pricing, favorable sales mix and lower depreciation expense, partially offset by cost inflation, mainly on materials, transportation and energy costs, lower financial volumes and higher MG&amp;A spend.CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY HIGHLIGHTSU.S. GAAP cash from operations: net cash provided by operating activities was $1,502.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 which decreased $71.5 million compared to the prior year primarily due to unfavorable timing of working capital and lower net income adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by lower income taxes paid and lower payments for incentive compensation. The unfavorable timing of working capital includes the prior year net repayment against various tax payment deferral programs associated with the coronavirus pandemic.Underlying free cash flow: cash received of $852.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 which represents a decrease in cash received of $229.9 million from the prior year, primarily due to lower net cash provided by operating activities and higher capital expenditures as a result of significant investment in our Americas breweries.Debt: Total debt as of December 31, 2022 was $6,562.3 million and cash and cash equivalents totaled $600.0 million, resulting in net debt of $5,962.3 million and a net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio of 2.93x. As of December 31, 2021, our net to debt underlying EBITDA ratio was 3.14x.Dividends: A quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share was declared and paid to eligible shareholders of record on the respective record dates throughout 2022 for a total of $1.52 per share or a CAD equivalent of CAD 1.95 per share.Share Repurchase Program: On February 17, 2022, our Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program up to an aggregate of $200 million of our Company's Class B common stock through March 31, 2026, with repurchases primarily intended to offset annual employee equity award grants. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 995,000 shares under the share repurchase program at a weighted average price of $51.70 per share, including brokerage commissions, for an aggregate value of $51.5 million.OTHER RESULTSTax Rates Table(Unaudited)For the three months endedFor the years endedDecember 31, 2022December 31, 2021December 31, 2022December 31, 2021U.S. GAAP effective tax rate(4.6%)24.8%(198.4%)18.6%Underlying effective tax rate(1)13.8%17.1%19.1%13.8%(1)See Appendix for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures.The decrease in our fourth quarter and full year U.S. GAAP effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of a non-cash $845 million partial goodwill impairment recorded within our Americas segment in the fourth quarter of 2022, which related to goodwill not deductible for tax purposes. The decrease in our full year U.S. GAAP effective tax rate was further impacted by $18 million of tax expense recognized in 2021, which related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities following an announced corporate tax rate increase in the U.K. from 19% to 25%. These decreases to the full year effective tax rate were partially offset by the release of $73 million of reserves for unrecognized tax benefit positions as a result of a settlement reached on a tax audit in 2021.The decrease in our fourth quarter Underlying effective tax rate was primarily due to a $15 million discrete tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $6 million of discrete tax expense recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase in our full year Underlying effective tax rate was primarily due to cycling the release of $73 million of reserves for unrecognized tax benefit positions as a result of a settlement reached on a tax audit in 2021.2023 OUTLOOKFull Year GuidanceWe expect to achieve the following targets for full year 2023 despite the inherent uncertainties that exist with a softer beer industry and the impacts of continued global inflationary cost pressures:Net sales: low single-digit increase versus 2022 on a constant currency basis.Underlying income (loss) before income taxes: low single-digit increase compared to 2022 on a constant currency basis.Capital Expenditures: $700 million incurred, plus or minus 5%Underlying free cash flow: $1.0 billion, plus or minus 10%.Underlying depreciation and amortization: $690 million, plus or minus 5%.Consolidated net interest expense: $240 million, plus or minus 5%.Underlying effective tax rate: in the range of 21% to 23% for 2023.On February 20, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share, to be paid on March 17, 2023, to shareholders of Class A and Class B common stock of record on March 3, 2023. Shareholders of exchangeable shares will receive the CAD equivalent of dividends declared on Class A and Class B common stock.NOTESUnless otherwise indicated in this release, all $ amounts are in U.S. Dollars, and all comparative results are for the Company’s fourth quarter or full year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the fourth quarter or full year ended December 31, 2021.

BYND is likely to register a top-line decline when it reports fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Feb 23. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $78.4 million, suggesting a fall of 22.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for 2022 sales is pegged at $417.4 million, indicating a decline of 10.2% from the year-ago period’s reported figure.Beyond Meat’s bottom line is likely to grow year over year in the fourth quarter.

Price and EPS SurpriseBeyond Meat, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Beyond Meat, Inc. Quote Things to ConsiderBeyond Meat has been grappling with increased manufacturing costs, including higher material costs and increased transportation and warehousing expenses, among others. Declining household penetration for the plant-based meat category amid a rising inflationary environmentremains a concern for the company. In addition, rising competition in the plant-based meat space has been hampering the company’s top-line performance.  For 2022, management expects net revenues in the range of $400-$425 million, reflecting a decline of nearly 14-9% year over year. Management expects gross margin pressure in the fourth quarter of 2022.That said, the company has been focused on curtailing operating expenses. Beyond Meat is driving efficiency gains and rationalizing its production network.  In addition, the company’s regular product introduction, a sturdy distribution channel and prudent partnerships are upsides.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Beyond Meat this time around.

Also, a recovery in the coffee business bodes well.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected the coffee business to deliver strong sales and earnings growth in the fourth quarter.Within carbonated soft drinks, the company’s zero-sugar products have been performing well. And in seltzers, its partnership with Polar has been driving growth. Driven by such upsides, management, in its last earnings report, projected net sales (cc) growth in the low-double-digit range and adjusted earnings per share growth in the mid-single digits for 2022.The company is likely to have retained its strong performance in the Packaged Beverages segment in the fourth quarter, attributable to growth in CSDs, CORE Hydration, Snapple, Polar seltzers, Evian, Mott's and Hawaiian Punch. KDP has also been gaining from strong in-market performance, with strength in CSDs, premium unflavored water, seltzers, teas, apple juice and fruit drinks.However, the company has been witnessing input cost inflation, rising transportation costs and supply-chain disruptions.

In the past two years alone, United Airlines Ventures has invested in start-ups such as Cemvita, Dimensional Energy, and NEXT Renewable Fuels.And in a first among U.S. airlines, anyone who buys a ticket on the United website or app now has the option to contribute to supplement United's investment in the fund. The first 10,000 people who choose to contribute will each receive 500 MileagePlus Miles as a thank-you.SAF is an alternative to conventional jet fuel that, on a lifecycle basis, reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with air travel compared to conventional jet fuel alone. SAF, which currently must be blended with conventional jet fuel to meet regulatory requirements for use within the aircraft, is being made from used cooking oil and agricultural waste, and, in the future, could be made from other feedstocks including household trash or forest waste. To date, United has invested in the future production of over three billion gallons of SAF - the most of any airline in the world.***Story continues""Solving climate change is doable but it requires hard work and real leadership,"" said United CEO Scott Kirby. ""This fund is unique. It's not about offsets or things that are just greenwashing. Instead, we're creating a system that drives investment to build a new industry around sustainable aviation fuel, essentially from scratch. That's the only way we can actually decarbonize aviation.""UAV Sustainable Flight FundThe UAV Sustainable Flight Fund is open to investment by corporations across industries and the fund will prioritize investment in new technology, advanced fuel sources and proven producers, all in an effort to scale the supply of SAF. Partners of the fund also have the potential to gain preferential access to environmental attributes associated with United's supply of SAF.Companies interested in joining the fund can visit united.com/ventures.United has already made investments in or signed purchase agreements with companies using a variety of ingredients and technologies to produce SAF, including feedstocks like ethanol, animal byproducts, forestry and crop waste, and municipal waste, as well as early-stage, promising technologies like synthetic biology and power to liquids. United Airlines Ventures will move selected existing SAF investments to establish the UAV Sustainable Flight Fund portfolio.Consumer Awareness and Call to ActionUnited is also educating consumers about their air travel carbon footprint and giving them the option to take action.Starting today on United.com and the United app, United becomes the first U.S. airline to show customers an estimate of each flight's carbon footprint in their search. Green shading will indicate a lower-carbon option on a per economy seat passenger basis in a customer's chosen itinerary. A flight's carbon footprint is measured in kg CO2e (kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent) and United's estimates, which could differ from actual flight emissions, are based on aircraft type, flying time, seat capacity and the number of people and cargo on a given flight.And consumers who book travel through United for travel within or from the U.S. will now see an option to contribute to supplement United's investment in the UAV Sustainable Flight Fund before check-out. Customers have the choice to contribute $1, $3.50 or $7.00.****The default option for customer contributions is set at $3.50 to illustrate the potential impact of customer action at scale: if the 152 million people who flew on United in 2022 each contributed just $3.50 to the UAV Sustainable Flight Fund, that would be enough to design and build a SAF refinery capable of producing as much as 40 million gallons of alternative fuel annually.*****The Federal Government Recognizes the Value of SAFThe 2022 Inflation Reduction Act includes the largest governmental climate change investments in U.S. history - a new blender's tax credit specifically for SAF along with other critical incentives for clean energy and carbon capture – that will help spur an increase in SAF infrastructure and supply while lowering costs for SAF consumers.The U.S. military currently uses nearly five billion gallons of jet fuel annually and the Department of Defense will use a jet fuel blend containing at least 10% SAF by 2028 because of the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act.And according to the U.S. Department of Energy, the country's vast feedstock resources are enough to meet the projected SAF demand of the entire U.S. aviation industry.United's Commitment to Net Zero Emissions by 2050United aims to be 100% green by reducing its GHG emissions 100% by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets. In addition to the UAV Sustainable Flight Fund, United has launched a SAF purchasing program called the Eco-Skies Alliance and established a venture fund - United Airlines Ventures - to identify and invest in companies and technologies that can decarbonize air travel. These strategic investments include carbon capture, hydrogen-electric engines, electric regional aircraft and air taxis.About UnitedUnited's shared purpose is ""Connecting People.

The online seat engine first reviews all available free Economy seats and then opens complimentary upgrades to available Preferred Seats, if needed.Customers traveling with children under 12 will start to see more adjacent seat options immediately and the complete policy change will go into effect in early March.In instances when adjacent seats are not available prior to travel - due to things like last minute bookings, full flights or unscheduled aircraft changes – United's new policy also lets customers switch for free to a flight to the same destination with adjacent seat availability in the same cabin. Customers also won't be charged if there is a difference in fare price between the original and new flight.""In an era where more families are working in a hybrid environment, they're traveling more often – and they're flying United,"" said Linda Jojo, Chief Customer Officer for United. ""We're focused on delivering a great experience for our younger passengers and their parents and know it often starts with the right seat. We look forward to rolling out more family-friendly features this year.""Many airlines try and use a more manual process to seat families together that can include blocking random seats or asking agents to facilitate seat swaps at the gate. Those circumstances often result in more stress and a longer boarding process for everyone.Story continuesToday's announcement reflects the investments United has made in its technology and tools. Since last summer, the airline has worked to improve its ability to seat families together more easily by optimizing the airline's seat engine to prioritize families who did not have seats assigned before their day of travel and prioritize adjacent seating for families during schedule changes, aircraft swaps or irregular operations.United Polaris®, United First Class® and Economy Plus® seats remain separate products and are excluded from this family seating policy change.About UnitedUnited's shared purpose is ""Connecting People.

146,7b4f6206-0146-3875-8862-46741b2b9a9f,PNW,2023-02-21,Earnings Preview: Pinnacle West (PNW) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-pinnacle-west-pnw-150003691.html,1676905203,STORY,['PNW'],"[The market expects Pinnacle West (PNW) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 27, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis power company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.18 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -175%.Revenues are expected to be $841.12 million, up 5.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 54.55% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Pinnacle West?For Pinnacle West, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -14.55%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Pinnacle West will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Pinnacle West would post earnings of $2.62 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.88, delivering a surprise of +9.92%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Pinnacle West doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, PG&amp;E (PCG), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.28 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates no change from the year-ago quarter. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $5.7 billion, up 8.6% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for PG&amp;E has been revised 13.6% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -4.22%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PG&amp;E will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, the Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) share price is up 66% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 42% (ignoring dividends).Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Intuitive Surgical managed to grow its earnings per share at 14% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 11% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company. Of course, with a P/E ratio of 63.31, the market remains optimistic.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Intuitive Surgical shareholders are down 16% for the year. Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 6.6%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 11%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. Is Intuitive Surgical cheap compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Story continuesOf course Intuitive Surgical may not be the best stock to buy.

Although the dividend is now higher, the yield is only 1.3%, which is below the industry average. See our latest analysis for CSX CSX's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageThe dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. However, CSX's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 14.5%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 19%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendCSX Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.187 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.40. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 7.9% a year over that time. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are LimitedSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. However, CSX's EPS was effectively flat over the past five years, which could stop the company from paying more every year. While EPS growth is quite low, CSX has the option to increase the payout ratio to return more cash to shareholders.CSX Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for CSX that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Is CSX not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

The second is that, we are in seasonally a very bullish period. Pre-election year seasonality for the first quarter is better than any other of the 16 quarters that make up the presidential cycle. The third is that we continue to see pretty excessive bearish sentiment across the board... The near term sentiment has gotten a little more optimistic. However, if we saw anything from recent reports of investor risk, people are very much on the sidelines and we're seeing very high levels of investor cash. That makes me think that we are in very much a bull market that can continue.""Mark Newton's views are remarkably similar to those of billionaire investor Ken Fisher. Newton thinks that the market bottomed somewhere in October 2022 and now we are in a bull market. Newton thinks that technology, which was one of the worst-performing sectors in 2022, is now making a comeback. Newton supported his thesis by elaborating on how the market has ""gone from extreme pessimism to now skepticism"". While ""we haven't reached bullishness yet"", according to Mark Newton, ""the market's respecting inflation selling off sharply as well as a pivot potentially with the Fed"".Story continuesMark Newton thinks ""both energy and healthcare have a chance of snapping back"". However, he sees tech ""being a phenomenally good sector to position in for 2023"". According to Mark Newton, interest rates will ""continue to come down over the course of the year"" and ""that should fuel growth"". Newton thinks ""growth comes back and tech outperforms"" in 2023, and he also revealed that his year-end target for the S&amp;P 500 is 4,500.Some of the most profitable NASDAQ stocks today are Meta Platforms, Inc.

We narrowed down our screen and looked for companies that had a trailing twelve-month net income of greater than $4 billion. We used data from Yahoo Finance to verify each company’s net income and finally picked the 25 companies that had reported the highest annual net income for fiscal 2022. We have ranked these stocks in ascending order of their TTM net income, as of fiscal 2022. Since companies use different fiscal years, we have mentioned the end-date of each company’s fiscal year along with its net income.Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks Today25.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”23.

Netflix added 2.4 million subscribers in the quarter, beating the Street’s expectation of 1.1 million added subscribers, and management guided to 4.5 million subscriber additions for 4Q, above expectations for 4.1 million.We believe that 2022 was an inflection year for Netflix as the company became free cash flow (“FCF”) positive during 1Q22 and FCF should scale from here (management guided to $1 billion FCF for 2022). A combination of strategic initiatives, price increases and a stabilization of content investment should position the company for high-single digit annual revenue growth, while driving improved operating margin to more than 25% over the next few years. Revenue grew 6% for 3Q22 and operating margin was 19%, up from 10% in 2018.

After a qualitative review of Lam Research, we believe the company will face a number of headwinds that could make for an unfavorable risk-reward position, given the highly cyclical nature of its business in a slowing global economy. We are also expecting fundamentals to turn negative as sales and operating profits are poised to decelerate, resulting in negative earnings revisions. While the stock trades at an attractive valuation multiple, we believe that this is more a sign that earnings will decline meaningfully.”20. Adobe Inc.

The company had revenues of $17.6 billion in its last fiscal year with operating margins in the mid-30s. The company has also grown revenues at double-digit rates every year since 2015.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors was dominated by  Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”13.

Two of our top five largest individual detractors for the period were in the health care sector: Sanofi(NASDAQ:SNY) and Bayer (OTCPK:BAYZF). Sanofi, a French pharmaceutical and health care company, saw its share price fall after it was named as a co-defendant in a class action lawsuit alleging that Sanofi and other sellers of the heartburn medication Zantac failed to warn of the drug’s risk of containing a possible carcinogen.”12.

Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”11. Micron Technology, Inc.

For more semiconductor stocks, head on over to 5 High Growth Semiconductor Stocks that are Profitable. The semiconductor industry is the backbone of the technological world. This is simply due to the principles of computer science, as any gadget, whether it is a small smoke detector or a mega supercomputer, must have a processor or semiconductor to perform the required functions. Therefore, as long as there is technology, the chip sector will be present to power all the devices out there.However, while on the surface the industry appears to make only chips, the reality is that there a countless different firms that contribute to the manufacturing process. Broadly speaking, the chip sector is divided into several categories such as design equipment manufacturers, product designers, equipment providers, manufacturers, and front end firms that package the final product into usable forms. Together, these make up an ecosystem responsible for transforming sand into a high end processor.In terms of market value, the semiconductor industry was worth $556 billion in 2021 according to DigiTimes Research, and from then until 2030, it is slated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7% to sit a $1 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Out of this estimate, the biggest portion will be for communications and computing devices, according to the research firm. These are products that are used in computers, smartphones, and other products and cover chips such as central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and modems. Within the market, the communications sector will grow slower when compared to the broader market through a 6% CAGR to $318 billion, with the computing sector also exhibiting a similar CAGR and sitting at $360 billion by 2030. However, the current gold rush in the electric vehicle segment and the increasing use of electronics will lend the automotive sector a faster than the average growth rate. DigiTimes estimates that this industry will have a whopping 12% CAGR and grow to $145 billion.Story continuesTechnologically, there are several emerging trends in the industry right now. For instance, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is currently engaged in mass producing chips on the 3-nanometer node - which is the most advanced chip making process in the world. At its heels is the chip giant Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), who, according to statements by its chief executive officer Mr. Patrick Gelsinger, aims to catch up to TSMC in less than two years. On the backend side of things, both Intel and TSMC along with other chipmakers are in a rush to procure the latest chipmaking machines from ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) before they become short. ASML is the only company capable of making machines used in fabricating advanced chips, and the new equipment, called High-NA, is capable of producing crisper chip designs.Today, we'll look at the top profitable semiconductor firms, and those that stand out are Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:MPWR), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), and Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI).12 High Growth Semiconductor Stocks that are ProfitableEgorov Artem/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology We used the Finviz stock screener to pick out which chip firms are highly profitable. The firms are selected based on a net profit margin that is greater than 15%. The net profit margin divides the firm's net income by its overall sales, and those with a higher percentage earn more cents on each dollar of sales. They were then further sifted through based on a quarterly revenue growth greater than 15%. Finally, the companies' income statement was analyzed to confirm that the net income is not influenced by a one off event, such as a business unit sale. The final candidates are ranked through their sequential sales growth.High Growth Semiconductor Stocks that are Profitable12.

But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Analog Devices (ADI) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this semiconductor maker is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Analog Devices is 11.3%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 8.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 5.7%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Analog Devices is 99%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 40.2%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 26.7% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 18.1%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Analog Devices. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 6.5% over the past month.Bottom LineAnalog Devices has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Analog Devices is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The stock has been a strong performer lately, and the momentum might continue with analysts still raising their earnings estimates for the company.The rising trend in estimate revisions, which is a result of growing analyst optimism on the earnings prospects of this semiconductor maker, should get reflected in its stock price. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Our stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- has this insight at its core.The five-grade Zacks Rank system, which ranges from a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record of outperformance, with Zacks #1 Ranked stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 2008.For Analog Devices, there has been strong agreement among the covering analysts in raising earnings estimates, which has helped push consensus estimates considerably higher for the next quarter and full year.The chart below shows the evolution of forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSCurrent-Quarter Estimate RevisionsFor the current quarter, the company is expected to earn $2.67 per share, which is a change of +11.25% from the year-ago reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog Devices has increased 13.65% over the last 30 days, as eight estimates have gone higher compared to no negative revisions.Current-Year Estimate RevisionsFor the full year, the company is expected to earn $10.38 per share, representing a year-over-year change of +8.46%.In terms of estimate revisions, the trend for the current year also appears quite encouraging for Analog Devices.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, Analog Devices has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while M/A-Com has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that ADI has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.ADI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.57, while MTSI has a forward P/E of 22.27. We also note that ADI has a PEG ratio of 1.52. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. MTSI currently has a PEG ratio of 2.28.Another notable valuation metric for ADI is its P/B ratio of 2.67. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, MTSI has a P/B of 5.57.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to ADI's Value grade of B and MTSI's Value grade of C.Story continuesADI has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than MTSI, so it seems like value investors will conclude that ADI is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

156,6ed15fb9-6f0e-36f1-91a4-2412a9fcaddc,ADI,2023-02-21,4 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy in a Challenging Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-semiconductor-stocks-buy-challenging-134601884.html,1676900761,STORY,"['MCHP', 'ADI', 'SLAB', 'STM']","[Semiconductor sales have been slowing over the past few months. However, 2022 still emerged as one of the strongest years for the industry. In reality, semiconductor sales had one of their best years ever regionally owing to robust demand.Demand is still robust, which has been assisting in boosting sales despite worries that the semiconductor market may shrink now that the supply-chain issue has significantly subsided. Also, the United States is working to increase its semiconductor manufacturing output in order to become self-sufficient, thanks to a new law that was developed last year with this aim. Given this situation, semiconductor stocks like Analog Devices ADI, Microchip Technology MCHP, Silicon Laboratories Inc. SLAB and STMicroelectronics N.V. STM are likely to benefit in the near term.Semiconductor Sales GrowingAccording to SIA, worldwide semiconductor sales increased 3.2% to $573.5 billion in 2022 from $555.9 billion in 2021, according to data released on Feb 3. Although global semiconductor sales declined both in the fourth quarter and December, demand for semiconductors has remained high almost throughout the year.Year over year, sales dropped $130.2 billion or 14.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022. According to SIA, the semiconductor market in 2022 experienced major ups and downs, with sales falling off in the second half of the year.“Despite short-term fluctuations in sales due to market cyclicality and macroeconomic conditions, the long-term outlook for the semiconductor market remains incredibly strong, due to the ever-increasing role of chips in making the world smarter, more efficient, and better connected,” said John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO.Semiconductor sales skyrocketed soon after the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020. There was a rise in the demand for communication tools and accessories as more people studied and worked from home. A large part of demand was also driven by the auto industry.Story continuesHigh demand coupled with lockdowns in several countries resulted in a shortage of semiconductors. This resulted in a supply-chain crisis and manufacturers struggled to meet the demand from several industries.However, over the past year, the issue has largely been resolved, which brought down the pressure of high demand from different industries.Besides, a number of interrelated issues, such as rising prices, geopolitical tensions, and pandemic aftereffects, have combined to cause the current short-term decline. These elements have influenced consumer spending, macroeconomic uncertainty and swings in semiconductor demand.For instance, the demand for semiconductors that power consumer gadgets like PCs, cellphones, and tablets have declined along with household expenditure on those items.Even then, demand for semiconductors is quite high, which is driving sales.Additionally, the need for semiconductors is being fueled by the development of technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and the Internet of Things.Our ChoicesGiven the continued demand, it would be wise to invest in semiconductor stocks. Below are four chip stocks that investors can gain from in the current scenario.Analog Devices is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing (“DSP”) integrated circuits.

According to Sky News, it will also allege that Mastercard and Visa - and not market forces - imposed the level of these fees on banks as a condition of doing business with them.A source quoted by Sky News said the size of the legal action could be at a minimum of £7.5 billion (£1 = $1.2089), although the amount may ultimately be double that sum.

Combined, the four terminals would expand US oil exports by nearly 7m barrels every day, handling the capacity of half of all current national oil exports.Should all of these projects be allowed to proceed and then operate at full capacity for their expected 30-year lifespan, it will result in an incredible 24bn metric tonnes of greenhouse gases once the transported oil is burned, an analysis conducted for the Guardian by Global Energy Monitor has found.These huge “carbon bomb” projects, critics say, fatally undermine Biden’s image as a president who has acted decisively to stem the climate crisis. No new major fossil fuel infrastructure can be built if the world is to avoid dangerous global heating, the International Energy Agency has warned.“The amount of oil going through these projects, and the resulting emissions, are pretty astounding,” said Baird Langenbrunner, an analyst at Global Energy Monitor, who added that the emissions total is likely a worst-case scenario as it is unlikely all four terminals will be built and then operate at full capacity for decades.Interactive“But even if the emissions are a bit lower then, we are fast-forwarding ourselves to the date where we have to stop completely emitting,” said Langenbrunner. “Any extra emissions are in direct conflict with climate goals and it’s hypocritical for the Biden administration to allow these things to get built and then say the US wants to decrease its own emissions.”Story continuesThe oil shipped from the planned terminals would be extracted from the vast Permian basin that lies beneath Texas and New Mexico, and fed through a network of pipelines to huge tankers that would convey it from the Gulf of Mexico to buyers overseas. The emissions from the burned oil would not count towards the US’s total carbon pollution, which Biden has vowed to halve this decade, but will still escalate the disastrous climate crisis.The Sea Port oil terminal, a joint venture between Enterprise, Enbridge and Chevron, will be the US’s largest oil export terminal once built, with a capacity of 2m barrels a day. This is around a quarter of all the oil the US currently exports each day and is part of a national boom in oil extraction that will hit record levels this year and next, despite Biden’s climate pledges and Republican claims that the US president has shut down domestic drilling.The project will link 140 miles of land-based and underwater pipelines to an onshore storage facility near the city of Freeport. Two underwater pipelines will run to the deepwater port located offshore, a key requirement for an oil industry that is keen to shift huge amounts of the resource from the Permian basin but has been frustrated by a lack of deep ports on the Texas coast with the capacity for the very largest oil tankers.In November, the maritime administration, an arm of the US Department of Transport, approved the construction of the Sea Port oil terminal, referencing the heightened demand for new oil and gas in Europe following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The project “is in the national interest because the project will benefit employment, economic growth, and US energy infrastructure resilience and security”, the agency wrote in its decision. “The port will provide a reliable source of crude oil to US allies in the event of market disruption.”InteractiveThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also recommended that the Sea Port oil terminal go ahead, albeit with mitigating features to avoid “disproportionate adverse impacts” to low-income people and people of color who will probably bear the brunt of the new development. Brazoria county, which includes Freeport, already fails to meet national clean air standards for ozone, a pollutant linked to a range of respiratory problems.The approval of the port has triggered a lawsuit from a coalition of green and local groups, which allege the oil terminal will threaten the critically endangered Rice’s whale, expose already overburdened communities of color to toxic air and create emissions equivalent to running 90 coal-fired power plants, a situation they say is “a stain on the Biden administration’s climate and environmental justice record”.The maritime administration, meanwhile, is poised to decide upon permits for three other proposed terminals – called Texas Gulf Link, Blue Marlin Offshore Port and Bluewater Texas – that are at various stages of development. The Texas GulfLink project is located just a few miles from the Sea Port oil terminal, running through the small town of Jones Creek.Until 2015, when Congress lifted a ban on crude oil exports, the US barely exported any fossil fuels, but following a glut of shale oil and fracking activity the country is now the world’s third largest oil exporter and the leading exporter of liquified natural gas, or LNG.At least 16 gas export terminals have been approved or are under construction along the Gulf of Mexico coast, which, along with the new oil activity, has spurred fresh concerns among environmental justice advocates for coastal communities already dealing with toxic air pollution and safety concerns. In June last year, a large LNG export plant in Freeport exploded, due to what regulators say were systemic failures in its operation.The Bryan Mound strategic petroleum reserve near Freeport, Texas. The area is already home to many pollution-producing facilities. Photograph: Adrees Latif/Reuters“It’s shocking the number of pipelines we already have and the dangers we face, such as explosions and oil spills, it’s just too much,” said Melanie Oldham, an air quality activist and Freeport resident who said that many of her neighbours suffer asthma and other health conditions from living next to a tangle of polluting facilities.“We are a low-income community – 65% of people here are Hispanic and this seems to be where they always want to build oil terminal projects,” she said. “We are a sacrifice zone. It’s a constant worry and we just wonder when it will all stop.”Oldham was part of a protest in Washington DC last year over the proposed oil terminals, which ended with four arrests. She said she is “extremely disappointed” that Biden has overseen a surge in oil drilling, despite promising to shut it down when he was a candidate for president. Biden has repeatedly called for expanded oil drilling to bring down gasoline costs for US drivers and during his recent State of the Union address said: “We’re going to need oil for at least another decade, and beyond that.”The Biden administration’s continuing embrace of fossil fuel drilling projects, likely including the controversial Willow project in the Alaska Arctic, risks undermining its major triumphs in confronting the climate crisis, such as the passage last year of the Inflation Reduction Act, a $370bn (£308bn) package to shift the US to clean energy. Biden’s term has been a confounding one for many climate activists.“These oil terminals will lock us into decades of greenhouse gas emissions and jeopardises our ability to meet national and international climate goals,” said Kelsey Crane, senior policy advocate at Earthworks, an environmental group. “The Biden administration’s continued fossil fuel expansion contradicts the science on what we need to do to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of climate change.“We can’t invest in clean energy if we’re not phasing out fossil fuels – we need to reinstate the ban on oil exports and think about a managed decline for fossil fuels within this administration.”A spokesperson for the maritime administration didn’t answer questions on how its approvals fit in with climate goals but said the Sea Port oil terminal will create “a safer, more efficient mechanism for exporting oil”.]"

There were no shortages. And our energy: We managed to make sure he didn’t use this weapon in the effective way.""The war, however, fueled an energy price crisis in the EU that sent the bills of households and businesses through the roof.“Our citizens did have to bear the brunt of his manipulations,"" Timmermans added. “But he didn’t get us. He didn’t divide us and he certainly didn’t get us on our knees.""In response to reduced supplies of Russian energy, the EU introduced last year counter measures that included launching a nearly 300 billion-euro ($320 billion) program to promote more efficient fuel use and a faster rollout of renewable power.The EU also introduced embargoes on Russian coal and oil, accompanied by a price cap on Russian oil exports. In addition, the bloc diversified its energy sources by sealing deals for liquefied natural gas to compensate for the loss of Russian gas and fill its stocks for the winter while reducing its use of gas and electricity.Story continuesAs Putin continues to justify his invasion of Ukraine by accusing Western countries of threatening Russia, Timmermans said the Russian leader's use of energy as a weapon has backfired. In January, gas prices on the European spot market were back to their prewar level.“He’s losing a lot of income because of this,"" Timmermans said. “He’s selling his oil and cut prices to India and China. He has to reduce the sale of gas. He thought he could use that as a weapon. But the weapon turned against him, and it has sped up.""Some EU member countries reduced their natural gas consumption by more than 20% this year, Timmermans said. The war ""is changing the way we relate to energy and it’s helping us understand that we need to move quicker in terms of renewable energy,"" he added.According to the bloc’s data, gas consumption in the EU dropped by 19.3% in the period August 2022-January 2023, compared with the average gas consumption for the same months between 2017 and 2022.To meet the EU's goal of becoming climate neutral by 2050, the European Commission supports a target of 45% renewable energy sources in the bloc’s energy mix by 2030 as countries look to wind and solar power to bolster their energy security.According to a review by global energy think tank Ember, “a massive scale-up in clean energy is on its way"" in Europe. Wind and solar in 2022 generated a record 22% of the bloc's electricity and for the first time overtook gas, which accounted for 20%. Coal power accounted for 16%.“We have a unique opportunity to move toward clean technologies that will need no emissions, that will be circular, so you don’t have to keep digging up primary materials,"" Timmermans said. “If we move in that direction, clean growth is possible. I am optimistic about the potential of that, but we have to move quicker than we’re moving now.""Timmermans insisted that time is running out to keep average global temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. That target, laid down in the 2015 Paris climate accord, appears increasingly doubtful as temperatures have already increased by more than 1.1 C.“And we need to make sure that our policies will keep us well below 2 degrees of temperature increase,"" he added. “If we continue with the policies of today, we will overshoot 2 degrees and we will be in a completely different territory.""___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine and of tje climate and environment at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment]"

However, with the rise of artificial intelligence—specifically, the rise of generative AI—GPUs are finding novel and rampant use cases.Microsoft, which pumped billions into the ChatGPT creator OpenAI at the start of this year, already partnered with Nvidia in November 2022 to build a massive computer to “help enterprises train, deploy, and scale AI, including large, state-of-the-art models.”For Nvidia, the market leader in graphics chips designed for complex computing tasks, the AI revolution is promising. The more people use ChatGPT, the more computing power OpenAI will require. Even if ChatGPT itself turns out to be more fad and fluff than gamechanger, its fundamentals hold the potential for huge changes in the computing industry.Quotable: Nvidia piggybacks on the generative AI rage“[Nvidia’s] full-stack of accelerated silicon/systems/software/developers positions it uniquely to lead the nascent generative AI arms race among global cloud and enterprise customers...

When the yield curve inverts, it reflects long-term interest rates falling below short-term rates. The move is indicative of investors putting more money to work in longer dated bonds amid fear of near-term economic prospects.Fear an inverted yield curve?Second, according to Matejka, money supply continues to move lower in the both the U.S. and Europe as interest rates remain on an upward trajectory.And lastly is that bank lending standards have been tightening, leading to slower demand for credit and usually serving as a precursor to recessions.""We do not see recession as off the table now, and believe the rally will fade as we move through Q1,"" Matejka wrote. ""Recession view is being priced out… however, key monetary signals are all sending warnings signs.""A woman walks by Caution Falling Ice sign in downtown Chicago, Illinois, on January 26, 2021. (Photo by KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI/AFP via Getty Images)Thus far in 2023, markets have ignored all of these macro warning signals. Investors have also overlooked a borderline dreadful earnings season.The blended earnings decline for the fourth quarter for the S&amp;P 500 is tracking at 4.7% according to Factset. If this drop holds, it will mark the first year on year profit decline for the S&amp;P 500 since the third quarter of 2020.Yet, here we are with solid returns in markets year to date.The Nasdaq Composite has churned out a 12.6% gain year-to-date on the back of pure hype around new artificial intelligence applications from the likes of Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA). Hopes for a Fed pivot on interest rate policy have only lit a further flame to the bid in often high-risk tech stocks.Story continuesThe S&amp;P 500 has advanced 6.2%, meanwhile, as investors position for a rebound of the Chinese economy following the loosening of COVID lockdowns.At the same time, various Fed officials have walked back any talk of a pivot on interest rates this month, which has weighed on stocks this month. And earnings from the likes of Walmart and Home Depot this week stand to offer up a mixed view on the U.S. consumer, at best.All in all, as argued by Matejka, investors may be setting themselves for a springtime disappointment as reasons to be optimistic take a few hits.""Now fed funds are almost 5%, quantitative tightening is proceeding, the yield curve is negative (has been for three months), and M2 in February is probably down almost -3% year on year (a significant decline),"" EvercoreISI chairman Ed Hyman wrote in a research note.

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.McKesson (MCK) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this prescription drug distributor is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for McKesson is 17%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 8.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 5.9%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, McKesson has an S/TA ratio of 4.36, which means that the company gets $4.36 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.76, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And McKesson is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 4.3% this year versus the industry average of 1.1%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for McKesson have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4.7% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made McKesson a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that McKesson is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The optimism, led by a solid third-quarter 2022 performance, along with its focus on patient monitoring, is expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding overdependence on Masimo SET and stiff competition persist.Over the past six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 19.5 compared with the industry’s 2.4% growth. The S&amp;P 500 declined 2.3% in the said time frame.This renowned global provider of non-invasive monitoring systems has a market capitalization of $8.66 billion. The company projects 17.2% growth in 2023 revenues and expects to maintain its strong performance going forward. Masimo delivered an earnings surprise of 8.3% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Positive Study Outcomes: We are optimistic about Masimo’s products, which have been the subject of various studies over the past few months. In January, the company announced favorable results of a prospective study in which researchers sought to assess the impact of varying ventilation strategies on the cerebral oxygenation of patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).Patient-Monitoring in Focus: On the third-quarter 2022 earnings call in November 2022, Masimo confirmed that its Healthcare business has been witnessing solid growth as it realizes a steady stream of new customer wins globally. In its consumer business, sales growth had also exceeded management’s expectations as demand for premium audio products was strong.On the same call, Masimo confirmed that it had secured important new customers in its Healthcare business, including Denver Health and Nationwide Children’s (a renowned children’s hospital in the United States).In January, Masimo signed an agreement to expand its partnership with Royal Philips for augmenting patient monitoring capabilities in home telehealth applications. The partnership will integrate Masimo W1 watch’s advanced health tracking capabilities with Philips’s enterprise patient monitoring ecosystem to improve telemonitoring and telehealth.Story continuesStrong Q3 Results: Masimo’s solid third-quarter 2022 results buoy our optimism. The company recorded a solid uptick in the top line and its healthcare business. Robust order shipments and expansion of the company’s installed base were also seen. The Masimo W1 health watch’s full market release in August 2022 was promising. Enhancement to its telehealth capabilities also raises optimism.DownsidesOverdependence on Masimo SET: Masimo currently derives the majority of its revenues from primary product offerings like the Masimo SET platform, Masimo rainbow SET platform and related products. Thus, the company’s business is highly dependent on the continued success and market acceptance of its primary product offerings.Stiff Competition: Masimo operates in an intensely competitive medical device industry and is significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. The Masimo SET platform faces additional competition from companies developing products for use with third-party monitoring systems and from companies currently marketing their pulse oximetry monitors.Masimo Corporation PriceMasimo Corporation PriceMasimo Corporation price | Masimo Corporation QuoteEstimate TrendMasimo has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings per share (EPS) has moved 0.2% north to $4.37. The metric for fourth-quarter 2022 is stable at $1.17 per share for the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $601 million, indicating an 83.5% improvement from the year-ago period.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space include McKesson MCK, Cardinal Health, Inc.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company to watch right now is Henry Schein (HSIC). HSIC is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 16.56 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 18.32. Over the last 12 months, HSIC's Forward P/E has been as high as 18.52 and as low as 12.89, with a median of 16.11.Investors should also recognize that HSIC has a P/B ratio of 2.64. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 6.50. Within the past 52 weeks, HSIC's P/B has been as high as 3.03 and as low as 2.10, with a median of 2.57.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. HSIC has a P/S ratio of 0.89. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.08.Story continuesFinally, we should also recognize that HSIC has a P/CF ratio of 13.25. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 24.79. Over the past 52 weeks, HSIC's P/CF has been as high as 14.86 and as low as 10.52, with a median of 12.88.Investors could also keep in mind McKesson (MCK), an Medical - Dental Supplies stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.McKesson is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 13.84 at the moment, with a PEG ratio of 1.34. This compares to its industry's average P/E of 18.32 and average PEG ratio of 1.63.Over the past year, MCK's P/E has been as high as 15.66, as low as 11.69, with a median of 14.02; its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.56, as low as 0.99, with a median of 1.71 during the same time period.McKesson also has a P/B ratio of -23.84 compared to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 6.50. Over the past year, its P/B ratio has been as high as -23.48, as low as -59.10, with a median of -33.73.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Henry Schein and McKesson's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment.

The figure topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.7%.The adjustments include expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, and restructuring and restructuring-related charges, among others.Our projection of adjusted EPS was $1.00.GAAP EPS for the quarter was 51 cents, reflecting a plunge of 15% year over year.Full-year adjusted EPS was $3.88, down 4.9% compared to the end of 2021. Our projection of full-year adjusted EPS was $3.77.Revenues in DetailInteger Holdings registered revenues of $372.4 million in the fourth quarter, up 18.9% year over year. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.6%.Organically, revenues increased 13.4%.The fourth-quarter revenue compares to our estimate of $361.6 million.Robust segmental performances drove the company’s top line in the reported period.Full-year revenues were $1.38 billion, reflecting a 12.7% improvement from the comparable 2021 period. Organically, revenues increased 6.5%.Our projection of full-year revenues was $1.37 billion.Segmental AnalysisInteger Holdings operates through two segments — Medical Sales and Non-Medical Sales.Medical Sales reported revenues of $356.8 million, up 18.2% year over year on a reported and 12.4% on an organic basis.This figure compares to our Medical Sales fourth-quarter projection of $350.1 million.Medical Sales has three product lines — Advanced Surgical, Orthopedics &amp; Portable Medical (AS&amp;O); Cardio &amp; Vascular; and Cardiac Rhythm Management &amp; Neuromodulation.Integer Holdings’ AS&amp;O revenues amounted to $28.4 million, up 32.3% year over year on a reported and 32.4% on an organic basis. Per management, this resulted from higher demand and price achievement from the start of the multi-year portable medical exit that the company announced in 2021.Revenues at the Cardio &amp; Vascular business totaled $185.7 million, up 19.8% from the prior-year quarter on a reported basis and up 13.1% organically. The strong year-over-year performance was driven by strong organic demand across all markets, especially the structural heart and key products (such as guidewires) and incremental sales from Oscor and Aran acquisitions. The business also benefited from the improved delivery performance from the complex catheter supplier that negatively impacted the third quarter of 2022.Story continuesRevenues at the Cardiac Rhythm Management &amp; Neuromodulation business were $142.7 million, up 13.7% year over year on a reported and up 8.1% on an organic basis. The business was driven by sales growth in Oscor and improved supplier delivery performance compared with the prior-year period, particularly for neuromodulation products.This compares to our fourth-quarter projections of $26.3 million, $186 million and $137.7 million, respectively, for each of the product lines.Revenues in the Non-Medical segment totaled $15.6 million, up 40.9% year over year. This was driven by strong sales at the Electrochem product line, part of the Non-Medical segment, across all market segments and supplier delivery recovery.This figure compares to our segmental projection of $11.5 million for the fourth quarter.Integer Holdings Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseInteger Holdings Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseInteger Holdings Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Integer Holdings Corporation QuoteMargin AnalysisInteger Holdings generated a gross profit of $97.9 million in the fourth quarter, up 19.6% year over year.

Research, development and engineering costs were $13.8 million in the quarter, up 8.7% year over year. Adjusted operating expenses of $54.9 million increased 11.9% year over year.Adjusted operating profit totaled $43 million, reflecting a 30.9% uptick from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter expanded 106 bps to 11.6%.Financial PositionInteger Holdings exited the full-year 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $24.3 million compared with $17.9 million at the end of 2021. Total debt (including the current portion) at the end of the full-year 2022 was $925.3 million compared with $828.1 million at the end of 2021.Cumulative net cash flow from operating activities at the end of 2022 was $116.4 million compared with $156.7 million a year ago.2022 GuidanceInteger Holdings has initiated its financial outlook for the full-year 2023.For 2023, the company expects revenues in the range of $1,470 million-$1,500 million (suggesting an improvement of 7-9% from the 2022 reported figure). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.49 billion.The company expects full-year adjusted EPS to be in the band of $4.00-$4.30 (suggesting a rise of 3-11% from the 2022 reported figure). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $4.22.Our TakeInteger Holdings exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected results. The strong year-over-year top-line and bottom-line performances are impressive. Robust performances by both segments and strength in all three product lines of the Medical Sales segment are encouraging. Continued benefits from the Oscor and Aran acquisitions look promising. The expansion of both margins bodes well for the stock.Integer Holdings’ strong product development pipeline in high-growth markets, emerging customer product launches, successful tuck-in acquisitions and underlying strength of existing programs also look promising for the stock.However, the company’s business was continued to be widely hampered by challenging labor and supply chain environment, which raised our apprehension.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderInteger Holdings currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Air Products and Chemicals. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Air Products and Chemicals, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Air Products and Chemicals. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.4% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.5% and 5.8%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 21 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Air Products and ChemicalsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. in their own names. We do note, however, it is possible insiders have an indirect interest through a private company or other corporate structure. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$206m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Private Company OwnershipIt seems that Private Companies own 5.8%, of the Air Products and Chemicals stock. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

If you want to see more high growth low debt stocks to buy, go directly to 5 High Growth Low Debt Stocks to Buy.High growth stocks have various definitions to different people.For this article, we define high growth as a company with an estimated average annual EPS growth rate of over 10% a year for the next 5 years.For high growth stocks, a substantial percentage of a company's value is based on future predicted growth. If a high growth company's growth doesn't meet expectations, market growth expectations for the future might decrease and the company's value estimated by the market could decrease. As a result, the company's stock price could decline, in some cases substantially depending on various factors. Given they are more uncertain, many high growth stocks could be potentially riskier than blue chip stocks.In terms of EPS growth rate in the future, inflation is an important factor for many companies.If inflation is higher, it would be easier for some companies in certain industries to grow their EPS a little faster simply by maintaining their profit margin and realizing higher revenues as a result of the inflation.If long term inflation in the future is 5%, there could be a lot more companies that grow their EPS by 10% or more each year. If they keep their profit margins the same and realize 5% more revenues, those companies would have 5% profit increases. If they buy back a lot of their stock, they would have even higher EPS growth if they maintain the same level of profitability. If the companies do other things to increase their EPS enough, those companies would have a 10%+ EPS growth rate. For those of you interested, check out 15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.Given the Federal Reserve's actions with interest rates, however, it is likely that inflation will eventually normalize to 2% or perhaps slightly higher than that in the long term.Story continuesLow Debt StocksLow debt stocks are stocks of companies without a lot of debt. With interest rates higher, the cost of variable debt is higher and as a result, many companies are paying more in interest payments on debt. Because they don't have as much debt, low debt stocks don't have to pay as much in terms of interest on debt payments as similar companies with more debt.If there is a recession or an economic slowdown, not having that much debt would be a good characteristic as it would give management more flexibility.Of course, the success of a company depends on many different things rather than just debt ratios or expected growth ratios. Markets can be unpredictable and as a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Logo, Sign, Building, Symbol, Corporation, Microsoft Corporate Building,Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 10 High Growth Low Debt Stocks to Buy, we chose 10 stocks with competitive advantages that have an estimated average annual EPS growth rate of over 10% a year for the next 5 years according to FINVIZ.com.We filtered the stocks based on stocks that had less than a debt to equity ratio of 0.7.What is considered low debt varies from industry to industry.The debt-to-equity ratio and EPS Next 5 Year Ratio are from FINVIZ.com.EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is the estimated average annual EPS growth rate in the next 5 years.10 High Growth Low Debt Stocks to Buy10.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 High Growth Energy Stocks To Buy. The International Energy Agency's latest report highlights the concerning trend that the number of people without access to modern energy is increasing, reversing the progress made in the last decade. According to the report, around 75 million people who have recently gained access to electricity may not be able to afford it, while an additional 100 million people may need to rely on traditional biomass for cooking. As per the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in April, in order to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C as set out in the Paris Agreement, it is necessary to reach the peak of greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 at the latest and reduce them by 43% by 2030. Dealing with emissions presents a chance for the development of the green economy. The sectors that support the transition to net-zero emissions have the potential to reach a value of $10.3 trillion for the world economy by 2050.On the other hand, experts predict that China's crude oil imports will reach a new high in 2023 due to an increase in demand for fuel as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted and new refineries begin operations. This is expected to be a positive factor for the oil market, which is already being supported by output cuts from the OPEC+ producer group and western sanctions on Russian exports.According to industry consultancies including Wood Mackenzie, FGE, Energy Aspects, and S&amp;P Global Commodity Insight, China's crude oil imports could increase by as much as 500,000 to 1 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, potentially reaching up to 11.8 million bpd, surpassing the previous record of 10.8 million bpd in 2020. This growth would reverse the trend of declining crude oil imports over the last two years.Investors who are interested in the energy sector can also check out 12 Top Performing Energy Stocks in January, 12 Cheap Energy Stocks To Buy, and 12 Best Performing Energy Stocks in 2022.

196,925af546-af56-3797-ae49-f2af191730cd,OKE,2023-02-21,Oneok Inc. (OKE) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oneok-inc-oke-earnings-expected-150003644.html,1676905203,STORY,['OKE'],"[The market expects Oneok Inc. (OKE) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 27, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis natural gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.02 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +20%.Revenues are expected to be $5.61 billion, up 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 46.34% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Oneok?For Oneok, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.49%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Oneok will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Oneok would post earnings of $0.93 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.96, delivering a surprise of +3.23%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Oneok doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In addition, its nutraceutical division also makes vitamins and beta-carotenes used in supplements, food and beverages sold across the world.Divi’s currently operates two manufacturing sites which run 24/7 near Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam in India, with a third under construction. Collectively, these operations make up the largest API manufacturing facilities globally, with a gross total of 14,500sqm of manufacturing space spread across over 64 buildings in the two sites.Due to its stringent quality-control processes, Divi's required an ultra-reliable network that could securely transfer data at line rate between its two plants without any packet loss. After experiencing difficulties managing and monitoring its network with their previous legacy solution, it decided to embark on a network refresh with Juniper that would future-proof several operational requirements.This network refresh would include reliable Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) and PoE+ switching to drive their wireless infrastructure while providing for organizational-wide network visibility, easy onboarding and manageability.

The media and technology company said it will invest more than $100 million to install at least one thousand miles of new fiber-rich highways that will reach up to 80,000 homes and businesses by the end of this year. The planned expansions add to Comcast’s ongoing $2.8 billion investment in Texas over the last three years.Network expansion efforts will begin in Kingwood, Pinehurst, Prairie View, Waller, New Caney and Conroe. Construction will continue in other communities that have ongoing network infrastructure builds in the Houston area.A Comcast contractor uses equipment to install fiber lines in the Kingwood community. At least one thousand miles of new fiber lines will be installed to reach up to 80,000 homes and businesses by the end of 2023.Construction has started in Kingwood, which will be the largest expansion of the year; it is expected to be complete by the end of 2023 and will reach nearly 24,000 Kingwood homes and businesses. These locations will have the foundational next-generation network in place to begin deploying DOCSIS 4.0, setting the stage for the introduction of new symmetrical multi-gigabit Internet options.“We will bring our fiber-rich network to twice the number of homes and businesses this year compared to the number we passed last year,” said Ralph Martinez, Senior Regional Vice President of Comcast’s Texas Region. “Southeast Texas’ rural and suburban communities have been growing fast, and we are building out our next-generation Comcast network in tandem with the growth. We will continue to expand to even more rural communities in the next few years.”Watch the ""Back to our Roots"" video.Once complete, Comcast, the nation’s largest provider of 1.2 Gigabit per second speeds, will give consumers access to reliable and fast Xfinity Internet and Xfinity Mobile service that outperforms its competitors.

In addition, Comcast’s next-generation technology provides multiple layers of security that automatically detect and block hundreds of thousands of cyber events every second, and a Smart Network that automates many core network functions and dramatically reduces the number of outages.Story continues“Access to reliable internet and telecommunications services is something that we cannot go without in our day-to-day activities,” said Houston Mayor Pro-Tem and Kingwood resident, Dave Martin. “Comcast and their new construction project in Kingwood is a perfect example of a business working to bridge the gap to connect more people to much-needed services while increasing accessibility to much-needed services and their dependability. I appreciate Comcast’s partnership and commitment to District E.”Comcast is also committed to addressing digital equity in communities we serve, through Project UP, the company’s $1 billion dollar commitment to help tens of millions of people connect to the internet and build futures of unlimited possibilities. Last year, Comcast Texas invested more than one million dollars to help local community organizations provide personalized digital skills training, offer workforce development/readiness workshops and other tech education to students, adults, and people with disabilities. The funding also supports ongoing efforts to build awareness about connectivity programs like Internet Essentials and the federal government’s Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which offers eligible households up to $30/month credit, or up to $75 for households on tribal lands, for home Internet. Comcast proudly participates in the Affordable Connectivity Program, and offers Internet Essentials Plus, a $29.95/month home Internet service that is effectively free for eligible households, once the ACP credit is applied.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 10 Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks Today.2022 was one of the worst years for the NASDAQ, primarily because it is dominated by tech, and tech stocks crashed as interest rates climbed. The NASDAQ lost roughly more than one-third of its value in 2022. However, in 2023 things seem to have taken an interesting turn. The NASDAQ has been rising and, as of February 17, the tech-heavy index has gained 13.48% year to date.""I Think Growth Comes Back and Tech Outperforms""Is the tech sector making a comeback in 2023? Fundstrat's head of technical strategy, Mark Newton, thinks so. On February 7, Mark Newton appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed why he thinks growth and technology are making a comeback in 2023. Here are some comments from Mark Newton:""There's 3 main things for investors to look at. One is that momentum and breadth have improved substantially in the last couple of months. The second is that, we are in seasonally a very bullish period. Pre-election year seasonality for the first quarter is better than any other of the 16 quarters that make up the presidential cycle. The third is that we continue to see pretty excessive bearish sentiment across the board... The near term sentiment has gotten a little more optimistic. However, if we saw anything from recent reports of investor risk, people are very much on the sidelines and we're seeing very high levels of investor cash. That makes me think that we are in very much a bull market that can continue.""Mark Newton's views are remarkably similar to those of billionaire investor Ken Fisher. Newton thinks that the market bottomed somewhere in October 2022 and now we are in a bull market. Newton thinks that technology, which was one of the worst-performing sectors in 2022, is now making a comeback. Newton supported his thesis by elaborating on how the market has ""gone from extreme pessimism to now skepticism"". While ""we haven't reached bullishness yet"", according to Mark Newton, ""the market's respecting inflation selling off sharply as well as a pivot potentially with the Fed"".Story continuesMark Newton thinks ""both energy and healthcare have a chance of snapping back"". However, he sees tech ""being a phenomenally good sector to position in for 2023"". According to Mark Newton, interest rates will ""continue to come down over the course of the year"" and ""that should fuel growth"". Newton thinks ""growth comes back and tech outperforms"" in 2023, and he also revealed that his year-end target for the S&amp;P 500 is 4,500.Some of the most profitable NASDAQ stocks today are Meta Platforms, Inc.

We considered the annual net income as a measure of a company's profitability. We narrowed down our screen and looked for companies that had a trailing twelve-month net income of greater than $4 billion. We used data from Yahoo Finance to verify each company’s net income and finally picked the 25 companies that had reported the highest annual net income for fiscal 2022. We have ranked these stocks in ascending order of their TTM net income, as of fiscal 2022. Since companies use different fiscal years, we have mentioned the end-date of each company’s fiscal year along with its net income.Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks Today25.

(NASDAQ:REGN) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“There have been some bright spots in our long book. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”23.

Netflix added 2.4 million subscribers in the quarter, beating the Street’s expectation of 1.1 million added subscribers, and management guided to 4.5 million subscriber additions for 4Q, above expectations for 4.1 million.We believe that 2022 was an inflection year for Netflix as the company became free cash flow (“FCF”) positive during 1Q22 and FCF should scale from here (management guided to $1 billion FCF for 2022). A combination of strategic initiatives, price increases and a stabilization of content investment should position the company for high-single digit annual revenue growth, while driving improved operating margin to more than 25% over the next few years. Revenue grew 6% for 3Q22 and operating margin was 19%, up from 10% in 2018.

After a qualitative review of Lam Research, we believe the company will face a number of headwinds that could make for an unfavorable risk-reward position, given the highly cyclical nature of its business in a slowing global economy. We are also expecting fundamentals to turn negative as sales and operating profits are poised to decelerate, resulting in negative earnings revisions. While the stock trades at an attractive valuation multiple, we believe that this is more a sign that earnings will decline meaningfully.”20. Adobe Inc.

The company had revenues of $17.6 billion in its last fiscal year with operating margins in the mid-30s. The company has also grown revenues at double-digit rates every year since 2015.

With Comcast, uncertainty surrounding broadband growth due to rising competition and lower market activity, as well as the continued deterioration of the traditional media business, led to a less attractive risk/ reward tradeoff and we chose to reallocate that capital to more attractive ideas.”16.

The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”15. Applied Materials, Inc.

Throughout 2022, investors became increasingly concerned about a cyclical downturn in semiconductors and pending trade regulations that would restrict the sale of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment to Chinese customers. This uncertainty caused the stock to become oversold, in our opinion. The stock price recovered in the fourth quarter as investors were able to size the impact of export controls and, we believe, as investors increasingly understood the long-term, structural demand for semiconductors and the equipment that produces them.”14.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors was dominated by  Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”13.

Two of our top five largest individual detractors for the period were in the health care sector: Sanofi(NASDAQ:SNY) and Bayer (OTCPK:BAYZF). Sanofi, a French pharmaceutical and health care company, saw its share price fall after it was named as a co-defendant in a class action lawsuit alleging that Sanofi and other sellers of the heartburn medication Zantac failed to warn of the drug’s risk of containing a possible carcinogen.”12.

Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”11. Micron Technology, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MU) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Inflation is still higher than interest rates… not an incentive to save for most people. Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”Some of the most profitable tech stocks that are popular among elite money managers include Micron Technology, Inc.

204,5e697fde-7ad3-3707-ae81-5707de34c5d7,DVN,2023-02-21,Devon Energy Corporation (DVN) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/devon-energy-corporation-dvn-attracting-140002365.html,1676901602,STORY,['DVN'],"[Devon Energy (DVN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned -17.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.4% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, to which Devon Energy belongs, has lost 10.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.82 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -3.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -15.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.70 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -7.3%. This estimate has changed -6.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.53 indicates a change of -2.2% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Devon Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.32 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $18.26 billion and $17.9 billion estimates indicate -4.7% and -2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $4.3 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.66 for the same period compares with $1.39 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.65 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -7.5%. The EPS surprise was -5.14%.Over the last four quarters, Devon Energy surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, head over to 5 High Growth Value Stocks to Buy According to Seth Klarman. Legendary value investor Seth Klarman informed his hedge fund investors on February 8 that the Federal Reserve's actions in response to the financial crisis of 2008, along with the following decade of low interest rates, had contributed to the creation of a ""financial fantasyland."" The leader of Baupost Group, Seth Klarman, stated in a letter to clients at the end of the year: “A consequence-free era of virtually unlimited low-cost capital had come to an end. A boom based on easy-money policies will inevitably contain the seeds of its own destruction.”Despite the surge in major global stock indices this year due to declining inflation figures, a pessimistic perspective has emerged. This view opposes the belief that the Federal Reserve may soon stop increasing interest rates, which has bolstered investor confidence. Seth Klarman said that the sudden spike in interest rates last year is like kryptonite, as it finally led to the deflation of the ""everything bubble."" This included the decline of investments in unprofitable ""growth"" companies that had risen during the pandemic but had little fundamental worth. Regardless of the recovery of markets this year, Klarman cautioned that the decline in markets from last year still has potential to continue, and there may be a risk of a sovereign debt crisis in the future.He further wrote in the letter to clients at year-end: “Time spent on due diligence came to seem to them a hindrance to maximal capital deployment, and the usual warning signs of excess — financial profligacy, a proliferation of dubious business models, and obvious red flags — were mocked or ignored.” Despite dire warnings about the stock market, in the final quarter of last year, Seth Klarman significantly increased his firm's holdings in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), among other major technology companies. Klarman also boosted his stake in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) by 190%, while his ownership in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) increased by 151%.Story continuesOur Methodology We selected the stocks from the Q4 portfolio of Baupost Group which exhibit the highest average 3-year revenue growth between 2019 and 2021. Not all of these stocks are pure ""value"" stocks, but Klarman, who is a pure value investor, having huge stakes in these companies makes them worthy of attention and being treated as value plays in the long-term context. The list is ranked in the ascending order of Seth Klarman’s stake value in each firm. 12 High Growth Value Stocks to Buy According to Seth KlarmanSeth Klarman of Baupost GroupHigh Growth Value Stocks to Buy According to Seth Klarman12. Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. (NYSE:HLF)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Baupost Group’s Stake Value: $29,760,0003-year Revenue Growth: 18.9%Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) is a California-based provider of health and wellness products in the areas of weight management, targeted nutrition, energy, sports, fitness, and outer nutrition. In Q4 2022, Seth Klarman added Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) to his portfolio by acquiring 2 million shares worth nearly $30 million. On February 14, Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.53, beating market estimates by $0.19. The revenue of $1.2 billion outperformed Wall Street consensus by $70 million. On February 3, BofA analyst Anna Lizzul initiated coverage of Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) with an Underperform rating and a $14 price target. According to BofA, Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. (NYSE:HLF)’s multi-level marketing (MLM) business model is the biggest danger to its operations because it is harder to see the sales channel of direct sellers compared to retail-based companies. Furthermore, the firm stated that there is still a risk for the company in emerging markets.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 24 hedge funds were long Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. (NYSE:HLF), compared to 28 funds in the prior quarter. William Duhamel’s Route One Investment Company held the largest stake in the company, with 10.8 million shares worth $215.7 million. In addition to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) is one of the high growth stocks that Seth Klarman is piling into. Here is what Bronte Capital has to say about Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Herbalife is – as we have discussed many times before – a multi-level marketing scheme selling weight-loss shakes. The idea is simple. If I replaced six meals a week with low-calorie protein shakes and I walked an extra 15 km a week I would quickly lose 15-20kgs. It would be good for me. It is also well-nigh impossible to do.One solution is to hire a personal trainer (usually of the opposite sex) and have them nag you. You will do tough stuff for an attractive member of the opposite sex. More realistically you could just have your friends nag you. And that is why this works so well as a multi-level marketing scheme. The person who sells you the shakes has an incentive to keep you on the diet.We have looked at many distributors and we see a weight-loss program – implemented for (literally) millions of people – which works about as well as any weight-loss health program that ever existed. That still means it fails most of the time – but it works enough that we can be proud of owning this stock and the health benefits it provides. Herbalife, it turns out, grew well during COVID. This was initially a surprise to us – as we thought Herbalife depended on the personal touch to make the sale. But, instead, weight loss and associated social clubs moved online – and – in many cases were the main social outlet the customers had.”11. Gray Television, Inc. (NYSE:GTN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Baupost Group’s Stake Value: $39,277,0003-year Revenue Growth: 13.7%Gray Television, Inc. (NYSE:GTN) was founded in 1891 and is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. It is a television broadcasting company that owns and operates television stations and digital assets in the United States. Seth Klarman increased his Gray Television, Inc. (NYSE:GTN) stake by 8% in Q4 2022, holding 3.51 million shares worth $39.2 million. On November 10, Barrington analyst James Goss reiterated an Outperform rating on Gray Television, Inc. (NYSE:GTN) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $15 from $25. The analyst’s previous target was much higher, but his new target for 2023 is based on the company's reduced political forecasts, new guidance indicating a steeper decrease in subscriber levels than previously seen, and a more cautious target multiple. He informed investors that these factors led to his more conservative price target.According to Insider Monkey’s data, Gray Television, Inc. (NYSE:GTN) was part of 29 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 25 in the prior quarter. Anand Desai’s Darsana Capital Partners is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.5 million shares worth $65.7 million. 10. Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45Baupost Group’s Stake Value: $51,185,0003-year Revenue Growth: 80.1%Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) operates as an automotive retailer in the United States. The company operates through three segments – Domestic, Import, and Luxury. Klarman’s Baupost Group owns 250,000 shares of Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) worth $51 million as of Q4 2022. With average 3-year revenue growth exceeding 80%, it is one of the top high growth stocks in Klarman’s portfolio.On February 15, Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on March 24, to shareholders of record on March 10. Guggenheim analyst Ali Faghri on February 16 maintained a Buy rating on Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) but lowered the price target from $343 to $332, despite the company's Q4 earnings falling short of Street expectations. The analyst believes that the market's negative reaction to the company's results was primarily due to a significant miss in sales, general, and administrative expenses, as well as a decline in new sales volumes, compared to its peers' strong performance. While the firm has lowered its 2023 estimate, it is optimistic that earnings will hit a low point in 2023, and then gradually increase in 2024 before ""significantly accelerating"" in 2025.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 45 hedge funds were long Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD), compared to 40 funds in the prior quarter. David Abrams’ Abrams Capital Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 2.35 million shares worth $504.4 million. Here is what Oakmark Select Fund has to say about Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) in its Q1 2022 investor letter: “As is typical during periods of significant volatility, we added a new name to the portfolio. Lithia Motors (NYSE:LAD) is the largest franchised auto dealer group in the United States. The company has a long history of creating shareholder value through best-in-class operations and consistent acquisitions of smaller dealers at attractive returns. There is a long runway for management to continue creating value through such acquisitions. Management believes this will drive earnings per share to more than $50 by 2025, even as car prices return to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, Lithia has a significant opportunity to further accelerate growth through Driveway, its online auto retailing platform. We believe Lithia’s existing nationwide infrastructure provides Driveway with significant competitive advantages in e-commerce, which smaller dealers will struggle to replicate. Driveway is not generating any earnings today, but it could become a major contributor over the next five to seven years. With the stock priced at less than 7x management’s 2025 EPS target and with substantial future growth potential from Driveway, we believe Lithia shares are a bargain today.”9. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 269Baupost Group’s Stake Value: $83,160,0003-year Revenue Growth: 67.4%Securities filings for the fourth quarter of 2022 reveal that Seth Klarman’s Baupost Group boosted its Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stake by 300%, holding 990,000 shares worth over $83 million. On February 2, the company reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.03, falling short of market estimates by $0.14. Revenue over the period came in at $149.2 billion, up 8.6% year-over-year, beating Wall Street consensus by $3.43 billion. According to Loop Capital analyst Rob Sanderson, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s Q4 results indicate that the company's retail business is making significant strides toward improving its unit economics. The analyst noted that if non-recurring charges for employee severance, impairment charges, and increased insurance liabilities are removed, the company's North America operating margin would have been around 2.6% instead of the reported -0.3%. He maintained a Buy rating and a $140 price target on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) on February 14. However, the analyst also cautioned that AWS is experiencing more substantial margin compression and slowdown than previously anticipated, and the firm is adopting a more conservative outlook for this segment.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 269 hedge funds were bullish on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), compared to 252 stocks in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is a significant position holder in the company, with approximately 50 million shares worth $5.6 billion.Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“At Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), recessionary and inflationary headwinds drove weaker demand and higher costs for its AWS (Amazon Web Services) and retail businesses. While overinvestment in the retail business during the pandemic and continued growth of investments in AWS could lead to near-term pressure on profitability, we believe Amazon’s competitive advantages will continue to grow and that the business has the potential to grow much faster than the overall economy in the coming years.”8. Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Baupost Group’s Stake Value: $146,217,0003-year Revenue Growth: 34.2%Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.

(NYSE:FIS) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $1.71 and a revenue of $3.71 billion, beating Wall Street estimates by $0.01 and $20 million, respectively. According to a research note by UBS analyst Rayna Kumar on February 14, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) has announced that it will be executing a tax-free spin-out of its Merchant Solutions business. However, the analyst believes that investors would have preferred a sale of the business rather than a spin-out. As a result, the analyst has lowered the firm's price target on FIS from $86 to $78 while maintaining a Buy rating on the shares.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 60 hedge funds were bullish on Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS), compared to 67 in the prior quarter. Select Equity Group held the largest stake in the company, comprising 5.8 million shares worth $443.5 million. Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“In addition to SVB Financial and V.F. Corporation, we eliminated our positions in financial services technology company Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) and media and technology company Comcast Corporation. Several reasons factored into our decision to sell Fidelity National Information Services, including board and leadership changes, a strategic review, and a cooperation agreement with activist shareholder D.E. Shaw (and discussions with JANA Partners).”7. Micron Technology, Inc.

New Oriental Education—the largest provider of private educational services in China—moved sharply lower in July after policymakers implemented new rules which effectively turned Chinese tutoring companies into non-profits. Looking at New Oriental Education, we closed our position as soon as government policy became clear and used the proceeds to allocate to existing holdings.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 High Growth Value Stocks to Buy According to Seth Klarman.  Suggested articles:12 Stocks to Sell According to Motley Fool10 Best Annuity Companies in the US15 Biggest Advertising Companies in the World Disclosure: None. 12 High Growth Value Stocks to Buy According to Seth Klarman is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 10 Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks Today.2022 was one of the worst years for the NASDAQ, primarily because it is dominated by tech, and tech stocks crashed as interest rates climbed. The NASDAQ lost roughly more than one-third of its value in 2022. However, in 2023 things seem to have taken an interesting turn. The NASDAQ has been rising and, as of February 17, the tech-heavy index has gained 13.48% year to date.""I Think Growth Comes Back and Tech Outperforms""Is the tech sector making a comeback in 2023? Fundstrat's head of technical strategy, Mark Newton, thinks so. On February 7, Mark Newton appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed why he thinks growth and technology are making a comeback in 2023. Here are some comments from Mark Newton:""There's 3 main things for investors to look at. One is that momentum and breadth have improved substantially in the last couple of months. The second is that, we are in seasonally a very bullish period. Pre-election year seasonality for the first quarter is better than any other of the 16 quarters that make up the presidential cycle. The third is that we continue to see pretty excessive bearish sentiment across the board... The near term sentiment has gotten a little more optimistic. However, if we saw anything from recent reports of investor risk, people are very much on the sidelines and we're seeing very high levels of investor cash. That makes me think that we are in very much a bull market that can continue.""Mark Newton's views are remarkably similar to those of billionaire investor Ken Fisher. Newton thinks that the market bottomed somewhere in October 2022 and now we are in a bull market. Newton thinks that technology, which was one of the worst-performing sectors in 2022, is now making a comeback. Newton supported his thesis by elaborating on how the market has ""gone from extreme pessimism to now skepticism"". While ""we haven't reached bullishness yet"", according to Mark Newton, ""the market's respecting inflation selling off sharply as well as a pivot potentially with the Fed"".Story continuesMark Newton thinks ""both energy and healthcare have a chance of snapping back"". However, he sees tech ""being a phenomenally good sector to position in for 2023"". According to Mark Newton, interest rates will ""continue to come down over the course of the year"" and ""that should fuel growth"". Newton thinks ""growth comes back and tech outperforms"" in 2023, and he also revealed that his year-end target for the S&amp;P 500 is 4,500.Some of the most profitable NASDAQ stocks today are Meta Platforms, Inc.

We narrowed down our screen and looked for companies that had a trailing twelve-month net income of greater than $4 billion. We used data from Yahoo Finance to verify each company’s net income and finally picked the 25 companies that had reported the highest annual net income for fiscal 2022. We have ranked these stocks in ascending order of their TTM net income, as of fiscal 2022. Since companies use different fiscal years, we have mentioned the end-date of each company’s fiscal year along with its net income.Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks Today25.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”23.

Netflix added 2.4 million subscribers in the quarter, beating the Street’s expectation of 1.1 million added subscribers, and management guided to 4.5 million subscriber additions for 4Q, above expectations for 4.1 million.We believe that 2022 was an inflection year for Netflix as the company became free cash flow (“FCF”) positive during 1Q22 and FCF should scale from here (management guided to $1 billion FCF for 2022). A combination of strategic initiatives, price increases and a stabilization of content investment should position the company for high-single digit annual revenue growth, while driving improved operating margin to more than 25% over the next few years. Revenue grew 6% for 3Q22 and operating margin was 19%, up from 10% in 2018. In addition to its opportunities in TV and movie streaming, the company recently launched a mobile gaming service that opens an additional $100 billion-plus market for future growth.”In addition to tech giants Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:GILD) was the top contributor in the quarter based on positive data released in a study evaluating Trodelvy versus comparative chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The detailed findings increased investor confidence the drug would receive incremental approvals for a broader range of breast cancer treatments. Shares also received a boost on news the TAF patent portfolio for HIV drugs will be extended from the middle of this decade through the early 2030s, thereby lengthening the company’s long-term opportunity in the virology market.”21.

After a qualitative review of Lam Research, we believe the company will face a number of headwinds that could make for an unfavorable risk-reward position, given the highly cyclical nature of its business in a slowing global economy. We are also expecting fundamentals to turn negative as sales and operating profits are poised to decelerate, resulting in negative earnings revisions. While the stock trades at an attractive valuation multiple, we believe that this is more a sign that earnings will decline meaningfully.”20. Adobe Inc.

Adobe also has a suite of customer experience products that help other businesses sell more easily to consumers. All of Adobe’s products have high switching costs and sold on a subscription basis.Adobe’s business qualities enable extremely high margins and predictable, recurring revenues. The company had revenues of $17.6 billion in its last fiscal year with operating margins in the mid-30s. The company has also grown revenues at double-digit rates every year since 2015. Despite a good record of investing in its businesses, it still has an excess of cash on its balance sheet. As such, Adobe has returned cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. Since 2015 the company has returned a total of $24.5 billion.”19. Honeywell International Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors was dominated by  Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”13.

Two of our top five largest individual detractors for the period were in the health care sector: Sanofi(NASDAQ:SNY) and Bayer (OTCPK:BAYZF). Sanofi, a French pharmaceutical and health care company, saw its share price fall after it was named as a co-defendant in a class action lawsuit alleging that Sanofi and other sellers of the heartburn medication Zantac failed to warn of the drug’s risk of containing a possible carcinogen.”12.

Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”11. Micron Technology, Inc.

But the times are changing, increasing the likelihood that investors who find good AI stocks to buy will profit over the medium term and the long term.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFor one, the market is, at last, becoming friendlier to high-tech growth stocks. And, of course, the huge amount of publicity surrounding ChatGPT has made Street and retail investors aware of the vast power of AI.Here are three AI stocks to buy. I believe these three names will benefit meaningfully over the long term from their focus on and exploitation of AI.TickerCompanyPriceSTEMStem$9.74INTCIntel$28.20MUMicron$60.05AI Stocks to Buy: Stem (STEM)Close-up of letters ""AI"" written on a computer chip, symbolizing artificial intelligence and AI stocksSource: shutterstock.com/YAKOBCHUK VAs I explained in an August 2021 column, “Stem’s AI platform, Athena, increases the efficiency of energy storage systems that work in tandem with renewable energy ‘by automatically switching between battery power, onsite generation and grid power.’”Given the electrification of transportation, the extremely rapid proliferation of storage batteries and renewable energy, and the huge power of AI, Athena should be able to save companies loads of money.Morgan Stanley is also upbeat on STEM stock. Last month, the firm raised its rating on the shares to “overweight” from “equal weight.” As reasons for its bullishness, the bank cited “improvement in global battery supply, Inflation Reduction Act support and Stem’s focus on driving higher-margin software sales.” Stem’s emphasis on software should serve it well, added MS, which has a $15 price target on the name.Story continuesStem recently announced a joint venture with America’s leading EV charger operator, ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT). That deal looks poised to boost Stem’s financial results considerably in the longer term.In the first nine months of 2023, Stem generated $260.3 million of revenue, versus $127.4 million for all of 2021.Intel (INTC)The Intel (INTC) booth at the CES show in Las Vegas on January 08 2017 , CES is the world's leading consumer-electronics show.Source: Kobby Dagan / Shutterstock.comAmid Intel’s current troubles, the chip maker is looking to cut costs, but it does not appear to be scaling back its efforts to produce semiconductors that enable AI. Indeed, according to a website called HPC wire, Intel is moving “full-speed ahead” on developing its new Gaudi AI chip, Gaudi3, which “will have much more memory, compute and networking than its predecessor,”  the website reported.And impressively, “Gaudi has shown potential to handle large language models powering applications like ChatGPT,” while Gaudi2 trained AI systems faster than a competing Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) chip. Nvidia’s latest offering surpassed Gaudi2, but INTC is, as mentioned earlier, working on Gaudi3, and the chip maker’s ability to, apparently, nearly keep pace with NVDA is very encouraging.Moreover, Intel is looking to combine the Gaudi line with its existing GPU chips that are also used to facilitate AI. The combination could be much better than the two individually.Micron (MU)An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock.Source: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.comMicron is another chip maker that’s well-positioned to benefit from the tremendous growth of AI.Specifically, the company reports that its memory storage products “and multi-chip packages” are enabling the AI revolution.And, driven partly by data centers’ ability to process much more data as a result of using AI, Micron expects individual servers’ memory requirements to double between 2021 and 2025. Moreover, due to the same trend, it expects individual servers’ storage capacity to triple during those same years. Of course, that’s great news for MU since the company specializes in selling memory and storage solutions.Micron’s earnings per share, excluding some items, soared 38% in its fiscal year that ended in September. While that marked a big slowdown from the 114% adjusted EPS growth it enjoyed in its prior fiscal year, the 38% increase is still very impressive for such a large, well-established company amid the decline of consumers’ purchasing of computing products.Despite Micron’s strong growth drivers and its rapid EPS growth, MU stock has a very low price-earnings ratio of just 11.25.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of STEM.  The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Larry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

209,0bc97755-beac-3123-aaa6-150f2397314b,FIS,2023-02-21,12 High Growth Value Stocks to Buy According to Seth Klarman,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-high-growth-value-stocks-154537426.html,1676907937,STORY,"['AMZN', 'HLF', 'LAD', 'FIS', 'EDU', 'GTN-A', 'MU', 'GOOGL']","[In this article, we discuss 12 high growth value stocks to buy according to Seth Klarman. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, head over to 5 High Growth Value Stocks to Buy According to Seth Klarman. Legendary value investor Seth Klarman informed his hedge fund investors on February 8 that the Federal Reserve's actions in response to the financial crisis of 2008, along with the following decade of low interest rates, had contributed to the creation of a ""financial fantasyland."" The leader of Baupost Group, Seth Klarman, stated in a letter to clients at the end of the year: “A consequence-free era of virtually unlimited low-cost capital had come to an end. A boom based on easy-money policies will inevitably contain the seeds of its own destruction.”Despite the surge in major global stock indices this year due to declining inflation figures, a pessimistic perspective has emerged. This view opposes the belief that the Federal Reserve may soon stop increasing interest rates, which has bolstered investor confidence. Seth Klarman said that the sudden spike in interest rates last year is like kryptonite, as it finally led to the deflation of the ""everything bubble."" This included the decline of investments in unprofitable ""growth"" companies that had risen during the pandemic but had little fundamental worth. Regardless of the recovery of markets this year, Klarman cautioned that the decline in markets from last year still has potential to continue, and there may be a risk of a sovereign debt crisis in the future.He further wrote in the letter to clients at year-end: “Time spent on due diligence came to seem to them a hindrance to maximal capital deployment, and the usual warning signs of excess — financial profligacy, a proliferation of dubious business models, and obvious red flags — were mocked or ignored.” Despite dire warnings about the stock market, in the final quarter of last year, Seth Klarman significantly increased his firm's holdings in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), among other major technology companies. Klarman also boosted his stake in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) by 190%, while his ownership in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) increased by 151%.Story continuesOur Methodology We selected the stocks from the Q4 portfolio of Baupost Group which exhibit the highest average 3-year revenue growth between 2019 and 2021. Not all of these stocks are pure ""value"" stocks, but Klarman, who is a pure value investor, having huge stakes in these companies makes them worthy of attention and being treated as value plays in the long-term context. The list is ranked in the ascending order of Seth Klarman’s stake value in each firm. 12 High Growth Value Stocks to Buy According to Seth KlarmanSeth Klarman of Baupost GroupHigh Growth Value Stocks to Buy According to Seth Klarman12. Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. (NYSE:HLF)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Baupost Group’s Stake Value: $29,760,0003-year Revenue Growth: 18.9%Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) is a California-based provider of health and wellness products in the areas of weight management, targeted nutrition, energy, sports, fitness, and outer nutrition. In Q4 2022, Seth Klarman added Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) to his portfolio by acquiring 2 million shares worth nearly $30 million. On February 14, Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.53, beating market estimates by $0.19. The revenue of $1.2 billion outperformed Wall Street consensus by $70 million. On February 3, BofA analyst Anna Lizzul initiated coverage of Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) with an Underperform rating and a $14 price target. According to BofA, Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. (NYSE:HLF)’s multi-level marketing (MLM) business model is the biggest danger to its operations because it is harder to see the sales channel of direct sellers compared to retail-based companies. Furthermore, the firm stated that there is still a risk for the company in emerging markets.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 24 hedge funds were long Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. (NYSE:HLF), compared to 28 funds in the prior quarter. William Duhamel’s Route One Investment Company held the largest stake in the company, with 10.8 million shares worth $215.7 million. In addition to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) is one of the high growth stocks that Seth Klarman is piling into. Here is what Bronte Capital has to say about Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Herbalife is – as we have discussed many times before – a multi-level marketing scheme selling weight-loss shakes. The idea is simple. If I replaced six meals a week with low-calorie protein shakes and I walked an extra 15 km a week I would quickly lose 15-20kgs. It would be good for me. It is also well-nigh impossible to do.One solution is to hire a personal trainer (usually of the opposite sex) and have them nag you. You will do tough stuff for an attractive member of the opposite sex. More realistically you could just have your friends nag you. And that is why this works so well as a multi-level marketing scheme. The person who sells you the shakes has an incentive to keep you on the diet.We have looked at many distributors and we see a weight-loss program – implemented for (literally) millions of people – which works about as well as any weight-loss health program that ever existed. That still means it fails most of the time – but it works enough that we can be proud of owning this stock and the health benefits it provides. Herbalife, it turns out, grew well during COVID. This was initially a surprise to us – as we thought Herbalife depended on the personal touch to make the sale. But, instead, weight loss and associated social clubs moved online – and – in many cases were the main social outlet the customers had.”11. Gray Television, Inc. (NYSE:GTN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Baupost Group’s Stake Value: $39,277,0003-year Revenue Growth: 13.7%Gray Television, Inc. (NYSE:GTN) was founded in 1891 and is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. It is a television broadcasting company that owns and operates television stations and digital assets in the United States. Seth Klarman increased his Gray Television, Inc. (NYSE:GTN) stake by 8% in Q4 2022, holding 3.51 million shares worth $39.2 million. On November 10, Barrington analyst James Goss reiterated an Outperform rating on Gray Television, Inc. (NYSE:GTN) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $15 from $25. The analyst’s previous target was much higher, but his new target for 2023 is based on the company's reduced political forecasts, new guidance indicating a steeper decrease in subscriber levels than previously seen, and a more cautious target multiple. He informed investors that these factors led to his more conservative price target.According to Insider Monkey’s data, Gray Television, Inc. (NYSE:GTN) was part of 29 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 25 in the prior quarter. Anand Desai’s Darsana Capital Partners is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.5 million shares worth $65.7 million. 10. Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45Baupost Group’s Stake Value: $51,185,0003-year Revenue Growth: 80.1%Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) operates as an automotive retailer in the United States. The company operates through three segments – Domestic, Import, and Luxury. Klarman’s Baupost Group owns 250,000 shares of Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) worth $51 million as of Q4 2022. With average 3-year revenue growth exceeding 80%, it is one of the top high growth stocks in Klarman’s portfolio.On February 15, Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on March 24, to shareholders of record on March 10. Guggenheim analyst Ali Faghri on February 16 maintained a Buy rating on Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) but lowered the price target from $343 to $332, despite the company's Q4 earnings falling short of Street expectations. The analyst believes that the market's negative reaction to the company's results was primarily due to a significant miss in sales, general, and administrative expenses, as well as a decline in new sales volumes, compared to its peers' strong performance. While the firm has lowered its 2023 estimate, it is optimistic that earnings will hit a low point in 2023, and then gradually increase in 2024 before ""significantly accelerating"" in 2025.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 45 hedge funds were long Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD), compared to 40 funds in the prior quarter. David Abrams’ Abrams Capital Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 2.35 million shares worth $504.4 million. Here is what Oakmark Select Fund has to say about Lithia Motors, Inc. (NYSE:LAD) in its Q1 2022 investor letter: “As is typical during periods of significant volatility, we added a new name to the portfolio. Lithia Motors (NYSE:LAD) is the largest franchised auto dealer group in the United States. The company has a long history of creating shareholder value through best-in-class operations and consistent acquisitions of smaller dealers at attractive returns. There is a long runway for management to continue creating value through such acquisitions. Management believes this will drive earnings per share to more than $50 by 2025, even as car prices return to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, Lithia has a significant opportunity to further accelerate growth through Driveway, its online auto retailing platform. We believe Lithia’s existing nationwide infrastructure provides Driveway with significant competitive advantages in e-commerce, which smaller dealers will struggle to replicate. Driveway is not generating any earnings today, but it could become a major contributor over the next five to seven years. With the stock priced at less than 7x management’s 2025 EPS target and with substantial future growth potential from Driveway, we believe Lithia shares are a bargain today.”9. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 269Baupost Group’s Stake Value: $83,160,0003-year Revenue Growth: 67.4%Securities filings for the fourth quarter of 2022 reveal that Seth Klarman’s Baupost Group boosted its Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stake by 300%, holding 990,000 shares worth over $83 million. On February 2, the company reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.03, falling short of market estimates by $0.14. Revenue over the period came in at $149.2 billion, up 8.6% year-over-year, beating Wall Street consensus by $3.43 billion. According to Loop Capital analyst Rob Sanderson, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s Q4 results indicate that the company's retail business is making significant strides toward improving its unit economics. The analyst noted that if non-recurring charges for employee severance, impairment charges, and increased insurance liabilities are removed, the company's North America operating margin would have been around 2.6% instead of the reported -0.3%. He maintained a Buy rating and a $140 price target on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) on February 14. However, the analyst also cautioned that AWS is experiencing more substantial margin compression and slowdown than previously anticipated, and the firm is adopting a more conservative outlook for this segment.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 269 hedge funds were bullish on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), compared to 252 stocks in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is a significant position holder in the company, with approximately 50 million shares worth $5.6 billion.Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“At Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), recessionary and inflationary headwinds drove weaker demand and higher costs for its AWS (Amazon Web Services) and retail businesses. While overinvestment in the retail business during the pandemic and continued growth of investments in AWS could lead to near-term pressure on profitability, we believe Amazon’s competitive advantages will continue to grow and that the business has the potential to grow much faster than the overall economy in the coming years.”8. Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Baupost Group’s Stake Value: $146,217,0003-year Revenue Growth: 34.2%Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) is a Florida-based company that provides technology solutions for merchants, banks, and capital markets firms worldwide. It operates through Merchant Solutions, Banking Solutions, and Capital Market Solutions segments. Klarman boosted his stake in Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) by 251% in Q4 2022, holding 2.15 million shares worth $146.2 million.On February 13, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $1.71 and a revenue of $3.71 billion, beating Wall Street estimates by $0.01 and $20 million, respectively. According to a research note by UBS analyst Rayna Kumar on February 14, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) has announced that it will be executing a tax-free spin-out of its Merchant Solutions business. However, the analyst believes that investors would have preferred a sale of the business rather than a spin-out. As a result, the analyst has lowered the firm's price target on FIS from $86 to $78 while maintaining a Buy rating on the shares.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 60 hedge funds were bullish on Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS), compared to 67 in the prior quarter. Select Equity Group held the largest stake in the company, comprising 5.8 million shares worth $443.5 million. Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“In addition to SVB Financial and V.F. Corporation, we eliminated our positions in financial services technology company Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) and media and technology company Comcast Corporation. Several reasons factored into our decision to sell Fidelity National Information Services, including board and leadership changes, a strategic review, and a cooperation agreement with activist shareholder D.E. Shaw (and discussions with JANA Partners).”7. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Baupost Group’s Stake Value: $164,233,0003-year Revenue Growth: 18.3%Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was founded in 1978 and is headquartered in Boise, Idaho. The company designs, develops, and manufactures memory and storage products worldwide. It operates through four segments – Compute and Networking Business Unit, Mobile Business Unit, Embedded Business Unit, and Storage Business Unit. As of Q4 2022, Seth Klarman owns 3.28 million shares worth $164.2 million, representing 2.67% of the total 13F securities.

(NASDAQ:MU) from Neutral to Buy and raised the price target from $48 to $72. The analyst cited improving structural trends that are expected to accelerate the path to supply/demand balance for memory as the main driver of the upgrade. According to the analyst, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), along with Western Digital and Seagate, are close to a cyclical bottom, with Q1 potentially marking the peak in inventories and a low point in revenue. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was part of 74 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 69 in the earlier quarter. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 7.4 million shares worth $374 million. Here is what Claret Asset Management has to say about Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Inflation is still higher than interest rates… not an incentive to save for most people. Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”6. New Oriental Education &amp; Technology Group Inc.

Fang Zheng’s Keywise Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with nearly 4 million shares worth $95 million. Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), New Oriental Education &amp; Technology Group Inc. (NYSE:EDU) is one of the high growth stocks on Seth Klarman’s radar. Here is what Polen International Growth has to say about New Oriental Education &amp; Technology Group Inc. (NYSE:EDU) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“The quarter’s leading detractors were Chinese companies that were impacted by the CCP’s regulatory crackdown and liquidity concerns at property developer Evergrande. New Oriental Education—the largest provider of private educational services in China—moved sharply lower in July after policymakers implemented new rules which effectively turned Chinese tutoring companies into non-profits. Looking at New Oriental Education, we closed our position as soon as government policy became clear and used the proceeds to allocate to existing holdings.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 High Growth Value Stocks to Buy According to Seth Klarman.  Suggested articles:12 Stocks to Sell According to Motley Fool10 Best Annuity Companies in the US15 Biggest Advertising Companies in the World Disclosure: None. 12 High Growth Value Stocks to Buy According to Seth Klarman is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

For the last 15 years, I've been both a franchisee and a franchise operator.Tasty Restaurant Group's CEO, Robert Rodriguez, and I have worked together several times throughout my career. When we talked about his new adventure working with Triton Pacific to build Tasty Restaurant Group and the challenges of building a great restaurant operation company, it seemed like an incredible opportunity to work with a talented team of people and to have a positive impact on our family members' (what we call our team members) lives while serving our guests and our shareholders.What's the Pizza Hut experience like at a Tasty Hut restaurant? We are a large company that aspires to deliver the Pizza Hut-defined Guest Experience (great food, served fast and friendly), but we always put people first and still offer a culture characterized by love and caring support for our family members and customers. We call this our Hut Family Values. We work hard to create inviting exteriors and interiors and utilize modern technology to be both productive for our teams, but also relevant for our customers. We have seven operational foundations that, when executed well, help provide great guest and family member experiences, as well as grow business results. These seven foundations are 100 percent staffed; 100 percent trained; food safety basics; perfect dough and pizzas; fast and effective compliant management; ready for customer; and Hut Family Values.Story continuesWe continue to grow with more than 60 remodels, relocations, rebuilds, and new stores in the last two years. This includes a mix of delivery/carry-out restaurants and a few dine-in restaurants.We also adopt new technologies that will help enhance the guest and Team Member experience, leveraging third-party delivery services (like DoorDash Drive), world-class operation boards, pickup windows, digital signage, menus, and purchasing systems.What does Tasty Hut look for in leaders in their organization?We try to keep it simple at Tasty Hut. We believe if people respect and aspire to live out our Hut Family Values, are skilled to do their job, and are open to learning and receiving personal growth, then we can teach folks the rest. Leaders, whether at a restaurant or here at corporate, who have been most successful at Tasty Hut are those who build strong teams with diverse thinkers, are maniacs about execution and strategies, and really lean in and lead change.What is Tasty Hut's growth strategy and what's most important to Tasty Hut?(see graphic above)How is Tasty Hut involved in the community?We not only strive to support our communities with jobs at our restaurants and offering incredible food to our guests but also try to give back where we can through philanthropic donations. This may include fundraising or providing meals for individuals experiencing hardship or tragic events.Right now, we are doing a Ukraine fundraiser to support World Central Kitchen, providing emergency meals to Ukrainians all over Europe. This organization is also supporting families around our restaurants in Eastern Kentucky. And most importantly, we have dozens of family members who get involved in their communities to support those in need.What's next for Tasty Hut?We will continue to march down the path of becoming one of the very best Pizza Hut franchisees in the world by continuing to invest in our people, energizing our current assets and building new restaurants, delivering consistent results for our shareholders, but even more, impressing our guests with great guest experiences.We have come a long way in 2.5 years, but we still have work to do to fully live out our mission as a premier Pizza Hut franchise. And, I am blessed to have a great team of people, both in Tasty Hut and in our support groups, who fully support us on this journey.To learn more about Tasty Restaurant and Tasty Hut LLC, visit tastyrg.com.Yum!

Some travel comparison shopping websites haven't recovered in 2022 to pre-pandemic levels. k4dordy / FlickrTravel metasearch sites such as Trivago and Tripadvisor fell considerably short of pre-pandemic 2019 revenue levels in 2022 while travel companies in other sectors, such as Airbnb in short-term rentals, and tours and activities provider Viator greatly exceeded their marks from three years ago.The following chart shows that Trivago reached only 64 percent of 2019 revenue last year while Tripadvisor’s hotel metasearch feature climbed to just 85 percent of pre-pandemic revenue numbers in 2022. In the hotel sector, Marriott came up just short of the mark, having achieved 99 percent of 2019 revenue last year.Source: Skift and public financial filingsAirbnb; Viator, which is part of Tripadvisor; United, and Expedia Group all surpassed their 2019 revenue numbers last year. In 2022, Airbnb and Viator exceeded their prepandemic top lines by 75 percent and 71 percent, respectively. United (up 4 percent) and Expedia (2 percent) inched ahead. Expedia might have been a tad further ahead of 2019 if it hadn't sold its corporate travel unit, Egencia, which generated $620 million in revenue that year, to American Express Global Business Travel in November 2021.Booking Holdings hasn't reported its fourth quarter and full-year 2022 numbers yet, but in the third quarter of 2022 it blew past the revenue amount it recorded three years earlier by 21 percent. So one would expect Booking to show that it recovered considerably faster than rival Expedia when Booking publishes its 2022 financials on Thursday.What Is Travel Metasearch?What are travel metasearch sites? In general, they are websites where online travel agencies and hotels can bid for placement within a hotel listing, for example, and consumers can view their rates on a given date range, and then click over to these online travel agency and hotel websites to complete their bookings. Google, for one, supplements paid booking links from advertisers with free links from hotels and online travel agencies. Online travel agencies are the largest advertisers in metasearch compared with hotels, use these sites as an important vehicle to market their hotel offerings, and pay them each time a traveler clicks on one of their links.Story continuesThe following is a Tripadvisor metasearch listing for a stay at the Ibis Madrid Calle Alcala hotel on the night of February 24. Expedia likely bid the most for the featured position, and there are about 16 other deals displayed, all from online travel agencies with the exception of one hotel, Ibis. (Notice that in this instance all of the nightly rates are within $1 of one another.)Are Tripadvisor and Trivago Outliers?Kayak co-founder and CEO Steve Hafner, whose metasearch company is part of Booking Holdings, said of Trivago and Tripadvisor: ""They definitely lag the big OTAs (online travel agencies) but that mainly reflects their desire to focus on profitability versus top-line growth.""While Tripadvisor's hotel metasearch globally generated only 85 percent of its 2019 revenue in 2022, the company stated Tuesday during its fourth quarter earnings call that its metasearch revenue in the U.S. achieved parity with 2019 levels in 2022, and trended upward in the fourth quarter of last year.The question remains whether Trivago and Tripadvisor metasearch are currently weak links in the metasearch sphere — compared with Google — or whether the entire sector is in a swoon. Hafner wouldn't comment on Kayak's performance, nor would Trivago concerning the reasons it lagged the online travel agency recovery.Our focus has been on public companies Trivago and Tripadvisor, which publicized their metasearch performance. The leading metasearch player, Google, doesn't break out the performance of its comparative shopping service, Google Travel, and wouldn't comment on its trajectory.Google Metasearch May Be the BenefactorHowever, advertising revenue from the travel industry and the retail sector were Google's strongest performers in the fourth quarter, the company reported. While Alphabet, Google’s parent, saw its overall advertising revenue tick down 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter, travel and retail revenue increased. It should be pointed out, though, that Google generates its travel advertising revenue from two sources: Google.com and its metasearch feature travel.google.com. So it's unclear from Google's telling how Google's metasearch feature in particular has performed.However, Skift Research argued in December that metasearch sites such as Trivago and Tripadvisor have been losing market share to Google metasearch. ""Metasearch sites have been losing consumer traffic share to Google metasearch,"" a Skift Research report said. ""Data from SimilarWeb backs this up and suggests that Google became even more dominant during the pandemic jumping from a ~51% traffic share in the U.S. to 62%.""Other FactorsBeyond Google's ascendance and the fact that public company metasearch firms are emphasizing profitability over growth, there are other factors behind the tepid revenue recovery of some metasearch companies as compared with more robust growth at travel companies in other sectors. Among them, online travel agencies are leaning into brand marketing to elicit more direct bookings and loyalty program signups, and may be seeing declining marketing efficiencies when advertising in metasearch. Hotels saw  an increased percentage of direct bookings earlier in the pandemic, but that may be swinging back in the other direction now.Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates also impeded 2022 revenue numbers at metasearch and online travel agency sites when measured against 2019. Another potential factor is that Expedia Group has helped Marriott and IHG clamp down on smaller online travel agencies making unauthorized use of discounted wholesale rates from these two hotel brands and advertising them on metasearch sites.    Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

But after several years of adjusting, where do they stand when it comes to working in the office versus anywhere? New research from talent solutions and business consulting firm Robert Half reveals five remote work trends taking shape for 2023. View infographics of the research highlights.Research from Robert Half shows remote jobs are here to stay.Remote jobs are here to stay. Professionals remain confident in the job market, and having greater flexibility to choose where and when to work is a top motivator for making a move. Nearly 9 in 10 workers considering a job change (87%) are interested in hybrid or fully remote positions. And they have options: 28% of all new job postings in January 2023 were advertised as remote, on par with 29% a year ago.* View Robert Half's Demand for Skilled Talent report for insight on roles with the greatest percentage of remote opportunities.Work flexibility can lead to greater happiness. More than three-quarters of professionals (77%) who can work where and when they are most productive are putting in more hours now than three years ago. Despite longer workdays, 46% report higher job satisfaction.Some would sacrifice salary for more remote time. Nearly one-third of workers (32%) who go into the office at least one day a week are willing to take a pay cut for the ability to do their job remotely all the time. When asked by how much, the average response was 18%. Technology professionals (47%), 18- to 25-year-olds (42%) and working parents (41%) are most likely to accept a salary reduction to be fully remote.Being in the office has benefits. Nearly two-thirds of professionals (65%) said they have more effective relationships with colleagues they've met face-to-face versus those they have not. And more workers are comfortable collaborating in person (49%) than virtually (31%). Read about the benefits of working ""in person with a purpose"" in Robert Half's Your Future Is Flexible report.Employees have career opportunities, wherever they are. Most managers (82%) who oversee hybrid teams feel in-office and remote employees have the same opportunities for career advancement. Yet, 42% of remote workers are concerned about being visible for project opportunities and promotions. Managers said the best ways for off-site employees to position themselves for growth are:Story continues""Even though we've seen more people return to the office as of late, companies shouldn't pull back on remote work policies,"" said Paul McDonald, senior executive director of Robert Half. ""Flexibility and choice are clearly non-negotiables for many professionals, and employers will lose good staff if they limit remote options without a valid reason.""Lynne Smith, Robert Half senior vice president of global human resources, added, ""Supporting a hybrid workforce is not easy. It requires extensive planning, paying attention to employee and business needs, and pivoting to get right. But there are huge benefits of embracing a people-first, flexible work philosophy, including a more engaged and productive team.""About the ResearchThe online surveys were developed by Robert Half and conducted by independent research firms. They include responses from more than 2,500 workers 18 years of age or older (conducted Oct. 17 to Nov. 7, 2022) and 2,175 managers with hiring responsibilities (conducted Oct. 20 to Nov. 3, 2022) at companies with 20 or more employees in the U.S.*Robert Half calculations are based on job postings provided by TalentNeuron™.About Robert HalfRobert Half (NYSE: RHI) is the world's first and largest specialized talent solutions and business consulting firm that connects people with meaningful work and provides companies with the talent and subject matter expertise they need to confidently compete and grow.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Right now, Paccar is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Tesla has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that PCAR's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.PCAR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.39, while TSLA has a forward P/E of 52.62. We also note that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 1.24. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 2.18.Another notable valuation metric for PCAR is its P/B ratio of 3. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, TSLA has a P/B of 14.49.Based on these metrics and many more, PCAR holds a Value grade of A, while TSLA has a Value grade of D.PCAR stands above TSLA thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that PCAR is the superior value option right now.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company value investors might notice is PACCAR (PCAR). PCAR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 12.63, while its industry has an average P/E of 34.20. Over the last 12 months, PCAR's Forward P/E has been as high as 13.85 and as low as 10.39, with a median of 11.73.Investors should also note that PCAR holds a PEG ratio of 1.26. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. PCAR's industry currently sports an average PEG of 2.14. Within the past year, PCAR's PEG has been as high as 1.39 and as low as 1.04, with a median of 1.17.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is PCAR's P/B ratio of 2.97. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 4.15. Over the past 12 months, PCAR's P/B has been as high as 2.97 and as low as 2.20, with a median of 2.53.Story continuesValue investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. PCAR has a P/S ratio of 1.37. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 3.13.Finally, investors should note that PCAR has a P/CF ratio of 11.30. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. PCAR's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 13.93. PCAR's P/CF has been as high as 12.01 and as low as 8.61, with a median of 10.37, all within the past year.These are only a few of the key metrics included in PACCAR's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, PCAR looks like an impressive value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 14.5% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $76.12 in the previous session. Paccar has gained 14.7% since the start of the year compared to the 28.6% move for the Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector and the 43.3% return for the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on January 24, 2023, Paccar reported EPS of $1.76 versus consensus estimate of $1.49.For the current fiscal year, Paccar is expected to post earnings of $6.11 per share on $30.75 billion in revenues. This represents a 6.26% change in EPS on a 12.57% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $5.57 per share on $28.34 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of -8.9% and -7.82%, respectively.Valuation MetricsPaccar may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Paccar has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 12.4X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 12.4X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 11.4X versus its peer group's average of 12.9X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.24. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Paccar currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Paccar fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Paccar shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. NetApp (NTAP) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.33 a share, just two days from its upcoming earnings release on February 22, 2023.NTAP has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.82%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.33 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.31.NTAP is just one of a large group of Computer and Technology stocks with a positive ESP figure. Intuit (INTU) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on February 23, 2023, Intuit holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.44 a share three days from its next quarterly update.Intuit's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.42% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.43.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, NTAP and INTU could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

219,22a77ac4-eb06-328a-b625-82de575bcdad,NI,2023-02-21,4 Utilities Set to Surpass Estimates This Earnings Season,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-utilities-set-surpass-estimates-125112610.html,1676897472,STORY,"['SRE', 'EIX', 'DTE', 'NI', 'NIMC']","[Per the latest Earnings Preview, the Zacks Utilities sector’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings are expected to improve 3.1% on the back of revenue improvement of 3.1%. The capital-intensive utility stocks were impacted by the ongoing increase in interest rates and rising operating costs, while cost management, customer growth, systematic investment to strengthen infrastructure to increase the resilience of the system and new rates implemented in their service territories boosted revenues.With the assistance of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified four utilities, namely NiSource NI, Sempra Energy SRE, Edison International EIX and DTE Energy DTE, which are poised to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in fourth-quarter earnings. These stocks have the ideal combination of two ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) — to surpass expectations. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.A few large utilities, like NextEra Energy, Dominion Energy and Duke Energy, among others, have already reported an earnings surprise in their respective releases.Factors That Likely Impacted Q4 ResultsDomestic-focused companies operating in the sector are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. New rates and customer additions are creating fresh demand as well as assisting the utilities. Investment in strengthening the infrastructure is allowing utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings.Domestic-focused operations also insulate utilities from the adverse impact of currency fluctuation. Mergers and acquisitions in the utility space allow utilities to expand operation, make essential investment to upgrade old infrastructure and extend quality services to new customers, thus boosting revenues.Capital-intensive utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations, and are capital-intensive in nature. The performance of the utilities is likely to have been adversely impacted by the increase in interest rates from near-zero levels. The ongoing increase in borrowing costs and the possibility of more interest rate hikes this year may have further pushed up capital servicing expenses and adversely impacted earnings.Utilities have been focused on improving productivity and their cost structure through investments in digital technologies, integrating key systems and analyzing data to make proper decisions to improve overall operations. The utilities have been educating customers relating to the proper usage of electricity to reduce utility bills and things to do during emergencies to reduce damage.The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is likely to have supported and accelerated utilities’ transition toward clean energy sources. IRA has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for renewable sources usage. The Act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions, in a much predictable way, for a long time and will create earnings visibility.Expected Q4 OutperformersNiSource is an energy holding company and together with its subsidiaries provides natural gas, electricity and other products and services in the United States. NiSource remains on track to make capital investments of nearly $15 billion within the 2023-2027 period.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Zimmer Biomet has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while LeMaitre Vascular has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that ZBH is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.ZBH currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.93, while LMAT has a forward P/E of 42.57. We also note that ZBH has a PEG ratio of 2.89. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. LMAT currently has a PEG ratio of 4.26.Another notable valuation metric for ZBH is its P/B ratio of 2.20. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, LMAT has a P/B of 4.24.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to ZBH's Value grade of B and LMAT's Value grade of C.ZBH has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than LMAT, so it seems like value investors will conclude that ZBH is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Welcome to our fourth quarter and year end investor update. We'll keep our remarks brief this morning given the comprehensive update we shared with you on January 11th. We continue to be extremely excited for PPL's bright future and the value we intend to deliver for our customers and shareowners. Turning to slide four, 2022 was a remarkable year in PPL's history, one that has completely redefined our company. It marks the beginning of a new era as we are now positioned as a premier pure-play US regulated utility holding company. Our strategic repositioning began with the sale of our UK business in 2021 and concluded in May of 2022 with the addition of Rhode Island Energy and its almost 800,000 customers.Story continuesI'm very proud of the execution from our team to close this transaction and complete the transition activities to-date with National Grid. We are on schedule to complete all of the TSAs in 2024 as originally planned. The acquisition of Rhode Island Energy also enhances our scale and enables PPL to be a leader in our sector for years to come. This includes positioning our company to deliver top-tier 6% to 8% earnings and dividend growth through at least 2026, with one of the best credit profiles in our sector, our balance sheet can support our growth without equity issuances throughout the planning horizon. And while we executed on our strategic repositioning, we remain steadfast in our pursuit of delivering excellent financial and operational results in 2022.First and foremost, we achieved ongoing earnings of $1.41 per share, beating the midpoint of our forecast, which we had increased in November. This is a fantastic accomplishment considering all the extra work our teams completed this past year in connection with our strategic repositioning. In addition to delivering solid financial results, we also laid the groundwork for capital investments we need to make for years to come, in our pursuit of delivering an exceptional customer experience at an affordable price. Specifically, we presented a balanced investment plan in Kentucky to replace nearly 1,500 megawatts of retiring coal generation. This plan best positions our utilities in Kentucky to serve our customers with safe, reliable, affordable and sustainable energy while the state fosters significant economic development and growth.We also designed a series of plans for our newly acquired Rhode Island Energy, strategies to deliver the energy grids necessary to achieve the state's impressive clean energy goal of 100% renewable energy by 2033. These plans include advanced metering, grid modernization and our first infrastructure safety and reliability plans under our ownership. These plans emphasize just some of the robust investment opportunities at our utilities. We're also looking at potential regulated investment opportunities beyond our four utilities, leveraging our expertise in transmission development to open new doors for potential growth. This includes our strategic partnership with WindGrid, an Elia subsidiary, where we are exploring offshore transmission solutions in New England.Any investment opportunity stemming from this partnership, are not included in our capital forecast and represent potential upside to our long-term growth plan. On the operational front, during 2022, we maintained our top quartile reliability in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, despite the increased frequency and severity of storms in our service territories. And in just a few months of ownership, Rhode Island Energy has experienced a marked improvement in reliability and exceeded 2022 expectations by more than 10%. One example of this excellent performance was during Winter Storm Elliott. Rhode Island Energy was the first major New England utility to achieve full customer restoration in the early morning of Christmas Day. We also maintained our top quartile customer satisfaction at PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities.And while we're proud of these achievements, we are sympathetic to the concerns of our Pennsylvania customers who experienced increases in their December bills as a result of higher energy prices. While we don't control the price of electricity supply, we know that it can have a meaningful impact on our customers. And while the default rate for PPL Electric's non-shopping customers increased in December, many of our customers who have chosen third-party suppliers saw even higher price increases and are paying significantly more than our default rate of approximately $0.145. Our most recent review of shopping results found that in November, over 40% of our residential shopping customers paid a higher rate than our default rate. Over 100,000 customers paid a rate between 25% and 100% more than the default rate and nearly 20,000 customers paid more than double our default rate.Solar panel, Energy, SunPhoto by Moritz Kindler on UnsplashFor the last two years, PPL Electric has been a vocal advocate, on behalf of our customers, for greater safeguards and other actions to protect them from overpaying for their electricity supply. We proposed various consumer protection reforms with our Pennsylvania legislators and regulators and are again having discussions with them for the benefit of our customers. In addition to higher bills from these increased energy prices, a large number of our PPL Electric Utilities customers received estimated bills in December due to a technical issue. The timing of higher electricity bills and the increased number of estimated bills created some confusion and concern for customers. We have since fixed the technical issue and have temporarily doubled the resources at our call centers to address customer questions and significantly reduce call wait times.And in further support of our customers, we've waived late fees and expanded our no-shutoff practice over the winter to include all residential and small business customers. We're also focused on communicating even more with our customers about high energy prices and what customers can do to minimize their energy bills. While this is an important topic for us and our customers that I wanted to address today, I want to be clear that we do not expect this matter to have a significant impact on our financial results. As we've discussed at length, one of the key aspects of our strategy is to drive operating efficiencies across the entire business. In developing our strategy, we anticipated affordability being a key area of focus for customers and regulators, even before we saw the effects of inflation and high commodity costs.We all know the energy grids need significant investment to ensure reliability and resiliency while preparing for renewables, DERs and more electrification. This is why our plan best positions PPL to achieve our goals while focusing on affordability for our customers. Turning to Slide 5. PPL's outlook for 2023 is one that is simply focused on executing our utility of the future strategy. In my 2022 recap, I discussed that we are on track with our integration activities with Rhode Island Energy. An obvious top priority for 2023 is to remain on track with our Rhode Island integration, setting us up for completion in 2024. We have a $2.4 billion capital plan that improves the safety, reliability and resiliency of our networks while addressing our customers' evolving needs.We're on track to deliver the first leg of our $175 million O&amp;M savings target by 2026 with $50 million to $60 million of savings in 2023 as we deploy our playbook and continue to optimize our operations. These savings will provide a strong basis for us to deliver the midpoint of our 2023 earnings forecast of $1.58 per share. Recall, this forecast represents a 7% increase from our pro forma 2022 forecast of $1.48 per share. We will also focus on the regulatory filings in Kentucky and Rhode Island to deliver lease cost and reliable energy for our customers and help to advance the clean energy transition. Turning to Slide 6. As we executed our strategic repositioning over the past few years, we took a hard look at how we wanted to be defined as a company and management team.Simply put, we want to be the best utility company in the US, the best set of learning safe, reliable, affordable and sustainable energy to our customers and competitive long-term returns to our shareowners. We've included on the right side of the slide, the categories that we'll use to measure our success against our peers. In short, we will be targeting top decile or top quartile performance and safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and cost efficiency, while at the same time, targeting a premium stock valuation. While we're not there yet in all categories, I firmly believe we are on the right path to get there. And I'm excited to see us advance down this path. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Joe?Joe Bergstein: Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 8. Our solid fourth quarter financial results closed out a great year for the company. Fourth quarter GAAP earnings were $0.26 per share. Special items in the fourth quarter were $0.02 per share, primarily due to integration and related expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy, partially offset by a tax benefit due to the provision to final 2021 tax return adjustments, primarily related to the sale of WPD. Adjusting for these special items, fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.28 per share, an improvement of $0.06 per share compared to 2021. With these strong fourth quarter results, our 2022 GAAP earnings totaled $1.02 per share.Special items for the year were $0.39 per share, primarily related to integration and related expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy. Our ongoing earnings for the year were $1.41 per share compared to $1.05 per share for 2021 exceeding the midpoint of our earnings forecast for 2022. Turning to the ongoing segment drivers for the quarter on slide nine. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results improved by $0.01 year-over-year. Results were primarily driven by higher sales volumes due to milder than normal weather last year and increased returns on additional capital investments in transmission. These improvements were offset partially by higher O&amp;M expenses. Our Kentucky segment decreased by $0.01 per share year-over-year.Improved sales volumes in Kentucky also due to milder than normal weather experienced last year were more than offset by higher O&amp;M and interest expense. The addition of our Rhode Island segment increased earnings by $0.03 per share for the quarter. Results at Corporate and Other increased $0.03 per share compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower O&amp;M expenses, lower income taxes, and other factors that were not individually significant. These favorable drivers were partially offset by higher interest expense. Our strong performance in the fourth quarter reflects another proof point of delivering on expectations since our repositioning last year. Our results for the full year are on slide 10. We reported improved results across each business segment in 2022.The operating segment results presented here exclude the impact of share accretion, which we've shown as a separate bar on the far right of the slide. Recall that we used a portion of the UK business sales proceeds to repurchase $1 billion of shares back in the fourth quarter of 2021, resulting in $0.05 of accretion in 2022. We also used another $4 billion of the UK sales proceeds to reduce our holding company debt, strengthening our balance sheet to one of the best in the sector. This reduction of debt was the primary driver for the $0.10 improvement in our Corporate and Other segment for the year. Turning to the operating segments. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment delivered a $0.06 per share increase for the year compared to 2021. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by returns on additional capital investments in transmission, higher peak transmission demand, and improved sales volumes.These favorable drivers were partially offset by higher O&amp;M expenses, including increased uncollectibles, additional vegetation management costs, and IT amortization costs. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earnings increased by $0.07 per share for the year compared to 2021. Our improved results in Kentucky were primarily driven by a full year of higher retail rates that went into effect in July 2021 and higher sales volumes. These favorable drivers were partially offset by higher O&amp;M expenses, including vegetation management, plant outage and storm costs, and higher depreciation expense. Our Rhode Island segment added $0.08 per share to ongoing earnings for the year, reflecting the period from our acquisition in late May through the end of the year.This was a great year for the company and is yet another demonstration of our commitment to deliver on and exceed our financial goals. Turning to slide 11. We expect to keep that momentum heading into this year. Today, we are reaffirming our 2023 earnings forecast range of $1.50 to $1.65 per share and the midpoint of $1.58 per share. We remain confident in our ability to deliver our forecast by leveraging our proven operating model, a strategy focused on driving cost efficiencies to reduce O&amp;M, which enables investments necessary to advance our energy networks in the most affordable manner. Our Pennsylvania segment results are expected to increase by $0.04 per share in 2023, primarily due to returns on additional capital investments in transmission and lower O&amp;M, partially offset by higher interest expense.We project our Kentucky segment results to increase by $0.05 per share in 2023, primarily due to lower O&amp;M, partially offset by higher interest expense. Our Rhode Island segment results are expected to increase by $0.08 per share in 2023, primarily due to the impact of a full year's earnings. We project corporate and other results to be flat year-over-year. Moving to slide 12. In connection with the request from many of our investors, we've reallocated our Kentucky holding company financing costs to corporate and other, beginning January 1. This reallocation provides a clearer view of the utility earnings for our Kentucky Regulated segment and is consistent with how we report the Pennsylvania and Rhode Island segments. We've illustrated the impact of this reallocation to our actual 2022 ongoing earnings on this slide to show the 2022 segment results on a consistent basis with our 2023 segment forecast.Moving to slide 13. Our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share to be paid on April 3 to shareholders of record as of March 10. As we discussed in January, the $0.24 dividend is a 7% increase that aligns with our predictable, linear and competitive annual EPS growth of 6% to 8%. This is also within our targeted dividend payout range of 60% to 65%, combining our targeted EPS growth with our dividend yield provides investors with a compelling total return proposition in the range of 9% to 11% per year. This is consistent with our mission of delivering long-term returns to shareholders. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince.Vince Sorgi: Thank you, Joe. Over the past two years, we've taken bold steps to transform PPL for long-term growth and success and to improve shareowner return, while building on our core strengths. Since then, we have continued to deliver on the goals we set, exceeding the midpoint of our 2022 earnings forecast, advancing industry-leading grid modernization, providing highly reliable electricity and gas service and economically advancing our clean energy strategy. And our plan provides investors with an attractive return proposition, one that the entire management team and I intend to deliver. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions.See also 12 Countries that Produce the Best Tea and 25 Least Developed Countries in Asia.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

(NYSE:RMD) Worth US$216 Based On Its Intrinsic Value?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/resmed-inc-nyse-rmd-worth-135418899.html,1676901258,STORY,['RMD'],"[Key InsightsResMed's estimated fair value is US$178 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityResMed is estimated to be 21% overvalued based on current share price of US$216 Analyst price target for RMD is US$256, which is 44% above our fair value estimateHow far off is ResMed Inc. (NYSE:RMD) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for ResMed What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$797.7mUS$1.18bUS$1.15bUS$1.33bUS$1.46bUS$1.55bUS$1.62bUS$1.69bUS$1.75bUS$1.80bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 6.16%Est @ 4.93%Est @ 4.08%Est @ 3.47%Est @ 3.05% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4% US$742US$1.0kUS$929US$996US$1.0kUS$1.0kUS$982US$951US$916US$878(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.4bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.8b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.4%– 2.1%) = US$34bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$34b÷ ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$17bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$26b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$216, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at ResMed as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.903. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for ResMedStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Medical Equipment market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value?

227,85495685-517b-364c-8bac-41a101d07680,OXY,2023-02-21,Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) shareholders YoY returns are lagging the company's 29% three-year earnings growth,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-nyse-oxy-shareholders-110027097.html,1676977227,STORY,"['OXY', 'CL=F']","[It hasn't been the best quarter for Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 15% in that time. But that shouldn't obscure the pleasing returns achieved by shareholders over the last three years. After all, the share price is up a market-beating 68% in that time.While this past week has detracted from the company's three-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Occidental Petroleum became profitable within the last three years. So we would expect a higher share price over the period.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Occidental Petroleum's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Occidental Petroleum the TSR over the last 3 years was 75%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Occidental Petroleum shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 60% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 1.1% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Occidental Petroleum better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Occidental Petroleum (at least 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Occidental Petroleum is not the only stock insiders are buying.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 High Growth Energy Stocks To Buy. The International Energy Agency's latest report highlights the concerning trend that the number of people without access to modern energy is increasing, reversing the progress made in the last decade. According to the report, around 75 million people who have recently gained access to electricity may not be able to afford it, while an additional 100 million people may need to rely on traditional biomass for cooking. As per the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in April, in order to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C as set out in the Paris Agreement, it is necessary to reach the peak of greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 at the latest and reduce them by 43% by 2030. Dealing with emissions presents a chance for the development of the green economy. The sectors that support the transition to net-zero emissions have the potential to reach a value of $10.3 trillion for the world economy by 2050.On the other hand, experts predict that China's crude oil imports will reach a new high in 2023 due to an increase in demand for fuel as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted and new refineries begin operations. This is expected to be a positive factor for the oil market, which is already being supported by output cuts from the OPEC+ producer group and western sanctions on Russian exports.According to industry consultancies including Wood Mackenzie, FGE, Energy Aspects, and S&amp;P Global Commodity Insight, China's crude oil imports could increase by as much as 500,000 to 1 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, potentially reaching up to 11.8 million bpd, surpassing the previous record of 10.8 million bpd in 2020. This growth would reverse the trend of declining crude oil imports over the last two years.Investors who are interested in the energy sector can also check out 12 Top Performing Energy Stocks in January, 12 Cheap Energy Stocks To Buy, and 12 Best Performing Energy Stocks in 2022.

229,b6d68440-17db-3b0c-a073-e465c2ea3db4,OXY,2023-02-21,Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-oxy-earnings-expected-150003594.html,1676905203,STORY,"['OXY', 'BRY']","[The market expects Occidental Petroleum (OXY) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis oil and gas exploration and production company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.83 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +23.7%.Revenues are expected to be $8.65 billion, up 8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.01% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Occidental?For Occidental, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.82%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Occidental will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Occidental would post earnings of $2.48 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.44, delivering a surprise of -1.61%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Occidental appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, Berry Petroleum (BRY) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.24 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +100%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $171.3 million, down 17.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Berry Petroleum has been revised 10.1% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 16.20%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Berry Petroleum will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

230,f00e9ffb-5762-3f45-b1a5-98dc3b7163ec,OXY,2023-02-21,Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-corporation-oxy-trending-140002533.html,1676901602,STORY,['OXY'],"[Occidental Petroleum (OXY) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned -9.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, which Occidental falls in, has lost 10.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Occidental is expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share, indicating a change of +23.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.60 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +276.5%. This estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 indicates a change of -31.8% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.9%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Occidental.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OXY _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Occidental, the consensus sales estimate of $8.65 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +8%. The $37.19 billion and $33.4 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +41.3% and -10.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $9.5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +39.4%. EPS of $2.44 for the same period compares with $0.87 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.35 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.58%. The EPS surprise was -1.61%.Over the last four quarters, Occidental surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(ULTA) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ulta-beauty-inc-ulta-hits-141502506.html,1676902502,STORY,"['ULTA', 'ARHS']","[Have you been paying attention to shares of Ulta Beauty (ULTA)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 7.9% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $533.68 in the previous session. Ulta Beauty has gained 13% since the start of the year compared to the 9.3% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 11.1% return for the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on December 1, 2022, Ulta reported EPS of $5.34 versus consensus estimate of $4.09.For the current fiscal year, Ulta is expected to post earnings of $24.29 per share on $9.99 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $26.50 per share on $10.77 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 5.94% and 7.82%, respectively.Valuation MetricsUlta may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Ulta has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 21.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 16.3X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 22.9X versus its peer group's average of 6.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.59. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Ulta currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Ulta meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Ulta shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does ULTA Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of ULTA have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Arhaus, Inc. (ARHS). ARHS has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of F.Earnings were strong last quarter. Arhaus, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 80%, and for the current fiscal year, ARHS is expected to post earnings of $0.88 per share on revenue of $1.23 billion.Shares of Arhaus, Inc. have gained 10.8% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 16.32X and a P/CF of 19.06X.The Retail - Miscellaneous industry is in the top 39% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for ULTA and ARHS, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

QuoteFactors to ConsiderIn second-quarter fiscal 2023, Palo Alto is likely to have benefited from strong momentum stemming from deal wins, which is further expected to have boosted its top line. The strong demand for form factor hardware products, particularly the machine learning-powered models that ensure zero-trust network security for organizations, is expected to have contributed to the quarterly performance.Palo Alto has been gaining from the Bridgecrew acquisition, which forms the crux of the Prisma public cloud and Xpanse, which forms the basis of Cortex. Prisma and Cortex are likely to have continued performing well in the fiscal second quarter as well.The growing and accelerated migration to the cloud in a post-pandemic era is likely to have boosted the adoption of the aforementioned platforms. The company projects year-over-year billings growth between 21% and 24% ($1.94 billion-$1.99 billion) during the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, the increased use of cloud and remote networks amid a hybrid working environment has resulted in escalating cyberattacks currently.

PANW’s fiscal second-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from this demand surge.Story continuesFederal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) recognitions are boosting the adoption of Palo Alto’s products by government organizations. The company’s Prisma Access, Cortex XDR, Cortex Data Lake, Prisma Cloud and WildFire received FedRAMP recognitions.This FedRAMP recognition reflects the U.S. public sector’s trust in Palo Alto’s IoT security solutions.

Why Textron (TXT) is a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-170005202.html,1676912405,STORY,['TXT'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Textron (TXT), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Textron currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for TXT that show why this maker of Cessna small planes and Bell helicopters shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor TXT, shares are up 1.4% over the past week while the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry is up 1.4% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 10.26% compares favorably with the industry's 0.93% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Textron have increased 4.66% over the past quarter, and have gained 7.61% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 3.78% and -5.37%, respectively.Investors should also take note of TXT's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, TXT is averaging 1,484,149 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with TXT.Over the past two months, 5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost TXT's consensus estimate, increasing from $4.43 to $4.74 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that TXT is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Textron on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is Textron (TXT). TXT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 15.59 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 23.79. Over the last 12 months, TXT's Forward P/E has been as high as 18.19 and as low as 13.22, with a median of 15.63.TXT is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1.39. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. TXT's industry has an average PEG of 2.14 right now. Over the last 12 months, TXT's PEG has been as high as 1.55 and as low as 0.98, with a median of 1.17.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. TXT has a P/S ratio of 1.19. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.72.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Textron's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that TXT is an impressive value stock right now.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It's just not enough to have an adequate deterrent effect.”Norfolk Southern's stock is down about 9.5% since the February 3 derailment.The Transportation Secretary spoke with reporters on Monday to preview the actions unveiled this morning in response to the derailment in the town of East Palestine, Ohio, which led to chemicals being released into the local air and water with local residents expressing deep worry about their health as a result.The Ohio crash is still being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board. Norfolk Southern has not yet been accused of any safety lapses. Nevertheless, Buttigieg sent a stern letter over the weekend to president and CEO Alan Shaw asking the company to support the local community and accusing the railway of having a record of thwarting efforts to improve rail safety standards in the U.S.The company didn’t immediately respond to Buttigieg’s note, but previously sent a letter of their own promising “We will not walk away, East Palestine.”This video screenshot released by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) shows the site of a derailed freight train in East Palestine, Ohio after about 50 Norfolk Southern freight train cars derailed on the night of Feb. 3 in East Palestine, a town of 4,800 residents near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. (NTSB/Handout via Xinhua)‘A pretty good place to begin would be to add a zero’The call from the Biden administration for new fines came as part of a series of announcements unveiled Tuesday.Story continuesThe administration called on the freight rail industry to use safer tank cars, provide workers with paid sick leave, and other measures. The Transportation Department also said it intends to take unilateral action of its own such as new rules around train crew size as well as more rigorous and focused safety inspections.Those announcements are paired with the proposal for increased fines, which would need to be approved by Congress. The Biden administration is calling for other actions from Congress, including strengthening the rules that govern high-hazard flammable trains.Buttigieg said he hopes there is currently a window of opportunity on Capitol Hill following the bipartisan outcry in recent days following the rail disaster. ""If people are going to find religion on rail regulation, I welcome that,"" he said.As for the level of fines, he would like to see: “This is something I want to work with Congress on but at a common sense level, I think a pretty good place to begin would be to add a zero,” Buttigieg says.The Tuesday announcement from Buttigieg comes as the Transportation Secretary himself weathers criticism of his own, especially from Republicans, for what is seen as a slow federal government response to the derailment.A Norfolk Southern train passes through East Palestine, Ohio on February 14. Another train operated by the company derailed on February 3, releasing toxic fumes and forcing evacuation of residents. (Angelo Merendino/Getty Images)Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) even called for Sec. Buttigieg to resign claiming he has “demonstrated a gross level of incompetence and apathy” during his two years in office. Rubio says that a lack of oversight from Washington was a part of the reason for the crash.In response, Buttigeig scoffed at Rubio’s charges, pointing to a 2021 letter pushing for more automated track inspections that was signed by Rubio and other GOP senators that, Buttigieg said, “was pretty obviously drafted by industry, calling on us to weaken our practices around track inspection.”During a recent Yahoo Finance Live interview, Purdue University Lyles School Professor Andrew J. Whelton spread the blame around saying ""State, federal, and local officials haven't been forthright and transparent enough with the population.""Buttigieg and other Biden officials meanwhile are clearly aiming to have Norfolk Southern shoulder most of the blame. But the partisan battle is only expected to increase this week: former President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the northeastern Ohio town. “I'll see you on Wednesday!” the former President wrote this weekend in a statement.Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.Click here for politics news related to business and moneyRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

The Biden administration said on Friday it was stepping up its efforts as two congressional committees investigate.Buttigieg told reporters he wants major rail companies to adopt safer tank cars by 2025, rather than 2029 as required under a law passed in 2015.He also called on them join a whistleblower protection program, boost hazardous shipment notifications to state emergency response teams and provide paid sick leave saying ""a healthy and well-supported workforce is a safer workforce.""Buttigieg said he planned to pursue new regulations to boost rail safety ""to the extent possible"" under current law and would initiate additional focused inspection programs.He wrote to Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw on Sunday highlighting prior aggressive industry lobbying to weaken efforts to impose new safety requirements.Norfolk Southern said it had established an initial $1 million community support fund and distributed $3.4 million in direct financial assistance to more than 2,200 families to cover evacuation costs. ""We are going to do the right things to help East Palestine recover and thrive again,"" Shaw said.Story continuesSeparately, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan will visit East Palestine for the second time in less than a week on Tuesday and will announce additional health and safety measures. Buttigieg said ""when the time is right"" he also plans to visit East Palestine.Buttigieg wants Congress to make it easier to impose new train safety regulations and increase U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) fines for violating safety regulations from the current maximum $225,455 at least ten-fold. ""For a multi-billion rail company posting profits in the billions ever year, that is just not enough to have an adequate deterrent effect,"" he said.The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the derailment and USDOT said it would use the probe results ""to hold Norfolk Southern accountable, while pushing for rail safety initiatives in the more immediate future.""The rail industry says 99.9% of all hazmat shipments reach their destination without incident and hazmat accident rate has declined by 55% since 2012.Some rail safety requirements were withdrawn under President Donald Trump. Some Republican critics of the East Palestine response who previously opposed rail regulations have now expressed openness to new rules. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Jamie Freed)]"

EPS came in at $0.40, in line with consensus estimates, boosted by the company’s share buyback program.The company expects Q1/23 revenue of $600M-$603M and full-year revenue of $2.475B-$2.49B. Both numbers beat the Street expectations, but the company benefited both in Q4 and in its guidance from the recent acquisition of Formswift.Management also provided its guidance for free cash flow, expecting $825M-$855M for 2023, though they at least raised questions about whether they could hit their long-term guidance of $1B in free cash flow for 2024, citing a combined headwind from FX and R&amp;D legislation of over $75M since they issued that guidance.Twilio soars on strong results, announces $1B buybackTwilio (NYSE:TWLO) shares surged more than 14% on Thursday after the company delivered a Q4 beat and better-than-expected profit guidance.Q4 EPS of $0.22 and revenue of $1.02B came in better than the consensus estimate of ($0.08) and $1B, respectively.For Q1/23, the company expects EPS of $0.18-$0.22, better than the consensus of $0.01, and revenue of $995M-$1,005M, compared to the consensus of $1,020M.The company also announced a $1B share buyback program.Shares closed the week with more than a 17% gain.AutoNation shares jump following Q4 beatAutoNation (NYSE:AN) shares surged more than 11% on Friday following the company’s reported Q4 results, with both EPS and revenues coming in better than expected.The revenue beat was driven by higher average selling prices of vehicles, increased new vehicle unit sales, and continued growth in after-sales, more than offsetting the company's lower used vehicle unit sales.Related Articles6 big earnings reports: Roku's dazzling week | Pro RecapDow futures fall 225 pts; Home Depot results disappoint ahead of PMI releaseWalmart earnings beat by $0.19, revenue topped estimates]"

243,a29f1c83-6acb-3f20-9d2d-d4c3b74d4be8,KO,2023-02-21,CocaCola Company (The) (KO) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cocacola-company-ko-attracting-investor-140002995.html,1676901602,STORY,"['KO', '^GSPC']","[Coca-Cola (KO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned +0.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.4% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which Coke belongs, has lost 0.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.64 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.59 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +4.4%. This estimate has changed +2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.78 indicates a change of +7.5% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Coke is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for KO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Coke, the consensus sales estimate of $10.8 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.9%. The $44.67 billion and $46.97 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.9% and +5.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $10.13 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7%. EPS of $0.45 for the same period compares with $0.45 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.2%. The EPS surprise was 0%.Over the last four quarters, Coke surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

244,f943f92b-b44e-3e76-8d29-20409468dd55,DVA,2023-02-21,Addus HomeCare (ADUS) Reports Next Week: What to Expect,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/addus-homecare-adus-reports-next-150003000.html,1676905203,STORY,"['ADUS', 'DVA']","[Wall Street expects flat earnings compared to the year-ago quarter on higher revenues when Addus HomeCare (ADUS) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 27, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis provider of home-based personal care, nursing and rehabilitative therapy services is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.97 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter.Revenues are expected to be $246.6 million, up 9.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.43% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Addus HomeCare?For Addus HomeCare, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.52%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Addus HomeCare will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Addus HomeCare would post earnings of $0.93 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.94, delivering a surprise of +1.08%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Addus HomeCare doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry, DaVita HealthCare (DVA) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.88 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -56.4%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.94 billion, down 0.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for DaVita HealthCare has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -1.71%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that DaVita HealthCare will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

245,8781b436-8eca-3caa-94bd-b5a49baff357,DVA,2023-02-21,DaVita (DVA) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/davita-dva-report-q4-earnings-130601262.html,1676898361,STORY,"['DVA', 'PEN']","[DaVita Inc. DVA is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 22, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.45 per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.1%. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions and lagged the same in the other two, delivering a negative earnings surprise of 0.9%, on average.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayDuring third-quarter 2022 call in October, DaVita confirmed that it continued to witness treatment volume and labor-related headwinds in the reported quarter. Management confirmed that the headwinds in volumes had persisted longer than was assumed, and contract labor costs and productivity did not begin to improve in the quarter as had been expected by DaVita. Management also confirmed that it expects these pressures to continue longer than anticipated. Moreover, the continued uncertainty from COVID-19 and the labor market led DaVita to lower its guidance for the year. This does not look encouraging for the stock as this is likely to have significantly impacted the fourth-quarter revenues.During the same call, DaVita confirmed that its net treatment rates, which had a meaningful impact on the change in its treatment volume due to an increase in mid-treatment rates resulting from the Ominicon search, were anticipated to return to seasonal norms after the win in search. However, that was not the case and hence, management believes these will remain elevated through the end of 2022. This is also likely to have weighed on the to-be-reported quarter’s treatment volume, thereby impacting the overall top line.DaVita Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseDaVita Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseDaVita Inc. price-eps-surprise | DaVita Inc. QuoteManagement also confirmed during the last earnings call that although COVID-19 mortality rates in 2022 have been down compared with prior years, excess mortality remains a challenge for DaVita. The company expects this to persist in the fourth quarter, although the magnitude of the impact will depend on the size and the severity of COVID-19 surges during the winter.Story continuesMoreover, labor costs have continued to remain a challenge over the past few months, with higher contracted labor utilization and base wage increases. Despite management’s efforts to offset the impact of wage and other inflationary increases, these are likely to have weighed on the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 top line.On a positive note, management had stated that although U.S. dialysis treatments per day were down on a sequential basis, revenue per treatment grew sequentially. This primarily resulted from favorable adjustments, increased acute treatment and the continued shift to Medicare Advantage plans, partially offset by the reinstatement of Medicare sequestration. This trend is likely to have continued into the fourth quarter, thereby driving up the quarter’s revenues. However, the reinstatement of Medicare sequestration is likely to continue to have a negative impact on fourth-quarter revenues.DaVita is likely to have continued to benefit from its acquisition of MedSleuth, which was completed in January 2022. MedSleuth’s software enables closer partnerships and better coordination between transplant centers, nephrologists and kidney care providers, with all three working together to support the company’s patient transplant journey.During the third-quarter 2022 earnings call DaVita confirmed that its Integrated Kidney Care is a business that management has generally assumed will have a better fourth-quarter performance than other quarters because of how revenue recognition works. This is also likely to have driven up the quarterly revenues.The Estimate PictureFor fourth-quarter 2022, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.94 billion for total revenues calls for a decline of 0.2% from the prior-year reported figure.We estimate fourth-quarter total revenues to be $2.93 billion, reflecting a decline of 0.3% year over year.The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at 88 cents, indicating a decline of 56.4% from the prior-year reported number.We estimate fourth-quarter earnings to be 86 cents, reflecting a decline of 57.5% year over year.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), along with a positive Earnings ESP has higher chances of beating estimates. This is not the case here, as you can see below.Earnings ESP: DaVita has an Earnings ESP of -1.71%.

Ingersoll Rand believes Organic Revenue Growth is a helpful supplemental measure to assist management and investors in evaluating the Company’s operating results as it excludes the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions on revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain non-cash, non-recurring and other adjustment items. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income including interest, depreciation and amortization of non-acquisition related intangible assets and excluding other items used to calculate Adjusted EBITDA and further adjusted for the tax effect of these exclusions. Organic Revenue Growth is defined as As Reported Revenue growth less the impacts of Foreign Currency and Acquisitions. Ingersoll Rand believes that the adjustments applied in presenting Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items and about non-recurring items that the Company does not expect to continue at the same level in the future. Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by Adjusted Diluted Average Shares Outstanding. Incrementals/Decrementals are defined as the change in Adjusted EBITDA versus the prior year period divided by the change in revenue versus the prior year period.Ingersoll Rand uses Free Cash Flow to review the liquidity of its operations. Ingersoll Rand measures Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures. Ingersoll Rand believes Free Cash Flow is a useful supplemental financial measures for management and investors in assessing the Company’s ability to pursue business opportunities and investments and to service its debt. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of our liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities.Management and Ingersoll Rand’s board of directors regularly use these measures as tools in evaluating the Company’s operating and financial performance and in establishing discretionary annual compensation. Such measures are provided in addition to, and should not be considered to be a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable measures under GAAP. In addition, Ingersoll Rand believes that Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Incrementals/Decrementals and Free Cash Flow are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of issuers, many of which also present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, and Free Cash Flow when reporting their results in an effort to facilitate an understanding of their operating and financial results and liquidity.Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as alternatives to revenue growth, net income, diluted earnings per share or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Free Cash Flow have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing Ingersoll Rand’s results as reported under GAAP.Reconciliations of Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Free Cash Flow to their most comparable U.S. GAAP financial metrics for historical periods are presented in the tables below.Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures related to full year 2023 guidance have not been provided due to the unreasonable efforts it would take to provide such reconciliations due to the high variability, complexity and uncertainty with respect to forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including net income (loss) and adjustments that could be made for acquisitions-related expenses, restructuring and other business transformation costs, gains or losses on foreign currency exchange and the timing and magnitude of other amounts in the reconciliation of historic numbers. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.INGERSOLL RAND INC.

Once all installations are completed, the projects are anticipated to benefit over 40,000 people in more than 60 communities in the Mexican states of Baja California, Sonora, Michoacan, Chiapas, Oaxaca, Veracruz and Morelos.With more than 20 years of experience working with underserved populations across Mexico, Fundación Mozcalti's mission is to empower vulnerable communities in Mexico with a focus on education, health, basic needs and social entrepreneurship.In late 2022, a group of Sempra employees volunteered their time to help Fundación Mozcalti install the cleaner cookstoves and other clean energy assets in communities across Baja California, Mexico.""It is incredibly meaningful to know Sempra Foundation has helped expand energy access in under-resourced communities,"" said Lisa Larroque Alexander, director and chair of Sempra Foundation. ""Through our support of these communities, we are helping shape a healthier, more prosperous and cleaner future for all.""The collaboration between Sempra Foundation and Fundación Mozcalti began in 2021 with a nearly $500,000 donation that supported the installation of 2,400 cleaner cookstoves in dozens of remote communities across Mexico where cooking often occurred over open fires. Sempra Foundation donated an additional $600,000 to Fundación Mozcalti in 2022 to help provide another 2,400 cleaner cookstoves for households in remote Mexican communities. In comparison to the cleaner cookstoves, cooking over an open fire creates more emissions, is more expensive, and can cause negative health effects including respiratory illnesses and vision problems. These new stoves are also portable and can be used to prepare food to be sold at local markets - serving as a source of income and economic prosperity for families and communities in these areas.Story continuesSempra Foundation and Fundación Mozcalti also launched a biodigester pilot program in 2022 with the installation of two types of biodigesters. The first type of biodigester is a small, household backyard system that allows individual households to turn food scraps and waste into cleaner cooking gas and rich fertilizer. The second type of biodigester is used for small business, restaurants, farms and community centers that serve as soup kitchens.In addition to biodigesters, solar-powered refrigerators are planned to be provided to multiple community centers and solar energy are planned to be installed at community water pumping stations in Morelos, Mexico. Currently, families in the community pay a monthly fee to access water for one hour once a week. The solar installation pilot project is designed to offer families greater access to affordable, reliable water.Sempra Foundation received the Empresa Socialmente Responsable award from the Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP) in Mexico for its efforts to improve the lifestyles in communities in and around Mexico.About Sempra FoundationFounded by Sempra in 2007, Sempra Foundation has long been focused on investing its energy and resources into efforts that make a real difference for people when they need it most. It encourages community engagement among the 20,000 employees who work for Sempra and its operating companies by matching certain employee contributions of time and money to any eligible 501(c)(3) charitable organization they choose to support. Sempra Foundation logo (PRNewsfoto/Sempra) CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sempra-foundation-helps-bring-cleaner-cookstoves-to-indigenous-and-environmental-justice-communities-across-mexico-301751412.htmlSOURCE Sempra Foundation]"
249,22a77ac4-eb06-328a-b625-82de575bcdad,SRE,2023-02-21,4 Utilities Set to Surpass Estimates This Earnings Season,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-utilities-set-surpass-estimates-125112610.html,1676897472,STORY,"['SRE', 'EIX', 'DTE', 'NI', 'NIMC']","[Per the latest Earnings Preview, the Zacks Utilities sector’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings are expected to improve 3.1% on the back of revenue improvement of 3.1%. The capital-intensive utility stocks were impacted by the ongoing increase in interest rates and rising operating costs, while cost management, customer growth, systematic investment to strengthen infrastructure to increase the resilience of the system and new rates implemented in their service territories boosted revenues.With the assistance of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified four utilities, namely NiSource NI, Sempra Energy SRE, Edison International EIX and DTE Energy DTE, which are poised to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in fourth-quarter earnings. These stocks have the ideal combination of two ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) — to surpass expectations. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.A few large utilities, like NextEra Energy, Dominion Energy and Duke Energy, among others, have already reported an earnings surprise in their respective releases.Factors That Likely Impacted Q4 ResultsDomestic-focused companies operating in the sector are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. New rates and customer additions are creating fresh demand as well as assisting the utilities. Investment in strengthening the infrastructure is allowing utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings.Domestic-focused operations also insulate utilities from the adverse impact of currency fluctuation. Mergers and acquisitions in the utility space allow utilities to expand operation, make essential investment to upgrade old infrastructure and extend quality services to new customers, thus boosting revenues.Capital-intensive utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations, and are capital-intensive in nature. The performance of the utilities is likely to have been adversely impacted by the increase in interest rates from near-zero levels. The ongoing increase in borrowing costs and the possibility of more interest rate hikes this year may have further pushed up capital servicing expenses and adversely impacted earnings.Utilities have been focused on improving productivity and their cost structure through investments in digital technologies, integrating key systems and analyzing data to make proper decisions to improve overall operations. The utilities have been educating customers relating to the proper usage of electricity to reduce utility bills and things to do during emergencies to reduce damage.The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is likely to have supported and accelerated utilities’ transition toward clean energy sources. IRA has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for renewable sources usage. The Act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions, in a much predictable way, for a long time and will create earnings visibility.Story continuesExpected Q4 OutperformersNiSource is an energy holding company and together with its subsidiaries provides natural gas, electricity and other products and services in the United States. NiSource remains on track to make capital investments of nearly $15 billion within the 2023-2027 period.

To celebrate the countdown to crunch time in the 2022-2023 UEFA Champions League (UCL) tournament, today Lay's brought global football icon Thierry Henry to the doorsteps of Barcelona's most dedicated football fans to announce the ""No Lay's No Game"" platform – a campaign that surprises fans and confirms that the football watching experience is not only elevated but simply unthinkable without Lay's. No Lay's, No Game""No Lay's, No Game"" is a platform that honors nearly a decade of partnership between the world's favorite chip brand and the UEFA Champions League because there's nothing better than watching a football match at stadiums, at home, or out with friends while sharing a bag of Lay's. Real fans understand that intense matches require the perfect viewing experience. Every second, shot and snack can impact the game's outcome. With stakes this high, ""No Lay's, No Game"" seeks to ensure football fans across the globe know that Lay's has been absolutely essential and there to bring the fun, excitement, and taste to every unexpected, high intensity moment the sport has given us all throughout the years. It's unthinkable to watch football without Lay's. No Lays, No Game.Speaking on the ""No Lay's, No Game"" platform, PepsiCo's Vice-President of Marketing, Global Food Brands, Ciara Dilley, said: ""As the official snack partner of the UEFA Champions League, we understand that a huge part of football culture is the camaraderie created through sharing the experience with friends and the most anticipated guest at the party is always the perfect snack…Lay's Potato Chips. For years, our chips have been an integral part of the football experience, adding to and fueling the passion and intensity fans show for this beautiful game. Without Lay's, there is no game. We are so proud to enlist a legend like Thierry Henry to help football fans across the globe build bonds and to serve as the only snack that makes the game complete. It's unthinkable to watch football without Lay's.""Story continuesHow unthinkable? To launch ""No Lay's, No Game"" the brand partnered with FIFA World Cup France 1998 Champion, Two-Time Premier League Champion, Three-Time FA Cup Winner and 2009 UEFA Champions League Winner, Thierry Henry to make sure fans were match-day ready with their Lay's.In this video titled, ""Thierry Visits"" Henry kicks-off ""No Lay's, No Game"" in a very literal way. The Arsenal and FC Barcelona legend unexpectedly visited Barça fans at their homes to see if they were prepared for the game with plenty of Lay's chips. If they were, the surprising, superstar striker stayed to watch the match, but if they were Lay's-less, he left in search of supporters who were whistle ready.""I've had the privilege of playing all over the world and have lifted many trophies in front of millions of amazing supporters,"" said Thierry Henry. ""None of that prepared them for the utter surprise of me knocking on their doors to watch a match together if they had Lay's crisps. It was especially meaningful to do so in Barcelona where I have so many fans from our 2009 UCL Championship. Partnering with Lay's to kick-off ""No Lay's, No Game"" was all about connecting with the fans and communities that are so dedicated to this amazing game. I had a blast creating this experience with Lay's and my fans who mean so much to me. I hope I helped to ensure that football fans always know that it is unthinkable to watch the big match without Lay's. So, stay ready…you never know when who will pop up next!""Lay's commitment to football extends beyond football watching and door-knocking stunts, though. The brand's Lay's RePlay program helps underserved communities have the access to play the game they love. The award-winning program transforms empty chips bags into football pitches across the globe. Since the first Lay's RePlay pitch launched in 2021, the initiative has provided over 5,000 hours of programming, positively impacting nearly 50,000 community members.Later this year, Lay's is opening multiple new pitches worldwide to enable more inclusion, access and joy to young footballers who might dream to one day compete in the UEFA Champions League.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the Biologics License Application (BLA) for pozelimab as a treatment for adults and children as young as 1 year of age with CHAPLE disease (also known as CD55 deficiency with Hyperactivation of complement, Angiopathic thrombosis and Protein Losing Enteropathy or CD55-deficient protein-losing enteropathy). There are currently no approved treatments for CHAPLE, an ultra-rare and life-threatening hereditary immune disease driven by an overactivation of the complement system. Pozelimab is an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody designed to block the activity of complement factor C5, a protein involved in complement system activation. The target action date for the FDA decision is August 20, 2023.Those living with CHAPLE are unable to regulate complement activity due to mutations in the CD55 gene, a protein regulating the body’s complement system which is a mechanism for destroying microbes. Without proper CD55 regulation, the complement system may attack normal cells, causing damage to blood and lymph vessels along the upper digestive tract and leading to the loss of proteins and to blood cells. In most patients, this process results in a range of potentially life-threatening symptoms beginning in infancy, including abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, vomiting, malnutrition, slow growth, swelling in the legs (edema), recurrent infections, and blood clots. There are fewer than 100 patients worldwide who are known to have CHAPLE.The BLA is supported by results from a Phase 2/3 open-label trial that investigated the efficacy and safety of pozelimab in 10 patients aged 1 year or older. Patients were given a single loading dose of pozelimab 30 mg/kg intravenously on day 1, followed by subcutaneous weekly weight-based doses of pozelimab. At 24 weeks, the co-primary endpoints were achieved with 100% of patients experiencing rapid and sustained normalization of serum albumin (a disease biomarker) and improvement or no worsening of clinical symptoms. Clinical symptoms evaluated, included abdominal pain, number of bowel movements per day, and investigator-assessed facial and peripheral edema. Analyses of secondary endpoints also demonstrated marked reductions in hospitalization days and total number of albumin transfusions, as well as clinically meaningful increases in body weight for age and stature for age. Adverse events (AEs), which occurred in 7 of 10 patients, were limited to those of mild or moderate severity with the most common being iron deficiency, pyrexia, rhinitis, urticaria and vomiting (n=2 each). No AEs led to treatment discontinuation.Story continuesLife-threatening meningococcal infections have occurred in patients treated with complement protein C5 inhibitors and may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. Recommended guidance indicates patients with complement deficiencies should be vaccinated at least 2 weeks prior to receiving a C5 inhibitor. Vaccination reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of meningococcal infections. All patients in the pozelimab trial received vaccination for meningococcal infection prior to treatment with pozelimab.The FDA designated pozelimab for treatment of CHAPLE as a drug for a “rare pediatric disease” in April 2020, with the opportunity for Regeneron to receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher should pozelimab be approved for CHAPLE. Orphan Drug Designation was granted at the same time, which is given to investigational medicines intended for the treatment of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. Pozelimab was also granted Fast Track designation in September 2022, which is designed to expedite the FDA’s review of innovative new drugs that demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. Pozelimab is currently under clinical development for CHAPLE, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About PozelimabPozelimab was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology and is an investigational, fully human, monoclonal antibody designed to block the activity of complement factor C5 and prevent diseases mediated by the complement pathway. It is an IgG4 antibody that binds with high affinity to wild-type and variant human C5.As part of its ongoing development program, pozelimab is also being evaluated in combination with Alnylam’s cemdisiran (siRNAi C5 inhibitor) as an investigational combination therapy for the treatment of other complement-mediated disorders including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and myasthenia gravis (MG). This combination is currently under clinical development, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Regeneron's VelocImmune® TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original, FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent® (dupilumab), Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents, develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases. Founded and led for 35 years by physician-scientists, our unique ability to repeatedly and consistently translate science into medicine has led to nine FDA-approved treatments and numerous product candidates in development, almost all of which were homegrown in our laboratories.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 10 Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks Today.2022 was one of the worst years for the NASDAQ, primarily because it is dominated by tech, and tech stocks crashed as interest rates climbed. The NASDAQ lost roughly more than one-third of its value in 2022. However, in 2023 things seem to have taken an interesting turn. The NASDAQ has been rising and, as of February 17, the tech-heavy index has gained 13.48% year to date.""I Think Growth Comes Back and Tech Outperforms""Is the tech sector making a comeback in 2023? Fundstrat's head of technical strategy, Mark Newton, thinks so. On February 7, Mark Newton appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed why he thinks growth and technology are making a comeback in 2023. Here are some comments from Mark Newton:""There's 3 main things for investors to look at. One is that momentum and breadth have improved substantially in the last couple of months. The second is that, we are in seasonally a very bullish period. Pre-election year seasonality for the first quarter is better than any other of the 16 quarters that make up the presidential cycle. The third is that we continue to see pretty excessive bearish sentiment across the board... The near term sentiment has gotten a little more optimistic. However, if we saw anything from recent reports of investor risk, people are very much on the sidelines and we're seeing very high levels of investor cash. That makes me think that we are in very much a bull market that can continue.""Mark Newton's views are remarkably similar to those of billionaire investor Ken Fisher. Newton thinks that the market bottomed somewhere in October 2022 and now we are in a bull market. Newton thinks that technology, which was one of the worst-performing sectors in 2022, is now making a comeback. Newton supported his thesis by elaborating on how the market has ""gone from extreme pessimism to now skepticism"". While ""we haven't reached bullishness yet"", according to Mark Newton, ""the market's respecting inflation selling off sharply as well as a pivot potentially with the Fed"".Story continuesMark Newton thinks ""both energy and healthcare have a chance of snapping back"". However, he sees tech ""being a phenomenally good sector to position in for 2023"". According to Mark Newton, interest rates will ""continue to come down over the course of the year"" and ""that should fuel growth"". Newton thinks ""growth comes back and tech outperforms"" in 2023, and he also revealed that his year-end target for the S&amp;P 500 is 4,500.Some of the most profitable NASDAQ stocks today are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Let's now discuss these stocks, among others, in detail.25 Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks TodayPhoto by Pascal Bernardon on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe screened for companies trading on the NASDAQ. We considered the annual net income as a measure of a company's profitability. We narrowed down our screen and looked for companies that had a trailing twelve-month net income of greater than $4 billion. We used data from Yahoo Finance to verify each company’s net income and finally picked the 25 companies that had reported the highest annual net income for fiscal 2022. We have ranked these stocks in ascending order of their TTM net income, as of fiscal 2022. Since companies use different fiscal years, we have mentioned the end-date of each company’s fiscal year along with its net income.Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks Today25.

(NASDAQ:REGN) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“There have been some bright spots in our long book. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”23. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 115Net Income (TTM) as of December 31, 2022: $4.49 billionFor the trailing twelve-month period ending on December 31, 2022, Netflix, Inc.

The company reported better-than-expected subscriber additions for 3Q and provided strong 4Q guidance. Netflix added 2.4 million subscribers in the quarter, beating the Street’s expectation of 1.1 million added subscribers, and management guided to 4.5 million subscriber additions for 4Q, above expectations for 4.1 million.We believe that 2022 was an inflection year for Netflix as the company became free cash flow (“FCF”) positive during 1Q22 and FCF should scale from here (management guided to $1 billion FCF for 2022). A combination of strategic initiatives, price increases and a stabilization of content investment should position the company for high-single digit annual revenue growth, while driving improved operating margin to more than 25% over the next few years. Revenue grew 6% for 3Q22 and operating margin was 19%, up from 10% in 2018. In addition to its opportunities in TV and movie streaming, the company recently launched a mobile gaming service that opens an additional $100 billion-plus market for future growth.”In addition to tech giants Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:GILD) was the top contributor in the quarter based on positive data released in a study evaluating Trodelvy versus comparative chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The detailed findings increased investor confidence the drug would receive incremental approvals for a broader range of breast cancer treatments. Shares also received a boost on news the TAF patent portfolio for HIV drugs will be extended from the middle of this decade through the early 2030s, thereby lengthening the company’s long-term opportunity in the virology market.”21.

After a qualitative review of Lam Research, we believe the company will face a number of headwinds that could make for an unfavorable risk-reward position, given the highly cyclical nature of its business in a slowing global economy. We are also expecting fundamentals to turn negative as sales and operating profits are poised to decelerate, resulting in negative earnings revisions. While the stock trades at an attractive valuation multiple, we believe that this is more a sign that earnings will decline meaningfully.”20. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 93Net Income (TTM) as of November 30, 2022: $4.75 billionAt the close of the third quarter of 2022, 93 hedge funds were eager on Adobe Inc.

Adobe also has a suite of customer experience products that help other businesses sell more easily to consumers. All of Adobe’s products have high switching costs and sold on a subscription basis.Adobe’s business qualities enable extremely high margins and predictable, recurring revenues. The company had revenues of $17.6 billion in its last fiscal year with operating margins in the mid-30s. The company has also grown revenues at double-digit rates every year since 2015. Despite a good record of investing in its businesses, it still has an excess of cash on its balance sheet. As such, Adobe has returned cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. Since 2015 the company has returned a total of $24.5 billion.”19. Honeywell International Inc.

Charter is not sitting still; the company is adapting via footprint expansion into underserved areas, price-advantaged mobile line growth, and so on.

Throughout 2022, investors became increasingly concerned about a cyclical downturn in semiconductors and pending trade regulations that would restrict the sale of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment to Chinese customers.

Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category.

266,31efdc9c-ec7c-3c55-b55f-1ea56b3d7745,CSCO,2023-02-21,Cisco: Change Systems - Change the World,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-change-systems-change-world-152500377.html,1676906700,STORY,['CSCO'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 20, 2023 / Cisco Systems Inc.Cisco Systems Inc., Monday, February 20, 2023, Press release pictureEvery February 20th, the United Nations invites us to commemorate the World Day of Social Justice to focus on the plight of social injustice throughout the world and to press for improvements and solutions. As Cisco's new Chief Social Impact Officer, I'm honored to say that I work for a company that aligns with that intention every day. Social Justice is integral to Cisco's purpose: to Power an Inclusive Future for All.As we commemorate the day, it's a good opportunity to pause and reflect on our Social Justice journey two and a half years into the five-year commitment we made in 2020.In 2020, the outcry over the tragic murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and others created a growing awareness of systemic racial injustice, oppression, and inequality. This was an inflection point for many companies and a well-intentioned bias towards quick action ruled the day. It was extremely encouraging to see an unprecedented level of corporate commitment to diversity, equity, and justice initiatives, but action without a cohesive business strategy becomes reaction - and that will never be enough to drive lasting change.Cisco took a different approach, working across our company to develop a core set of beliefs to guide us and an initial strategy for bolder action and greater impact. We transformed a longstanding advocacy for social justice into a five-year commitment, backed by US$300 million, the full accountability of our Executive Leadership Team, and the support of our Board of Directors.Over the past 90 days, I've immersed myself in understanding every aspect of our social justice journey. Here are my key takeaways - and some initial thoughts on where we can go from here.Good for the world - good for our businessSocial Justice is woven into the fabric of many aspects of our business. Our strategies are built on our core belief that our social justice actions will drive business value - and that's what makes them so powerful. Many companies have ESG goals, but few push to imbed those goals within the business. Cisco has an Action Office (AO) equal in size to many of our key business functions to lead the strategy and execution of our Social Justice Actions. Our AO brings together people and expertise across every function and region to drive consistent execution, rigor, and accountability.Story continuesOur approach operationalizes our purpose - and it's becoming a key differentiator for our business. A talent magnet. And a reason to stay and grow with Cisco. Analysts are clamoring to learn more - and they're factoring it into their predictions of future value.Moving forward, I'm working with my team - and with leaders across the business - to identify opportunities to communicate powerfully about the impact our work is having on building an inclusive future. Within the next weeks, I'll start meeting with industry analysts and other external thought leaders to ensure we are maintaining an innovative and forward-looking point of view.Change systems - change the worldCisco's 12 Actions for Social Justice were always designed as a cohesive, interconnected strategy to drive impact within our enterprise - across our ecosystem of customers, partners, and suppliers - throughout our communities, and around the world.This is the kind of approach that Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, articulates in the bold vision for philanthropy in the twenty-first century he calls ""From Generosity to Justice"". This groundbreaking philosophy truly resonates with me as it challenges us to consider philanthropy as a tool for achieving economic, social, and political justice. When I came to Cisco, I saw this bold vision was evident in our Social Justice strategies. In essence, Darren Walker's philosophy is that generosity will always be needed - and we will always be investing - but it's an intermediary goal and insufficient in driving long term outcomes. The shift to justice is in eliminating the conditions within a system that only address the symptoms - not the cause - and perpetuate the need for continuous generosity.In other words: To change the world - we must change systems.Consider this in relation to our Action to Commit $150 million to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).Changing systems means we look at the impact we want to create - and the inclusive future we want to power - from a systems perspective. Then, we break down barriers and create opportunities to drive the outcome: Thriving HBCUs leveraging best-in-class technology and modernized infrastructure to provide quality STEM education. Communities bridging the digital divide and creating environments where students and their families are connected and empowered. Students rising to their full power and potential to graduate as the next generation of tech talent. Finding an abundance of highly paid opportunities within the digital economy. Companies rising to their full power and potential through an influx of talent.In the past year, we've completed 40 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) assessments and 16 technology installations at HBCUs and have continued to train students interested in cybersecurity and networking careers at these universities with concrete upskilling programming.That's operationalizing on purpose. That's justice. That's impact - now and for generations to come. The donation was just the beginning.Each of our 12 Actions for Social Justice has this potential. As I move forward in setting my strategic priorities, I'm looking across our Actions to make sure that we're well aligned operationally and continuing to focus on measurable impact and outcomes.From my perspective, we now have some unique opportunities to leverage what we've learned at this point in our journey to expand and improve. To build on a bold and solid foundation - and continue to fuel Cisco's purpose to Power an Inclusive Future for All.Want to learn more?Tune in to Cisco's #TechBeat Podcast where I share insights for equality across the tech industry and cultivating a diverse workforce.Read From Generosity to Justice: A New Gospel of Wealth by Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation.View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/739965/Cisco-Change-Systems--Change-the-World]"
