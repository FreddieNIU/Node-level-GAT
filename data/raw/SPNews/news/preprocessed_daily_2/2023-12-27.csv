Not the holidays – but the election. We’re less than 11 months out from the Presidential vote, and the first primary, the Iowa GOP caucus, is less than 30 days away.', 'Election years are the ‘known unknown’ of the US economy. We know they’re coming, we know the results can change everything, we know that every economic sector will react differently – but we never truly know how those changes will shake out.', 'This cyclical truth of politics and financial markets informs HSBC analyst Rajesh Kumar’s analysis, and he applies it to the biopharmaceutical industry.', 'Laying out the case, Kumar writes, “The year of US elections often can be a source of angst for Biopharma investors, especially with the ongoing drug pricing debate. Given Medicare, empowered by the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), has embarked on the first round of price negotiations, we think 2024 will see a heated debate on the impact of drug pricing on the Biopharma industry’s earnings power… MedTech names could prove to be the least affected by the US election next year, especially given their lower cyclicality in a weak macro environment. Add any interest rate cuts, and the preference for longer duration names could shift investor interest disproportionately into the space.”', 'Meanwhile, against this backdrop, Kumar has singled out two biopharma giants, both large-cap stocks, that present investor opportunities as we head into 2024. We’ve used the TipRanks platform to see what it is about these names that makes them stand out from the pack.', 'Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA)', 'We’ll start with a biopharma firm, Teva Pharmaceutical. This company is best known as a manufacturer of generic drugs – that is, drugs whose patent protections have run out, and can now be manufactured under off-brand labels. The generic drug market is huge – estimated by Statista at more than $410 billion last year, and expected to reach over $600 billion by 2030 – and Teva is perennially counted among the 5 largest drug makers in this important biopharma segment.', 'Teva describes its mission as making the world’s highest quality medicines accessible to the largest possible segment of the public. To this end, the company has the largest product portfolio of any biopharma firm, with more than 3,500 different products available in 60 countries around the world. This portfolio includes a heavy emphasis on generics, but Teva also works to develop wholly-owned new drugs, and engages in partnerships with other drug companies. Teva boasts that every day, some 200 million people globally take a Teva medicine, and that in the US alone more than 1 million prescriptions are filled on a daily basis with a Teva product.', 'The company’s varied pharmaceutical operations are only one note of interest to investors. During 2023, Teva has seen a shakeup in upper management. The company brought on a new CEO in January, and in September announced a new Exec VP for North American Commercial operations.', 'The new management will have its hands full. As Kumar noted in his industry report, election years bring changes for the pharmaceutical industry. Candidates make promises on drug prices, on Federal spending, and on benefit packages for Medicare/Medicaid – and after the election, the winners have to follow through. For a company like Teva, specializing in relatively low-cost generic drug options, this can present a rich field of opportunity as a supplier when new budgets are written.', 'In the meantime, we can take a look at Teva’s last quarterly report, from 3Q23, to see where the company currently stands. Teva reported $3.9 billion in global revenue, up 7% year-over-year and $160 million over the forecast. At the bottom line, Teva’s earnings came in at 60 cents per diluted share, by non-GAAP measures. This figure missed expectations by a single penny per share.', 'As for the HSBC view, analyst Kumar highlights several points to support the bull case. He writes, “We think that the new management may bring change to Teva’s status quo. A more focused approach in the generics business on higher value opportunities should stabilize revenue and a disciplined plan to pay down debt will lower leverage. In addition, the company now has a few promising assets in the innovative medicine business, including AUSTEDO (HSBC estimates peak sales USD2.2bn in 2031) and the next generation TL1A for Inflammatory Bowel Disease treatment, which has shown great market potential. We think external collaboration with branded pharma players such as Sanofi on the innovative assets can bring more margin of safety for clinical development.”', 'Looking ahead, Kumar rates the shares as a Buy, with a $13 price target to suggest a 25% upside in the next 12 months. (To watch Kumar’s track record, click here)', 'The view from the Street on Teva is a Moderate Buy, based on 7 recent analyst recommendations that include 4 to Buy, 2 to Hold, and 1 to Sell. The shares are priced at $10.43, and their $11.83 average price target implies a one-year gain of 13.5%. (See Teva stock forecast)', 'Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)', 'The second stock we’ll look at is from the medical technology, or medtech, segment. Thermo Fisher produces and supplies the multitude of products that research laboratories, especially medical research labs, need to conduct their work. TMO’s own product lines include such items as chemicals and reagents, sampling and testing supplies, scientific instruments, and the software systems that run labs and lab equipment. Thermo Fisher serves clients in any line of work involving laboratory research, and counts academics, medical researchers, government organizations, and research universities among its customer base.', 'As analyst Kumar noted, medical technology firms should face less of a challenge from election year antics. These companies work behind the scenes, and in Thermo Fisher’s case, the customers will still have need of lab equipment and products no matter how the pharmaceutical firms react to the election results – the lab work that underlies medical innovation will continue.', 'Supporting scientific research labs is big business; Federally supported R&D centers were funded to the tune of $26.5 billion in 2022 – and that figure does not include privately funded ventures or international research and development work. Thermo Fisher has a rich field of opportunity, and brought in over $44.9 billion in total revenue last year.', 'This year, however, Thermo Fisher’s revenues are down slightly. For the first nine months of 2023, the company’s revenue total of $32 billion is down 4.4% from the same period last year. A close look at the 3Q23 numbers shows that the $10.57 billion in quarterly revenue was down 1% y/y and missed the forecast by $70 million. On the other hand, the company’s earnings – the non-GAAP EPS – were up 12% y/y to $5.69 per share. This earnings figure was 8 cents per share better than the forecast. Company management attributed the earnings growth to a 200-basis point expansion in operating margins.', 'Turning once again to Rajesh Kumar and the HSBC view, we find the analyst upbeat on Thermo Fisher’s prospects going forward. He says of the stock, “With the potential for a cyclical recovery in the Life Science tools market and one of the better execution stories, we think the company is set for a return to high single-digit (7-8%) organic growth. While the company has re-calibrated market’s expectations down for 2024 towards H2 weighted growth, our analysis of leading indicators and supply chain offers confidence regarding such a return to growth. With a market-leading M&A platform, and more sensible valuations in the tools market, we think the company should be in a strong position to augment such growth with bolt-on deals.”', 'Kumar quantifies his stance with a Buy rating and a $610 price target that points toward a one-year upside potential of 15.5%. (To watch Kumar’s track record, click here)', 'TMO shares hold a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street, based on 22 ratings with a 17 to 5 breakdown favoring the Buys over the Holds. That said, the average price target of $547.80 implies shares have room for only modest growth of 4% for the next year.

Buying dividend-paying stocks and holding them for long periods is still an easy and effective way to realize market-beating gains."", ""Investing in companies that have profits to distribute is a proven strategy. During the 50 years from 1973 through 2022, dividend-paying stocks in the S&P 500 delivered an average annual return of 9.18% compared to just 3.95% for companies in the same benchmark index that didn't offer a dividend."", ""These three dividend payers offer a rare combination of high yields upfront combined with a strong chance to see their payouts rise in the years ahead. Here's how adding them to your portfolio in 2024 could lead to steady payments that keep rising throughout your retirement years."", ""Ever since the Great Recession, America's largest banks mostly stopped lending to middle-market companies regardless of their ability to generate cash and make interest payments. As a result, heaps of capital-starved companies with between $10 million and $1 billion in annual revenue are eager to accept relatively high-interest loans from business development companies (BDCs) like Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC)."", ""In the third quarter, 69% of Ares Capital's portfolio was earning interest at floating rates that grew significantly.

Such diversification has helped the BDC report industry-leading loss rates since its inception in 2004 and will likely allow it to keep meeting its dividend commitments for many years to come."", 'PennantPark Floating Rate Capital (NYSE: PFLT) is another BDC that offers an eye-popping dividend yield.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Carimin Petroleum Berhad's ROE today."", 'ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Carimin Petroleum Berhad ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Carimin Petroleum Berhad is:', '12% = RM24m ÷ RM198m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every MYR1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated MYR0.12 in profit."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""At first glance, Carimin Petroleum Berhad seems to have a decent ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 9.6% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Probably as a result of this, Carimin Petroleum Berhad was able to see a decent growth of 13% over the last five years."", ""As a next step, we compared Carimin Petroleum Berhad's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 13% in the same period."", 'The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is Carimin Petroleum Berhad fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.', ""In Carimin Petroleum Berhad's case, its respectable earnings growth can probably be explained by its low three-year median payout ratio of 19% (or a retention ratio of 81%), which suggests that the company is investing most of its profits to grow its business."", 'Besides, Carimin Petroleum Berhad has been paying dividends over a period of nine years. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders.', ""On the whole, we feel that Carimin Petroleum Berhad's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. If the company continues to grow its earnings the way it has, that could have a positive impact on its share price given how earnings per share influence long-term share prices. Let's not forget, business risk is also one of the factors that affects the price of the stock. So this is also an important area that investors need to pay attention to before making a decision on any business.

The news was reported by Bloomberg.In an interview, Alberto Tamura, the CEO of Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co., said, “This could be the highest ever revenue year.” Notably, Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities is a joint venture between Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. MUFG.MUFG bought a 20% stake in Morgan Stanley in 2008, following which, Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities and Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities were set up.Tamura added that the joint ventures between MS and MUFG are likely to find more areas of collaboration in Japan and elsewhere but there is no plan to fully merge the two firms.In recent months, the Bank of Japan has taken measures to liberate the debt market from years of its control, which has cheered investors in the region. The policy tweaks have helped breathe life into Japan’s once-sleepy government bond market, generating more trading business for various firms.In addition to this, growing expectations that the central bank will scrap negative interest rates next year are likely to spur client activity in the nation.This is the first time since May that asset managers have turned bullish on the yen on expectations that the Bank of Japan will end its ultra-easy monetary policy in 2024.Recently, Bank of Japan’s governor Kazuo Ueda said that the chances of achieving the inflation target have been gradually rising. Bank of Japan would consider changing policy if prospects of sustainably achieving the 2% target increases “sufficiently.”Ueda added, “If the virtuous cycle between wages and prices intensifies and the likelihood of achieving our price target in a sustainable and stable manner rises sufficiently, we will likely consider changing policy.”If Morgan Stanley, together with MUFG, can record what it expects in Japan, it will reach its goal of overtaking Nomura Holdings as the top broker in the country.Tamura said, “I think we are going to be in a position to become the top securities firm in Japan.”Over the past six months, MS shares have gained 9.5% compared with the industry’s 15.1% rally.', '\xa0', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', '\xa0', 'Currently, MS carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Growth in the utilities and industrial end markets is boosting the Water Infrastructure segment’s performance.

XYL acquired mission-critical water treatment solutions and services provider, Evoqua, in May 2023.

More impressive, Fluor's annual earnings are forecasted to soar 188% this year to $2.35 per share versus $0.82 a share in 2022. Plus, FY24 EPS is expected to expand another 12%."", 'Furthermore, over the last quarter, FY23 earnings estimate revisions have now soared 18% while FY24 EPS estimates are up 4%.', ""Making Fluor's stock a very sound investment is that the company's valuation is reasonable considering its growth prospects. At 16.6X forward earnings, Fluor's stock trades at a 31% discount to the Zacks Engineering-R and D Services industry average of 24.1X with some of the other notable players in the space being AECOM ACM, Altair Engineering ALTR, and Sterling Infrastructure (STRL)."", ""Fluor's stock also trades nicely beneath the S&P 500's 22.2X. More enticing is that Fluor shares trade well below their decade-long high of 41.8X forward earnings and at a slight discount to the median of 17.4X."", ""Notably, Fluor's price-to-sales ratio of 0.43X is comfortably below the optimum level of less than 2X with its industry average at 1.4X and the S&P 500 currently at 3.9X."", ""Fluor's stock has risen +7% in the last two months seeing strong momentum after third quarter earnings of $1.02 per share most recently crushed the Zacks Consensus of $0.52 a share by 85% in early November."", ""This led to Fluor raising its full-year EBITDA and adjusted EPS guidance with shares now up +13% in 2023.

In addition to its strong buy rating, Fluor\'s stock currently has an overall ""A"" Zacks VGM Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth and Momentum.', ""Investors who haven't taken notice may want to do so as Fluor's stock hit 52-week highs of $40 a share last week and looks poised to reach higher highs."", 'Although many stocks have started to participate in the broader end-of-the-year rally, Align Technology looks like one to avoid right now.', ""Mostly attributed to a weakening outlook, it's noteworthy that Align Technology's Zacks Medical-Dental Supplies Industry is currently in the bottom 7% of over 250 Zacks industries."", ""Despite the company's favorable long-term prospects as a provider of Invisalign clear aligners for the treatment of malocclusions or the misalignment of teeth, Align Technology's stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and the Bear of the Day."", ""Considering most of Align Technology's +28% year-to-date gains came over the last month its stock certainly looks do for a correction or pullback as earnings estimate revisions are still noticeably lower in the last 60 days."", 'Fiscal 2023 earnings estimates are down -3% over the last two months from $8.77 per share to $8.42 a share. More concerning, FY24 EPS estimates have dropped -9% from $10.33 per share to $9.40 a share.', ""With a current stock price of $270, Align Technology's valuation doesn't support its extensive rally over the last month trading at a 32.5X forward earnings multiple which is now noticeably above its industry average of 20.3X and the S&P 500's 22.2X."", ""Furthermore, Align Technology's price-to-sales ratio of 5.4X is uncomfortably above the optimum level of less than 2X and a very stretched premium to its industry average of 0.4X and even the S&P 500's 3.9X."", ""Undoubtedly, investors are hoping the end-of-the-year rally can continue for the broader stock market but the recent spike in Align Technology shares appears to be overdone. It may be wise to fade the rally in Align Technology's stock or stay on the sidelines until better opportunities present themselves."", 'The biotech sector took a beating in 2023. Rising interest rates and inflation, global supply chain constraints, recent bank failures and ongoing conflicts due to Russia-Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas wars increased broader economic uncertainty.', 'New drug approvals, pipeline progress and an increase in M&A activity were some of the positives in the sector in 2023.

At the time of granting accelerated approval, the FDA approved the therapy for use in patients aged 4 through 5 years. Sarepta intends to submit a regulatory filing with the FDA soon.', 'Sarepta commercially launched Elevidys in third-quarter 2023. Despite the setback in the EMBARK study, the company recorded $69.1 million in sales, which is encouraging for a newly-launched treatment.', 'Apart from Elevidys, Sarepta is working to introduce new gene therapy treatments in its portfolio. In this regard, it started two separate early-stage studies on novel gene therapy treatments targeting different muscular dystrophies, namely Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) type 2E/R4 and LGMD2B/R2 (dysferlinopathy).', ""sSarepta currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

But the technology-heavy index has mounted a spectacular rebound in 2023, soaring 44% year to date. And history says that upward momentum could continue in 2024.', 'Excluding 2022, the Nasdaq suffered a calendar-year decline exceeding 10% only eight times since its inception in 1971. Those events were generally followed by two strong rebound years. Specifically, the index returned an average of 16% during the year immediately following a double-digit decline and returned an average of 15% during the subsequent year.', ""In other words, the Nasdaq Composite should climb about 15% in 2024 if its performance aligns with the historical average. That upward momentum could push the values of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) above $2 trillion, meaning both companies would join a club that's currently exclusive to Apple and Microsoft."", ""Of course, past performance is never a guarantee of future returns, but Amazon and Alphabet are worth buying today, regardless of what happens next year. Here's why."", 'Amazon currently has a market capitalization of $1.6 trillion. That figure would need to increase 25% over the next year to reach $2 trillion by the end of 2024.', 'History says that outcome is well within the realm of possibility. Amazon stock returned 82% year to date. But even if those gains fail to materialize, Amazon is still a smart long-term investment, given its strong presence in three large markets: e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing.', 'Amazon operates the most-visited e-commerce marketplace in the world and accounts for 38% of online retail sales in the U.S., more than the next nine competitors combined. That tremendous ability to engage shoppers and source data helped Amazon become the third-largest ad tech company in the world. Additionally, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest provider of cloud infrastructure and platform services (CIPS), due to the unparalleled breadth and depth of its portfolio.', 'That last point is especially significant. As the CIPS leader, Amazon should benefit greatly as businesses invest in artificial intelligence (AI). To quote Argus analyst Jim Kelleher, ""AWS is uniquely positioned in the burgeoning AI-as-a-service market."" To further reinforce that point, consultancy firm Gartner recently recognized AWS as a leader in cloud AI developer services, citing a greater ability to execute than any other vendor.', 'AWS is leaning into that leadership with Bedrock and CodeWhisperer. Bedrock is a cloud service that helps businesses build custom generative AI applications, and CodeWhisperer is an AI-enabled productivity tool that automates portions of the coding process to accelerate software development. Ultimately, those products could help AWS reinforce its leadership in the cloud.', 'Retail e-commerce sales are forecast to increase at 8% annually through 2030, digital ad spending is expected to grow at 10% annually through 2032, and the cloud computing market is projected to expand at 14% annually through 2030. In that light, Amazon has a good shot at low-double-digit revenue growth for many years to come, a reasonable estimate, given that revenue increased at 16.8% annually over the last three years.', 'Moreover, that estimate makes its current valuation of 2.9x sales look quite reasonable. So patient investors should feel comfortable buying a small position in this growth stock today.', 'Alphabet currently has a market capitalization of $1.8 trillion. That figure would need to increase 11% over the next year to reach $2 trillion by the end of 2024.', 'History says that outcome is plausible. Alphabet stock returned 60% year to date. But even if its market capitalization falls short of $2 trillion by the end of 2024, Alphabet is still a worthwhile long-term investment, given its strong presence in two large markets: digital advertising and cloud computing.', 'Alphabet subsidiary Google effectively positioned itself as the gateway to the internet. It owns six products that serve more than 2 billion users, including the most popular search engine (Google Search) and the leading web browser (Chrome). Google has a profound ability to collect consumer data, which makes the company an irreplaceable ad tech partner for many brands. Indeed, Google will account for nearly 29% of digital ad spending in 2023, more than the next two competitors combined.', 'Beyond advertising, Google also has a strong cloud computing business. Google Cloud Platform ranks third in CIPS revenue, behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, but its market share increased four points to 11% in the last three years. One reason for those share gains is AI expertise. Gartner recently called Google a leader in AI research, and consultancy firm Forrester recognized its leadership in AI infrastructure services.', 'Alphabet is leaning into AI to drive growth across its digital advertising and cloud computing businesses. For instance, Google added generative AI capabilities to Google Ads to automate marketing workflows like media content creation and copywriting. The company also added support for generative AI to Vertex AI, its cloud platform for training machine-learning models.', 'Digital ad spending is forecast to increase at 10% annually through 2032, and the cloud computing market is expected to grow at 14% annually through 2030. That gives Alphabet a good shot at low-double-digit revenue growth for many years to come, a reasonable estimate, given that revenue increased at 20% annually over the last three years.', 'In that context, its current valuation of 6.2x sales (a discount to the three-year average of 6.4x sales) looks reasonable. Patient investors should feel comfortable buying a small position in this growth stock today.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It's also unclear if Tesla will remain the undisputed leader in electric vehicles a decade from now, especially as so many companies are trying to take market share."", ""And unlike companies like Nvidia and Microsoft that directly benefit from artificial intelligence (AI), Tesla has moonshots that simply haven't materialized."", ""The history of Tesla is riddled with starkly contrasting opinions on whether it is grossly overvalued or is the greatest company ever. And there's a good chance that its future will also face breakout potential or a lot of room to collapse. But what I like about Tesla is that it has a good setup for 2024 and beyond. There are specific things to look for that could support or take away from the investment thesis."", ""In the short term, Tesla needs to prove it can fund its long-term growth plans even during a downturn in the business cycle. Tesla's long-term success depends on increasing production, achieving massive scale, and then unlocking pricing power to make vehicles more efficiently than the competition, and therefore, win on quality and quantity. It already has this advantage now. But to preserve it, Tesla will need to build more factories and manage its extremely complex supply chain."", 'In the longer term, Tesla will need to monetize its AI and robotics investments. If it makes a leap in self-driving, it could open the door to the coveted robotaxi market, which could completely reimagine ride-sharing and deliveries.', ""The company's decision to slash prices and take a hit to its margins to focus on volume looks bad now. But it could end up being a brilliant move if it discourages other automakers from ramping up EV spending, leaving Tesla to extend its lead over the competition. After all, if Tesla shows it has immense pricing power and can afford to undercut the competition, that may deter companies from going toe-to-toe with Tesla at the risk of losing billions in the process."", ""In this vein, there's a path for Tesla to either sustain its production growth, recover its margins, or both in 2024. If that happens, the stock could do very well next year. But even if Tesla's performance stalls in the near term, it still has so much potential upside that simply can't be ignored. Even more than margin or volume improvements, investors should monitor Tesla's self-driving progress in 2024."", 'Apple stands out as the ""safest"" Magnificent Seven stock. It has the best valuation, especially considering the company\'s relentless stock repurchase program. Buybacks decrease the outstanding share count, boost earnings per share, and make the stock a better value even if it doesn\'t grow earnings organically.', ""Apple is also conservative with its spending. It doesn't chase growth just for the sake of it. Instead, it has a purposeful product development pipeline. So if the market does sell off or valuations compress across industries, then Apple will be in an excellent position to deploy some of its cash on a timely acquisition."", 'Apple is unique because it can thrive when the economy is doing well and consumer spending is high. But it also has a nice margin of error in case things take a turn for the worse.', 'Apple has a 31.5 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio compared to 33.3 for the Invesco QQQ Trust, which mirrors the performance of the 100 largest Nasdaq stocks. Apple is a higher-quality company than the rest of the Nasdaq 100, even with lower growth. And for that reason, it looks like a good value heading into 2024.', ""Like Tesla, Microsoft has a clear setup for 2024. At just about every investor event or presentation this year, Microsoft would make sure you knew just how much it was investing in AI and how big of an opportunity it was. Even if the rhetoric is over the top at times, Microsoft is correct in that it has its finger on the pulse of the consumer and business community. It is implementing AI across its products and services. And because it can monitor the reception of these updates, it can see what is and isn't working and then make adjustments."", 'Microsoft is a straightforward and easy-to-understand AI play. In many ways, its solutions are nothing groundbreaking. One example is Microsoft Copilot, which act as an assistant in an application to make it easier to use and let the user accomplish tasks faster.', 'The company generates tons of free cash flow, has an impeccable balance sheet, and can fund both near-term and long-term AI investments with the wiggle room to take risks and make mistakes. Microsoft has a balanced risk/reward profile when it comes to investing in AI.', ""Understanding the market's attitude toward a theme or industry at a given time can help you make wise investment decisions."", ""It wasn't long ago, just last year in fact, that many investors wanted nothing to do with Amazon because of its slowing growth and overspending. Or with Alphabet, because the only good use of its cash seemed to be buybacks. Or with Tesla, because consumer spending was crashing in the wake of higher interest rates and EV competition was getting more ruthless."", 'Meta Platforms was left for dead after the market thought Instagram was losing market share and the company was wasting money on the Metaverse. Even Nvidia crashed as investors thought the cyclical slowdown would damage the growth trajectory. Microsoft and Apple held up better last year, but mostly because they have lower valuations and wider moats.', ""This is all to say that sentiment can change in an instant. And that's exactly what happened in 2023."", ""Anything can happen in 2024. As it stands now, there are only three Magnificent Seven stocks that look like good buys. But if there's a major market sell-off or a prolonged bear market, all seven companies are worth a closer look."", 'The secret lies in finding which ones you like the best and having the conviction to step in and buy those stocks, even when the market wants nothing to do with them.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, the S&P 500, which is widely considered to be a better gauge of overall U.S. stock-market performance, has produced a total return of about 26% for the year. So, while even the worst performer in the Dow might not seem like it had a terrible year (especially when compared with many stocks' 2022 performance), these stocks were significant underperformers in an overall very good year for the market."", ""To be sure, a lot of the underperformance can be attributed to factors that aren't company specific. For example, the energy sector itself was one of the worst performing parts of the stock market, and oil prices were down by about 5% for the year, which fueled Chevron's underperformance."", ""Plus, value stocks (which all three of these are) generally underperformed growth stocks in 2023, as the latter rebounded sharply from a rough 2022 and fueled the S&P 500's strong gains. In fact, the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: VUG) delivered a 47% total return for investors in 2023.

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price.

And if you believe that the stock is really worth $474.05, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Synopsys’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.', 'Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price.

He’s afraid of what comes next",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/peak-tv-revolution-curdled-wasteland-130000182.html,1703595600,STORY,['NFLX'],"['In cementing its dominance in streaming over the past decade, Netflix produced hit shows, signed up almost 240 million subscribers, and minted new franchises—the Holy Grail of Hollywood success. At the same time, the company became the entertainment industry’s grim reaper. First, as a DVD mailer, it accelerated Blockbuster’s demise. Then it upended Hollywood, thrusting cable television and movie studios into existential crises of their own.', 'Peter Biskind, a long-time entertainment journalist and cultural critic, chronicled in previous bestsellers Hollywood’s groundbreaking New Wave of the 1970s (in Easy Riders, Raging Bulls) and the indie cinema movement of the 1990s (in Down and Dirty Pictures). Now he’s back with Pandora’s Box, a sweeping narrative that begins with HBO’s disruption of broadcast television all the way through the streaming wars and Netflix’s history from a provocative tech upstart that ushered in binge-watching and ad-free television, to now, as an industry leader pushing for the widest audience possible—just like the television networks it displaced as American cultural powerhouses.', 'Throughout the book Biskind argues that appealing to broad audiences leads to lackluster shows and movies, which, in turn, drives away viewers. Once that happens few entertainment companies, whether traditional powerhouses like Hollywood studios or new age streamers like Netflix, can keep audiences for long. “As Netflix, for example, plays itself out and becomes unwatchable, something will replace it,” Biskind tells Fortune.', ""Streamers like Netflix, Max, and its various other competitors have replaced networks, he believes. “The difference between streaming and the networks is crumbling because a lot of shows are moving back and forth between networks and streaming,” Biskind tells Fortune. “This attempt to find the biggest streaming audience is deleterious to content and they're restructuring some of these companies like Netflix in the image of Hollywood studios and the networks, and I think all that is bad news.”"", 'Streamers, according to Biskind, are trying to outmuscle each other in the hyper-competitive streaming business. This constant one-upmanship hasn’t yielded better movies or more “prestige TV,” as Biskind might have hoped, but rather a race to the middle toward entertainment that doesn’t offend.\xa0\xa0', ""“It used to be, ‘Let the creators do whatever they want,” Biskind says. “Now it’s, ‘Get the biggest audience possible and beat our competitors.’ That's a big, big difference. And the way you get a big audience is to create shows that don't antagonize people. It's more important to not antagonize people than it is to appeal to people. So, the sharp edges get sanded down.”"", 'That approach recalls the bland, family-friendly network TV content of the 1950s and ‘60s. Even during the golden period of cable television, which HBO ushered in with The Wire and The Sopranos, television studios and executives had to be cajoled, convinced, and at times even forced to accept that audiences wanted to watch a radically new form of entertainment. Namely, it was one in which the good guys didn’t just lose, but were largely absent from the story altogether.', 'Biskind recounts how AMC, after making the hit show Mad Men that minted new stars such as Jon Hamm and Elizabeth Moss, was “ambivalent” about taking a chance by greenlighting Breaking Bad. Over its five-season run, Breaking Bad would go on to win 16 Emmy’s and inspire a fandom that was equal parts reverential and rabid. The prevailing ethos, according to Biskind, seemed to be “why test our luck” with another edgy show.', 'In speaking to people who worked at AMC at the time, Biskind, was “surprised they were so frank that they hated their superiors—the executives above them—so vehemently” and considered them “pretty much morons.”', 'And this was one of the networks considered to be a leader of the peak TV movement in entertainment.', 'The streamers, Netflix in particular, took a different approach. Eager to test the waters of creating its own original series, Netflix welcomed creators who wanted to make taboo-busting shows. Among the most high-profile early releases was Orange is the New Black, about a women’s prison, and House of Cards, about a corrupt D.C. politician. Both shows appeared to be successes after being warmly received by critics. Their respective first seasons earned 21 Emmy nominations between them. But since Netflix didn’t release viewership numbers or ratings at the time, it was difficult to gauge their popularity. (Earlier this month Netflix released viewership numbers for the first time, showing the most watched shows from the first half of the year).', 'Even executives at Netflix’s competitors didn’t quite realize its ambition or how appealing consumers would find the prospect of seemingly infinite content. Former Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said early on that “Netflix posed no more of a threat than the Albanian army,” Biskind writes in Pandora’s Box. Netflix’s own executives were equally “myopic,” according to Biskind, failing to realize that the runaway growth of their business would attract competitors from both legacy movie studios and the tech industry. That hubris was immortalized when, in 2017, then Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said the streamer’s competition was sleep, which people staved off during late night binges of shows they were “really dying to watch.”', ""“That's far from the truth,” Biskind says."", 'He points to the rise of competitors from Disney, Paramount, and HBO parent company Warner Bros. Discovery, along with tech giants Apple and Amazon. All of them now compete for the same audience.', 'As more companies entered the fray the shows they produced changed, becoming more sanitized and taking fewer creative risks. That translated into characters portrayed in their shows. “The social implications of anti-heroes were very radical in the sense that the necessity of being an anti-hero meant breaking rules,” Biskind says. “And breaking rules implied that the rules of society favor the rich and powerful, and if you really wanted to get ahead, you had to break those rules. If you wanted to survive, you had to break those rules. Once the anti-hero disappears, you get this comfort viewing like Ted Lasso,” a reference to the hit Apple+ comedy about a perpetually upbeat soccer coach.', 'For tech companies, though, entertainment is just a side business. It’s another throwback to old Hollywood, when studios were merely subsidiaries of larger corporations. In 1948 industrialist Howard Hughes adsorbed RKO Studios into his web of companies, which he eventually sold to a tire company. The trend was perhaps best embodied by the conglomerate Gulf and Western that owned Paramount from the mid-1960s through 1994, on which Biskind focused in his seminal book Dirty Riders and Raging Bulls.', 'The tech companies, Amazon especially, made no secret of using entertainment to spur their core businesses by “turning viewers into shoppers,” as Biskind put it. Amazon’s “new streamer was a hobby, like stamp collecting, whereas streaming was the be-all and end-all for Netflix,” Biskind writes.', 'Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, himself, succinctly spelled out his priorities during a conference in 2016: “When we win a Golden Globe, it helps us sell more shoes.”', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

We believe that strength in Marmaxx is likely to continue aiding the company’s overall sales.The TJX Companies has been witnessing solid momentum in its HomeGoods (U.S.) division, driven by a rise in customer traffic. In the HomeGoods (U.S.) division, the company’s net sales amounted to $2,208 million in the fiscal third quarter, up 13% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.

Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.', 'Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize any of the strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities arising from the Horizon acquisition, and such benefits, synergies or opportunities may take longer to realize than expected.

A breakdown,\xa0cyberattack or information security breach of our information technology systems could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business.

The S&P 500 index has trended higher by almost 25% this year. It’s difficult to talk about targets for the next year, but I believe the markets will remain in an uptrend as multiple rate cuts are possible. Expansionary policies will not only stimulate economic growth but also inject liquidity into the financial system.', 'As a basic screening, I have looked at stocks to buy that are trading at a valuation gap. This includes growth stocks and blue-chip stocks. In my view, a portfolio of these stocks can potentially deliver 30% to 50% returns over the next 12 months. Further, these stocks are worth holding beyond this initial time horizon.', 'Source: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock', 'Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is one of the more interesting stocks to buy as it has trended higher by 15% in the last month.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'However, if we look at the 12-month chart, NEM stock is has delivered negative returns of 8%. With gold trading near $2,050 an ounce, it’s a good time to buy NEM stock for a bigger rally in the coming quarters. A dividend yield of 3.89% adds to the attractiveness.', 'With an investment grade balance sheet, Newmont has solidified its position as one of the largest gold miners. Further, the company has quality assets that are likely to ensure stable production into the 2040s. With prospects of multiple rate cuts in 2024, the rally for gold might have just started. It would not surprise me with a 30% to 40% rally for this blue-chip stock next year.', 'For Q3 2023, Newmont reported operating cash flow of $1 billion. If gold continues to trend higher, Newmont is positioned to report annual OCF of more than $5 billion in 2024. Cash flow upside will also be supported by the acquisition of Newcrest Mining. Strong cash flows would also imply healthy dividend growth.', 'Source: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com', 'Earlier this year, Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) traded at highs of $47.3. However, with a profit booking driven correction, the stock is trading at $35. I believe this is one of the more intriguing stocks to buy, and I expect LI stock to double from current levels next year.', 'It’s worth mentioning that Li Auto commands a market valuation of $34.3 billion. However, the company holds cash of $12.13 billion as of Q3 2023. Further, in the last quarter, Li Auto reported free cash flow of $1.8 billion. Ultimately, valuations are based on cash flows and from that perspective, Li Auto seems significantly undervalued.', 'Further, with the company having a strong cash buffer, aggressive investment in retail expansion will support growth. The regular launch of new models is another catalyst. Early next year, Li MEGA will be launched and will support deliveries growth. The company is also planning overseas expansion with the first market likely to be the Middle-East.', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com', 'There is a sense of missing out on the rally with Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) stock having surged by almost 400% for year-to-date.', 'I want to point out the fact that RIOT stock was trading above $70 when Bitcoin (BTC-USD) made highs in 2021. It’s very likely that the cryptocurrency will make new highs next year and RIOT is one of the best crypto stocks to buy and a potential multi-bagger from current levels.', 'Of course, Bitcoin trending higher is not the only reason to like Riot Platforms. The company has strong fundamentals and is pursuing aggressive growth plans. In the next 12 to 24 months, Riot is positioned for stellar revenue and cash flow growth.', 'To put things into perspective, Riot has cash and digital assets worth $600 million. The company intends to use this cash buffer for aggressive mining capacity expansion. By the end of the year, Riot expects to achieve capacity of 12.3EH/s. Further, by the end of 2025, capacity should surge to 38.1EH/s. This will translate into robust cash flow growth assuming Bitcoin remains in an uptrend.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/Hendrick Wu', 'Miniso Group (NASDAQ:MNSO) stock had a rather sharp sell-off from recent highs of $29.9 to current levels of $19.9. This undervalued stock has a forward P/E ratio of 18.1, making it promising to buy.', 'In addition, the dividend yield of MNSO stock stands at an appealing 2%. Previous peaks for MNSO stock imply a potential 50% upside. There is a high probability of this occurring within the next 12 months.', 'For Q1 2024, Miniso reported healthy revenue growth of 36.7% on a year-on-year basis to $519.6 million. For the same period, the company’s adjusted EBITDA increased by 52.8% to $139 million. EBITDA margin expansion has been a big positive in the last few quarters.', 'It’s worth noting that Miniso continues to open new stores globally. As of September 2023, the company reported 6,115 stores, which was higher by 819 on a year-on-year basis. This is another factor that’s likely to support revenue growth besides an increase in average ticket size. With the initiation of dividends this year and share repurchase, there seems to be ample scope for value creation.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com', 'I had maintained my view in the recent past that Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) stock is deeply oversold. The stock has witnessed a sharp rally of 16% in the last one month.', 'I expect the bullish momentum to sustain next year. ALB stock continues to trade at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 6.8, even after recent gains. ALB stock also offers a dividend yield of 1%.', 'During the year, the downside in ALB stock was driven by lower lithium prices. While the company still expects 30% to 35% sales growth, significant EBITDA margin contraction is on the cards. However, this factor is discounted in the stock.', 'Going forward, I expect lithium prices to stabilize and trend higher. Albemarle has ambitious lithium conversion capacity expansion plans. This will translate into healthy revenue growth and cash flow upside. Considering the company’s strong balance sheet, I expect potential acquisitions to support growth.', 'Source: testing/Shutterstock.com', 'Panasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) is among the nest stocks to buy now considering the valuations. PCRFY stock has remained almost sideways in the last 12 months and trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 7.8.', 'Further, the stock offers an attractive dividend yield of 2.36%. It would not surprise me if it produced 30% to 50% total returns in the next 12 months.', 'The electric vehicle battery maker has ambitious growth plans through 2031. During this period, the company plans to quadruple EV battery capacity to 200GWh. This is one reason to be bullish on the stock. Revenue growth is likely to be healthy in the coming years.', 'By 2029, Panasonic is also targeting to produce solid-state batteries for drones. Of course, these are long term targets, but will have an impact on valuations. Further, being an innovator, I expect Panasonic to remain ahead of the curve even amidst competition.', 'Source: tishomir / Shutterstock.com', 'Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is my top oil and gas pick with the stock having declined by 10% in the last 12 months.', 'An investment grade balance sheet with robust cash flows is a major reason to like Chevron. To put things into perspective, Chevron reported operating cash flow of $9.7 billion for Q3 2023. With the recent acquisition of Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES), cash flows will swell further.', 'It’s not surprising that Chevron is targeting annual capital expenditure of $19 to $22 billion after they complete the acquisition.

This means any downturn in the broader market can be used as a surefire buying opportunity for long-term-minded investors.', 'Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average recently powered to a record close, the growth-driven Nasdaq Composite still sits roughly 7% below its all-time high, which was set in November 2021. In short, bargains are still available for investors willing to seek them out.', ""What's particularly encouraging about investing on Wall Street is you don't need a boatload of money to start growing your wealth. Most online brokerages have completely done away with commission fees as well as minimum deposit requirements. It means any amount of money -- even $200 -- can be the perfect amount to invest."", ""If you have $200 ready to put to work, and you're absolutely certain this isn't cash you're going to need to pay bills or cover emergency expenses, the following three stocks stand out as no-brainer buys right now."", 'The first genius stock to add to your portfolio right now if you have $200 ready to invest is healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), which is better known as ""J&J.""', ""While the iconic Dow managed to climb to a record high in 2023, J&J was mostly left in the dust. Its underperformance can primarily be traced to ongoing litigation that alleges its now-discontinued talc-based baby powder causes cancer. J&J has attempted to settle these roughly 100,000 collective lawsuits on two occasions but had both settlements thrown out in court. This legal overhang has been something of a cement weight tied around J&J's proverbial ankles."", ""However, this litigation isn't as problematic as J&J's stock performance makes it appear. This is one of only two publicly traded companies to sport the highly coveted AAA credit rating from Standard & Poor's (S&P), a division of the more familiar S&P Global. Whatever ultimate settlement puts this litigation in the rearview mirror, J&J's pristine balance sheet and abundant cash flow will be able to handle it."", ""What investors should be focused on is the steady earnings growth that J&J brings to the table. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, J&J had delivered 35 consecutive years of adjusted operating earnings growth. Since people don't get to choose when they become ill or what ailment(s) they develop, demand for prescription drugs and medical devices remains constant in virtually any economic climate."", 'One reason J&J is such a success is its shift toward pharmaceuticals. Even though brand-name drugs have finite periods of exclusivity, they provide substantial pricing power and juicy margins to J&J.', 'Furthermore, you can count on two hands how many CEOs J&J has had since its founding in 1886. Continuity in key leadership positions ensures that strategic initiatives are being implemented properly from start to finish.', ""The cherry on top for J&J is that its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is lower than at any point over the previous 10 years. It's an absolute bargain for patient investors."", ""The second no-brainer stock that's begging to be bought with $200 right now is cybersecurity company Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA)."", ""Shares of Okta were clobbered in October after the company disclosed a breach of its security platform. The company would later admit that all of its clients had data exposed to hackers. Anytime a breach of this magnitude occurs, it's not uncommon for the cybersecurity company in question to lose some of its customers in the short run."", ""But it's also important for investors to recognize that cybersecurity has grown into a basic-need service. No matter how well or poorly the U.S. economy and stock market are performing, hackers and robots don't take time off from trying to steal sensitive data. As businesses continue to shift their data, and that of their customers, online and into the cloud, third-party providers are being relied on more than ever before."", ""Okta is building its niche as a provider of identity-verification solutions. The company's platform is cloud-native and reliant on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to protect its customers. Although the latest breach demonstrates that the platform can be improved, AI and ML will allow Okta's solutions to become smarter and more effective than on-premise tools at recognizing and responding to potential threats over time."", ""What's intriguing about Okta is just how massive the runway is in identity verification. The company estimates its addressable market to be $80 billion, yet it's pacing just an estimated $2.24 billion in full-year sales in fiscal 2024, which is set to end on Jan. 31, 2024."", ""Furthermore, Okta should benefit immensely from its acquisition of Auth0, which completed in early 2022. While the higher-than-anticipated integration costs of this buyout have left a bad taste in investors' mouths, Auth0 will play a key role in gobbling up share in the $30 billion customer-identity market. To add, Auth0's presence will help Okta cross-sell its identity-verification solutions outside the borders of the U.S., which is critical to the company sustaining a double-digit growth rate."", 'The third no-brainer stock to buy with $200 right now is none other than the largest U.S. electric utility by market cap, NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE).', 'Utilities are typically one of the steadiest and least volatile sectors to invest in; but in 2023 the sector was abysmal. A rapid increase in Treasury bond yields encouraged income seekers to pull their money out of utilities and put it to work in low-risk bonds.', 'Additionally, higher interest rates will make future projects and/or the refinancing of existing debt costlier for utilities. NextEra Energy had certainly leaned on cheap capital to finance some of its projects. Higher interest rates could lead investors to question whether NextEra can sustain its superior operating performance.', 'The good news is that both of these concerns look overblown for NextEra. With the Federal Reserve forecasting three rate cuts in 2024, access to future capital will become cheaper, and Treasury bond yields are liable to decline. The latter will make utility stocks more attractive to income seekers.', ""What's far more important is that NextEra's operating performance has shown no signs of deteriorating even amid higher interest rates. As of Sept. 30, the company had 70 gigawatts (GW) of total capacity in operation, with 34 GW deriving from renewables. The 23 GW of capacity generated from wind and 6 GW from solar are high-water marks for all utilities worldwide. Though clean-energy projects can be costly, they've demonstrably lowered NextEra Energy's electricity-generation costs and helped the company generate nearly 10% annual adjusted earnings-per-share growth since 2012."", ""NextEra isn't planning to let off the accelerator anytime soon, either. Between the start of 2023 and end of 2026, the company anticipates bringing 32.7 GW to 41.8 GW of renewables online."", ""Something else for investors to consider is that demand for electricity doesn't change much from one year to the next. Similar to businesses needing cybersecurity protection in any economic climate, homeowners and renters need electricity to power their appliances and potentially their home heating and cooling systems. This means NextEra is going to bring home highly predictable operating cash flow every year."", ""Lastly, NextEra Energy's forward P/E ratio of 17.6 marks its cheapest valuation since 2015. This time-tested company is ripe for the picking by opportunistic investors."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Johnson & Johnson right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Johnson & Johnson, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Johnson & Johnson wasn't one of them.

To skip our detailed analysis of the global meat industry and a brief overview of the restaurant industry in 2023, go directly and see 5 Highest Quality Steakhouse Chains in the US.\xa0', 'According to a market research report by the OECD, the global meat market is estimated to have a total value of 375.9 billion in 2023, and is projected to reach $473.1 billion by 2028, at a CAGR of 4.3%. The next decade is expected to see a rampant growth in the global consumption of meat proteins, projected to amount to more than 14% by 2030 compared to the base period average of 2018-2022. This growth is largely to be driven by rising income and population growth. Furthermore, meat protein availability from beef, pork, poultry, and sheep meat is expected to surge by 5.9%, 13.1%, 17.8% and 15.7% respectively by 2030.', 'However, consumption is expected to take a nosedive in many high-income countries due to changing consumer preferences, greater levels of ageing, and slower growing populations, leading to a diminishing per capita meat consumption and a greater move towards consumption of higher valued meat cuts. One of the primary trends affecting major players in the meat industry like Beyond Meat Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND), Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL), and Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) is a global shift towards poultry, especially in lower income developing countries, owing to a lower price of poultry per unit as compared to other meat. In high-income countries, this shift represents an increasing preference for white meats which are considered much easier to prepare and are widely perceived as being the healthier option. Hence, in global terms, poultry meat is expected to make for more than 41% of all meat sources by 2030, representing a stark increase of 2% compared to the base period. The global shares of other meat products are lower: beef (20%), bacon (34%), and sheep mutton (5%). Furthermore, international meat trade is expected to pick up in countries in Asia and the Near East, where production is unlikely to be sufficient to meet demand.

Consumers will likely get luxurious and tantalizing kinds of meat, like Wagyu beef and bluefin tuna, for extremely affordable, standardized prices all across the world. The report predicts that by 2030, billions of pounds of the global meat supply could be provided by cultivated meat, with further implications for multiple sectors, like some of the  highest quality steakhouse chains in the US.\xa0 Cultivated meat has, in the span of a few decades, grown from a futuristic dream of a handful of academic scientists to a potentially mainstream global meat supply. Instead of relying on animals for meat, or equating different characteristics of plants with animal meat, cultivated meat is produced by acquiring minute samples of animal cells and growing them in a controlled environment. By systematically manipulating cell density and shaping techniques, the resultant product could replace the experience of eating conventional meat.', 'As biological science catalyzes an era of innovation, top players in the industry like Beyond Meat Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND), Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL), and Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) are diverting greater investments in the research and development of cultivated meat sources. They aspire to be able to reduce production cost by more than 99%. With regulatory authorities in the United States agreeing to regulate the product, the industry, which in the present only comprises a meagre handful of startups, was able to generate more than $350 million in investments from companies like Beyond Meat Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND), Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL), and Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN).

However, there are still certain preconditions which need to be met for cultivated meat to turn into a major industry, not including the fact that in order to scale it to even less than 1 percent of the global meat market, there is a need to invest tens of billions of dollars into the product. In this vein, the next decade is likely to entail companies vying to prove commercial viability of the product to the highest quality steakhouse chains in the US by relying on modest market penetration. In order to ensure profitability in the next decade, the industry must deal with potential concerns that arise around any novel food idea whilst ensuring deliciousness at the right price.\xa0', 'Many of the top meat companies like Beyond Meat Inc.

The restaurant industry in the United States is facing a challenging time due to global supply chain constraints and immediate inflationary pressures. Although these issues have shown initial signs of abating, restaurant leaders are expecting expensive increases in labor and input costs over the next five years. Furthermore, as consumer demands continue to morph and evolve, restaurant leaders are under increasing pressure. In this vein, many restaurant chains are building up their revenue growth management (RGM) capabilities to resist potential headwinds and ensure profitability in times of crisis. RGM is an integral ingredient with immense potential for value creation during tough times, becoming incredibly salient during times when cost pressures form an impediment to profitable growth.

We then proceeded to award each chain a cumulative score according to the aforementioned criteria and selected 15 chains which scored the highest points.

TSN appears well-positioned, courtesy of strength in growth pillars. Tyson Foods is undertaking several operational and supply chain efficiency programs to improve itself in the long run. Strength in the company’s brand portfolio bodes well. However, weakness in the Pork segment continues to hurt.Let’s discuss this in detail.', 'Tyson Foods’ growth strategy is based on three main pillars, which include driving growth across the core protein platform. The company expects global demand for protein to continue rising and remains well-placed to cater to it. Management intends to stay focused on merchandising and advertising to support its brands. While Tyson Foods is pleased with its brand strength, it is constantly building innovations to expand the appeal and market opportunities for its products.The company is benefiting from operational enhancements while making incremental improvements in yield and live operations. The company’s ongoing productivity initiatives based on procurement, logistics and digitalization are likely to solidify the company’s fundamentals.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Tyson Foods is investing in capacity expansion and automation technology investments. In this regard, the company continues to accelerate digitalization via supply chain planning and execution processes to enhance customer service. Management is optimizing its plant network by adding fully-cooked capacity, converting plants for value-added production, executing plant flexibility and strengthening the portfolio mix. For the fiscal 2024, management projects capital expenditures to be $1-$1.5 billion. These include spending related to capacity expansion, automation and product and brand innovation.The company continues to evaluate its production footprint and network to fuel efficiencies. In this regard, management shut down six less efficient chicken plants. Tyson Foods also decided to shut down two smaller fresh meat case-ready value-added facilities.TSN is focused on efforts to expand into the international markets as part of its strategic growth plan. Recently, management inaugurated a new fully-cooked food production facility in Danville, VA, worth $300 million. This move is in sync with Tyson Foods’ strategy to fuel sustained growth, enhance operational efficiency and invest in its poultry space.', 'Tyson Foods’ core business lines boast a portfolio of iconic retail brands, including Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, such brands witnessed volume growth of 3.2% year over year, way ahead of other competitors. Management continues to see market share leadership across most retail categories in terms of pound and dollar share gains. The company intends to stay focused on merchandising and advertising to support its brands.', 'Tyson Foods is facing weakness in the Pork segment stemming from supply-and-demand imbalances, which is affecting spreads. Although management is witnessing some improvement in spreads and reduced grain costs, it is still bearing the brunt of the imbalance between the supply and demand of pork. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, sales in the Pork segment fell 7% on reduced pricing amid soft global demand. Segmental volumes dropped 0.2%, while the average price tumbled 6.7%.In its last earnings call, management highlighted that it expects to see higher start-up costs and increased cattle costs, which is likely to impact the first half of fiscal 2024 adversely. Also, rising interest rates and inflationary headwinds remain a concern for the company’s margin performance.Nevertheless, the upsides mentioned above are likely to keep narrating the company’s growth story.

However, with investors always looking to out-beat the market, technology firms, and especially semiconductor companies, provide potential for explosive growth potential. With their innovation and presence in an expanding artificial intelligence market, semiconductor companies present investors with higher risk and reward opportunities. Other than simply AI, other key drivers for this growth can be attributed to the growing demand from electric vehicle companies, communication and data processing centers, and automotive needs among others.Although these companies sometimes are more susceptible to interest rate environments and foreign policy relations with China and the U.S., not investing in these would limit high earnings growth potential. Thus, in this article, we aim to present three semiconductor stocks that should be on your radar as we go through this holiday season and approach the new year.', 'Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com', 'Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a company that manufactures products that contribute to the development of technologies like 5G. The stock is doing well and is up over 25% in the past year.

Its earnings also reflect this future growth with EPS expected to sustain double-digit growth and hit $10.38 by 2025. The company also appears to be relativity undervalued and offers an upside when compared to its competitors and its own historical values. The stock currently has a P/E ratio of 17.02x compared to the sector median of 21.73x. This indicates an over 20% upside in valuation compared to what semiconductor players usually trade for. With this being the case, the stock is a sure watch for investors in the coming months.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Ascannio via shutterstock', 'United Microelectronics Corporation (NYSE:UMC) is a global leader in the semiconductor foundry business and is currently competitively positioned to break into the automotive segment to expand its client base even further. While the current semiconductors climate has taken a blow on many of UMC’s competitors, its relatively strong valuation and innovative strategy to grow off of trends such as electrification and connectivity keep me optimistic about this company.With the global semiconductor foundry market expected to reach a $137 billion market cap in 2022 with a continued CAGR of 8% from 2023-2029, UMC’s amazing valuation sets it up as a top pick for any investor. Currently, its P/E ratio sits at a discounted 9.35x, as compared to its sector median of 21.73x. Its financial profile is just as strong, with its cash and equivalents totaling up to a whopping $5.2 billion as compared to its long-term debt of only $1.15 billion. Furthermore, in spite of the current downturn hurting product margins, UMC has continued to put out comfortable margins of around 30%. With plans to continue building up on its 22nm and 28nm semiconductors, as well as its new strategy revolving around EV, 5G, and AI, this stop is a no-brainer that should be on any investor’s radar into the coming year.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Navitas Semiconductor (NASDAQ:NVTS) is a pioneering force in next-gen semiconductors, making a revolution through integrated gallium nitride and silicon carbide semiconductors.

Yahoo Finance analysts share similar sentiments with a one-year expected price target between a median of $10.54 and a high of $14.NVTS’s most recent earnings report has shown continued excellence.

Now its most recent Q3 earnings show an improvement to a gross margin of 43.1% and a revenue growth up 115% YOY. With an additional $177 million of cash on its balance sheet and zero debt, this company will see no issues in continuing its innovations toward more effective semiconductors.

YTD = year-to-date.', ""For comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has delivered a 15.3% total return for 2023 through Dec. 26. However, the S&P 500, which is widely considered to be a better gauge of overall U.S. stock-market performance, has produced a total return of about 26% for the year. So, while even the worst performer in the Dow might not seem like it had a terrible year (especially when compared with many stocks' 2022 performance), these stocks were significant underperformers in an overall very good year for the market."", ""To be sure, a lot of the underperformance can be attributed to factors that aren't company specific. For example, the energy sector itself was one of the worst performing parts of the stock market, and oil prices were down by about 5% for the year, which fueled Chevron's underperformance."", ""Plus, value stocks (which all three of these are) generally underperformed growth stocks in 2023, as the latter rebounded sharply from a rough 2022 and fueled the S&P 500's strong gains. In fact, the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: VUG) delivered a 47% total return for investors in 2023.

Sure, Walgreens pays a 7.2% dividend yield, but how long can it keep this up, invest billions into developing new healthcare businesses, and struggle to turn a profit?', ""As previously mentioned, Chevron is mainly down because of falling energy prices. However, it is in the middle of acquiring Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES) in an all-stock deal, and there are some political uncertainties surrounding the deal that investors should keep an eye on. Although the stock has fallen this year, it's worth noting that Chevron started 2023 near its all-time high."", 'Johnson & Johnson has had a volatile 2023. The recent results have looked pretty solid in the wake of the spin-off of its consumer-products business as Kenvue (NYSE: KVUE), and its 3.1% dividend yield looks very safe. However, sales for certain key products declined, and Medicare price negotiations remain a big risk factor.', ""One very important takeaway is that these stocks aren't down for no reason. All of them have clear factors weighing on the stock price."", ""That said, I'd personally avoid Walgreens for the time being, at least until the company's cash flow gets back on track. However, Chevron is primarily beaten down because of lower energy prices, and Johnson & Johnson appears to be an excellent business on sale due to some near-term uncertainty.

In short, bargains are still available for investors willing to seek them out.', ""What's particularly encouraging about investing on Wall Street is you don't need a boatload of money to start growing your wealth. Most online brokerages have completely done away with commission fees as well as minimum deposit requirements. It means any amount of money -- even $200 -- can be the perfect amount to invest."", ""If you have $200 ready to put to work, and you're absolutely certain this isn't cash you're going to need to pay bills or cover emergency expenses, the following three stocks stand out as no-brainer buys right now."", 'The first genius stock to add to your portfolio right now if you have $200 ready to invest is healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), which is better known as ""J&J.""', ""While the iconic Dow managed to climb to a record high in 2023, J&J was mostly left in the dust. Its underperformance can primarily be traced to ongoing litigation that alleges its now-discontinued talc-based baby powder causes cancer. J&J has attempted to settle these roughly 100,000 collective lawsuits on two occasions but had both settlements thrown out in court. This legal overhang has been something of a cement weight tied around J&J's proverbial ankles."", ""However, this litigation isn't as problematic as J&J's stock performance makes it appear. This is one of only two publicly traded companies to sport the highly coveted AAA credit rating from Standard & Poor's (S&P), a division of the more familiar S&P Global. Whatever ultimate settlement puts this litigation in the rearview mirror, J&J's pristine balance sheet and abundant cash flow will be able to handle it."", ""What investors should be focused on is the steady earnings growth that J&J brings to the table. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, J&J had delivered 35 consecutive years of adjusted operating earnings growth. Since people don't get to choose when they become ill or what ailment(s) they develop, demand for prescription drugs and medical devices remains constant in virtually any economic climate."", 'One reason J&J is such a success is its shift toward pharmaceuticals. Even though brand-name drugs have finite periods of exclusivity, they provide substantial pricing power and juicy margins to J&J.', 'Furthermore, you can count on two hands how many CEOs J&J has had since its founding in 1886. Continuity in key leadership positions ensures that strategic initiatives are being implemented properly from start to finish.', ""The cherry on top for J&J is that its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is lower than at any point over the previous 10 years. It's an absolute bargain for patient investors."", ""The second no-brainer stock that's begging to be bought with $200 right now is cybersecurity company Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA)."", ""Shares of Okta were clobbered in October after the company disclosed a breach of its security platform. The company would later admit that all of its clients had data exposed to hackers. Anytime a breach of this magnitude occurs, it's not uncommon for the cybersecurity company in question to lose some of its customers in the short run."", ""But it's also important for investors to recognize that cybersecurity has grown into a basic-need service. No matter how well or poorly the U.S. economy and stock market are performing, hackers and robots don't take time off from trying to steal sensitive data. As businesses continue to shift their data, and that of their customers, online and into the cloud, third-party providers are being relied on more than ever before."", ""Okta is building its niche as a provider of identity-verification solutions. The company's platform is cloud-native and reliant on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to protect its customers. Although the latest breach demonstrates that the platform can be improved, AI and ML will allow Okta's solutions to become smarter and more effective than on-premise tools at recognizing and responding to potential threats over time."", ""What's intriguing about Okta is just how massive the runway is in identity verification. The company estimates its addressable market to be $80 billion, yet it's pacing just an estimated $2.24 billion in full-year sales in fiscal 2024, which is set to end on Jan. 31, 2024."", ""Furthermore, Okta should benefit immensely from its acquisition of Auth0, which completed in early 2022. While the higher-than-anticipated integration costs of this buyout have left a bad taste in investors' mouths, Auth0 will play a key role in gobbling up share in the $30 billion customer-identity market. To add, Auth0's presence will help Okta cross-sell its identity-verification solutions outside the borders of the U.S., which is critical to the company sustaining a double-digit growth rate."", 'The third no-brainer stock to buy with $200 right now is none other than the largest U.S. electric utility by market cap, NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE).', 'Utilities are typically one of the steadiest and least volatile sectors to invest in; but in 2023 the sector was abysmal. A rapid increase in Treasury bond yields encouraged income seekers to pull their money out of utilities and put it to work in low-risk bonds.', 'Additionally, higher interest rates will make future projects and/or the refinancing of existing debt costlier for utilities. NextEra Energy had certainly leaned on cheap capital to finance some of its projects. Higher interest rates could lead investors to question whether NextEra can sustain its superior operating performance.', 'The good news is that both of these concerns look overblown for NextEra. With the Federal Reserve forecasting three rate cuts in 2024, access to future capital will become cheaper, and Treasury bond yields are liable to decline. The latter will make utility stocks more attractive to income seekers.', ""What's far more important is that NextEra's operating performance has shown no signs of deteriorating even amid higher interest rates. As of Sept. 30, the company had 70 gigawatts (GW) of total capacity in operation, with 34 GW deriving from renewables. The 23 GW of capacity generated from wind and 6 GW from solar are high-water marks for all utilities worldwide. Though clean-energy projects can be costly, they've demonstrably lowered NextEra Energy's electricity-generation costs and helped the company generate nearly 10% annual adjusted earnings-per-share growth since 2012."", ""NextEra isn't planning to let off the accelerator anytime soon, either.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Analysts.\xa0', 'This year brought a notable shift in the investment scene, where technology stocks surged ahead, overshadowing the performance of dividend-focused equities. Despite this change, experts advise that investors diversify their portfolios across various asset classes to navigate diverse market situations effectively. This strategy aims to ensure resilience against fluctuations and uncertainties in the market, emphasizing the importance of a well-rounded investment approach that goes beyond focusing solely on one sector or type of stock. Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, shared insights on investment strategies in an interview with Bloomberg. Here are some comments from the analyst:', '“It’s clear that having a diversified portfolio is probably the best way to navigate the investment climate and the best way to do that is owning the S&P 500 — full stop. If you were to start this year by saying ‘everyone says there’s a recession coming so I’m going to invest defensively,’ you got punched in the nose.”', 'Dividend stocks faced challenges this year, yet these equities have retained their status as investor favorites over the years due to the exceptional returns they consistently generate. When investing in dividend stocks, investors pay special attention to companies that have raised their dividends for years. This long-standing history of raising dividends signifies stability, financial health, and a commitment to sharing profits with shareholders. The S&P 500 High Dividend Growth Index monitors companies that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 5 years and are expected to continue this trend in the upcoming year. This index has outperformed the S&P 500 since 2010, according to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices. Despite the S&P 500 showing strong performance during this time, the High Dividend Growth Index has not only matched but exceeded it. Over the period from 2010, it has shown an average yearly return of 11.94%, while also offering a notably higher yield compared to the broader market. In addition to this, the S&P 500 High Dividend Growth Index increased its dividend annually by 13.8% between 2010 and 2022. This growth rate surpasses the long-term inflation rate in the US, even considering the recent rise in inflation observed over the last few years.', ""A growing flow of dividends brings unique advantages that might be rare in other investment plans. Firstly, robust dividend growth can boost returns and act as a defense against inflation, similar to an annual salary increase. Companies increasing dividends often see their stock prices rise too. This is because stocks typically follow a company's improving earnings and dividends. In addition to this, reinvesting these increasing dividends speeds up how quickly your investment grows over time through compounding. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, from the end of 1985 to the end of 2022, the stocks in the Russell 1000 Index that consistently increased their dividends showed better performance compared to the broader benchmark. Additionally, these dividend-growing stocks demonstrated lower fluctuations or volatility in their performance during this period."", 'Some of the best dividend growth stocks include Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), \xa0The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and\xa0AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV) as these companies boast a long-standing history of consistently increasing their dividends over many years, making them sought-after choices for those seeking reliable and growing income from their investments.

Net, these headwinds are likely to drive many investors to look for NKE to deliver on innovation-led growth before assigning a more premium multiple to the stock going forward.”', 'The upshot of the above is a lower price target from Roach, which falls from $139 to $135. Still, following the sharp drop, there’s potential upside of 25% from current levels.

The company is a leader in using miniaturized lithotripsy (soundwave) technology to break up heavy calcification in arteries, enabling safer and more effective treatment of cardiovascular disease. Shockwave devices are increasingly being used in both coronary artery and peripheral artery indications, and we see significant room for continued growth in these areas. Meanwhile, the company continues to invest in new products to extend the usefulness of intravenous lithotripsy in other indications, and it is making long-term plans to introduce a novel therapy for refractory angina. Unlike some high growth medical device franchises, Shockwave is already profitable, and we expect its strong top-line growth to support margin expansion. However, despite the positive product cycle momentum, the stock’s recent performance tells a different story. The market appears concerned that the rapid growth of GLP-1 diabetes/obesity drugs will reduce demand for cardiovascular disease management technologies. However, we think the public health benefits of obesity therapies, while real, are unlikely to materially restrain Shockwave’s growth opportunities for many years to come, and we remain invested.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41', 'Palo Alto, California-based BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.

On a day-by-day basis, however, the emotions of fear and greed may dominate stock prices, leading to wild price swings.', ""That conflict between long-term value and near-term prices will occasionally create a situation where ordinary investors can benefit. Sometimes, the market's short-term fear will drive an individual company's share price below its long-term value, allowing investors to buy at a bargain price. When that happens, all you need to do is hold on and wait for the future to play itself out. If those decent prospects turn out to be true, you can profit as the market recognizes its mistake and reprices the company's shares."", 'With that in mind, here are three bargain stocks that you can buy today and may end up worthy of holding on to forever.', 'Prudential Financial (NYSE: PRU) sits atop my list as a top value stock to buy right now. Prudential Financial is an insurance company that cares so much about being financially rock-solid that it uses an actual rock -- the Rock of Gibraltar -- as its corporate logo.', ""Most of the time, that's an awesome place to be, but it caused the company major pains over the past few years as interest rates rose. To support its rock-solid reputation, Prudential Financial carries over $300 billion in bonds on its balance sheet. While those bonds provide higher certainty of cash flows than stocks, they also tend to see their market values drop as interest rates rise."", ""Now that the Federal Reserve has indicated that its rate rising campaign is likely over -- and indeed, that future rate cuts are probably on the horizon -- that rough patch is likely behind Prudential Financial. With its shares trading at around 8 times its projected earnings and those earnings expected to grow by 10.5% annualized over the next five years, the company's shares certainly look to be bargain priced."", 'Add a solid 4.8% dividend yield to its value price, and Prudential Financial starts to look like a bargain-priced stock that will pay you a decent amount to wait for its shares to climb.', ""Diageo (NYSE: DEO) is the British company behind such world-famous alcohol brands as Guinness, Johnnie Walker, Baileys, and Smirnoff. Unlike many companies, Diageo's shares are actually down in 2023, and it's that decline that makes it potentially interesting to value investors today."", ""Diageo's shares command a reasonable 17.5 price-to-earnings ratio, and the company's earnings are expected to increase by about 5.6% annualized over the next five years. While not the cheapest stock on the market, the company's price does appear decently valued for investors with a long-term time frame who are interested in a solid business with decent prospects for the future."", ""In addition to the reasonable valuation, what makes Diageo an attractive potential investment is the fact that the alcohol business tends to be recession resistant. Sure, when money is tight, people may shift from drinking in bars to drinking at home, but they'll still drink. As the alcohol manufacturer -- not the bar -- Diageo will get paid no matter where that drinking takes place."", 'Add a decent 2.7% yield on top of that reasonable valuation and recession-resistant business model, and Diageo shows up as an interesting company to consider for investors with a long-term time horizon.', 'PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) is well known as a digital payments processor, with a substantial part of its business focused on online purchases. It makes most of its money from transaction fees -- and the more transactions move online, the more of those fees it can capture.', ""PayPal currently trades at around 11 times its anticipated forward earnings, and those earnings are expected to grow by more than 16% annualized over the next five years. Unlike the other two companies on this list, PayPal doesn't currently pay a dividend, but its faster growth and still-reasonable valuation make it pop as a potentially bargain-priced business."", ""Of course, PayPal's success does depend on purchases continuing to move online. As long as that trend remains intact, PayPal looks to be value priced for a business with such solid potential growth ahead of it."", ""Whether or not you think Prudential Financial, Diageo, or PayPal might deserve a spot in your portfolio, the reality is that bargains rarely last long in the market. As a result, when you find a business you like trading at a legitimate value price, it's generally a decent idea to make your initial investing decision fairly quickly."", ""If you don't want to go all-in on your investment, it's perfectly fine to only put part of your available money to work while you continue to look into the business. If its shares go up, you'll at least have something invested in a winning decision. But if they go down, you'd still have capital available, should you decide that the lower price just made that bargain business even cheaper."", 'No matter how you go about it, though, today is a great day to go hunting for bargain stocks.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Prudential Financial right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Prudential Financial, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Prudential Financial wasn't one of them.

Nowhere was that more apparent in the auto sector, where the United Auto Workers (UAW) extracted big concessions from the Big Three (GM, Ford, Stellantis) following a six-week standoff in the fall.', 'The ramifications of the ""historic"" contract as the UAW calls it will be felt for years as the Big Three and nonunion automakers come to grips with a new reality of empowered workers. Though there were warning signs, even veteran execs at the Big Three were caught off guard by the strength of labor’s popularity in general, and the UAW\'s unorthodox strategy.', ""Here's how it all unfolded, and what it means for the UAW and the auto sector going forward."", 'It all began in the summer. The Big Three had been preparing for negotiations with the UAW ahead of the expiration of the union’s collective bargaining agreement in mid-September. But this came against the backdrop of unionization efforts gaining steam across the country, putting pressure on companies to respond with big offers, or face the consequences.', ""The Teamsters' negotiations with UPS sent shockwaves through the industry, as well as the labor movement, when a big tentative deal was announced right before a threatened strike. Veteran full-time drivers at UPS will now make $49 per hour by the end of the contract; UPS CEO Carol Tomé said total compensation including benefits for those drivers will be $170,000 per year, up from around $145,000."", 'Jaws dropped in corporate America when the deal was announced; even the meme game was strong depicting UPS drivers living the good life.', 'This followed workers at places like Starbucks, American Airlines pilots, and even REI retail workers trying to capitalize on union strength in America. Not to mention the highly contentious Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and Writers Guild of America (WGA) labor disputes with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) — the “Hollywood” strikes — which were ongoing during the lead-up to the UAW’s contract expiration deadline.', 'Polls, meanwhile, showed a majority of Americans backing the efforts of unions as inflation and interest rate hikes made borrowing costs much higher. US workers blamed employers for not keeping up with the cost of living increases as corporate profits boomed. ', 'This was the lead-up to the Big Three’s stand off with the UAW. But the real X factor was new union president Shawn Fain.', 'Yahoo Finance heard rumblings from one Big Three executive that the auto execs didn’t know what to expect from Fain, who had won by an extremely close vote in March. This executive expected things might be different.', ""He just didn't know how different."", '""This election was not just a race between two candidates, it was a referendum on the direction of the UAW.” Fain said shortly after his election. “For too long, the UAW has been controlled by leadership with a top-down, company union philosophy who have been unwilling to confront management, and as a result we’ve seen nothing but concessions, corruption, and plant closures.”', 'Fain from the outset did things differently. He refused to engage in the traditional handshake that occurs ahead of UAW-Big Three negotiations; auto negotiators also complained that Fain and the UAW team were unresponsive as the deadline approached.', 'Fain took the gloves off. He put the spotlight on the record profits of the Big Three automakers, claiming the companies raked in $29 billion in net income in the first six months of the year. Fain also howled at the rich contracts CEOs like GM’s Mary Barra and Ford’s Jim Farley enjoyed.', '""While Big Three executives got rich, UAW workers got left behind,"" Fain said.', 'With the deadline set for 11:59pm on Sept. 14, it was no real surprise when Fain and the UAW made the late-night call to strike. But what was surprising was the method — the so-called stand-up strikes — meaning the UAW would strike at select plants at all Big Three automakers with limited to no warning.', ""This meant the Big Three couldn't plan ahead for mitigating strike-related shutdowns. And it also was a big deviation from how the UAW operated in the past, where the union picked one automaker to strike at, went through a full negotiation to hammer out an agreement, then used that pattern agreement to secure deals with the other two automakers."", 'Now the UAW was negotiating with all three at the same time.', '“This strike — or rather, escalating simultaneous strikes — is different because of both the energy and intentionality behind it,” said labor expert Veena Dubal, law professor at the University of California, to PBS NewsHour. “Unlike previous UAW leadership who were often criticized for “going along” and “settling cheap,” reformist president Shawn Fain and his team are using escalating tactics, public discussions, and bold demands to draw attention to the extraordinary inequality between bosses and workers.”', 'Negotiations continued for a couple of weeks without any breakthroughs, until a big moment at the end of September. After days of going back and forth, President Biden decided to join the picket lines in Michigan, joining striking UAW members.', 'With the pressure on the automakers rising, and Fain’s continued threats of escalating a strike that was popular (at least among many Americans), it was only a couple of weeks later when Ford upped its best offer, which lead to a tentative agreement. An increase of 25% for top-tier workers, immediate ratification bonuses, bringing more part-time workers into full-time status, and the restoration of COLA (cost of living adjustment) payments were enough to get the deal across the finish line. UAW members at GM and Stellantis approved similar deals shortly thereafter.', 'The immediate financial costs of the UAW strikes on the Big Three were known soon enough. Ford said the strike and ensuing higher compensation meant it would cost the automaker $8.8 billion over the course of the four-year contract, and meant Ford cars on average would cost $800-$900 more. GM said the cost of its contract would be around $9.3 billion over four years.', 'But effects go beyond the Big Three. As if on cue, foreign automakers like Nissan, Hyundai, Toyota, and Honda in recent weeks gave pay hikes for their US workers, none of whom are unionized.', '“Nonunion workers can thank the UAW for their recent pay raises,” said AutoForecast Solutions analyst Sam Fiorani to Yahoo Finance in late November. “It was entirely expected that wages would go up in the face of recent labor changes,” he said, referring to recent wage hikes at nonunion Toyota, Nissan, and Hyundai plants.', 'Which brings us to the EV king in America: Tesla. For years Tesla (TSLA) has mostly avoided the impact of labor strife and unionization at its plants across the globe. But it seems the times, and growing favorable public opinion for workers to get more for the fruits of their labor, have changed the calculus.', 'Late on Thursday CNBC reported that Tesla told workers at its Giga Nevada plant that some battery production workers there will see pay increases of around 10% starting in early January 2024.', 'Labor expert Marick Masters of Wayne State University said what these foreign automakers were doing is part of a deliberate strategy.\xa0“Clearly, such actions by nonunion companies can be viewed as part and parcel of a ‘union substitution’ strategy, which seeks to deter unionization in specific companies by paying workers sufficiently comparable wages,” Masters said to Yahoo Finance.', ""Musk himself said if Tesla doesn't keep its workers happy, they will leave to any number of other similar manufacturing jobs. Though Musk has touted that profit sharing initiatives like stock options have made millionaires of production line workers, the company reportedly just removed stock-based compensation for this year."", ""What's ahead?"", ""Tesla and other nonunion automakers will likely have to do more for workers, or have to fend off unionization efforts. Analysts and investors will be watching to see if these nonunion shops will continue to raise wages and compensation in order to keep their workers happy, or at least keep them at their respective jobs.\xa0Case in point: Current labor unrest in Sweden is giving Tesla headaches, as other unions in the Scandinavian region strike in sympathy with Tesla's Swedish mechanics, who are demanding better pay and working conditions."", ""Whether it comes to pass with Fain and the UAW at Tesla plants in the US, or other foreign automakers operating in America, or even Tesla's international operations, labor unions will likely push their advantage in 2024. And that may dim profit forecasts for automakers already squeezed with massive investments in their EV transformations."", 'Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The three major indices have been on a blistering rally to end the year and have hit new highs on several occasions, buoyed by the tech surge, cooling inflation and the optimism that the Fed is done with interest rate hikes.The Nasdaq Composite emerged as the outperformer, gaining 43.2%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial have risen 23.8% and 12.8%, respectively. The strong trend is likely to continue in the New Year as well.Investors should consider stocks such as VeriSign Inc. VRSN, Block SQ, Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL, W.R. Berkley Corp. WRB, and Eldorado Gold EGO that could be compelling picks to tap the trend.', 'Let’s discuss these events in detail below with the stocks:', 'Technology has turned out to be the most profitable sector in 2023, driven by the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, easing inflation and a surge in “Magnificent Seven” stocks. Additionally, bets that the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hiking campaign might be nearing an end powered the rally in the sector in recent months. As the tech sector relies on borrowing for superior growth, it is cheaper to borrow more money for initiatives when interest rates are low.Investors should bet on the stocks that are yet to catch up with the broader sector rally. These stocks have a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), a strong VGM Score of B or better, and a positive earnings growth rate for 2024. While there are many in the sector, VeriSign, with a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B, seems an intriguing option. The stock has gained just 0.5% in 2023, suggesting room for upside potential. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.VeriSign provides Internet infrastructure services that include domain name registry services and infrastructure assurance services. It has an estimated earnings growth rate of 9.4% for the next year.', ""The world's largest cryptocurrency started 2023 just above $16,000 and climbed to a 12-month high of $45,000 in early December. The rally came on the back of broad enthusiasm about U.S. interest rate cuts and the imminent regulatory approval for Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin halving, scheduled for April 2024, added to the strength. Bitcoin's performance in 2023 has outpaced other assets like global stocks and gold. Bitcoin mining companies have outperformed Bitcoin by a wide margin amid the recent bullish price action in the largest cryptocurrency. This trend is likely to continue.Block, formerly known as Square, offers financial and marketing services through its comprehensive commerce ecosystem that helps sellers start, run and grow their businesses. It saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 75 cents over the past 90 days for 2024 and has an estimated growth rate of 53.2%. Block has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A."", 'Inflation in the United States has been cooling, with the Consumer Price Index edging down for the second consecutive month in November. Inflation has now fallen significantly to 3.1% from a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022. Lower inflation often leads to decreased interest rates and heightened consumer spending, which, in turn, boost the demand for stocks. This heightened demand is further fueled by robust company revenues, ultimately culminating in an appreciation of share prices. Thus, growth stocks tend to perform better when inflation is low.Although most companies will benefit from this trend, Royal Caribbean looks more appropriate. This cruise company owns and operates three global brands — Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruises. With a market cap of $32.8 billion, the stock has surged 22.7% over the past month. Royal Caribbean has an estimated growth rate of 38.1% for 2024. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 and a VGM Score of B.', 'In the latest meeting, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a major policy shift as inflation is easing and the economy is holding up better. He signaled three rate cuts for the next year, compared with the previous forecast of two rate cuts in 2024. The federal funds rate is expected to be in the range of 4.4-4.9%, down from the current 5.25% to 5.50%. This indicates that the Fed will cut rates by a total of 0.75% next year, indicating that the historic rate-hiking campaign might be ending.Lower interest rates generally lead to reduced borrowing costs, which can stimulate economic growth. This can positively impact sectors like real estate, consumer discretionary and financial services, which are typically sensitive to interest rate changes. In real estate, for instance, lower rates can boost housing market activity by making mortgages more affordable. For consumer discretionary sectors, reduced borrowing costs can lead to increased consumer spending. In the financial sector, while lower rates can compress net interest margins for banks, they can also encourage lending and potentially lead to increased consumer and business loan activity.As a result, investors could bet on any of these sectors to magnify gains in 2024. In particular, the most beaten-down stocks of 2023 could outperform in 2024. One exciting option could be W.R. Berkley, which is one of the nation’s largest commercial lines property casualty insurance providers.The stock is down about 3% this year but has the potential to move higher in 2024, given its Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B. Additionally, W.R. Berkley saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past 30 days for 2024, with an estimated growth rate of 20.2%.', 'The allure of gold has returned in recent months on a decline in bond yields and a weaker U.S. dollar. A potential shift in monetary policy coupled with geopolitical tension presents an intriguing scenario for investors looking into 2024. Lower interest rates are usually good for gold, as it weakens the U.S. dollar. A weak dollar makes bullion cheaper for overseas buyers, thereby driving gold prices higher.Additionally, geopolitical tensions like the Israel-Hamas conflict will continue to raise safe-haven buying, making gold attractive. Gold is often used as a means of preserving wealth during times of financial and political uncertainty. It usually does well when other asset classes struggle.Given the optimism, investors have a long list of options to tap into the metal’s rally. Eldorado Gold, having a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A, seems attractive. It is a gold-producing and exploration company with assets in Brazil and Turkey. It has a market cap of $2.7 billion. Eldorado Gold has an estimated earnings growth rate of 24% for 2024 and saw a positive earnings estimate of 15 cents over the past three months.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With the rise of cashless transactions, digital payments, and Buy Now, Pay Later, a huge transition is happening in the finance world. 2023 was also a year when people started to lose trust in traditional banks and were looking for other options to put their money into. This backdrop has led to this list of fintech stocks to buy.', 'This is where several fintech companies won. The coming year will be about innovation, technology, and digital transactions. With that in mind, now is the right time to invest in fintech stocks that will be able to withstand competition in 2024.', 'Here are the top fintech stocks to buy.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com', 'One of my favorite fintech stocks in 2024 is Visa\xa0(NYSE:V). The company has a solid global presence, caters to over 100 merchants, and thrives despite uncertain market conditions. The financial stock has been a big winner of 2023 and is exchanging hands for $259 right now, up 25% year to date and very close to the 52-week high of $263. It has generated over 100% returns in the past five years, and the momentum will not stop anytime soon.', 'One big reason to invest in the stock is that the company has low operating costs and consistent revenue. It makes money whenever its card is swiped, and as we transition towards cashless payments, Visa is set to gain. It charges a fee on every transaction, which can lead to a huge amount of money. The company also offers other value-added services like risk management, advisory, and acceptance solutions, which generate revenue.', 'Another reason to invest in Visa is the\xa0strong financials. The company reported a revenue of $32.7 billion for 2023, up 11%, and a net income of $8.28 per share. A striking feature of the income statement is the profit it makes. The company has made $21 billion in operating income, which is a huge margin, and this shows that it has enough liquidity to keep rewarding the shareholders. Visa is steadily producing free cash flow, which helps repurchase the company stock.', 'One of the top dividend stocks, Visa, enjoys a yield of 0.80% and has announced a quarterly dividend of $0.52. Yes, the stock isn’t cheap, but it will only move upward in 2024, and if you wait for it to drop, you could end up waiting forever.', 'Source: Wright Studio / Shutterstock.com', 'Another stellar fintech stock to buy is SoFi Technologies\xa0(NASDAQ:SOFI). The company did suffer over the past two years when SOFI stock went from $25 in Jan 2021 to $9.94 today. However, this dip is a solid chance to add the stock to your portfolio. SOFI is a multi-bagger stock to buy and hold for long-term gains.', 'It was once known for its lending operations but has now become a one-stop shop for everything money. Its financial services segment has grown by 141% in the recent quarter and is very close to reporting profitability. It is now offering everything one would want from a bank- checking accounts, investments, credit cards, and loans. As I’ve mentioned in my previous coverage of SOFI, the company is set to gain from the resumption of student loan repayments, and this will lead to a rise in the demand for personal loans.', 'In the third quarter, it added 717,000 members, which took the total number of members to 6.96 million. If it continues with the same growth rate, it will end the year with over 7.5 million members. The management aims to add about 1 million members in each quarter throughout 2024, and this will mean massive growth for the company. Its fourth-quarter report will be interesting and could carry good news.', 'The management aims to deliver a profit in the coming quarter, which could be the beginning of SoFi’s success story. Buying the stock below $10 is a smart move that can double your money in 2024. If you hold the stock throughout the coming year, you could end the year with a significant gain.', 'There is a mixed sentiment about PayPal\xa0(NASDAQ:PYPL), but I think it is too soon to write it off. A well-known player in the industry, the company will continue to benefit from the trend of digital payments. The fintech giant is benefitting from the growing popularity of online shopping. It caters to individuals and businesses globally.', 'Trading at $63 today, the stock is down 15% year to date and looks undervalued to me. Buy the stock now for strong long-term gains. It is still trading lower than the 52-week high of $88 and significantly lower than the all-time high of $308 it hit in 2021.', 'In the third quarter, the company saw a revenue rise of 8%, and it is expected that the fourth quarter could see lower revenue growth. Its EPS stood at $1.30 per share, and the revenue hit $7.4 billion, exceeding projections. This shows that the company has a solid market presence and can continue to grow even during high inflation.', 'PayPal has recently ventured into the blockchain segment and now offers services to help buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies.

The economic prowess and entrepreneurial spirit of the US make it the largest economy in the world. The richest US cities are home to some of the largest multinational corporations in the world. From bustling metropolises to tech hubs, the US cities are economic zones that have paved the way for several industries. These cities have become some of the wealthiest cities not only in the US but in the world. However, the richest US cities are also facing economic crises due to ongoing global economic issues. The high interest rates, increasing inflation, and ongoing geopolitical events in the Middle East are creating much economic uncertainty. On December 22, the United States Institute of Peace reported that the drone and missile attacks by Yemeni Houthis on ships in the Red Sea have disrupted global supply chains. About 12% of global trade passes through the Red Sea, accounting for billions of dollars of goods. Almost 30% of the world’s container shipping is channeled through the Red Sea. The increasing tensions in the region are creating huge supply chain risks, which can lead to increased prices of goods in Europe and the US.\xa0', 'We have highlighted the major global threat which is all driven by Israel’s aggression and bombing against the innocents of Gaza. Now, the new events unfolding in the region can cause another global economic turmoil, potentially impacting the economic outlook for 2024. Despite the risks, economic growth improved to a certain extent in the US in 2023. The increase in manufacturing investment during the third quarter of 2023 has boosted economic growth in the US. The private manufacturing construction investment reached a record-high level, the highest since 1958. On December 25, Business Insider shared the economic developments and outlook for 2024 for the US. The US economy is expected to remain slow in 2024 as leading banks and economists project the GDP growth between 0.5% and 2% for 2024. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) forecasts a conservative growth rate of 0.7%, while the Conference Board estimates growth rate of 0.9%.\xa0', 'According to Goldman Sachs, the US GDP is expected to grow 2.1% on a full-year basis. If this projection comes true it would beat the low consensus expectations. The consumption growth is expected to be just under 2%, with real disposable income growth of almost 3%. The business investment is projected to grow roughly 2% as the surge in manufacturing facility investments driven by CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act subsidies slows down. Residential investment is expected to remain flat as the shortage in the housing sector continues.\xa0', '2023 successfully defied recession fears and by the end of the year, there were a few expectations for a soft landing. However, the potential soft landing wasn’t feasible. According to Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate, there is more hope for a soft landing heading into 2024 compared to 2023, as reported by NBC News. The good thing is that the hard part of the inflation fight now looks over. Goldman Sachs analysts see an average 15% probability of recession over the next 12 months.\xa0', 'The richest cities in the United States always play a key role in the economic development of the country.

After all, a $1,000 investment in a dividend stock with a 5% yield would generate only $50 in extra cash each year -- and that gain could easily disappear if the underlying stock sheds more than 5% of its value. That's why many dividend investors shifted toward safer CDs and T-bills as interest rates rose over the past two years."", 'However, over time investors who buy a stable dividend stock and reinvest its dividends can still generate much higher total returns than CDs or T-bills offer. For example, a $1,000 investment in dividend stalwart Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) would have turned into $11,300 after reinvesting its dividends over the past three decades. That same investment in a 30-year CD with an annual percentage yield of 5% would have grown to only around $4,300.', ""Not every dividend stock is as dependable as Coca-Cola, but investors who put $1,000 in Verizon (NYSE: VZ), UMC (NYSE: UMC), or Altria (NYSE: MO) while they're trading at low valuations with high yields might be well-rewarded in the future."", ""Verizon's stock tumbled 36% over the past three years as it struggled to expand its core wireless business. It added only 201,000 postpaid phone subscribers in 2022 and lost about 19,000 subscribers in the first nine months of 2023. That slowdown was driven by its loss of consumer subscribers, which offset its growth in business subscribers."", 'Yet most of that slowdown occurred in the first quarter of 2023, with its loss of 127,000 postpaid phone subscribers. After that big setback, it added 8,000 subscribers in the second quarter and gained 100,000 subscribers in the third quarter.', ""The stabilization of that core business, along with the ongoing expansion of its smaller broadband business, which gained more than 400,000 quarterly net adds over the past four consecutive quarters, suggests Verizon isn't down for the count yet."", 'Verizon also raised its full-year free cash flow\xa0outlook in its latest quarter, raised its dividend for the 17th consecutive year, and pays a forward dividend yield of 7.1%. The stock also looks cheap at eight times forward earnings -- and that low multiple should limit its downside potential as it resolves its near-term problems.', ""UMC, the second-largest chip foundry in Taiwan, doesn't attract nearly as much attention as its big brother, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, (NYSE: TSM). That's mainly because UMC manufactures older, larger, and less power-efficient chips than TSMC."", 'Five years ago, UMC stopped chasing TSMC and Samsung in the capital-intensive ""process race"" to manufacture smaller and denser chips.

That conservative approach enabled it to profit from the secular expansion of the semiconductor market without worrying too much about the availability of high-end lithography hardware or looming government sanctions.', 'Like TSMC, UMC suffered a slowdown in 2023 as the semiconductor market weakened. But from 2023 to 2025, analysts expect its revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 13.5% as the macro environment improves.', ""UMC's stock has already risen nearly 350% over the past five years, yet it still looks surprisingly cheap at 13 times forward earnings and pays a hefty forward dividend yield of 7.4%. By comparison, TSMC trades at 16 times forward earnings and pays a lower forward yield of 1.9%. Therefore, investors who want a good dividend play with plenty of exposure to the recovering semiconductor sector should take a much closer look at UMC."", 'Altria, the largest tobacco company in America, has struggled with declining smoking rates for decades. It has offset that pressure by raising its prices, cutting costs, and repurchasing shares to boost its earnings per share (EPS) as its revenue growth stalled out. Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to rise just 1% and 3%, respectively, in 2024.', ""Altria also tried to curb its dependence on traditional cigarettes by acquiring a 35% stake in the domestic e-cigarette maker Juul for $12.8 billion in 2018. However, Altria was forced to take a massive writedown on that investment after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned all of Juul's products last year."", 'Now, it is trying to bounce back from that action by buying e-cigarette maker NJOY, which already had its products cleared by the FDA, for $2.75 billion this past June.', ""Altria's shrinking tobacco business and messy e-cigarette plans caused its stock to decline 18% over the past five years. But with a forward multiple of 8 and a forward dividend yield of 9.7% -- which has been raised every year since it spun off its overseas business as Philip Morris International in 2008 -- too much doom and gloom might be priced into its stock."", 'If Altria continues to cut costs, stabilize its cigarette business, and expand NJOY, it could still be a great long-term investment.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Verizon Communications wasn't one of them.

That impressive surge is justified thanks to the astronomic acceleration in the chipmaker's top and bottom lines on the back of booming demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips."", 'However, the big pop in Nvidia stock this year inflated its valuation. It is now trading at 27 times sales, which is higher than its five-year average price-to-sales ratio of 20. The trailing earnings multiple stands at 65.', 'While Nvidia seems capable of justifying that valuation thanks to its dominant position in the market for AI chips, which is likely to translate into terrific growth in 2024, investors may be looking for a cheaper alternative to capitalize on the proliferation of AI.', ""Enter Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU). Shares of the memory specialist have shot up 74% this year, and its latest earnings report tells us that more upside is in the cards in 2024 thanks to AI. What's more, Micron stock is trading at a very attractive valuation despite its rally. Let's look at the reasons why buying this chipmaker is a no-brainer right now."", ""Micron Technology released its fiscal 2024 first-quarter results (for the three months ended Nov. 30) on Dec. 20. The company's revenue jumped 16% year over year to $4.7 billion, exceeding its guidance of $4.4 billion and Wall Street's expectation of $4.58 billion."", ""Micron reported a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) loss of $0.95 per share for the quarter. While that was higher than the year-ago period's loss of $0.04 per share, the figure was smaller than Micron's guidance of a loss of $1.07 per share. Analysts were expecting Micron to report a loss of $1.01 per share. However, the improving conditions in the memory market helped the chipmaker outperform expectations."", 'The memory market was in dire straits earlier thanks to oversupply. Demand for memory chips fell as sales of smartphones and personal computers (PCs) dropped off a cliff, leaving memory manufacturers with excess supply that weighed on pricing. The good news is that Micron is now witnessing an ""improved supply demand environment in the current calendar quarter [that] gives us additional confidence in the trajectory of our business.""', 'CEO Sanjay Mehrotra added on the latest earnings conference call, ""We have driven a strong inflection in industry pricing this calendar quarter, which will allow us to benefit from higher prices earlier in our fiscal year compared to prior plans.""', 'Micron expects memory prices to grow at a faster pace than it was anticipating earlier. One of the reasons why that\'s the case is because the adoption of generative AI is driving stronger memory demand. Mehrotra says that Micron is ""in the very early stages of a multiyear growth phase catalyzed and driven by generative AI,"" and the company is ""already seeing strong demand driven by early deployment of AI solutions, which will only accelerate over time.""', ""Micron sees AI creating the demand for more memory, not only in servers but also due to the deployment of this technology in smartphones and PCs. That's not surprising, as PC manufacturers are already betting on AI to be the next big growth driver for this market, while tech giants are reportedly working to bring generative AI to smartphones."", ""All this explains why Micron is anticipating its key business segments to grow in the current fiscal year. In the data center business, for instance, Micron is forecasting server shipments to increase in the mid-single digits in 2024 following a double-digit decline in 2023. More importantly, the company's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips are in the final stages of qualification for deployment in Nvidia's H200 and Grace Hopper GH200 chip platforms, which are set to hit the market in 2024."", 'As a result, Micron management is confident of generating several hundred million in HBM revenue in fiscal 2024, followed by another year of growth in 2025. With the demand for HBM set to grow rapidly in the long run, Micron could win big by supplying its chips to Nvidia, considering that the latter is looking to substantially increase its production in 2024 thanks to the arrival of its new AI chip platforms.', 'Similarly, Micron is forecasting growth in both the PC and the smartphone markets in 2024 following sharp declines last year. Management also points out that the ramp-up of AI-enabled PCs in the second half of 2024 is likely to increase its addressable market to the tune of 4GB (gigabytes) to 8GB of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) per unit. Counterpoint Research estimates that shipments of AI-powered PCs could increase at an annual rate of 50% through 2030, and this should further contribute to strong memory demand in the long run.', ""So it's not surprising to see why the memory market's revenue is expected to jump a healthy 45% in 2024 to $130 billion, according to market research firm IDC. This robust end-market growth is the reason why Micron's financial performance is anticipated to improve sharply next year."", ""Micron's guidance for the current quarter suggests that its growth is set to accelerate. The company is forecasting $5.3 billion in revenue in the current quarter, which would translate into a year-over-year jump of 43%. Additionally, the chipmaker expects its adjusted net loss to drop to $0.28 per share from $1.91 per share in the prior-year period."", ""Though Micron hasn't issued a full-year revenue forecast, analysts are expecting its top line to jump nearly 48% in fiscal 2024 to $23 billion, followed by another year of robust growth in fiscal 2025."", ""Assuming the company does hit $23 billion in revenue in the ongoing fiscal year, which it seems capable of doing, its market cap could jump to $138 billion based on its current sales multiple of 6. That would represent a 45% upside from current levels. And Micron's price-to-sales ratio is much lower than Nvidia's, so it won't be surprising to see the market reward it with a higher multiple thanks to its AI-fueled growth."", ""That could lead to a stronger jump in Micron's shares, which is why investors looking to buy a fast-growing AI stock at an affordable valuation should consider buying it hand over fist right now."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Micron Technology wasn't one of them.

In fact, AMD's biggest competitor, Nvidia, has seen its shares rise more than 200% this year alongside a spike in chip sales."", ""AMD's financials have yet to reflect its potential in the sector, with its data center revenue actually dipping just under 1% year over year in the third quarter of 2023. However, that could all change in 2024, when the company will begin shipping what it calls its most powerful graphics processing unit (GPU) ever, designed specifically to compete with Nvidia's offerings."", ""AMD's new AI GPU, the MI300X, comes at a time when the market has grown desperate for alternatives to Nvidia, with companies looking forward to increased competition reducing the cost of chips. As a result, if the chipmaker can deliver better price-to-performance, it could have a real shot at taking a significant chunk out of Nvidia's estimated 90% market share in AI chips."", ""The MI300X is already off to a promising start, with Microsoft's Azure announcing in November that it would become the first cloud platform to use the GPU to expand its AI capabilities. Meanwhile, AMD has partnered with Meta, Cisco, and Broadcom to build advanced AI systems."", ""AMD's soaring stock price, alongside earnings that have yet to see a return on its investment in AI, has made its shares expensive, illustrated by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of about 52. However, EPS estimates suggest the company still has much to offer new investors."", ""This chart shows AMD's earnings could hit $5 per share over the next two fiscal years. Multiplying that figure by the chipmaker's forward P/E yields a stock price of $265, projecting growth of 90% over the next two fiscal years."", ""Consequently, AMD's stock is attractive ahead of 2024, and a no-brainer for anyone looking to invest in AI."", 'While AMD looks likely to shake up the AI chip market next year, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) could be poised to see big gains from the software side of the industry.', 'In early December the company unveiled its highly anticipated large language model, Gemini.

Management said that it would issue a dividend of $0.30 on Jan. 10 to shareholders as of Dec. 11, 2023. That implies a yield of 0.66%, which isn't great, but it's a start."", ""Prior to the suspension, Disney's dividend yielded around 1.5%, or about the S&P 500 average. Disney is an old stock, having traded over the counter since 1940 before an initial public offering in 1957. It has paid a dividend from the beginning but only started raising it in 1989."", 'It has had a great run, growing much more than storied dividends from stocks like Coca-Cola and Proctor and Gamble, before being put on hold in 2020.', ""Disney's been through a lot of ups and downs over the past four years, including a new CEO -- and now its old CEO. Bob Iger is trying to set things straight by reverting to the company's tried-and-true model of a powerful parks segment and blockbuster films, both fueled by an incredible content-creation machine. He's aiming to get streaming spending under control, boost profits, and reward shareholders."", ""Shareholders have been disillusioned by Disney's ongoing challenges, and Disney stock is up just 6% this year, sharply underperforming the market. It's still 53% off its highs, and it's going to take more work to drive the share price higher."", 'According to Board Chairman Mark Parker, ""This has been a year of important progress for The Walt Disney Company ... As Disney moves forward with its key strategic objectives, we are pleased to declare a dividend for our shareholders while we continue to invest in the company\'s future and prioritize meaningful value creation.""', ""On the most recent earnings call, Iger mentioned a strong balance sheet and robust cash flow as an impetus to restart the dividend. These are both bouncing back nicely, and now that Disney has the money, it's giving back to patient shareholders."", ""Disney has the money to pay the dividend, and it doesn't look like investors need to worry about its ability to pay it and keep operations running."", 'Don\'t buy Disney stock for the January dividend; you\'ll get better yields elsewhere. This is mostly a gesture that says, ""We\'re back."" However, it does look like things are moving in the right direction for Disney, and this could be the start of a real rebound for the media giant.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walt Disney right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walt Disney wasn't one of them.

On a day-by-day basis, however, the emotions of fear and greed may dominate stock prices, leading to wild price swings.', ""That conflict between long-term value and near-term prices will occasionally create a situation where ordinary investors can benefit. Sometimes, the market's short-term fear will drive an individual company's share price below its long-term value, allowing investors to buy at a bargain price. When that happens, all you need to do is hold on and wait for the future to play itself out. If those decent prospects turn out to be true, you can profit as the market recognizes its mistake and reprices the company's shares."", 'With that in mind, here are three bargain stocks that you can buy today and may end up worthy of holding on to forever.', 'Prudential Financial (NYSE: PRU) sits atop my list as a top value stock to buy right now. Prudential Financial is an insurance company that cares so much about being financially rock-solid that it uses an actual rock -- the Rock of Gibraltar -- as its corporate logo.', ""Most of the time, that's an awesome place to be, but it caused the company major pains over the past few years as interest rates rose. To support its rock-solid reputation, Prudential Financial carries over $300 billion in bonds on its balance sheet. While those bonds provide higher certainty of cash flows than stocks, they also tend to see their market values drop as interest rates rise."", ""Now that the Federal Reserve has indicated that its rate rising campaign is likely over -- and indeed, that future rate cuts are probably on the horizon -- that rough patch is likely behind Prudential Financial. With its shares trading at around 8 times its projected earnings and those earnings expected to grow by 10.5% annualized over the next five years, the company's shares certainly look to be bargain priced."", 'Add a solid 4.8% dividend yield to its value price, and Prudential Financial starts to look like a bargain-priced stock that will pay you a decent amount to wait for its shares to climb.', ""Diageo (NYSE: DEO) is the British company behind such world-famous alcohol brands as Guinness, Johnnie Walker, Baileys, and Smirnoff. Unlike many companies, Diageo's shares are actually down in 2023, and it's that decline that makes it potentially interesting to value investors today."", ""Diageo's shares command a reasonable 17.5 price-to-earnings ratio, and the company's earnings are expected to increase by about 5.6% annualized over the next five years. While not the cheapest stock on the market, the company's price does appear decently valued for investors with a long-term time frame who are interested in a solid business with decent prospects for the future."", ""In addition to the reasonable valuation, what makes Diageo an attractive potential investment is the fact that the alcohol business tends to be recession resistant. Sure, when money is tight, people may shift from drinking in bars to drinking at home, but they'll still drink. As the alcohol manufacturer -- not the bar -- Diageo will get paid no matter where that drinking takes place."", 'Add a decent 2.7% yield on top of that reasonable valuation and recession-resistant business model, and Diageo shows up as an interesting company to consider for investors with a long-term time horizon.', 'PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) is well known as a digital payments processor, with a substantial part of its business focused on online purchases. It makes most of its money from transaction fees -- and the more transactions move online, the more of those fees it can capture.', ""PayPal currently trades at around 11 times its anticipated forward earnings, and those earnings are expected to grow by more than 16% annualized over the next five years.

As a result, when you find a business you like trading at a legitimate value price, it's generally a decent idea to make your initial investing decision fairly quickly."", ""If you don't want to go all-in on your investment, it's perfectly fine to only put part of your available money to work while you continue to look into the business. If its shares go up, you'll at least have something invested in a winning decision. But if they go down, you'd still have capital available, should you decide that the lower price just made that bargain business even cheaper."", 'No matter how you go about it, though, today is a great day to go hunting for bargain stocks.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Prudential Financial right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Prudential Financial, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Prudential Financial wasn't one of them.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Analysts.\xa0', 'This year brought a notable shift in the investment scene, where technology stocks surged ahead, overshadowing the performance of dividend-focused equities. Despite this change, experts advise that investors diversify their portfolios across various asset classes to navigate diverse market situations effectively. This strategy aims to ensure resilience against fluctuations and uncertainties in the market, emphasizing the importance of a well-rounded investment approach that goes beyond focusing solely on one sector or type of stock. Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, shared insights on investment strategies in an interview with Bloomberg. Here are some comments from the analyst:', '“It’s clear that having a diversified portfolio is probably the best way to navigate the investment climate and the best way to do that is owning the S&P 500 — full stop. If you were to start this year by saying ‘everyone says there’s a recession coming so I’m going to invest defensively,’ you got punched in the nose.”', 'Dividend stocks faced challenges this year, yet these equities have retained their status as investor favorites over the years due to the exceptional returns they consistently generate. When investing in dividend stocks, investors pay special attention to companies that have raised their dividends for years. This long-standing history of raising dividends signifies stability, financial health, and a commitment to sharing profits with shareholders. The S&P 500 High Dividend Growth Index monitors companies that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 5 years and are expected to continue this trend in the upcoming year. This index has outperformed the S&P 500 since 2010, according to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices. Despite the S&P 500 showing strong performance during this time, the High Dividend Growth Index has not only matched but exceeded it. Over the period from 2010, it has shown an average yearly return of 11.94%, while also offering a notably higher yield compared to the broader market. In addition to this, the S&P 500 High Dividend Growth Index increased its dividend annually by 13.8% between 2010 and 2022. This growth rate surpasses the long-term inflation rate in the US, even considering the recent rise in inflation observed over the last few years.', ""A growing flow of dividends brings unique advantages that might be rare in other investment plans. Firstly, robust dividend growth can boost returns and act as a defense against inflation, similar to an annual salary increase. Companies increasing dividends often see their stock prices rise too. This is because stocks typically follow a company's improving earnings and dividends. In addition to this, reinvesting these increasing dividends speeds up how quickly your investment grows over time through compounding. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, from the end of 1985 to the end of 2022, the stocks in the Russell 1000 Index that consistently increased their dividends showed better performance compared to the broader benchmark. Additionally, these dividend-growing stocks demonstrated lower fluctuations or volatility in their performance during this period."", 'Some of the best dividend growth stocks include Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), \xa0The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and\xa0AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV) as these companies boast a long-standing history of consistently increasing their dividends over many years, making them sought-after choices for those seeking reliable and growing income from their investments.

That impressive surge is justified thanks to the astronomic acceleration in the chipmaker's top and bottom lines on the back of booming demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips."", 'However, the big pop in Nvidia stock this year inflated its valuation. It is now trading at 27 times sales, which is higher than its five-year average price-to-sales ratio of 20. The trailing earnings multiple stands at 65.', 'While Nvidia seems capable of justifying that valuation thanks to its dominant position in the market for AI chips, which is likely to translate into terrific growth in 2024, investors may be looking for a cheaper alternative to capitalize on the proliferation of AI.', ""Enter Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU). Shares of the memory specialist have shot up 74% this year, and its latest earnings report tells us that more upside is in the cards in 2024 thanks to AI. What's more, Micron stock is trading at a very attractive valuation despite its rally. Let's look at the reasons why buying this chipmaker is a no-brainer right now."", ""Micron Technology released its fiscal 2024 first-quarter results (for the three months ended Nov. 30) on Dec. 20. The company's revenue jumped 16% year over year to $4.7 billion, exceeding its guidance of $4.4 billion and Wall Street's expectation of $4.58 billion."", ""Micron reported a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) loss of $0.95 per share for the quarter. While that was higher than the year-ago period's loss of $0.04 per share, the figure was smaller than Micron's guidance of a loss of $1.07 per share. Analysts were expecting Micron to report a loss of $1.01 per share. However, the improving conditions in the memory market helped the chipmaker outperform expectations."", 'The memory market was in dire straits earlier thanks to oversupply. Demand for memory chips fell as sales of smartphones and personal computers (PCs) dropped off a cliff, leaving memory manufacturers with excess supply that weighed on pricing. The good news is that Micron is now witnessing an ""improved supply demand environment in the current calendar quarter [that] gives us additional confidence in the trajectory of our business.""', 'CEO Sanjay Mehrotra added on the latest earnings conference call, ""We have driven a strong inflection in industry pricing this calendar quarter, which will allow us to benefit from higher prices earlier in our fiscal year compared to prior plans.""', 'Micron expects memory prices to grow at a faster pace than it was anticipating earlier. One of the reasons why that\'s the case is because the adoption of generative AI is driving stronger memory demand. Mehrotra says that Micron is ""in the very early stages of a multiyear growth phase catalyzed and driven by generative AI,"" and the company is ""already seeing strong demand driven by early deployment of AI solutions, which will only accelerate over time.""', ""Micron sees AI creating the demand for more memory, not only in servers but also due to the deployment of this technology in smartphones and PCs. That's not surprising, as PC manufacturers are already betting on AI to be the next big growth driver for this market, while tech giants are reportedly working to bring generative AI to smartphones."", ""All this explains why Micron is anticipating its key business segments to grow in the current fiscal year. In the data center business, for instance, Micron is forecasting server shipments to increase in the mid-single digits in 2024 following a double-digit decline in 2023. More importantly, the company's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips are in the final stages of qualification for deployment in Nvidia's H200 and Grace Hopper GH200 chip platforms, which are set to hit the market in 2024."", 'As a result, Micron management is confident of generating several hundred million in HBM revenue in fiscal 2024, followed by another year of growth in 2025. With the demand for HBM set to grow rapidly in the long run, Micron could win big by supplying its chips to Nvidia, considering that the latter is looking to substantially increase its production in 2024 thanks to the arrival of its new AI chip platforms.', 'Similarly, Micron is forecasting growth in both the PC and the smartphone markets in 2024 following sharp declines last year. Management also points out that the ramp-up of AI-enabled PCs in the second half of 2024 is likely to increase its addressable market to the tune of 4GB (gigabytes) to 8GB of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) per unit. Counterpoint Research estimates that shipments of AI-powered PCs could increase at an annual rate of 50% through 2030, and this should further contribute to strong memory demand in the long run.', ""So it's not surprising to see why the memory market's revenue is expected to jump a healthy 45% in 2024 to $130 billion, according to market research firm IDC. This robust end-market growth is the reason why Micron's financial performance is anticipated to improve sharply next year."", ""Micron's guidance for the current quarter suggests that its growth is set to accelerate. The company is forecasting $5.3 billion in revenue in the current quarter, which would translate into a year-over-year jump of 43%. Additionally, the chipmaker expects its adjusted net loss to drop to $0.28 per share from $1.91 per share in the prior-year period."", ""Though Micron hasn't issued a full-year revenue forecast, analysts are expecting its top line to jump nearly 48% in fiscal 2024 to $23 billion, followed by another year of robust growth in fiscal 2025."", ""Assuming the company does hit $23 billion in revenue in the ongoing fiscal year, which it seems capable of doing, its market cap could jump to $138 billion based on its current sales multiple of 6. That would represent a 45% upside from current levels. And Micron's price-to-sales ratio is much lower than Nvidia's, so it won't be surprising to see the market reward it with a higher multiple thanks to its AI-fueled growth."", ""That could lead to a stronger jump in Micron's shares, which is why investors looking to buy a fast-growing AI stock at an affordable valuation should consider buying it hand over fist right now."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Micron Technology wasn't one of them.

While United Microelectronics has settled, tensions persist as the legal case against Fujian Jinhua continues amid heightened U.S.-China technological competition.In November 2023, the company was accused of patent infringement by the Chinese chipmaker Yangtze Memory Technologies Company (“YMTC”). Partially state-owned, YMTC filed a lawsuit on Nov 9 at the U.S. District Court, alleging that the U.S. memory chipmaker has infringed eight of its patented technology, according to a report by Reuters.The ongoing tech war between the United States and China could jeopardize Micron’s prospects, which are already facing the brunt of the weak demand for memory chips. Chip sales in China make up nearly 11% of Micron’s total revenues."", '\xa0', 'Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Micron Technology, Inc.

The company anticipates that the boom in artificial intelligence spending will drive the demand for its chips in the data center end market.In line with this forward-looking approach, Micron Technology has recently introduced the Micron 3500 NVMe SSD. This innovative product utilizes advanced 232-layer NAND technology to enhance performance, catering to gaming, content creation, and client AI experiences.Micron recently reported better-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2024 performance and sequential growth across all key metrics. These indicates benefits of an improving supply-demand environment and signals that the industrywide sluggish period is nearing its end, and the company is moving back to profitability.The expectation of supply normalization by mid-year 2024 is likely to drive pricing, while the boom in artificial intelligence spending is expected to fuel demand for its chips used in the data center end market. A rising mix of high-value solutions and improving customer engagement and cost structure are growth drivers as well. Also, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for memory and storage.For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, MU anticipates revenues of $5.3 billion (+/-$200 million).

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", 'Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:', '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$1.64b', 'US$1.82b', 'US$1.85b', 'US$2.05b', 'US$2.17b', 'US$2.27b', 'US$2.35b', 'US$2.43b', 'US$2.51b', 'US$2.57b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ 5.53%', 'Est @ 4.54%', 'Est @ 3.84%', 'Est @ 3.36%', 'Est @ 3.01%', 'Est @ 2.78%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.6% ', 'US$1.5k', 'US$1.5k', 'US$1.4k', 'US$1.5k', 'US$1.4k', 'US$1.4k', 'US$1.3k', 'US$1.3k', 'US$1.2k', 'US$1.1k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$14b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.

Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Yum! Brands as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.276. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

In the consumer sector, both Realty Income (NYSE: O) and McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) could serve this purpose. Here's why."", ""Realty Income is a real estate investment trust (REIT)\xa0that owns more than 13,000 properties in the U.S. and four European countries. It has single tenants under long-term, net lease agreements. This means the tenant pays the properties' maintenance, taxes, and insurance, leaving Realty Income to profit from the rental income."", 'Investors may know Realty Income for the buildings it owns rather than as a company. Its client list includes retailers of all types, restaurants, and specialized businesses, such as auto repair shops or fitness centers. Walgreens, Dollar General, and Tractor Supply are examples of companies leasing space from Realty Income.', 'Retirement investors will also like that it bills itself as the ""monthly dividend company,"" backing that up with monthly payouts. The current annual dividend is almost $3.08 per share, which amounts to a dividend yield of 5.4%. Also, with four payout hikes in 2023 alone, its appeal as an income stock should continue to grow.', ""In the first nine months of 2023, revenue totaled $3 billion, an increase of 22%. Unfortunately, interest costs hit the bottom line though the company still generated $2.1 billion in funds from operations (FFO) income, a measure of a REIT's free cash flow (FCF). This fully covers about $1.6 billion in dividend costs over that period."", 'Admittedly, the stock is off slightly for the year due to the aforementioned rising interest rates. Still, that leaves Realty Income with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 43.\xa0Due to high depreciation costs, this earnings multiple may appear high but is actually at a low level historically. Now, with interest rates again on the decline, the stock and its dividend are likely to head higher in 2024.', ""Investors and consumers alike know McDonald's for its iconic fast-food hamburger restaurants found in almost any town in the U.S. and more than 100 countries worldwide.\xa0Nonetheless, when looking at its business model, it seems to have more in common with a REIT than a restaurant. The company derives most profits from franchise-related fees and rental income because it owns the restaurant properties."", 'Indeed, it owns a small proportion of its restaurants. Since it collects a 4% fee (5% for new franchises, beginning Jan. 1) on revenue from its franchises, it has some exposure to the overall economy. However, deriving most of its income from rent and franchising fees limits the negative effects of downturns.', ""Additionally, the company is testing a beverage chain concept called CosMc's. While it is still early going, the hours-long lines point to CosMc's potential success. This could pave the way for a new round of franchising that could stoke additional growth."", ""Indeed, the company has prospered even without CosMc's. In the first nine months of 2023, revenue of $19 billion rose 10% versus the same period in 2022. The 9% growth in global comparable sales drove the majority of that increase.\xa0Also, net income of $6.4 billion was up an astounding 50% as operating expenses shrunk year over year."", 'So far, such gains have not appeared in the stock price as it has only risen by just under 10% over the last year. However, its annual dividend of $6.68 per share yields an additional 2.1%.', 'The dividend has risen every year since 1976 and should serve as a continually rising source of income.

The Canadian energy infrastructure giant has delivered a 12.3% annualized total return since 2000, outpacing the S&P 500's 9.1% annualized total return. Enbridge would have grown a $400 investment into nearly $5,300 at that rate. That's almost double what that same investment would have earned in an S&P 500 index fund. "", 'The pipeline and utility company should have plenty of fuel to continue enriching its shareholders in the future.

It already has a lot of that growth lined up. It agreed to buy three natural gas utilities earlier this year in a transformational transaction that will boost its earnings in the near term and enhance its long-term growth prospects. ', 'Enbridge also has a multibillion-dollar backlog of commercially secured capital projects. It has a long list of expansion projects under construction that should come online through 2028. Those growth drivers should give Enbridge plenty of fuel to grow its dividend, which it has done for 29 consecutive years. ', 'With a 7%-plus yielding payout and earnings growing by around 5% annually, Enbridge has the power to potentially produce double-digit total returns in the coming years.

That has grown a $400 investment into over $6,500.', ""The warehouse operator is in a strong position to continue growing shareholder value. It pays a solid dividend (currently yielding 2.6%) that has grown rapidly over the years. Prologis has increased its payout at a 12% compound annual rate over the last five years, twice as fast as the S&P 500's average. "", 'The REIT is in an excellent position to continue growing its earnings and dividend at above-average rates. A big driver is its built-in rent growth. ', 'Prologis typically signs long-term leases with tenants that escalate rents at a low-single-digit annual rate. Because of that, it has not fully captured the surge in warehouse rents in recent years. The company estimates its same-store net operating income will grow 9% to 10% per year over the next few years as legacy leases expire and reprice at higher market rental rates.', 'On top of that, the company will get a boost from development projects and its essential platform (renewable energy and mobility offerings). These catalysts position the company to deliver 9% to 11% annual funds from operations (FFO) per-share growth through at least 2026. In addition, it has upside potential from making acquisitions and growing its strategic capital platform.

This move is consistent with Buffett's philosophy of investing in companies with solid long-term potential and a clear understanding of the business."", ""OXY's financial health is reflected in its key metrics, such as a Profitability Rank of 7/10 and a GF Score of 75/100, indicating a strong potential for future performance. The company's balance sheet, growth, and profitability have been evaluated with a Financial Strength rank of 5/10 and a Growth Rank of 5/10. Despite a low GF Value Rank of 3/10, the company's momentum is strong, with a Momentum Rank of 8/10."", ""Comparing Occidental Petroleum Corp's current stock price to its GF Value, the stock appears modestly overvalued. However, historical performance metrics are impressive, with an IPO percent change of 955.73% and a slight year-to-date price change of -0.39%. These figures suggest that while the stock may be trading above its intrinsic value, its long-term performance has been robust."", ""Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) is not the only notable investor with a stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp. Other gurus such as Dodge & Cox, Smead Value Fund (Trades, Portfolio), and Prem Watsa (Trades, Portfolio) also hold positions in the company. However, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc remains the largest guru shareholder, underscoring the significance of OXY within its portfolio."", ""The oil and gas industry is currently navigating a complex landscape, with Occidental Petroleum Corp positioned as a key player. The company's strategic operations and Buffett's recent investment further solidify its standing within the industry, potentially influencing its performance in the face of industry-wide challenges and opportunities."", ""In conclusion, Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s recent acquisition of shares in Occidental Petroleum Corp is a strategic move that aligns with his long-standing investment philosophy. The transaction not only reinforces the company's position in Buffett's portfolio but also reflects a positive outlook on its financial health and market performance. As the oil and gas industry continues to evolve, investors will be watching closely to see how this investment plays out in the long term."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

And that's exactly what Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) is modeling right now."", ""Thanks to its long-standing dominance in a key niche market, its newfound pursuit of powerful gene therapies, and its cash output, there's good reason to be excited about the stock. So here are three arguments for why it's worth buying now."", ""Vertex's sales are highly recurring because it makes medicines that patients need to take consistently to manage their chronic symptoms. Specifically, it makes four different drugs to treat cystic fibrosis (CF), a hereditary lung disease affecting around 88,000 people in the Western world, and it has even more in development."", ""For 2022, sales of those medicines brought in nearly $9 billion, up 637% from 10 years ago. Its medicines are the only ones capable of addressing the root causes of CF, and thus it has no real competitors for its market share. Plus, it's working to expand the indications of its existing medicines. As recently as April, it nabbed approval for its drug Trikafta to treat children between the ages of 2 and 5 who have a specific mutation relevant to CF. Around 900 additional patients can now be treated as a result."", ""Management thinks that it can eventually reach the remaining 20,000 patients with CF who haven't yet started ongoing treatment with its medicines. And as long as it can keep delivering its life-saving treatments to more and more people each year, its top line will stay strong, too, which is a solid reason to buy the stock."", 'Vertex is also currently commercializing a cutting-edge gene therapy called Casgevy, which can treat either sickle cell disease (SCD) or beta thalassemia, a pair of rare blood disorders. Developed with the help of CRISPR Therapeutics, Casgevy is intended to be curative or near-curative for both conditions, which affects around 32,000 people in the U.S. and European Union.', ""The drug candidate is already approved in the U.K. and in the U.S. for its sickle cell disease indication as of Dec. 8, but it isn't marketed for beta thalassemia just yet. Regulators will decide on the beta thalassemia indication next year on March 30. As there weren't any deal-breaking concerns for regulators regarding using Casgevy for SCD, regulators could easily be quick to give it a stamp of approval for beta thalassemia, too."", ""Therefore, another major catalyst for the stock is nigh. That's great news for shareholders, and a tantalizing possibility for people thinking of buying the stock."", ""Biopharmaceutical businesses thrive when they have plenty of cash on hand to spend on acquisitions in support of their research and development (R&D) activities. In Vertex's case, it has nearly $12 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments, whereas its trailing-12-month operating expenses are only roughly $4 billion."", ""That means if a promising young biotech or pharmaceutical asset were to come on the market, the company won't have any problem shelling out the cash to buy it up. This could help further expand Vertex's pipeline, much like in 2022 when it acquired ViaCyte for $320 million for its type 1 diabetes candidate in early stage clinical trials."", ""Vertex also adds to its hoard at a rapid pace. In 2022, it approached $4 billion in free cash flow (FCF) for the year. Furthermore, it's not beyond the realm of possibility for it to eventually issue a dividend. And that's yet one more reason to buy the stock."", '10 stocks we like better than Vertex PharmaceuticalsWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*', ""They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Vertex Pharmaceuticals wasn't one of them!

However, some stocks don't require nearly as much analysis as others. And a few are practically no-brainers. Here are three monster stocks to buy without any hesitation."", ""Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) isn't an 800-pound gorilla in e-commerce -- it's a 900-pound gorilla. The company accounts for nearly 38% of the U.S. e-commerce market, according to Statista. Market researcher PYMTS puts the number at 48%. The market share for Amazon's closest rival -- Walmart -- is no higher than 7% using either data source."", ""It's a closer contest in cloud services, but Amazon still reigns as king of that fast-growing market. Amazon Web Services ranks as the top cloud infrastructure provider with a market share of 32%. That's well ahead of No. 2 Microsoft Azure's market share of 22%."", 'The great news for investors is that Amazon has plenty of room to grow in both e-commerce and cloud services. E-commerce only made up 15.6% of total U.S. retail sales in the third quarter. Amazon continues to expand its online footprint by moving into new areas such as selling cars. Currently, less than 10% of global IT spending is in the cloud. That percentage is expected to skyrocket over the next 10 to 15 years.', ""In the meantime, Amazon is focused on increasing its profits like never before. The company's earnings more than tripled year over year in Q3. With this type of improvement combined with the opportunities presented by generative AI, Amazon should keep up its winning ways for a long time to come."", ""Amazon doesn't dominate e-commerce everywhere. In Latin America, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) rules. That's especially the case in Brazil, where the company enjoys a market share of more than 50%."", 'Business is booming for MercadoLibre. Its net revenue soared 69% year over year in Q3 on a constant-currency basis. Gross merchandise volume jumped 59%. The number of unique buyers grew by 18% year over year.', ""E-commerce isn't MercadoLibre's only business, though. The company's logistics unit achieved a record fulfillment penetration of 48% in Q3. Its fintech digital account total payment volume vaulted nearly 189% higher on a constant-currency basis."", ""Latin America's e-commerce volume is much smaller than the markets in North America, Europe, and Asia. However, that gives MercadoLibre strong growth opportunities. The company also has great prospects in Latin America's fintech market."", 'An estimated 88,000 people in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and Canada have cystic fibrosis. Only four therapies are approved for treating the underlying cause of the rare genetic disease. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) makes all of them.', ""Despite having a monopoly in cystic fibrosis, Vertex still has room for growth in the market. It's securing additional approvals and reimbursement deals to treat younger patients. The company is also developing new therapies for the condition. Vertex expects to soon report results from late-stage studies of its vanzacaftor triple-drug combo, which could be its most powerful cystic fibrosis therapy yet. And it's working with Moderna on developing a messenger RNA drug that could help the roughly 5,000 patients who can't benefit from current therapies."", ""Vertex isn't stopping at cystic fibrosis, though. The big biotech recently won U.S. approval for exa-cel as a treatment for sickle cell disease. It hopes to pick up a second U.S. approval for the gene-editing therapy as a treatment for transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia in the first quarter of 2024."", ""In addition, Vertex's pipeline is loaded with promising programs. VX-548 holds the potential to become a blockbuster non-opioid pain treatment. Inaxaplin could become the first approved therapy that treats the underlying cause of APOL1-mediated kidney disease, which affects more patients than cystic fibrosis. Vertex also is moving forward with several candidates that could effectively cure type 1 diabetes. With this abundance of riches in its pipeline, this stock -- like Amazon and MercadoLibre -- is a monster that should grow even bigger."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, consistent supply-chain issues might lead to lower jet deliveries and thereby remain a threat to the industry players. Nevertheless, improved projections for air travel, as stated by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), are expected to bode well for companies that are engaged in commercial aerospace operations. The frontrunners in the aerospace-defense industry are Safran SAFRY, Textron TXT and Leidos Holdings LDOS.', 'About the Industry', 'The Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry comprises of companies that primarily design and manufacture heavy-built products like commercial as well as military jets and helicopters, tankers and other combat vehicles, missiles, combatant ships as well as auxiliary ships, submarines, bombs, guns, space transportation vehicles, military satellites and a few more. The industry also includes cyber security players who offer information technology services and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions. A portion of its revenues comes from defense contractors offering spare parts, aircraft modification, ship repair and overhaul services, and supply-chain management services.', ' 4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense Industry', ""Improved Air Traffic Outlook Boosts Prospects: Recovering global air traffic data in recent times has boosted the near-term growth prospects of the industry. As stated in the latest report published by the IATA, industry-wide global RPK increased 40.1% year over year through September 2023, thereby reaching 92.9% of the traffic numbers seen in 2019. Looking ahead, IATA projects air passenger revenue growth of 38% year over year in 2023.Such impressive projections bode well for commercial aerospace manufacturers that have long borne the brunt of poor air travel in the form of delayed jet deliveries and, in some cases, cancellation of orders by airlines.Expanding Defense Budget Remains a Growth Catalyst: While the commercial aerospace market has been recovering steadily over the past couple of quarters, the defense side of the industry stood its ground amid the COVID-19 crisis, cushioned by steady government support. To this end, it is imperative to mention that in December 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden signed the U.S. defense policy bill that authorizes a record $886 billion in annual military spending, thereby increasing the nation's total national security budget by about 3%.\xa0 Such improved budgetary provisions set the stage for industry players focused on the defense business to win more contracts, which is likely to boost their top line.Supply-Chain Issues May Hurt: Significant supply-chain disruption impacted the Aerospace and Defense industry, thanks to the pandemic-induced lower aircraft demand and restrictions on the movement of people and goods. This primarily affected small suppliers like aircraft part manufacturers, especially those with heavy exposure to commercial aerospace, and the aftermarket business. Although the global economy has started to improve, supply-chain issues are expected to continue to keep aircraft deliveries in 2023 lower than the 2019 level, as estimated by IATA. This, in turn, might constrict the growth trajectory of the U.S. Aerospace and Defense industry, to some extent, in the near term.Strengthening Dollar Adds to Industry Woes: The recently appreciating U.S. dollar is adding another layer of cost to airlines that are already burdened with high inflation and rising jet fuel prices. The Federal Reserve’s policy rate now stands in the 5.25-5.50% range as of September 2023, having started at 0.25% in 2022. All U.S. dollar-denominated costs are rising for airlines that earn revenues in non-U.S. currency. Similarly, the debt burden has increased for all non-dollar-based entities that have borrowed in dollars. Such a burden on airlines might lead to lower aircraft delivery, thereby hurting aerospace-defense industry players that particularly operate in the commercial aerospace."", 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects', 'The Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry is housed within the broader Zacks Aerospace sector.

This article will cover recent industry trends and navigate through the major players in the industry. If you want to skip our analysis, go directly to the 5 Most Expensive Bottled Water Brands in the World.', ""According to a report by Grand View Research, the global bottled water industry reached $326 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow to $509 billion by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.9% over the forecasted period. The consumption of bottled water peaked at 46.5 gallons per capita, with the single-serving size accounting for the highest volume of water bottles sold. Water bottles labeled alkaline, caffeinated, oxygenated, or electrolyte-rich have been among the highest-selling products in the industry. In 2022, still-water sales formed 74.5% of the revenue earned by the bottled water industry. The consistent popularity of still water stems from consumers' preference for safe drinking water amid growing rates of diseases such as typhoid and diarrhea. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)'s Aquafina and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)'s Dasani have successfully become 2 of the top selling water brands in the US by capitalizing on this demand for safe water and producing purified sodium-free water with added minerals."", ""The second most popular bottled water segment is functional water, which is forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 7% by the end of the decade. The increasing popularity of this type of water is also attributed to the consumers' increasing concern for their health and fitness. Functional water, also known as aquaceutical, contains supplements such as minerals, vitamins, proteins, and acids for added nourishment. The introduction of aquaceutical has opened a new avenue for the expansion of the bottled-water industry in the future."", 'Nearly 89% of bottled water in 2022 was sold off-trade in retail outlets such as supermarkets, hypermarkets, and departmental stores. These sales are mainly driven by brand identity and customer loyalty, which largely stems from the quality of water that brands have to offer. While the off-trade distribution dominates the market, the on-trade market segment is expected to experience faster growth in the foreseeable future. On-trade revenue, which is earned by the sale of bottled water in restaurants and bars, will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.1% between 2023 and 2030.', ""Another pertinent classification within the bottled water industry is that of packaging material. Water sold in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) packaging accounted for 80% of the industry's revenue, outweighing aluminum cans and glass bottles. Producers prefer PET because of low production and transport costs, and the resulting low prices make them a consumer favorite."", 'The growth of the bottled water industry is driven by an increasing demand for nutrient-packed water, which is associated with an increasing concern for health and nourishment mainly among professionals determined to inculcate healthy lifestyle choices in their busy schedules. For this reason, the highest consumption of bottled water is recorded in the Asia Pacific region mainly due to an increasing concern for health, hygiene, and wellness in China, India, and Indonesia. The Asia Pacific region contributed 45.1% to the global revenue of the bottled water industry, followed by the North American region which brought in 23.9% of the revenue.\xa0', 'Europe is also forecasted to be a fast-growing market for bottled water in the future. This growth is linked to an expanding tourism industry within the continent, which will trigger the demand for safe drinking water that is conveniently packaged for traveling. The projected growth rate for the bottled water market in Europe is 5.7% between 2023 and 2030.', ""A major challenge faced by the bottled water industry is the use of single-use plastic for packaging. According to a United Nations University's Institute for Water, Environment and Health report,\xa0 plastic bottles make up 25 million tonnes of plastic waste worldwide, and are major contributors to environmental pollution. Bottled water companies are minimizing their environmental impact by introducing recycled PET (rPET) bottles. For example, Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)'s Kinley has been offering 100% recycled PET bottles since December 2022 in 40 countries including Bangladesh, a major producer of plastic waste and also one of the countries most impacted by global warming."", 'The most expensive bottled water is Tributo Modigliani, Acqua di Cristallo, produced by Fernando Altamirano of Paolo Di Verachi Studio. This limited-edition glass bottle is coated with platinum and embellished with 6,000 diamonds. The water in this bottle contains 5mg of 23-karat gold dust and is a premium blend of spring water sourced from Fiji and France, and glacier water sourced from Iceland. By producing this one-of-a-kind luxury bottle worth $4.4 million, Paolo Di Verachi Studio has become the most expensive bottled water brand in the world.', 'Some of the leading bottled water companies include Primo Water Corporation (NYSE:PRMW), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP).\xa0', 'On November 5, Primo Water Corporation (NYSE:PRMW) announced its plans to sell its international water and coffee business, including those in the United Kingdom, Israel, and Portugal, by the end of 2024. Primo Water Corporation (NYSE:PRMW) has already sold a large part of its international to Culligan International for $575 million. According to the CEO, this divestment will help the company focus more on its operations within North America. He said:', '""Following the completion of the transaction and the divestiture of the remaining international businesses, the simplified pro forma Primo Water will have a greater focus on our pure-play North American water businesses with scale and operational focus and improve financial profile accelerating the achievement of several previously announced 2024 targets...We will be able to drive organic customer growth, digital initiatives, and customer retention activities and our capital investments will be focused on high-impact profit-generating projects.""', ""PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is a New York-based producer of food and beverages. Its globally recognized bottled water brands include Aquafina, Propel, and Bubly. On October 10, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) reported its earnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2023. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) had an EPS of $2.25 and beat estimates by $0.10. The company's revenue for the quarter grew by 6.75% year-on-year and amounted to $23.45 billion, beating market consensus by $45.6 million."", ""Keurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ:KDP) is among America's leading producers of premium water, coffee, and carbonated beverages.

The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years."", 'The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts.

The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Coke imply an improvement in the company's underlying business.

You can certainly find higher-yielding stocks."", ""Look beyond the current yield, though. Coca-Cola has paid dividends like clockwork for decades and has raised its payment every year for the past 61 years. And it looks like there's no end in sight for these increases."", ""These aren't pittance improvements, either. The dividend is about twice as big as it was in 2015, and four times what it was 15 years ago. That growth has easily outpaced inflation during that time."", ""The healthy dividend only matters if it can be sustained, and that's not apt to be a problem for this company. It's been built and then rebuilt to generate cash in all environments."", ""As a consumer, you might see Coca-Cola as a beverage company. It's not exactly the bottling company it appears to be, though, but actually a licensor of brand names and flavors, collecting royalties on the products that bottlers manufacture and then sell through distribution channels."", ""The company's role is largely one of marketing and advertising its products. This translates into less revenue, but ultimately a bigger bottom line because the royalty business has much higher margins than bottling."", ""It's also more consistent and predictable revenue since the bottlers take on most of the risk and burden of rising costs, as we've seen since 2022."", ""And the company is very, very good at marketing -- so good that describing Coca-Cola's advertising efforts as mere marketing doesn't do them justice. The company is also incredible at branding, which is more about making its beverages part of a lifestyle than simply prompting the purchase of some drinks."", ""Consider this: It's been more than 50 years since it first aired, but consumers who were around at the time still remember the I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\xa0jingle written specifically for a series of Coca-Cola television commercials."", ""And the company isn't just its namesake cola. It has a wide array of beverage brands in its lineup, including Fresca, Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks to name a few. While none of them are as big as the Coca-Cola line itself, the company is certainly creating similar success with these other drinks using similar promotional approaches."", ""As a bonus, the company's wide range of products not only gives its salespeople leverage with retailers, but also gives the company something to promote to a wider range of consumers who are increasingly steering away from sugary sodas."", 'Last but not least, consider adding a stake in Coca-Cola soon because the stock is relatively cheap right now.', ""It's priced at more than 20 times its trailing and projected per-share profits, so not every investor will agree with this argument. But the stock is persistently priced at such a valuation, and the market's willing to support this premium because veteran investors know they must pay up for quality. It's well worth it, in fact."", ""Indeed, it may be more than worth it right now. Despite Coca-Cola's continued revenue and earnings growth during this time, the stock is trading right where it was in early 2020 when the pandemic took hold of the world; since then, investors have favored growth stocks over value stocks like Coca-Cola."", ""With the economy changing now, however, the backdrop is evolving in a way that could favor value over growth again for a while.

This has been crucial in boosting the top lines of industry participants.With an increased focus on health and wellness, consumers are seeking beverages that align with their dietary preferences and lifestyles. Notably, consumers have been steering clear of sodas and drinks with a high alcohol content to stay healthy. Players in the beverage industry have responded to this trend by introducing a variety of health-focused options, such as low-sugar, organic and functional drinks. The incorporation of natural ingredients and the reduction of artificial additives have been further contributing to the industry's appeal in a health-conscious market.Consequently, there has been a significant rise in demand for energy drinks, sports drinks, low-or-no-sugar carbonated drink variants, sparkling water, dairy, iced tea, juices and ready-to-drink coffee. Also, tequilas, hard seltzers and ready-to-drink cocktails have been gaining popularity, with the increased preference for drinks with low alcoholic content.In a nutshell, these endeavors and the strong fundamentals place beverage companies well for continued growth in 2024.

The state imposes income tax on income generated by individuals or businesses within their domain. Income tax helps in funding public services, providing goods for citizens, and paying government obligations. Income taxes vary from country to country, where income taxes are inquired by the federal government and state governments. Income taxes are of two types including personal income tax and corporate income tax. Personal income tax applies to an individual’s salary, wage, and other types of income. While, corporate tax is levied on corporations, businesses, partnerships, and the self-employed.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic changed the dynamics of global economies. Many countries adopted temporary changes to their tax systems during the COVID-19 period. Countries including the United States and France have reduced their corporate income tax rates by several percentage points. On the other hand, Colombia has increased its corporate income tax rate. Among the OECD countries, Portugal has improved its corporate tax base, while Belgium’s corporate tax base has been made less competitive. The United States, the United Kingdom, and Chile are discontinuing temporary improvements to their corporate tax bases.', 'The country’s tax code structure is a key factor that determines its economic performance. A well-structured tax code provides an easy gateway for taxpayers to apply tax policies and promote economic development through their taxes. According to the Tax Foundation, marginal tax rates on individual and corporate income have dropped significantly across the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) over the past few decades. Most of the OECD countries generate a large amount of revenue from broad-based taxes such as value-added taxes (VAT) and payroll taxes. Taxes are hard to collect in the countries with highest wealth inequality due to the complex economy and taxation system.', 'Estonia is ranked number one among the OECD countries with the best tax code for a straight tenth year, according to the Tax Foundation’s International Tax Competitiveness Index. Estonia has a 20% tax on both corporate income and individual income, respectively. Latvia has the second most competitive tax system, which has adopted the Estonian system for corporate taxation. Latvia also has an efficient taxing system for labor income. Following Estonia and Latvia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Luxembourg, and Turkey are among the top countries with the most efficient and competitive tax systems. Estonia has a competitive tax score of 100, while Latvia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Luxembourg, and Turkey have competitive tax scores of 88.5, 86.1, 84.7, 81.2, 78.9, and 78.6, respectively.

For more rich U.S. cities, head on over to the 5 Richest U.S. Cities by GDP Per Capita.', 'The United States has been well-renowned as the land of opportunities for decades. The economic prowess and entrepreneurial spirit of the US make it the largest economy in the world. The richest US cities are home to some of the largest multinational corporations in the world. From bustling metropolises to tech hubs, the US cities are economic zones that have paved the way for several industries. These cities have become some of the wealthiest cities not only in the US but in the world. However, the richest US cities are also facing economic crises due to ongoing global economic issues. The high interest rates, increasing inflation, and ongoing geopolitical events in the Middle East are creating much economic uncertainty. On December 22, the United States Institute of Peace reported that the drone and missile attacks by Yemeni Houthis on ships in the Red Sea have disrupted global supply chains. About 12% of global trade passes through the Red Sea, accounting for billions of dollars of goods. Almost 30% of the world’s container shipping is channeled through the Red Sea. The increasing tensions in the region are creating huge supply chain risks, which can lead to increased prices of goods in Europe and the US.\xa0', 'We have highlighted the major global threat which is all driven by Israel’s aggression and bombing against the innocents of Gaza. Now, the new events unfolding in the region can cause another global economic turmoil, potentially impacting the economic outlook for 2024. Despite the risks, economic growth improved to a certain extent in the US in 2023. The increase in manufacturing investment during the third quarter of 2023 has boosted economic growth in the US. The private manufacturing construction investment reached a record-high level, the highest since 1958. On December 25, Business Insider shared the economic developments and outlook for 2024 for the US. The US economy is expected to remain slow in 2024 as leading banks and economists project the GDP growth between 0.5% and 2% for 2024. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) forecasts a conservative growth rate of 0.7%, while the Conference Board estimates growth rate of 0.9%.\xa0', 'According to Goldman Sachs, the US GDP is expected to grow 2.1% on a full-year basis. If this projection comes true it would beat the low consensus expectations. The consumption growth is expected to be just under 2%, with real disposable income growth of almost 3%. The business investment is projected to grow roughly 2% as the surge in manufacturing facility investments driven by CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act subsidies slows down. Residential investment is expected to remain flat as the shortage in the housing sector continues.\xa0', '2023 successfully defied recession fears and by the end of the year, there were a few expectations for a soft landing. However, the potential soft landing wasn’t feasible. According to Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate, there is more hope for a soft landing heading into 2024 compared to 2023, as reported by NBC News. The good thing is that the hard part of the inflation fight now looks over. Goldman Sachs analysts see an average 15% probability of recession over the next 12 months.\xa0', 'The richest cities in the United States always play a key role in the economic development of the country.

Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$811.0m', 'US$1.73b', 'US$2.56b', 'US$2.68b', 'US$3.04b', 'US$3.30b', 'US$3.53b', 'US$3.72b', 'US$3.88b', 'US$4.03b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x8', 'Analyst x11', 'Analyst x7', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ 8.72%', 'Est @ 6.77%', 'Est @ 5.40%', 'Est @ 4.45%', 'Est @ 3.78%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% ', 'US$752', 'US$1.5k', 'US$2.0k', 'US$2.0k', 'US$2.1k', 'US$2.1k', 'US$2.1k', 'US$2.0k', 'US$2.0k', 'US$1.9k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$18b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth.

You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Estée Lauder Companies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.133. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

This article will cover recent industry trends and navigate through the major players in the industry. If you want to skip our analysis, go directly to the 5 Most Expensive Bottled Water Brands in the World.', ""According to a report by Grand View Research, the global bottled water industry reached $326 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow to $509 billion by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.9% over the forecasted period. The consumption of bottled water peaked at 46.5 gallons per capita, with the single-serving size accounting for the highest volume of water bottles sold. Water bottles labeled alkaline, caffeinated, oxygenated, or electrolyte-rich have been among the highest-selling products in the industry. In 2022, still-water sales formed 74.5% of the revenue earned by the bottled water industry. The consistent popularity of still water stems from consumers' preference for safe drinking water amid growing rates of diseases such as typhoid and diarrhea. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)'s Aquafina and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)'s Dasani have successfully become 2 of the top selling water brands in the US by capitalizing on this demand for safe water and producing purified sodium-free water with added minerals."", ""The second most popular bottled water segment is functional water, which is forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 7% by the end of the decade. The increasing popularity of this type of water is also attributed to the consumers' increasing concern for their health and fitness. Functional water, also known as aquaceutical, contains supplements such as minerals, vitamins, proteins, and acids for added nourishment. The introduction of aquaceutical has opened a new avenue for the expansion of the bottled-water industry in the future."", 'Nearly 89% of bottled water in 2022 was sold off-trade in retail outlets such as supermarkets, hypermarkets, and departmental stores. These sales are mainly driven by brand identity and customer loyalty, which largely stems from the quality of water that brands have to offer. While the off-trade distribution dominates the market, the on-trade market segment is expected to experience faster growth in the foreseeable future. On-trade revenue, which is earned by the sale of bottled water in restaurants and bars, will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.1% between 2023 and 2030.', ""Another pertinent classification within the bottled water industry is that of packaging material. Water sold in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) packaging accounted for 80% of the industry's revenue, outweighing aluminum cans and glass bottles. Producers prefer PET because of low production and transport costs, and the resulting low prices make them a consumer favorite."", 'The growth of the bottled water industry is driven by an increasing demand for nutrient-packed water, which is associated with an increasing concern for health and nourishment mainly among professionals determined to inculcate healthy lifestyle choices in their busy schedules. For this reason, the highest consumption of bottled water is recorded in the Asia Pacific region mainly due to an increasing concern for health, hygiene, and wellness in China, India, and Indonesia. The Asia Pacific region contributed 45.1% to the global revenue of the bottled water industry, followed by the North American region which brought in 23.9% of the revenue.\xa0', 'Europe is also forecasted to be a fast-growing market for bottled water in the future.

The dividend yield will be 2.8% based on this payment which is still above the industry average."", ""While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Investors will be pleased to see that Gap's stock price has increased by 108% in the last 3 months, which is good for shareholders and can also explain a decrease in the dividend yield."", ' See our latest analysis for Gap ', ""Impressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Based on the last payment, Gap's profits didn't cover the dividend, but the company was generating enough cash instead. Healthy cash flows are always a positive sign, especially when they quite easily cover the dividend."", 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continue, we could see the payout ratio reaching 33% which is fairly sustainable.', ""The company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. There hasn't been much of a change in the dividend over the last 10 years. The dividend has seen some fluctuations in the past, so even though the dividend was raised this year, we should remember that it has been cut in the past."", ""Given that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. Over the past five years, it looks as though Gap's EPS has declined at around 45% a year. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built."", ""In summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Gap's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. The payments haven't been particularly stable and we don't see huge growth potential, but with the dividend well covered by cash flows it could prove to be reliable over the short term. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income."", ""Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For instance, we've picked out 2 warning signs for Gap that investors should take into consideration. If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our curated list of high yield dividend stocks."", 'Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?
